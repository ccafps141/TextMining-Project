0,20 December 2021,kevin_robbins,10, You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film.,Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an underground high end burglary team looking for one big last mission and a parallel story about a successful police officer who is struggling at home. As the buildup to the big heist unfolds the two worlds come closer and closer together until the ultimate collision happens.,/
1,23 April 2011,planktonrules,9, Exceptionally well done though it's not the sort of film for everyone...but what movie is?,"I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like ""Heat"". However, on a lark and because it's apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.",r
2,9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Brilliant,"This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film's atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",e
3,15 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10, One Of The Best Crime Films Ever,"I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!",v
4,1 October 2021,concrndone,10, Is better now I'm middle aged,Wow. First saw this in the cinema back in 1996 and of course we all raved over how good it was but I don't think we really appreciated it back then or could have as twenty somethings.,i
5,17 August 2021,lareval,10, Michael Mann's finest work,"A brilliant character driven action thriller with drama and emotion all the way. Despite the long runtime, the pacing never drags. The Magic of this action movie is that you believe the people you see in the screen. You care for them and everything they go through. All of the scenes are influential, the script and the score are iconic. Two thumbs up!",e

Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters.

8,4 November 2008,bkoganbing,9, The Summit,"One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. ",r
9,23 June 2000,aboriginee,10, The best character film of all time.,"Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.",w
10,30 November 2004,LeightWinst,10, Masterful on all counts,For some reason I cannot stop thinking about this film lately.,6
11,15 September 2003,Theo Robertson,7, Good But Overlong,"The thing to strike me about HEAT is that it`s overlong . I don`t know if I`ve been watching too much MTV but a major problem I`ve had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they`re too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we`d have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson  by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they`re shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It`s a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There`s another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital/romantic life of every major character , cop and robber . I know Michael Mann`s later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but that`s necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is not ",1
12,17 February 2000,jamie-109,10," Heat is truly epic, absolutely breathtaking","One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.",9
13,2 November 2006,kosmasp,10, More than De Niro and Pacino,"What can you say about this movie, that hasn't been said before? Not much, but I state my opinion nonetheless :o).",4
14,25 April 2020,Jouford,6, I obviously don't get it ...,"Let me start by saying that Heat isn't a terrible movie. In fact, it's not a bad movie at all. I just think that it's incredibly overrated.
I'm not a huge fan of Michael Mann's work in general. I find his films to be no more than very long music videos. His movies seem to epitomise style over substance to me, and Heat is no different.
DeNiro and Pacino chew through the scenes like they normally do. That's a given. The rest of the cast are as competent and watchable, but the film doesn't feel deep enough for me. Though judging by the way everyone else is rating it, I must be missing something, even after watching it three times.
I'm sorry that I don't like this film. It's got all the right ingredients to be special, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's undercooked.",9
15,17 January 2005,eddieknocker,10, One of the best films of the 90's,"I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you. Its a crime thriller. Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best ""shoot-out"" in any film - ever. What more do you want???",8
16,12 June 2022,searchanddestroy-1,10, Is it possible to put more than ten stars?,"Al Pacino is definitely attached to the greatest crime gangster movies in film history: THE GODFATHER trilogy, SCARFACE, CARLITO'S WAY. And so Bob De Niro too: THE GODFATHER 2, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, THE GOOD FELLAS, CASINO. To summarize, because of the presence of these two giants, this movie which I talk now is also to be put on the list, and maybe on the top of it. For me it is the best cop gangster - armed robbers - scheme ever made, and a model, a reference for ant real gangster in the US and Europe. This movie is simply perfect, flawless, tense, taut, gripping, outstanding; unless to hate this kind of movie - and you have the right to - it's impossible to ignore it, this would be an heresy. Acting, directing, editing, everything is purely chiseled like a jewel, a diamond. We could see this as a kind of US remake of Jean Pierre Melville's LE DEUXIEME SOUFFLE where De Niro would have Lino Ventura's role, and Pacino Paul Meurisse's one.",0
17,5 August 2021,jdring2007,9, a masterpiece crime drama/action hybrid with memorable performances,"I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for the drawn out ""climax"" and the whole tangent between De Niro and his woman. I understand the necessity of that element, but his character is so indifferent throughout that it lost me completely. That said, about his character, I get it; he isn't supposed to be flamboyant, he's rigid and unforgiving, he lives by a strict creed, and De Niro nails it flawlessly. He just isn't nearly my favorite character. And there's so many to pick from! Heat offers you a slew of people to latch onto, emotionally and empathetically, or even apathetically. Every character showcases his own qualities and flaws, making even the bad guys likable in some cases, but when it comes right down to it they are, clear as day, the bad guys. And all the actors and actresses put on stellar performances. Al Pacino especially; Val Kilmer was a favorite for me, and even Waingro, as despicable a man as he was in the movie, depicted so memorably by Kevin Gage. Even Danny Trejo, who is such a small role, has. Subtle yet powerful performance in the third act. And then there's the action. While the movie is undeniably long, it isn't boring, with the exception of my aforementioned gripe with De Niro's romantic tangent. Aside from that, even when guns aren't blazing (every gunfight is raw and gritty and intensely filmed), there is action to be had. The script is ingenious and cinematography immersive. Have seen multiple times and will watch again in the future.",/

21,3 January 2000,stickman-6,10, Heat is a masterpiece,"In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today.  ""Heat"" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering ""who could be so lucky to work with them?"". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) ""Heat"" grabs you and pulls you in.  This is a true film masterpiece.",f

30,22 April 2005,210west,6," In the end, pretty underwhelming","HEAT has, of course, a terrific cast, but this sprawling, rambling, overlong, ultimately anticlimactic film is marred throughout by one of the more irritating clichés of cop dramas: the boring domestic scene in which the wife (or girlfriend) of the cop (or criminal) complains about how unfulfilled she is, the uncertainty of their relationship, how little she sees him, blah blah blah. In this one, it's hard-faced Diane Venora whining about how cop Al Pacino isn't THERE for her and her daughter (Natalie Portman), how she gets only part of his life, etc. Haven't we suffered through this boring situation in a hundred cop pictures? Then there are the uninteresting marital problems criminal Val Kilmer is having with Ashley Judd; who cares? Finally, there's the loony, preposterous, extraneous, wholly unbelievable relationship Robert De Niro has with Amy Brenneman, who plays a lovestruck artist/shopgirl who takes one look at De Niro, begins flirting with him, and is soon taking him to bed. Yeah, right: Here's a beautiful, glamorous-looking young woman who throws herself at a middle-aged, mean-and-careworn-and-greasy-looking guy who initially pretends to be a salesman and carries on a halting conversation worthy of a dullard. The relationship has no bearing on the plot that I could see; it's just an impediment and an annoyance. Thank God for the fast-forward on my remote.",
31,3 August 2021,wrdunn-88991,10, A film that took me several enjoyable viewings to understand.,"Heat on paper is a standard cops and robbers tale. Bad guys do what they do and cops do what they gotta do. The thing that took me so long to realise was this story isn't about robberies or cops chasing down bad guys. It's about a guy who thinks he's a methodical being when in actuality he makes more mistakes than he would ever admit. This film is enjoyed both ways, you can delve into the deep physcological meaning or you can enjoy some fantastic action. This is my all time favourite movie. I recommend it to everyone I talk movies with.",
32,13 January 1999,Peres-2,10, Pacino and De Niro together... simply great !,"Most of the comments I've read here agree that this is a great movie. I have the same opinion. The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro's character (Neil). His personal conflicts are as strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of this film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally.

38,21 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Pacino and DeNiro, together at last","More than simply a cops-and-robbers story, ""Heat"" allows us to understand the characters more than the average crime story. In the first place, Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) are good friends before they realize that they have to be enemies. And even when it becomes clear to them that they're on opposite sides of the law, the viewer still can sympathize with both men: we understand that McCauley doesn't want to be a criminal but has no choice, and we understand that Hanna finds law enforcement unpleasant but is trapped in his position. Never going overboard on violence or degenerating into silliness, ""Heat"" is a modern classic and a triumph for all involved. It was, in my opinion, director Michael Mann's best movie ever, and a very interesting look at Los Angeles. This is one movie that won't disappoint you.",

Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.",
42,21 August 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, The best at several things,"This is undoubtedly Mann's finest, and I'm not sure even he, himself, can really top it. If you ever wanted to know about crime in L.A., this is what to watch. The plot is excellent, and consistently told well, so that the audience never loses track, and in spite of great complexity, it manages to not be difficult to follow. Every single performance in this is spot-on and effective, from the two acting veteran leads through the young and always talented Portman, and to the smallest, briefest role. The characters are all fleshed out, credible and interesting. This doesn't take sides. It gives insight into the private lives of people on both sides of the law, those who uphold it as well as those who break it. Not everyone is in a positive light, but no one is unfairly treated by the presentation of that type of person, and the word ""one-note"" is simply not part of Michael's vocabulary when he penned the marvelous script. The emotion is genuine, and this is immensely involving and engaging from first to last frame. This is long, however, which hopefully will not deter any possible viewers. It's around three hours long, give or take twenty minutes, depending on the version. There is a little humor, at least worth chuckles, and it isn't trying to leave you in stitches. The dialog is sharp and impeccably delivered, often saying a lot with few lines. This has concise social commentary. It also has magnificent suspense and tension. Production values leave nothing to be desired. The action is among the most unforgettable committed to celluloid since its invention. Realism is sky-high, with next to no Hollywood(in fact, in all aspects of this), and I kid you not, when those guns go off, you can *feel* it. Nothing fancy, no stylization. Instead, every shot comes off as having an impact, as being dangerous. People actually reload, accuracy is an issue and the firearms can't magically handle whatever situation they're used in. Pretty much any moment of this that has bullets flying is epic. The ending is amazing, if I do argue with the very last bit. Hey, MM and finales... anyway, it doesn't bother me enough to lower my rating any. There is a lot of strong language, and some bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of drama who can stomach it. 10/10",

However, I did manage to stay awake for a almost three hour epic that blew my mind away and saw a different way to look at the cinema.  Before this film, the director Michael Mann, has shown the life of crime in THIEF, terror in THE KEEP, suspense in MANHUNTER, and a historical epic with LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  But Mann's film were going on a upswing, and with HEAT, Mann reached peak level. This is a film that will go down in history.  Granted, it's not as much as a classic as SCHINDLER'S LIST and GOODFELLAS.  But HEAT will give future generations a example of what the world and life style was like in the 1990's.

58,8 September 1998,Rid.X,10, A Powerhouse Crime Saga,"""Heat"" is one of the best crime films to come out of this decade. Michael Mann has crafted the perfect companion-piece to his haunting 1981 drama, ""Thief"". Mann's technical trademarks are present: the haunting, ambient score, and the industrial set design and exteriors add to the film's moody resonance and give Los Angeles a whole other dimension. The acting, writing, and direction is the key, however, and Mann has crafted insightful dialogue, and gotten stellar performances from all involved. It helps that the hunter and his prey and played by two heavy-hitting forces of nature -- Pacino and De Niro. They have a classic moment in a coffeehouse (the first on-screen pairing of the two method men), during which the viewer is left mesmerized as the two men unload the weight of the would in breathless, crisp dialogue. The shoot-out is one of the most cataclysmic, fantastically-choreographed scenes of action in one film; it's the kind of ballistic ballet that only John Woo seems capable of. All the negative reviews of the film gripe (understandably) about the length (or overlength). I didn't care much about the length; this an intensely dramatic crime saga with a depth that is hardly seen in American films of this genre. In short, this is one not to be missed.",

It has been rare throughout cinematic history to get action film that emphasizes the substance as much as pure style.

You just want to Robert DeNiro's Neil get away as much as you want Al Pacino's Vincent to catch him. And what a fantastic group of actors both leads got on their side. It is simply pleasuring to watch such a rich supporting cast. Everything in 'Heat' is in epic proportions, and so is the length of the movie, but it is so masterfully paced that you almost don't notice how three hours are passing.

77,2 October 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6, Fulfills the premise mostly,"""Heat"" is an American 3-hour(!) film from 1995, so this one had its 20th anniversary 2 years ago. It is perhaps the most known career effort by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Michael Mann, even if this one here did not receive any Academy Award noms, seemingly even did not win a single award despite of how big of a project it was. The latter is proved by the inclusion of lead actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino here, the probably finest Italian-Americans Hollywood has to offer and one thinks immediately of the Godfather sequel of course when mentioning these names. In that film, however, they did not have any scenes together as the action is set for each of them during different era. But back to this one here: So the premise here really was gigantic as you could expect a big conflict/rivalry perhaps between these two actors as they play characters on the opposite side of the law. However, here they also have almost no screen time together. The big exception is of course their table talk which turns out to be a bit of a (non-violent) trap for Pacino's character. So pay attention to how the two are constantly watching each other and each other's actions (for example during the scene with the cops down there and Bobby's character watching from above and Pacino's realizes), but are almost never together on the screen. With the big long bank robbery sequence all that follows afterwards, they kinda are, but the big meeting follows at the very end then when it is really just the two of them again. It feels like each of them has their own film in this one here dealing with their messed-up private lives and complicated professional lives at the same time. This area is key and luckily was elaborate on good enough for the film to not drag too much, especially for such a long film. Still it was not 100% smooth either I would say.",

In ""Heat"", he performs the reverse trick, and in a story of a brutal mass murderer and a policeman, tries to assert the moral that they're really both the same.  It doesn't convince in this convoluted, but essentially shallow film, in which even deNiro and Pacino fail to do much more than fill out familiar outlines; the fault in part lying in the degree of respect that Mann accords both stars. Neither wholly realistic nor truly slick; ""Heat"" holds the attention but little more, nothing really sparks except for a ludicrously over-the-top gun battle of which Peckinpah might have been proud.

I loved it at the time, with a caveat - that there was something about the way the female characters were presented that unsettled me. With learning accrued in the intervening years, I can flesh that out a little - the females all speak truth to or about me, or reveal it to them. The truth is almost always about the men themselves. All of this means that the women end up paying the cost and bearing the brunt of the men's actions, men whose response to the truth is to ignore, to double-down, kick back at it. That may be realistic - this is a very (toxic) male trait, and it leaves us with the question of if Mann does this consciously or if it's his own fault, too. Viewed in the context of his other work, it's hard to feel it's not a fault - most female characters in Mann's films have little or no agency for themselves, existing only for or in relation to men. For a filmmaker of such insight and brilliance, it's a striking fault. Otherwise, Heat is brilliant - just think, though, how shining that brilliance could be if the women were allowed agency.",

90,19 December 2009,Ziya90,10, The film of the bests,"Heat is one of the best movies of all time and Michael Mann's best movie to me. Also one of the best crime thrillers with the best bank robbery sequence. This is a film that Al Pacino is in the cast. He is not a supporter actor. His character is also suits him a lot. And there is Robert De Niro too. He is not a supporter actor like Pacino. And this movie is three hours. However, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are not father-in-laws and Heat is not a comedy. Pacino plays a cop and De Niro plays a thief. Pacino says I will catch you and De Niro says, do it if you can. While reading the cast for the first time, I said this is enough, OK. but it continued. One more very good (and to me very liked) actor or actress and one more and one more. This is a crime, action movie, but a deep one, not a shallow work at all. Heat shows almost every character's personal lives, working lives and problems, but even one scene is not uninteresting. Some scenes are so still, but I like it. Stylish. To me Heat is the most stylish Michael Mann movie with The Insider. I like the movies which show us the city or show us the places that Scorsese never does. There are almost two action scenes, one of them is very short, but very exciting. The other is one of the longest and realistic clashes of all times, probably the most loudest action scene, too. You have a headache, this is inevitable and the gun sounds ring inside your brain, your ears ring. However, I don't care about it so much. I love watching Al Pacino while he runs, Mann turns the music down. It must deserve to be put in the action cinema anthology. Almost all the people saw the film talk about the scene which Pacino and De Niro talk face to face, as you know, Heat is the first film that De Niro and Pacino were in the same scene. Honestly, I am not interested in it so much, I mean I don't love Heat so that there is this scene, it is a historical moment in cinema may be, but cut this scene, the film is still excellent. A very powerful and stylish crime epic.",

It is too long, too slow, too stilted, too dull. I have virtually nothing positive to say about it, which is surprising considering the good cast and crew.

92,29 November 2006,jeremy3,10, I loved this film,"Imagine a film with De Niro and Pacino on the same frame. There hasn't been one. In Godfather II, De Niro was the ""flashback"" Don, and Pacino played the ""present time"" son of the Don. I was not disappointed by the pairing of these two titans. Pairing together two titan actors is a big risk. Their egos could get in the way. This was not the case in this intelligent and exciting thriller. De Niro plays a criminal, and Pacino plays a cop. Although, on opposite sides, both characters are very similar. They both are excellent at their jobs, and they both have ruined their lives by being obsessed with their respective careers. This is the point of this film. In the end, both characters are tragic - De Niro for being trapped in his role, and Pacino for ruining his personal life in a lifetime pursuit of justice. The interaction between the characters is brilliant. There was also a tribute scene to Bullet (the McQueen film), where a chase goes through an airport. Val Kilmer also is very convincing as an apprentice criminal. De Niro's character feels an obligation to help out Kilmer's character, but also reminds him constantly that 'you have to walk away from anyone and anything within 30 seconds to get the heat off your trail'. This is a brutal reminder of how hard a life it is to be a career criminal.",
93,25 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,5, Mediocre,"The film, much hyped for the first on screen meeting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, opens with an only in Hollywood heist of an armored bank truck. The newest member of the gang- Waingro (Kevin Gage)- panics, which results in the murder of the 3 guards. De Niro's character, Neil McCauley, the gang's leader, attempts to kill the screw up, but he escapes. Meanwhile, Vincent Hanna (Pacino), LAPD homicide expert, takes over the case. Needless digressions include Hanna's failing marriage with his faithless wife Justine (Diane Venora) & suicidal stepdaughter (Natalie Portman), Waingroe's revelation as a serial killer of prostitutes, McCauley's contrived and sparkless romance with a lonely bookworm 25 years his junior, Eady (Amy Brenneman), & the backstory of the newest member of the gang. If the long and superfluous digressions are not bad enough, the implausible action scenes & character interactions are worse- this is an absolutely abominable screenplay, folks. Here are just some of the implausibilities: after figuring out that McCauley's thieves have turned the tables on him Hanna stops McCauley, who absurdly agrees to a cup of joe with him. This is the big 'Clash of Titans' the film hypes, but is as realistic as John Ashcroft breaking bread with Osama bin Laden. Instead, we get insipid dick on the table banter as Hanna warns McCauley he just might have to 'take him out'. McCauley counters, 'Oh yeah? I just might have to take you out.' It would have been a hoot had McCauley replied, 'You talking' to me?', but no such luck. In short, Heat is a mediocre movie at best- its visual style accounting for whatever props it deserves. It was only 2 years later that the brilliant L.A. Confidential came along & showed America what a truly great crime film could be. As for the DVD itself? It's no-frills- there's no commentary, 3 trailers, but the actual transfer of the film print is very clean, as is the sound quality. Curiously, the DVD package seems to recapitulate the making of the film: great attention paid to the shine, but a fairly hollow core.",
94,17 March 2005,Rayderback,10," I think I'm the only one, but this is the best film I've ever seen,","There is so much more to Heat than whats on its surface. It is so well directed, acted,written, scored and photographed that it takes mulitple viewings to take it all in. This is the best crime movie ever made. And, since my first viewing over 5 years ago, I have seen it a countless number of times. After all of these viewings I can only say that this is my favorite film to watch and therefore the best film I have ever seen. I will not divulge into plot because the expanse and depth of the films story, I could not do justice with a shorthand overview of its plot. This film is not about its plot, it is about its characters and what they feel. Michael Mann is my favorite filmmaker, his list of credits, admittedly, doesn't strike many people as the resume of the greatest living director, but when you watch those films you can see the gift this man possesses at telling a story and making us feel for his characters. There are three scenes in this movie that had me so drawn in, I still think about them often. One is the films first scene, Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing electronic score captivates us in the first shots of the train carrying Neal McCauley (Robert DeNiro)and leave me, and the audience wanting more. The third comes toward the end as McCauley and his boss Nate (a wonderful Jon Voigt) exchange their last words as Neal is planning on leaving the country the words the choose and attitudes they strike almost had me in tears. These are two hard men and this is far as they will go with their heartfelt goodbyes. The films last scene I will not give a description to as not to ruin the plot for you. I contains the best (almost) wordless exchange I've ever seen in a film. The music swells and Mann allows us to linger on the last shot. It brought me to tears, and still does.

95,10 April 2009,pc95,10, Michael Mann's Best; One of 90's best,"My gusher of a review - Epic in length and equally good, Heat is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. It has everything a movie-following man (and woman if you like violent cops and robbers)could want in a superbly finished and edited package. Yes, everything is outstanding in this movie - the drama, the story, and most especially the cinematography and acting. Leading the way is Al Pacino's performance whose bravado is 2nd to none - he is full of intense energy and wit. Robert De Niro is not far behind, chameleon-like, patient, and thoughtfully calculating. All supporting cast from small roles to lead support are interesting and dynamic. The script is concise and simple; likewise the dialog - very well written and believable. The action is graphic though not gratuitous. It's well placed and enhancing. Best support comes from Kevin Gage as Waingrove and Jon Voight as Nate - both understated and sharply well acted and additionally Mykelti Williamson who injects some stern realism to Pacino's emotional explosiveness. Running over 2 and half hours, you'd hardly notice as engrossing as this gem is. There are scant few scenes that the movie would benefit from being cut, and the music gives a great shading and undertone to the LA lights and settings. A defining movie for the 90s, and a superior effort for the crime drama genre in cinema, Heat stands out glowingly. Highly recommended.",

131,11 February 2000,Colonel Ted,4," An average thriller, overrated by the presence of De Nero and Pacino","A lot of people have made a lot of fuss over Heat. After seeing it for myself I really can't understand why. Aside from the presence of the two leads Heat is essentially a cops n' robbers saga given a little extra dimension and a lot of extra gloss. I can't fault Michael Mann's style. His stark vision of Los Angeles is excellent. The opening shot with the elevated train coasting past the camera with the haunting synth score is truly memorable. However, when the first shot of a film is the best part, you're in trouble. Mann as writer fairs much worse. His script (actually based on his 1989 TV movie LA Takedown) is a mess; padded his unnecessary subplots and characters; it substitutes intrigue for confused plotting. The near 3-hour running time is sheer self-indulgence, when the concept behind this film is complete mouse of idea: that cops and robbers are very much alike. In reality this so-called character development that Mann has put at the front of his film is just a story of male bonding between two highly unlikeable and unsympathetic characters. Pacino as the cop and De Nero as the robber are both well-worn clichés that are slightly deeper than normal. Pacino as an angst ridden cop, on his third marriage and De Nero as the calculating psycho criminal who plans his life so that he can drop everything and leave at 30 seconds notice when the heat is on. Both these characters are as unlikeable as the other is and this blunts much of the tension. A brilliantly staged gun battle on the streets of LA is wasted because we don't care which character comes off the better. The two leads don't do anything for their roles either. Neither gives performances that equal their best and the film's main purpose is simply to bring them on screen together. They appear twice together. Once in a coffee shop to discuss their morals and at the film's ending, which more than resembles that of Bullit. Clearly Mann has attempted to say that police and criminal are indivisible, and this is probably why we don't sympathise with either of them. This is such an unoriginal concept that has been explored as far back as the 70s with The French Connection and Serpico it also is the reason why, the film is overrated. Why should we spend 3 hours with two people we don't like?",

The film dates poorly; specifically, with Pacino screaming out supposedly clever lines that were probably witty for 1995, but nowadays is just seen as a cheap cry for attention. But even for 1995 standards, the film is incredibly overrated, what with your typical over-sappy and unnecessary Michael Mann unsexy love scene, or the ridiculous time spent (or wasted) developing overly-complex characters only to give them a rushed send-off. The tech aspect and the amazing band heist sequence (one of cinema's best) are both worth a look, but other than that, you're wasting your time.",
134,15 April 2008,Robert_duder,8, Heat is exactly what it says...a crime saga...not your average action crime flick,"In many ways Michael Mann is the type of director who really does have his own style and flare. I can't honestly say I'm necessarily a fan but I think he really does try to make the audience feel his story, and bring them into it and then on top of that makes it a snazzy artistic film that people can look at and say ""Yep that's Michael Mann."" I hold a certain disdain for him since I paid and sat through the utter garbage that was Miami Vice but you couldn't deny he tried to make it feel real and sharp and gritty and Heat is the same way. He called it a 'crime saga' and there is no doubt that Heat packs a punch but is it for the right reasons? The film clocks in at nearly three hours which as much as I appreciate a good long film, it's far too long for this type of movie. There is plenty that could have been cut out to make the film move a little better but again Mann wants it a certain way. The film chronicles every detail of both sides of this fight...the criminal side and this little family of crooks and then the police unit trying to stop and catch them and then it goes into the details about the personal lives of the two leaders to (I believe) show us that the two men aren't different at all.",

But De Niro is a lot smarter then he thinks being on the other side of this crime chase. He plays his character perfect with the full emotion needed to have a great story-line and a great character in this well made crime drama. Two great actors clash in a crazy story of good vs. evil. It is a perfect picture of the 90s. This movie is De Niro at his best along with Pacino actually playing a good guy. I give this movie a 10 out of 10,
136,10 June 2007,thinker1691,10, There Is A Flip Side To That,"Throughout ones cinematic life, a fan comes to understand the essential ingredients of every movie. When it comes to crime dramas, it becomes standard for the good guys to win over the bad guys. However, after a lifetime of watching the same scenarios, and knowing full well the good guys don't always win in real life, sophisticate audiences then expect reality to be part of the movie. Few authority figures want to change the 'good always triumphs' myth, but modern audiences demand more 'authentic' crime dramas and thus a few courageous directors will give the audience what it demands. The best among them is Michael Mann. The movie ""HEAT"" has earned him more acclaim than any movie to date for realistic films. Anyone who views Heat, will see real life drama in action. Watching the film one realizes more than Mann's superior direction went into the creation of this unique story. The sheer star power added to the magical combination. Here we have Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) a veteran no nonsense detective who goes after only the best crime 'Crews' and will not stop until they are put down. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a master career criminal who rarely makes mistakes in his craft. Val Kilmer plays Chris Shiherlis a professional who is willing to put everything on the line for his woman and the Big Score. Jon Voight is superb as De Niro's mysterious fence and skilled consultant. The Big heist is upon them and De Niro's hand picked crew is going for 70 million. Al Pacino's special elite police squad will be there to try and stop them and to bring their crime spree to a end. Expect Micahel Mann to allow the experienced criminals to take on the well armed police with military weapons and precision teamwork in one of the bloodiest, explosive most exciting running gun battles ever created. This movie is a must for anyone who's tired of the bad guys losing all the time. *****",

It tries hard to produce a stage for De Niro vs Pacino, the evilly motivated but likable scum vs the very flawed but ultimately good guy, and of course they meet before the climactic ending and share and manifest a mutual respect for each other, how of course they are not so different in the end, that old chorus... but although, again, this film makes for a somewhat entertaining viewing, even despite the very lengthy runtime, it's too much a caricature of what it sets out to do with very little intelligence in subtlety, originality or reinvention at all. The women/family of the protagonists are just filler to add more matter to the plot and runtime, and although they highlight aspects of the main lead characters' personalities they are just as ordinary as them, and the entire film.

It is also the first time Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starred opposite one another.

153,29 October 2015,Seraphion,7, A nicely stretched but complete story,"At first seeing the almost three hour duration, I thought this movie would take it all up to mostly unnecessary scenes. Yet the story nicely fills all the void that I now understand why Michael Mann took that long for this movie. All the characters, the many of the significant ones, get enough coverage that none of them feels like just a cardboard cut-out. All the interactions feel natural and the criminal craft looks pretty much true to reality. The action looks great; it gets very much suspenseful and also went to a grandiose level few movies nowadays would go to. One thing made the action scenes seem stupid is the perception of how many bullets can an assault rifle carry. With the rate of how the robbers shoot their rifles in full-auto mode, they should be changing magazines more often. The acting is a great job in overall. both Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro did remarkably stunning work, and their face off scenes are the best of this movie. Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo and Tom Sizemore did great also in filling for the story angles.",

156,21 June 2021,Easygoer10,9, Terrific Film,"(June 21, 2021). I saw ""Heat"" when it was released (1995) in a packed theater in Times Square, NYC. One of my favorite parts is the sound of the post-bank robbery shootout. This is absolutely stunning (and should've been awarded an Oscar). Much has been made of the robber's tactical movements. As terrific as these are, there is a better example in Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987): The Steadicam shots of the squad advancing into the (bombed out) city of Hue is a supreme example of a ""how to"". I would lay odds Mann was inspired by this techinque. My only negative criticism is during the much referenced scene of McCauley and Hanna having coffee in the diner. If you watch closely, you can see Pacino break character by cracking a small smile (in the wrong place). Please note: As mentioned in the director commentary, this scene was not rehearsed. Regardless, ""Heat' is a superb film I have seen many times.",

162,31 December 2000,jhclues,10," Mann Delivers Real ""Heat""","Two men, each a consummate professional in his respective field-- but on opposite sides of the law-- become adversaries in a high-stakes cat and mouse game from which only one can emerge victorious, in the action/drama `Heat,' directed by Michael Mann and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a professional criminal who makes his living by `Taking down scores;' it's all he knows, and what he does best.  Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a Detective with the L.A.P.D. whose main reason for `being' is to stop guys like McCauley from doing what they do best.  It's what `he' does best.  And when circumstances put them together on the same playing field, it becomes a battle of wits and tenacity, a matter of who will outwit whom and when; for each man is adamant in intent, and it becomes clear early on that neither will ever acquiesce, withdraw or concede the game to his opponent.  McCauley lives by a code that allows him to walk away if he knows the heat is around the corner, but only to another space on the same board; and Hanna owns the board.  What follows is an intense study in the dynamics of uncompromising conviction; and the tension begins with the opening sequence and continues to build throughout the film, right up to the very end. 	In McCauley, De Niro has created a character that is more than just a bit disconcerting; a hardened criminal, ready to kill-- indiscriminately-- at the drop of a hat, anyone who gets in his way, but with an outward appearance that belies his true nature.  This guy is anybody's next door neighbor; the software salesman or the manager of the local A&P who would blend in with the crowd anywhere because he is so nondescript.  A man whose life is a ruse, hiding his psychotic, sociopathic instincts behind a facade of normalcy.  And De Niro plays him with such integrity that it makes him one of the more terrifying characters he's ever brought to the screen, not because of what he seems to be, but because of what you know he is capable of.  His portrayal of Max Cady in `Cape Fear' was, by comparison, the outward expression of what McCauley is underneath, and which he conceals so well; With Cady at least you could discern the evil of the man just by looking at him-- a man the likes of which you would cross the street to avoid if you saw him coming.  McCauley is the one you would invite in, never suspecting the truth.  And that is what makes him such a powerful character. 		Pacino's Hanna, on the other hand, is the exact opposite.  He's boisterous, loud, and in all ways larger than life; he swaggers and intimidates.  And why?  Because it gets results. The manner he affects gives him the presence he needs to ferret out the criminal element and to keep them in line; if someone chooses to play in his court, they're going to know he's there, and he's not going to let them forget it.  It's his turf, his rules, end of story.  It's a purposefully over-the-top performance, because that's who Hanna is, or at least that's the face he puts on for the job. Underneath he's just a man looking for a little peace in his life, a part of his own personal puzzle that has so far eluded him, in no small part due to the dedication he brings to his work.  The necessity of dealing with reality at the level he must day in and day out is simply not conducive with the ability to leave the job at the door when the shift is over.  For a man like Hanna, the shift is never over.  And the fact that McCauley-- at the other end of the spectrum-- is made of the same cloth, is what gives this film such explosive intensity. 	The exemplary supporting cast includes Val Kilmer (Chris), Jon Voight (Nate), Tom Sizemore (Michael), Diane Venora (Justine Hanna), Amy Brenneman (Eady), Ashley Judd (Charlene), Natalie Portman (Lauren), Hank Azaria (Alan) and Kevin Gage (Waingro).  `Heat' is a hard-hitting, memorable film, impeccably directed and delivered by Mann; an entertaining and action-packed character study with an adrenaline rush that never lets you off the hook for a moment.  And how great to see De Niro and Pacino together; that alone is worth the price of admission.  If you're ready for some excitement, check this one out; it'll take you to the edge and keep you there, and by the time it's over you'll be ready for more of the same-- and that is what movies are all about.  That is the magic.  I rate this one 10/10.",

164,22 November 2022,VikingBurialService,8," Good, Especially the Bank Scene","A good crime movie, but not a great one for me. Basically, a team of robbers commits two big heists, while trying to avoid an agent played by Al Pacino. The pacing is a little weird, with the biggest stakes scenes (the truck robbery and the bank robbery) coming at the very beginning and middle. There's a lot of relationship/love-story drama that I think is overplayed for a movie about criminals. Additionally, both the criminals and the FBI agents are so deeply flawed that they're not likable, at least not compared to other crime movies. However, the acting is one-point, even from the non-Deniro/Pacino actors. The bank robbery and shootout is influential for a reason; it's one of the best action sequences I've ever seen, period. Overall it's a cool movie to throw on in the background, but not one I'll return to over and over.",

Al Pacino is incredible in his role, as he goes through various stages and moods that are followed by great emotions and some amazing scenes.

In fact, it's one of the best, most realistic portrayals of criminal life since GOODFELLAS. Eschewing all-out action in favour of plot development, this is a film which really makes you care about the characters - even if they are all criminals, and murderers at that.

191,22 January 2016,staven600,10," Terrific, classic","I used to love this film for the action sequences and that beautiful blue-tinted cinematography, Los Angeles looking as clear and smooth as the ocean Neil looks out on in reflection. De Niro and Pacino fully inhabit characters that are two sides of a coin, Neil (De Niro) an introverted loner and a professional thief in charge of a crew, and Vincent (Pacino) a disillusioned cop who finds a connection with Neil, who he likes and considers a star, reflecting his own professional, no- nonsense approach, a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dreary career in which he must expose himself to all kinds of horror and sickness which he goes into great detail describing in order to stop his partner from complaining about relationship problems. Pacino has some of the best and funniest line in the whole film. It was a stroke of brilliance to have both De Niro and Pacino play characters perfectly suited for them. Pacino is often accused of hamming it up, and although he does chew scenery in this film, that's the character he plays and I always found him a very subtle actor whose expressions speak volumes. De Niro of course is brilliant, that goes without say, and plays a likable crook who has found his niche on the other side of the law and does what he does best. Any attachments they have don't seem to work, and the only real bond they find is with each other through their mutual cat-and-mouse interest in one another. The film isn't just about those two characters though, and while it is a crime film, that's just a foundation for a sprawling, meticulously detailed yet effortless, interwoven narrative involving many people. The way it all comes together as the film progresses feels almost cosmic. Waingro (Kevin Kage) is sort of a spanner in the works throughout the film, a sort of devil of chaos with no awareness of what he's doing (?) who shoots cops in the opening heist and gets Vincent involved in the case and on the trail of Neil. He vanishes almost supernaturally when Neil tried to kill him and pops up in multiple uncanny ways to botch things up for his old crew and his new employer Van Sant (William Fichtner). He even manages to bring Neil and Vincent together in the end by being the chief motivator for Neil's detour from his escape to a new haven after the disastrous heist. Neil kills Waingro in a sort of cathartic cleansing, before being hunted down by Vincent and shot in the final hunt. They both kind of save each other in the end and it turns out the way Neil wanted it. It was his wish all along to die at the hands of this cop who knows him as well as he does, and it gives him a sort of release for the afterlife. I guess that makes Vincent, his hunter, his Shepherd. It's a moving ending to a great film, and the final scenes of Vincent holding Neil by the hand in his last moments as they stand in the night against the airport lights, the plane to a life Neil was never allowed departed and his downfall as it illuminates his shadow giving Vincent his cue to take Neil down, are all just perfect. It all feels very fatalistic in a profound way. The film is a great noir because it's all about purpose and the search for it. The supporting cast is also great, after all it's an ensemble film and there's a whole host of interesting, well played characters I haven't even mentioned because I can't be bothered now.",

Simply a vehicle for two fine performances","I find ""Heat"" to be a very overrated film and my main point of contention with it is its self-indulgent runtime. It does not need to be three hours long. I've no problem sitting through a three or four film, but not when it is something like Michael Mann's 1995 heist-caper. There are many dragged out scenes incorporated into the film, along with a storyline that tries to be a lot more than it is, inevitably leading one to check their watch and how much is left in the movie. It goes all over the place, and is heavy on the dialogue, but Pacino and De Niro manage to make it work.",

204,5 February 2012,fredericksmith1952,10, I am a huge fan of Micheal Mann,"Okay, I have to preface this by telling you I am a huge fan of Micheal Mann, so if my praise for the man seems a bit over the top, you know why. Al Pacino has figured prominently in many of my reviews, so no surprise he delivers another stellar performance in this epic that reunites his with his Godfather II costar, Robert De Niro, who also delivers in his best ""tough guy"" style. The cast list above may seem a little long, but it could be longer, since there are a few other superb actors in the film, such as Martin Ferrero, Henry Rollins, Hank Azaria, and Jeremy Piven. The list above represents a powerhouse of a cast, though. Ferrero and Noonan have worked with Mann many times before, and I would imagine their inclusion represents a strong suggestion on Mann's part, but they both perform their roles well. This is one of those films where we see the entire canvas, not just one or two parts of the painting. We discover what drives these men, and their women. The settings are perfect, the photography Oscar worthy, and in spite of a run time of just over 2 hours, keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of gun play and bad language, a few scenes of with implied sex, so no need to watch this when the kids are up and about. Definitely a collectible, one you will love to watch over and over again.",

Even if the plots are different, you can feel it's a Michael Mann-movie by this strange mixture of melancholy, violent and urban atmosphere he creates. ""Heat"" is definitely one of the best thrillers of the nineties. What's so special about it are the characters (like in nearly all of the big movies). The two men on opposite sides of the law, who fight against each other until one of them dies. It's inevitable. They don't really like what they are doing, but are doing what they have to, because that's what they are good at. When this seemingly vastly different men finally meet, it's an unforgettable moment. One of many in ""Heat"". I'm impressed with the way the two players are being shown failing to maintain the relationships with their wive/girlfriend. And when there's action, it's a blast. All of this brought to screen by gangster-film legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, with the direction and writing of Michael Mann. (Nearly) Perfect.",
208,29 October 2005,bulleetz37235,9, Very hot,"A classic hip thriller surrounding a world where crime lords run the show and cops can only try and keep up with the pace. ""walk out in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner"" That's how the game is played. Criminals have to stay ahead of the heat and plan in advance to get away with whatever they can. First they strike an armoured van, then a bank heist. They do whatever they can, they are hi-tech and infinitely smart. Robert DeNiro is Niel McCauley the leader of a motley crew of criminals who think they're better than the law, and smarter than the cops. As the film goes on they get into bigger things, the heat gets turned up and they even begin to stalk the cops, not have the cops stalking them. But every game must have an ending, and even though DeNiro is on the verge of getting out, he can't help himself and so he begrudgingly gets back in on the business with the intention of killing a piece of scum killer who used to be a part of his gang. Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna a top notch cop who wants nothing more than to bang up his nemesis, but cannot find enough evidence to support his case. But as DeNiro gets back in he takes an even bigger risk, that exposes him to the full force of the heat, and Pacino is ready for a final showdown. A showdown of courage, guns, and willpower. Honestly this film is brilliant, tense and taut and not form the faint hearted. It is nonetheless fantastic and even Val Kilmer's thrown in to add to the bang. Michael Mann shows flair in probably his best ever film. It is a long three hour epic, but it is also a great film to watch over and over again.",

215,2 April 2021,Doublej20005,8," A Great, if Slightly Underwhelming Crime Film","Undoubtedly a great film, but slightly underwhelming given my expectations. DeNiro and Pacino are fantastic - the ensemble cast is one of the best of all time. Mann's direction and visual stylings are fantastic - if this and Collateral prove anything, he knows how to make LA look fantastic. The action is also really well shot and enjoyable - the whole final hour is just brilliantly entertaining. The soundtrack is very enjoyable and the gritty cinematography works wonders throughout. The central storyline and conflict between DeNiro and Pacino is brilliant - their talk in the restaurant is probably the best scene in the film. However, as much as I appreciated a large amount of this film, it does feel quite overstuffed. None of the side characters or plots get enough time to be fully developed. I think the film should either have been 2 hours and had some of the side plots cut out, or be a 5-6 hour miniseries and fully develop all of the characters. As it is, there's just too much going on for me to give this a higher rating, despite the large amount of positives this film has. It's still great, but IMDB Top 250 great? Not for me.",

221,13 July 2006,Derek237,10, A brilliant crime saga,"Heat is a movie filled with clichés but as a whole is not clichéd. It has a confidence and skill to its craft that makes you believe that you are seeing this kind of story for the first time, or at least, in a whole new light. It's mainly the story of the obsessed-with-his-cases, badass cop and the professional, by-the-numbers criminal. Michael Mann fleshes out the characters (played by Pacino and DeNiro) extremely well and presents them as two men who are each consumed by their profession. Mostly because they are both very good at what they do, and they would not prefer to do anything else. Each story would make an interesting movie or TV show, but Heat collides these two similar characters together to make a great movie about two skilled men conflicted amidst pressures from their work and personal lives finally meeting their match.",

231,2 April 2023,thomvine,9, Near-close to perfect,"Heat is a intriguing adrenaline rush crime drama with a history making shoot out between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. It's a classic cops and robbers story at its core but the everyday lives of all the characters is the real heart of the story. As cops & robbers movies go this is pretty close to perfect. I didn't think so at first as the first 30-45 minutes moved at such a frantic pace between a large number of scenes of a bunch of guys muttering plans and threats and moved so quickly that by the time I had caught up to the current conversation it was on to the next one. But after that first act, I managed to put together what was going on and what everyone was doing and after that, it was smooth sailing. The rest of the movie turned into a pulse-pounding thriller that not only had an excellent cat-and-mouse dynamic but also explored interesting concepts like the similar effect being a dedicated criminal and cop have on their personal lives and the heavy sacrifices they must take in order to do what they do best.",
232,27 October 2003,eamon-hennedy,10, A Fantastic Film.,"Undeniably one of the best films of the 1990's, Heat is a superb crime thriller that is both thrilling and artistic. Michael Mann has made many a great film; Manhunter and The Insider, but here he has created a work of sublime art, a film that is both violent yet oddly beautiful, repressive yet oddly emotional and optimistic and of course, it features Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on screen together for the first time, however it is the story that Michael Mann is telling which is the real star. Pacino and De Niro together may have been the driving force of the publicity of the film but they only share at least ten minutes of this 160 minute film together on screen. Mann just tells his story of what is essentially a film about two men who are both parts of one coin but who undeniably exhibit two sides. It is a testament to Mann's talent as one of the best writer/directors working today that this film works so well. The story of the cop hunting the robber and their story ending with a shoot out has been done to death, but here it feels new and original and best of all it is a story that is well told.",

This is a great crime epic. The big scenes and small scenes are crafted with equal care. It is just about as good as the first 2 Godfather's and just as haunting. Michael Mann wrote a cold, brutal and very moving story about two men who are predators and are lost in life because of their natures. We have Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro --two of the greatest actors of my generation (I'm 41) giving two of the greatest performances of their careers. Their legendary scene over a cup of coffee may ridiculous in real cops and robbers life but but, man (pun intended), it makes for unforgettable cinema. The action is as good as it gets (the bank robbery ""set piece"" is one of the top 5 shootouts ever filmed) and never seems dramatically phony i.e. thrown in just for ""action's"" sake. Like just about all great movies the supporting is wonderful. Every role is memorable. This is one of the few scripts I've ever bothered to buy. It is a long movie that is richer for its length. Earlier Mann wrote and directed a wonderful (and equally underappreciated) movie called ""Thief"" with James Caan 15 years before this one and I can't help but to think that ""Heat"" is the novel length version of ""Thief""'s short story.",

The premise of the film is interesting and compelling. A master thief against a master cop. Pacino's Vincent Hannah and De Niro's Neil McCauley are two different sides of the same coin. It's powerful and interesting to see someone who has mastered their craft the way these characters have. It's a breath of fresh air to see masterminds do their work.

245,28 July 2008,pfgpowell-1,4, There's less to this than meets the eye,"It seems almost churlish to say so given the big movie names involved  Pacino, De Niro and Michael Mann, but, depending on what you want from a film, Heat, isn't really that good. As usual here in IMDb reviews it gets both 10/10 an just 1/10. Well, both are off mark. I have given it 4/10 because  well  as a movie spectacle it does the business and then some. The trouble is that Mann apparently wanted to make more than just a intelligent crook v an intelligent cop movie. Mann wanted to inject meaning. Well, he hasn't unless you're the kind of guy or gal who thinks that your average R&B pop video is meaningful. That's not to say, of course, that this is merely on the level of such a video, only that it has the same spurious significance. The usual cliché is that you often have to suspend disbelief to enjoy a tale, and Heat demands that a lot of disbelief is suspend. For one thing there is no back story: we are presented with a range of characters and must either accept them or not. But how did De Niro, portrayed as rather an intelligent cove get into crime when undoubtedly his intelligence and character would have made him a success in many more legitimate areas. On the other hand, he is remarkably ruthless, is apparently incapable of forming relationships (until he meets a girl who he thinks might be 'it'), and can see himself pursuing no other career than crime. Then there's Pacino: wedded to the job, his third marriage going down the pan, the man is an interesting case history. But no explanation is offered as to why this should be. Well, you might say, none is needed. Just accept those two characters and enjoy the action. In that case, why does Mann introduce the theme of relationship, their hold over us, their strength, their weaknesses? What was needed was another film which would examine that theme at length  but then Mann would not have had his action movie. So if that is what you want, enjoy it. But don't be taken in by the faux philosophical nature of the movie.",

DO NOT LISTEN to the low score reviews here. Do not even read those. These people missed the point. It is their opinion, however, their opinions are wrong in this case. This is an epic film that holds up even today. They don't make films like this anymore. One person said that De Niro acted out of character when he decided to fo after Waingro at the end. This person missed the point entirely. The point was that the each time he deviated from his ""Have no attachments that you cannot walk away from if you spot the Heat around the corner,"" things went bad for him. That was why he lived by that rule. When he deviated from it, he lost. That's why he finally lost to Pacino in the end. Also many on here who complain the film is too long also did not get it. The movie needed this length of time to tell this story, and the personal lives of the characters were brought into play FOR A REASON. It is called chatacterization.

That includes those characters that would get little or no lines in other films.",

The camera work is tight, the sound and photography often haunting. 
The characters will make you love and hate them as you agonizingly get pulled in each direction as the complex web of the story progresses. 
The action especially the violence, robberies and gun fights are so intense and riveting you cant help but be on the edge of your seat until the final minute with an ending that will make critics and fans alike gasp and compare ALL crime movies to this one from here on in.

There are very few movies that do that and Heat is one of them. Heat is the story of two men who lead very separate, yet strangely similar lives. Both men are driven by what they do best and other aspects of their life suffer as a result. One is a career criminal who's lifestyle forbids personal connections that cannot be easily severed at a moment's notice (for obvious reasons).

DeNiro makes a living doing heists with his crew, but it all goes wrong when one of his crew mates loses his temper and kills a couple guards during an armored truck run. In comes Pacino, assigned to the case. The movie becomes a cat and mouse chase as the bad guys keep doing crimes, and the good guys stay just a little behind. The other side to these stories are the dramatic relationship between girlfriends and protagonist. Standard relationship stuff, with Pacino even having a depressed stepdaughter with an absent dad. Unfortunately, though the acting in this film is great, this film suffers from unoriginality. It is tired storytelling with the only redeemable thing being the casting being strong therefore allowing the acting to be there. I was not a fan.",

Val Kilmer wears a ridiculous wig, or maybe its his real hair, which would be much worse. Some fool cast Tom Sizemore to appear in this movie. Heat features talented actresses ( Venora, Judd, Brenneman ) but the movie asks of these ladies to be part of the scenery- I can only assume this is because having good roles for the women in this movie would spoil Heat's chickensh*t macho fantasy. Its like this movie was written by a twelve year old boy, who wrote the the script with burned food rather than ink. Great job Michael Mann.",

Michael Mann brilliantly utilizes both veteran actors (Pacino as Vincent Hanna, DeNiro as Neil McCauley), playing them with and against each other to the ultimate confrontation neither can avoid. There is an underlying depth to the film as the actions are incidental, its the characters that matter. While the defining line between good guy/bad guy is drawn it is equally blurred as your empathy lies with both men, understanding they're one and the same, each capable of being on the other side. Black and white hardly exists here, but rather those murky shades of gray that calls to question what matters most, what truly defines us: the motivation or the actions, the man himself or his job?

The fact that the movie had already done a thorough and quick way of bonding us with the characters so quickly, and immediately putting them in such an extraordinary scene which is ordinarily found at the end of almost every movie... So many perfect performances and production moments all combined, put the viewer in a state of awe at what they just witnessed. This hooks the viewer and pulls their attention for the entire movie.

The film is an edge of your seat psychological thriller that really gets under the skin of each character and their motivations. It's expertly paced, is by far Michael Manns best film and it currently holds firm to the number 4 position in my all time top 10 movies. And as if that's not enough to wet your appetite, this film also boasts the greatest gun battle between the cops and the (highly sophisticated) robbers ever to be attempted.

This movie wasn't a massive box office hit like other similar movies but it is easily one of the best movies of all time because put simply, it has it all. To start with, it is visually stunning. Michael Mann couldn't have made LA look any better. Then we have the fantastic cast led by Pacino and De Niro and supported brilliantly by the likes of Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore. The casting is astonishing considering this wasn't a big budget, box office smash type movie. Then we have possibly the best written storyline in recent history. The story revolves around the dedicated but highly strung cop Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and his team of detectives trying to bust articulated thief Neil MaCauley (De Niro) and his team of bank robbers. The complexity of the characters becomes shades of grey rather than black and white as Neil wants out but struggles to give up doing what he does best and Vincent struggles to hold his marriage together as his pursuit of Neil takes over his life. All the characters in the movie are complex and interesting, adding different dimensions to the already fantastic storyline. It really has the lot. It is nearly 3 hours long but every minute is gripping and develops the story further, and the acting is fantastic. I recommend it any casual fan as much as fans of the genre. Sensational.",

You have Pacino as Vincent Hanna, the sharp and volatile cop investigating a line of heists. The thieves responsible for these heists are De Niro, as Neil McCauley, the smooth and mysterious mastermind, and his right hand men Kilmer and Sizemore. Despite the great ensemble of cast, Pacino and De Niro steal the show by both delivering unforgettable lines and action scenes. The beauty of this cast ensemble is that neither one of them out staged one another, as if one delivered one good line the other would just hit the other back with an equally good line.

The shoot-out in the middle of the movie is riveting, raw, and powerfully hard-hitting. The story made it impossible to guess exactly how it would turn out - was the cop going to get his man, or was the mastermind thief going to get away? Heat belongs on best heist and action movie lists but not nearly as high as many lists rank it. Heat carries some annoying faults. The ending of the film is abrupt and unsatisfying. The runtime is at least 45 minutes too long. The biggest frustration was Al Pacino's performance. He was so over the top that his character felt like he was in the wrong movie.

There was a chance to make a blockbuster movie, but somehow it ended up as a chance lost. The storyline is good, but the way it is acting out just seems to be dull, dragging itself through thick treacle. Many times throughout this film, it was hard to hear what was being said, kind of mumbling, whispering, muttering, and even with the sound turned right up, it did not improve that much. There is too much of this low light, mumbling routine all through the film. Of course, there is the big gun battle scene after one of the robberies, and probably this is what makes the viewers remember ""Heat"" for, but even that could have been done better. It ended up so very ""Hollywood"" with its never ending magazines, bullets that can only pierce the outer metal of a car door, not go right through the vehicle, civilians wandering around nonchalantly whilst bullets fly everywhere. However, this was the most ""Action"" part of the movie, and being nearly 3 hours long, the rest of the film just limped along. Could have been so much better, a chance lost.",

Myself I wouldn't have thought Michael Mann the director to get them in the same movie (even if they only meet up in two scenes), as my preconceptions of Mann back in the mid 90's pretty much begin and end with TV's style-over-content ""Miami Vice"", meaning I was expecting over-exaggerated characters, extreme situations, improbable connections, loud background music and of course lots of gunpower and violence.

297,24 July 2018,parkerrodney,10, Heat - On Fire,"With Robert Dinero, Al Pachino, Jon Voight and Val Kilmer headlining this movie, Heat is an intense police crime drama which capitalizes on its great screenplay, acting, production and directing. Many police dramas, particularly those of this era, have well developed story lines which fully engage the viewer in the main plot as well as the lives of the main characters. Although, at its core, Heat is a cops and robbers movie, what makes it special is the intensity of the dysfunctional personal relationships which Pachino, Dinero and Kilmer have with the women in their lives, and the cat and mouse game play between Pachino, the L.A. Police Lieutenant brining the ""heat"" to Dinero and his team of technically proficient and professional bank robbers. 
The movie starts, not with a bank heist, but with the heist of bearer bonds from an armored car which results in the death of three guards raising the stakes of the crime from that of armed robbery to homicide for all parties concerned and putting Pachino on their trail. But less about bank robbing and more about the lives of Dinero and Pachino, one of the movies high drama points is when their cat and mouse game results in their meeting over a cup of coffee in a diner. During this meetin Pachino recounts Dinero's criminal resume and stays in the penitentiary, to which Dinero states that he's, ""not going back."" The two also speak candidly about what they each do in terms of chosen professions and how neither of them lives the regular life of ""barbeques and ball games,"" and healthy relationship, and that this is the life they prefer. During this meeting the men share common perspectives on how they feel about what they do, and what they will have to do, even to each other, if it comes to that point. And we know, this point is coming. This scene demonstrates just how good these actors have perfected their crafts, as they convince the viewer that adversaries can have mutual respect for one another.
Heat follows the same pattern of many movies of this type, where we know how this is going to end - in the game of cops and robbers, the cops always win, and the robbers always make mistakes, errors in judgement and betray each other for any number of reasons. In the law and order aspect of the film there are casualties on both sides. But it is the casualties, drama and betrayal in the personal lives of the characters which keeps us glued to our seats. 
As the movie reaches a climax, we see the wreckage coming. Pachino is in pursuit, even as his wife cheats on him and his step daughter attempts to commit suicide. Kilmer's wife seeks to sell him out to the LAPD, and changes her mind, and Dinero who in the process of escaping with his love interest must make a detour to kill one last person who betrayed him. This unplanned, undisciplined reckless and impulsive act we know will lead to Dinero's undoing, as his execution results in police, fire descending upon his location and him leaving the scene of foot with his love interest watching him take off.
The closing scene is a foot chase between cop and robber as Dinero attempts to get to the airport to make meet his connection and make his getaway. The airport scene is unremarkable, as the chase ends with Pachino shooting Dinero. As Dinero lay dying on the ground, Pachino grabs Dinero's hand as Dinero tells him, ""I told you I'm not going back,"" to which Pachino replies, ""yeah.""
If you like classic crime dramas, without all the special effects, shiny objects, stunts and computer graphics, ""Heat"" is for you. Make no mistake about it. As entertaining as ""Heat"" is it is a film of human tragedy. It is the wreckage of human relationships where women pay a significant price for loving the men that they love. It is hard not to feel a women's pain as it front and center in almost every interaction.",

While Pacino screams, Kilmer and Voight, both sporting long blonde locks, mumble their lines in such low tones that they are barely comprehensible, causing the viewer to constantly adjust the volume. Mann directs with the slickness of a video game, but the film becomes tiresome because there are too many characters and plot lines.

These two Hollywood heavyweights carry their weight to help create a classic good guy vs. bad guy telling. Heat stands as one of our finest crime-dramas. It has great directing, great writing and supreme acting. The acting is as good as it gets. The cast assembled rivals most any movie. De Niro and Pacino are both awesome in their lead roles. Val Kilmer is outstanding, like he often is, Ashley Judd makes her mark here and Jon Voight delivers some polished acting grit. I must mention a young Natalie Portman who reveals her brilliant acting aptitude in limited screen time. Michael Mann does a terrific job behind the camera. His direction is sharp and poignant. Mann's style is very effective for the course of this movie and he really excels during the action sequences. Heat has a very good story. The primary plot is excellent, but some of the supporting plot lines are lacking. There are lingering scenes scattered throughout. Heat's intensity wanes in and out, and it does not quite sustain a desirable level of suspense throughout. Though the good scenes are so, so good. The diner scene presents the greatest clash of actors ever seen, Al and Bobby, toe-to-toe. This thrusts right into the bank heist scene. Be prepared to get blasted in the face as the most captivating and spectacular gun shootout scene ever seen unfolds between De Niro's crew and Pacino's task force. Once Heat picks up, it becomes enthralling. A can't miss. Do yourself a favor and go watch this movie if you haven't already. It's great.",

311,11 May 2000,ChrisBagley,10, This movie trashes all of the cliches about cops n' robbers,"Perfect. Every aspect of this film was perfect, from the acting, to the cinematography to the story line. It was excellent to see Pacino and De Niro, perhaps the two greatest actors in the history of crime-genre movies, finally appear as nemeses. The fact that they didn't appear on screen together for most of the movie was also a great buildup to the diner scene. Fabulous character study between the two--it trashes the usually superficial emotive tendency to cheer for the ""good guy"" and hate the ""bad guy."" Like De Niro's character asks, ""What is normal?"" Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Above all, I loved the viscerality--each of these guys is in it for the thrill, not for money or convictions. Not so for the lesser characters in the film, but this, too, feels appropriate, and throughout the movie, I felt a hair's breadth away from each character's id. The cinematography was also amazing. The gun battle in the street early on in the movie was the most gripping scene I've ever experienced, and the diner scene is also one for the ages--nothing on the screen except for two great egos matched up against each other for the thrill of the fight.",

However, if you allow yourself to be drawn into the movie, you'll find that those aspects are actually strengths and not weaknesses.

TDK has several plot holes that upon repeated viewings get more glaring, as well as pacing problems (I tend to feel exhausted by the joker is captured halfway through and just wish it were over).

The drama is good, so is the acting, but some relationships should have had more depth to them to make them more impactful, such as the one between the step-father and step-daughter for example.

341,2 March 2021,RonellSowes,10, Intelligent Crime Drama,"Neil McCauley(DeNiro) is a career criminal who's done his time in prison and doesn't plan on returning. Because of this, he's cool, calculating and percise in his work. This film is full of big-name talented actors but of them all, Robert DeNiro stands out the most. Like the entire film, a lot about the character isn't spelled out or clearly defined but DeNiro fills in these gaps by bringing an authentic personality to the character. And leaves you seeing no other actor as a possible substitute to him.
Meanwhile there's Vincent Hanna(Pacino), the weathered detective on the master criminal's scent, who matches Neil in more than just wits. A robber who never loses his cool and a cop prone to bombastic outburts might not sound to similar. But what drives both men and their personalities underneath it all, make the two something of the same. However, the unlikely connection between the two leads is by no means the extent of this film's drama. Neil has his relationship with Eady(Brenneman) and Vincent has his own issues with his wife(Venora) and mentally unstable step-daughter(Portman). Then there's everything that goes between some of Neil's crew: Chris(Kilmer) and his wife(Judd) and even Donald(Haysbert), an ex-con struggling to go straight. If there was ever a 'crime' 'drama' this is it. The film gets deep into all the character studies and personal stuff as well as including multiple crime storylines. Which involve Neil's laundering expert friend,Nate(Voight),a businessman who's plot to kill Neil backfires and a vengeful,former member of Neil's crew who's serial killings happen to also involve Vincent. As you can tell there's a lot if things going on in the picture, which all eventually tie together.
While this film is mostly drama, there's no doubt that the only major action sequence in it, the bank robbery, is one of the most famous of any action film. With novel sound effects and detailed choreography the 'big shootout' in this film manages to make something entertaining which often times isn't. However, the film's entire purpose really is to be a sort of intelligent action movie. Unlike the expository, square dialouge in most films of this type, in this film its actually quite snappy and full of subtext and nuance. Nothing is boldly declared and instead it relies on the viewer to figure things out-though at times it might be a little too subtle. And it stays pretty logical,to an extent that is. Following the style of Neil, the first half or more of this film is guided by careful reasoning and doing what is smartest. But after the main heist, it takes a sharp turn away from logic and sense. I suppose you could justify Neil's nonconcurrent actions as a reason to his downfall. He stayed alive and successful because of his unemotional, safe ways and once he broke his code of conduct, it cost him. Still, it conflicts with what's previously established and detracts from the overall intensity.",

Rarely missing a beat, this film takes the time to let the audience know how both sides, cops and professional criminals, go about their business. The time given to show the relationships they have outside their jobs with wives and girlfriends separates this film from most others. Michael Mann is a master of this, never underestimating the curiosity and intelligence of the audience. Every actor seems perfect for their role. Ted Levine and Mykelti Williamson can do more with a facial expression than most actors can with 100 lines of dialogue. Great Movie!

Actually so much of the depth of the characters come out through subtle facial expressions, e.g. Diane Venora when Pacino leaves her at the hospital (the camera lingers long enough for her posture to speak a thousand words) Ashley Judd in the couch after signaling to her husband...I hold my breath with her and almost faint every time I see that scene.

Of course, that is not even the best shoot-out in the film.  The 10-minute exchange between the robbers and the cops is simply *awesome*.

What I liked most was that particular gunshot scene after De Niro & Co robbed the bank.  It is simply the best gunshot scene I've seen until today.

Unfortunately, this biased me somewhat when I sat down to watch Heat (1995). Stylistically, both are fairly similar and use similar locales. However, at almost three hours long, some of the pacing in Heat made me think that it could have used a bit of a trim in the first half.",
356,13 May 2014,tvr1977,5, Long and Boring,"Has its good points, but at nearly 3 hours this movie is crying out for editing. I would have left out the whole Waingro as serial killer bit, including the scene with the hooker and the subsequent finding of the body - its inconsequential, irrelevant, and left unresolved. I also would've left out the whole ""sell VanZandt his bonds back"" subplot and just had Waingro be a straight out snitch. It would cut out a lot of nonsense, and leave the movie a lot leaner and meaner. Basically only include the armored car job, the foiled metals heist, and the bank job and denouement. At an hour and fifty minutes, this would be an action packed thriller. At 3 hours, it's kind of a yawn-fest.",
357,5 June 2019,mdisandro14,10, Easily one of my all time favorites.,This movie is unlike any bank heist/crime drama film I have seen. The cinematography throughout is excellent. The score of this movie is also amazing. The acting and character development is awesome and not to mention we have the first on screen appearance of both robert dinero and al Pacino. Excellent story as well and some of the best gun shooting scenes that are extremely realistic and intense great film!!,

Twenty plus years later and it's every bit as good and one of my all time top five movies.

361,8 January 2014,zardoz-13,10, One of the Best Crime Thrillers Ever Made!!!,"""Miami Vice"" creator Michael Mann made one of the best heist thrillers of all time with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. ""Heat"" pits a seasoned LAPD detective against a hardened criminal in an intelligent but exciting cat & mouse crime epic that considers the public and private aspects of the lives of the heroes and the villains. Indeed, we get to see how the cop lives after hours and how the criminal survives when he isn't committing crime. Clocking in at 172 minutes, ""Heat"" blazes up more often than not when it isn't smoldering with suspense. Pacino and De Niro make terrific adversaries, while Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ted Levine, Wes Studi, and Kevin Gage round out a first-class supporting cast. Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman, and Ashley Judd play the romantic interests respectively for Pacino, De Niro, and Kilmer. Of course, if Mann had left out the soap operatic elements, ""Heat"" would have been even better. Basically, Pacino and De Niro are at each other's throats for most of the 172 minutes, and they have one scene together in a diner where they read each other the riot act about what they will be compelled to do if they encounter one other in the line of duty. The De Niro character has a great line involving 30 seconds when you know everything will change. A shady entrepreneur William Fichtner takes up about a third of the action in a subplot that grows out of the armored car robbery at the outside. The way that De Niro and company knock over the armored car company is flat out neat. They ram the armored car with a huge tow truck. Everything looks authentic in this urban western. The bank robbery and shoot-out in the streets of L.A. is choreographed beautifully with most of the cops armed with automatic weapons. The big finale at LAX reminded me of the conclusion to ""Bullitt"" when Stever McQueen ventured out onto the airport runaway to catch a killer. Elliot Goldenthal furnishes Mann an orchestral score that underlines the tension, suspense, and heartache in the narrative. Lenser Dante Spinotti makes everything look larger-than-life and gritty.",

Cinematography - Probably some of the best heist scenes and a city at night ever shot on film. 4.

I wouldn't be willing to even buy into the argument that it was ahead of it's time or its one of the earliest 'heist' films. It's just too bland, boring and overdrawn. Al Pacino too seems to be hamming throughout the film. What happened to him? He was such a fine actor and did such a fantastic job in his old films. Especially in the 70's. Here he was hamming a lot. Screaming without reason and that a$s dialogue was just cringy as hell. The story is boring too and the screenplay is absolutely horrendous. Slow paced and completely uninteresting. Being a big fan of De Niro and Al Pacino's, I was hoping to be in for a treat, but the script is awful and the director seemed to be having to have done with a mess of a script. I waited.

The color choices alone seal the mood (like that blue filter so sweet) and it couldn't have been cut together better to add dramatic intensity and edge of your seat action sequences.

(but the first half is still better than all of the movies of today). The second half is 1 hour, it felt like half an hour. Never have I felt more tension in a film when Neil goes after everyone who betrayed him. In my opinion, the final hour of Heat is joint for the best hour in film history with Goodfellas's 1st hour. The final scene where Vincent kills Neil was so tense, and I felt it could really go the other way! The thing I love about this film is that you can root for both Vincent and Neil! Never have I rooted for the bad guy more than I have in this film, I guess it's all those hours I've spent playing GTA, which took a lot from this film. You have probably seen a film that 'copied' some of this movie without even noticing! This film is so influential in the Crime, and the Action genre.

I feel this is the best Crime movie to show a 12-13 year old who wants to get into the genre (After all, I'd seen Scarface and The Godfather before this, but this what got me hooked on the genre!) because it has the right balance of Crime Drama and amazing Action.

The pacing was kind of slow at times too but everything else more than made up for it's few flaws. The opening heist sequence is well done and the same can go for the intense shoot out in the streets of Los Angeles. Pacino makes for an effective hero on the side of good and De Niro is equally impressive as the villain. They both prove to be worth adversaries but unfortunately they're not given much screen time together or confrontations for that matter.

The only thing I felt the film was missing was more scenes between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, obviously they are the stars of the movie but they aren't seen together very much at all, the part in the coffee shop was amazing as we got to see two acting legends play off each other, and I would have loved to have seen more scenes like that, the chemistry between them was pure and natural. One thing I really love about Michael Mann's writing is that he gets the audience to follow, and also feel for, the antagonist just as much as the protagonist, it isn't just about the movies hero trying to capture the villain, we follow the bad guy as well, we learn about his motives and we actually feel sympathy for him, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both do an outstanding job as both characters, they are both very flawed but also likable, no matter who wins in the end, we are left feeling remorse for the other.

It is a very violent movie, so if you are squeamish about such things take a pass. Heat has a varied assortment of complex characters. The story line is basically about the world of violent criminals and the man who brings them together for the purpose of engaging in high profile crimes that have huge financial rewards. Denero plays the genius who leads them and Pacino the cop who wants to bring him down. The acting is first rate. Watch the interplay between DeNero and Pacino in the restaurant scene in which each is telling the other about their lives and goals. It is like watching two heavy weight champions fighting it out. I'll call it was a draw. Also look out for Dr. Bob, played by Jerimy Privin of ""Entourage"" fame. He has more hair now than he did then. Go figure. Rent or buy it, then sit back and watch a masterpiece. I think it is DeNero's best performance and one of the best ensemble casts you will ever see in a movie",

The hunter (pacino) is chasing the hunted (De Niro.) Niel Mcauley (De Niro) is a thief on the loose, and Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is the one to stop him. This epic chase puts Hannas family at risk. But none the less this is a true crime/cop thriller, which is right up there with the best of them including Dirty Harry and others.

I thought it was overly boring, and ran for way too long. My vast film knowledge was not even a fraction of what it is today at that point, but for years to come, if anyone ever asked if I had seen it, I said the same thing to them. So in the last two years, I've caught various parts of it, and was totally immersed within the film, despite my previous ideals about it.

This is one aspect that annoys me the most about a lot of films and it is hard to get me look past this point (of too long films), unless it happens to be a film with great pace throughout or highly entertaining from minute to minute. This is a point in general that I think should be amongst priorities for a film-maker.

A daring undertaking by Mann, an epic crime drama clocking in at over 2.5 hours, populated by a large and diverse cast, it is a by-the-numbers tale of police procedure and high-level criminals, and starring acting legends Al Pacino (as robbery-homicide Lt Vincent Hanna) and Robert DeNiro (as master thief Neil MacCauley).

I have yet to witness a heist movie that even comes close to the greatness of this slick thriller of a movie. Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley and Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna are riveting to watch. Val Kilmer's extremely cool Chris shiherlis steals the show in some of the movies greatest action scenes. The city of L.A is also captured beautifully; whether it is a heart-racing gun fight on the streets of L.A or a conversation between two guys in restaurant, the city of angels feels like a character of its own.

One of the few films where the violence serves the storytelling instead of replacing it. Also the dialogues are sometimes poetry without losing credibility.

How I missed it I don't know. I found out about it watching Pacino on Inside the Actor's Studio. Having the two in the same movie was a dream come true.

Thought provoking, entertaining, deeply rooted in character and a masterclass in action sequences with intent and purpose. It's not just hard men shooting each other for the shake of seeing things blow up and that's really amazing! Ofcourse I mean the character studies and performance are the standout. Like for the love of all that is holy why is it so hard to introduce us to characters, let those characters live out believable plot points and come to an end where their journeys have meaning and something worthwhile to say about their characters.

I didn't see it again until last year, when I was at University. I had forgotten how good this film really is! There are so many things that you miss out on when you watch it for the first time! Pacino and De Niro, quite rightly hyped as the 'two most electrifying actors in America', are both brilliant, as well as Voight and Kilmer. The shootout scene must be one of the most well directed and suspense filled in the history of cinema. It has been knocked for being too long, and I admit it can drag in places, but watching through these has its rewards. All in all a fantastic film, probably the second best film of the 90's after 'Shawshank Redemption'. Michael Mann can take credit for not letting the films hype detract from a throughly engrossing and entertaining film.9/10",

While you could call it slow and/or a standard action/thriller, I feel it has an extra edge which makes it great. It is partly the acting performances by Deniro, Pacino and Kilmer. But one of the best things about this film is the realism displayed in the dialogue and the character development. Even the negro character who only has a short amount of air time is well established as man who is weighed down by a crime ridden past, has reformed, but cannot rid of the tag that his crimes have left with him. The inclusion of Val Kilmer for me was always going to boost my opinion of the film. I feel this is his best performance second only perhaps to his portrayal of Doc Holliday in Tombstone. It is not so much his acting ability or aesthetic appeal that does it for him, but his raw presence and charisma. Finally, I have to give credit to the shootout scene towards the end of the film. I have designated this as my favourite scene in a movie ever despite its violence.",

He consistently has churned out modern classics, from Thief(1981), Manhunter(1988), The Last of the Mohicans(1992) and The Insider(1999). But in my opinion, Heat is his best. It may be strange to say so about a movie with a cast that includes Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, and Jon Voight, but its the writing that gets me. Is the dialouge Mamet level? No. Maybe its not the most original plot in the world either. But the screenplay has something that almost no movies can truly claim these days- efficiency. It may seem odd to say that about a movie that is almost 3 hours long, but there is not one scene in this film that doesn't advance the story. And the subplots are clear and every single one of them is resolved before the credits. Much has been made of the first onscreen meeting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. And when I say meeting, I mean it, as they literally share one dialouge scene together. And it is a fabulous scene.

Not a bad movie on its own. The problem with Heat is not the plot or the plausibility of the story and characters but rather the huge expectations from it starring two big names and the pressure to meet those two in a single movie at last. If you separate yourself from this notion you will enjoy the movie. It has great 90s feel to it, the cast is excellent, the shoot-out sequences are the best I've seen in an action movie. I wouldn't pick on details trying to find inconsistencies or implausibilities - it's a movie, for God's sake! The parallel private worlds of both main characters (and some of the rest) shown alongside the main events are good enough. I must say, I don't understand why Pacino and De Niro are talked to be the best ever but I actually like Pacino in this movie, perhaps him being loud, exaggerated and flamboyant fits the bill here. DeNiro, on his own, is good too. The plot doesn't allow for both of them to interact throughout the movie and that's how they should have kept it. Of course, they were forced to write the ""diner"" scene and it ruined the whole thing. The atrocious dialog in it didn't help either. Then, to add insult to the injury, they made De Niro's character betray himself and do something so out of character it was borderline laughable which led to even more laughable ending.

The story unfolds beautifully, never dragging. The characters all feel fleshed out, and the actions of every character effect the stories of every other character. On top of this the performances are all as great as you'd expect from a cast like this one. The dialogue is cool, fast, and entertaining without falling into the trap of needing constant one-liners or jokes to keep the audience engaged. It'd be a sin not to mention the score which features everything from rock, to electronic, to classical, to choir. All of it beautiful and minimalistic. As far as the technical aspects go, well, it's a Michael Mann crime thriller. Every scene is shot and lit to perfection.

When he was outside the club about to go in to meet Tone Loc (Albert's brother) the bouncer outside gives him a vial, on the house, and he takes a snort of if as he goes in. There are several times throughout the movie were it seems like Pacino is over acting. This is because he was supposed to be wired. However, Mann decided the movie was intense enough without this story line and cut all of the scenes out. I spoke with someone who went to a program where Michael Mann spoke about movie making and mentioned this. Also, if you get a hold of some of the early drafts of the screenplay you can read these scenes in them.",

468,23 September 2003,valdabyryn,10, Epic Crime Saga,"An epic crime saga, indeed - as described on the back of the box.  This is my favorite film of all time.  I need not go into great detail about the knockout cast, though it does the film bounds of justice.  This film's best quality is the fantastic acting meshed with Michael Mann's directing (See ""The Insider"", also directed by Mann and also starring Al Pacino and Diane Venora for comparison and like style).  The film also has a well composed score.  Regarding the use of music in Heat, the exclusion of background music from various scenes (like the bank robbery) forces the viewer to take in what's happening visually, and this is how power actors like Pacino and De Niro really make this film the masterpiece that it is. I voted this film a 10 because I think it excedes, and actually exemplifies, the criteria that viewers of good taste and quality want to experience when they see a movie. Fans of organized crime films such as Casino and Goodfellas will appreciate the up-to-date representations of crime in Heat.  Heat presents a modern tale of cops and robbers without focusing on the protagonist or pushing the viewer towards favoring one particular character.  This films blurs the lines between good guy and bad guy, and you'll be surprised who you'll root for in the end.",
469,7 September 2005,jboothmillard,7, Heat,"This is a pretty good crime action thriller where there are mainly chase sequences between the cops and the crooks. I think it is called Heat either for the amount of explosions, or the Heat of the chases. Al Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, the detective on the lookout for a crime gang planning to do something to the city, or something. Robert De Niro is Neil McCauley, the man mainly in charge of this gang, and the one who Hanna mainly wants to get his hands on. McCauley is a pretty hardcore criminal because he does not care who he kills to get his own way. Also starring Val Kilmer as the nasty Chris Shiherlis, Jon Voight as Nate, Ted Levine as Bosko and Natalie Portman as Lauren Gustafson. Robert De Niro was number 2, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, De Niro was number 50, and Pacino number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Pacino and De Niro together were number 5 on The World's Greatest Actor.

A multi-layered crime yarn filled with fascinating characters against a noirish Los Angeles cityscape. Truly the stuff of great cinema. What's so refreshing here is that even though this is a tale of cops and robbers, both sides aren't exactly typical hero or villain. We see the cracks and the downfalls of both, but we also see their honor, loyalty, and commitment to the job regardless of the risks or consequences. Director Michael Mann stages each scene with meticulous and razor sharp edge, and the second act shoot out is among one of the greatest action scenes in film history. Leads Pacino and DeNiro both deliver career-defining performances, adding so much nuance and depth to their respective characters. Great supporting performances from Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Danny Trejo, and Amy Brennaman also add to the mix.

Of all the the ubiquitous Pacino-De Niro -paired films, this one is easily the most outstanding. The direction is as tight as a Led Zeppelin concert, the cinematography is simply breathtaking, the major players are larger-than-life yet believable, the action sequences are exquisitely choreographed and finished to near-perfection. The moral questions the movie raises are an interesting side-issue as well. Not to mention the way the plot examines the flawed, but redeemable, relationships of post-modernity. In the end, one has become so involved as to try to stop the subtle plot from fulfillment. The suspense at the end builds to an almost unbearable climax, and the denouement is as brilliant, and human, and deeply moving, as they come... I would specially commend the music here.. it is just superb. They do not make movies like this any more. Michael Mann, you the man, where you went?",

Everything about this movie works for me; the cinematography is stunning, the cast is brilliant, the score is pretty good as well. Heat (excluding some of the ones in John Woos movies) also has one of the greatest shootouts ever. To me heat is the ultimate blend of realism and style. This is easily one of the best movies released in the 90s also there's some brilliantly inventive film making from Michael Mann that, despite the 2 hours 50 runtime, keeps you gripped and thrilled at all times. 10/10.",

Al Pacino first, well he is Al Pacino playing a cop. You don't see a cop you see Al Pacino, no creativity and no effort in making the character more subtle. De Niro is quite better playing it it cool and professional with a little bit of nostalgia in his eyes, but he cannot save the movie.",

Some have criticized the ending as being anti-climatic, or a sell out. I couldn't disagree more. I believe that was the point of the ending, to tie together the main theme of the plot.

Sure, there are excellent movies like ""Narc"" and ""The Departed"" every now and then, but for the most part, there is nary a superb cop film to be found. It's times like these where we should hope that filmmakers take extra notice of Michael Mann's crime masterpiece, ""Heat"", which was the definition of the perfect cop movie(or cops and robbers movie). Mann's 3 hour epic was nothing short of brilliant. The casting was wonderful considering that the main stars are Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman, and Jon Voight, and the writing was poetic, philosophical, and witty. Plus, the film leaves us in awe. It's ironic how *spoiler* the ending should be a happy one given that the good guy wins, but that is hardly the case since we end up caring for both the cop and the robber. As a result, Mann makes what should be a happy ending on paper, into a tragedy. ""Heat"" is a timeless masterpiece and is proof that poetic dialogue beats generic dialogue anyday!",

But to make a great movie you must, also, have a strong story.  This film has it. The film follows two sides to a very gripping story.  On one side, you have the on-edge detective, Vincent Hanna (played exceptionally by Al Pacino). You see the drama and heartache he must go through to be so dedicated to his work.  On the other side, you have Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley, who, in his own right, is a honest man.  The regrets he has and the pain he faces by being a criminal are both well played without exactly making you feel sorry for him.  Then, as the two slowly some together through their own destinies, you get to see the bond and similarities they share.  This film actually has three climactic points.  The first is the meeting in the coffee house.  It is there that they both show how much they actually respect each other.  The second is the robbery sequence.  This is probably one of the greatest action sequences ever to grace film.  The final climax is just that, the final sceen.  It is the final showdown between Pacino and De Niro.",

484,18 April 2000,matanovi,10," Mann's ""The Last of the Crime Movies"" - no more good and bad guys.","The first time I started watching ""Heat"" on the VHS I realized that something is wrong and that this isn't a traditional and classical cops-and-robbers genre, and that the film's seductive poster picture of a few masked men is just a simple promotive trick to attract the potential viewers who will surely expect a luxury of shootings, chases, fights and swearings - all settled clichees of an American crime genre. Since I didn't complete watching the movie, I rented it a few months later and gave it my full attention. I got under the skin of every replica and shot. Very soon it was more than cristaly clear what was wrong: ""Heat"" truly is a motion picture that just goes beyond the expectations of the cops-and-robbers genre and easily steams into the kingdom of movie masterpieces. Further elaborations are not necessary. ""Heat"" really is, not just because of the author's anti-thesis as the corner stone of this epic tale, ""the last crime movie"", which brings its every element, wheter it's writing, directing, acting or any other important segment of filmmaking, to complete and astounding perfection and stratified storytelling complexion which pulls the story with unbelieveble smoothness and calm, literally excelling from one shot to the next, interweaving its situations with some kind of magical, subtle and modern elevation and with juicy dialogues sharpend to the utter perfection of screen writing, surely simptomatic and authentic for the characters' surroundings and their professions. Michael Mann, probably one of the strongest and studious Hollywood directors today, breaks down the accepted thesis of life and film and asks the discussable question from which he creates the corner stone of his masterful master-piece, although remaining the exact definition of time and place of the action, and, in the end, still only fictious characters he adores so much. A parade of acting icons and Hollywood pearls shines with the foreground of picturesque characters, Pacino's appropriate mannerism and De Niro's intimistic coldness of a loner. Are there any other more suitable characters for the profiles of those two? And is there any scene in their careers that can be as historic and as fascinating as the coffee confrontation scene? The one that can, in some way, be a simbol of the plot of this unavoidable master-piece. Which is, unfortunately, the most underestimated film of the decade.",

That, and the length it adds, may be what turns some people off, including several of my friends. (That and feeling that Pacino is over the top here, which I have also learned to love - he's the last romantic left in acting.) In the end, there is no denying that Heat is a 10 out of 10 in these times in film, maybe better than The Departed, if not as culturally relevant as Goodfellas. Miami Vice fails because Mann did common themes of that film and Heat already in Collateral, and with more detachment than in Heat - so by the time he washed out in Miami Vice, passion (or ""heat"") had drained, and Farrell and Foxx had nothing to replace it with. I hope Mann makes one as good as Heat again, and collects an Oscar like Marty. Where he'll get the talent, I don't know.",

The film boasts a highly acclaimed cast, led by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino who are two of the greatest method actors ever and despite my skepticism of the combination of so many big names in one film, each member fits into their role beautifully. Director Michael Mann has created a masterpiece: beautiful screenplay and gritty realism combine with the stunningly elegant and orchestral soundtrack to produce a thrilling crime film that is elevated out of this at times unoriginal genre to greater heights. The plot examines two men on either side of the law: De Niro as the criminal genius who never lets anything get too close to him is fascinating, and Pacino as the obsessive, dedicated detective is equally engaging. Mann cleverly unites both men at a diner - here their similarities and motivations are revealed.",

While the actors are all good, the real stars of this movie is Los Angeles and the soundtrack themselves. The way Mann shoots the city for his crime masterpiece is amazing. The look and feel of it, along with the soundtrack gives the city a look I've never really seen in another movie. The bank scene is incredible.

Too bad that's as deep into the character as she managed to get. Al Pacino sleepwalked through this as he sleepwalked through so many roles, more or less playing the exact same guy with exactly the same gestures. Even putting the soap in the soap holder in the shower he's not in character. He's Al Pacino playing Al Pacino playing a crook. He stayed in this same role to sleepwalk through ""Insomnia."" Exact same guy. Same gestures to a T. Identical. How is that acting? Robert De Niro's love scene is simply unbelievable. It's preposterous! This guy has the sex appeal of an anvil. How a beautiful babe could get passionate about this lump of dirt is beyond me. Not only is he ugly but he's surly to boot. Did these guys mail their performances in or did they use a pay phone?

We would believe that an experienced fence would order the ""hit"" on DeNiro without researching his team, when DeNiro knows where the fence ""lives?""

It was not easy to decide to which character you feel more sympathy - I decided DeNiro, as he's so cool and played his best role since Taxi Driver. Also to be mentioned is Ashley Judd, who proves that she can be a great actress - her calm suffering and sympathy to the happening regarding her husband (Kilmer - who also surpriesd me, as I don't like him very much)was amazing to watch. When seeing this movie you cannot even move - it is filled with suspense, with a great action (Bankrobbery scene is a classic) and not a second to long.

That's how Michael Mann made sure that viewers grasp the city as a character too.

I had seen Thief, Collateral, and Miami Vice, and though they are decent films, especially Collateral, I'd never thought of Mann as a master of his craft. When one sees Heat, they see the work of an ingenious filmmaker. The script is perhaps one of the most brilliant contemporary screenplays, because Mann as the writer is so honest with his material and characters that everything plays as naturally as one could hope for. Nothing is contrived, even the most complex symbolisms and the clearest testaments to the characters. We feel like we may have before seen the cops-and-robbers chase film wherein the hero and villain bond, and who knows? Maybe we have. Little of that matters because Heat is so well done. There is so much more to it that can be found from viewing to viewing to viewing. De Niro's stern, wary bank robber and Pacino's fixed, passionate cop feel more throughout the story than just an interest in each other. The film isn't just about the complex and wholly realistic connection that they feel. It's also about the objective statements pertaining to the audience, as we view the lives, in action and at home, of both cops and criminals, and we see how despite occupation, family life depends on what is offered by that cop or that criminal and the outcome is according to those projections.",

Excluding an explosive, high-powered gunfight and a dramatic, suspenseful standoff of a finale, Heat is almost entirely interested in playing up tension and exploring character motivations. Its powerful cast is astoundingly well-rounded, with a complete lack of black-and-white personalities. Villains show their soft sides, heroes bare their dark underbellies, and in-betweeners continue to straddle the chasm between fates. Devoting the vast majority of its running time to the careful, calculated dance between law-saddled feds and their spooked targets, it applies the same flirty mentality to the inevitable rendezvous between the two big-name stars. It's a film that constantly teases its viewers with promises, only to yank them out of sight at the very last moment and resume playing hide-and-seek. That persistent devotion to delaying the shrapnel in favor of more character-building does result in a tremendous ensemble of players, and ultimately we care about the fate of every one of them.

'Manhunter (1986),' a solid and well-acted thriller, was tarnished by Mann's excessively ""trendy"" style, and a musical soundtrack that has kept the film perpetually trapped in the 1980s. More recently, 'Collateral (2004)' demonstrated a precise and balanced combination of style and substance, making excellent use of the digital Viper FilmStream Camera, perfect for capturing the low-key lighting of Mann's favoured night-time urban landscape. His follow-up, 'Miami Vice (2006),' was almost entirely devoid of substance, a meandering crime story redeemed only by a thrilling shoot-out in the final act. 'Heat (1995)' is among Mann's most lauded achievements, and I'm happy to say that it's probably the finest of the director's films I've seen so far. Most noted for being the first film in which Al Pacino and Robert De Niro shared the same screen (they were separated by decades in Coppola's 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'), 'Heat' is sizzling, action-packed drama.",

Pacino plays the hot shot ""Sonny Crocket-like"" cop on the hunt of a master thief and criminal, played by Robert DeNiro in a great plum of a role. Mann's film is interesting because like the classic 1980's drama, it shows both sides of the story. The cops and the robbers. It shows that outside of their work, there is more to life than busting people or killing people or money. DeNiro's Neil has nothing because he's never known anything but treachery and fear.

Everything about this film makes it jump off the screen. The film chronicles the lives of two men on opposite sides of the law. One is the dedicated detective Lt. Vincent Hanna, portrayed explosively by Al Pacino. On the other side is Neil McCauley, the calm, precise leader of a crew whose sole intention is to take down the biggest score.

He enthusiastically concurred. I realized at that moment where Generation X got their obsession with the goatee -- from Robert De Niro's character, Neil McCaulay. Almost everyone in this flick hands in a good performance, with one notable exception. Al Pacino's unsympathetic wife, Justine (played by actress Diane Venora), really spoils the movie for me and she unfortunately has the most prominent female role. I couldn't stand the same actress as Clint Eastwood's wife in that movie where he's a boozing, irresponsible newspaper reporter trying to save a wrongly convicted death row inmate from execution. In both flicks, she is a whiny, self-absorbed, thoroughly annoying broad. In reading the first few of the several hundred comments about ""Heat,"" I have yet to see anyone remark about the character, Waingro. Geez, what a scumbag. The actor who portrays this evil serial killer/sociopath (Kevin Gage) does so very convincingly. Right from the start, you see what a bastard he is as he almost casually executes the bank truck guard for no apparent reason, an act of senseless brutality which causes the deaths of other two guards, as well. Afterward, in the coffee shop, he downs a piece of apple pie, completely unaffected by what he just did. Those hard, squinting blue eyes just exude pure evil. This is most evident when he intimidates the young black prostitute he has just had sex with and is about to murder, and even more so when he advises money launderer Van Zandt that he's got ""some moves"" he can make that ought to help him get rid of De Niro's character, McCauley, who has threatened to kill him. Two women in this movie deserve special mention simply because they look so good in it --Ashley Judd as Chris's wife and Amy Breneman as Neil's girlfriend.

The cops are a fellowship of dedicated men led by a loser who is so determined to perfect his craft that he has destroyed his three marriages. He has no friends and the only person he does not shout at is the head of the robbers. The gang of robbers are all individuals. They are honest with each other but do not hesitate to murder a guard who saw too much. So who are the good guys and the bad guys? There is a set of characters who are REALLY bad. The women are all individuals with their own hopes and lives. None are cops. One wonders if the fellowship of the homicide squad would have deteriorated if one of their numbers had been a woman. Do not miss this film. I recommend you see it twice, the second time you can appreciate the characters and the events without worrying about what happens next.",

Mann I am charmed with Michael, he make movies that are excellent.Heat and The last of the Mohican's are the best works that Michael Mann has done. Infected with striking and unforgettable scenes like the scene of the shootout in the Street, the best action scene in cinema history, or the face-to-face one between Pacino and Of Niro. This movie is completely loaded of action through, supports his plaster to the sofa and does not leave you to go until the end. You cannot leave her, it is necessary to see her until the end and the ending is awesome. A timeless classic action movie and of course it is my fourth favorite film of all time.",
570,2 September 2002,cjenkinson,10, Brilliantly staged crime epic!!!,"'HEAT' has everything a crime thiller needs, and more. The pacing and style of this film, simply make it a cut above anything the genre's seen before. While watching 'HEAT' it's easy to see that the three main men involved (MICHAEL MANN- DIRECTOR, DE NIRO & PACINO) are all at the height of their powers! Mann's direction is pure genius. His use of the camera is subtle and classic, never resorting to flashy and unnecessary tricks. The plot structure and pace allows the the film to flow seamlessly from, nail biting tension to explosive action. The two lead roles (Pacino's obsessive cop and De Niro's clinical criminal) are so thoroughly characterized, that the audiences loyalties continually swing from one to the other. Michael Mann's masterpiece, in my opinion, is one of the top 10 films of the 90's!!! 10/10!!!",

Is it a collection of clichés; the thoughtful gangster and the cool police chef - not to forget all the beautiful women who share the role of the loving wife and girlfriend? Who are the characters that are introduced and suddenly disappear again? Why are we presented with the entire background of the cook/driver who dies within one minute? What is up with the daughter, that tries to kill herself, for no reason whatsoever? Michael Mann has no idea how to create sympathy for his characters, nor does he know how to convey emotions or give insight to the human psyche. The plot is yet endurable, compared to the filmic devices. The cuts are dreadful, unnecessary scenes are emphasized,important scene miss completely, the setting lacks design (Mr.Mann simply wanted to film L.A at night), the dialogue is grotesque and superficial - and does the role of Pacino have a dangerously high blood pressure or why is he permanently swearing and shouting like a prolet? The characters lack depth, especially their relationships are cliché-like and absolutely hollow. Cinematically, the film has no structure, it is a slap in the face. ",

575,16 October 2017,Richie-67-485852,10, Feel the Heat,"Heat is the pressure from the cops and of course of getting caught. If you live a simple honest life, the only heat you will get is from your oven or the sun. If a criminal, it never goes away thus this movie of professional take-down thieves who as Pacino (the cop) puts it will rock and roll on a dime. Most excellent entertainment for those that have to have their get a way heist, crime thriller tense drama flick fix. All the great actors strutting what they do best with a subject no less intriguing i.e. ill gotten gains. Once you start down this path of easy money, a rule of the Universe kicks in. Whatever you get into gets into you! Its like the old lays potato chip commercial where a guy pulls out of the Lays bag a perfect good-sized chip and says ""I bet you can't eat just one"". Same with crime or anything illegal or that we shouldn't do or have. Once you engage it, it engages too. Lots of human nature at work in this movie and it is true to life too. One interesting dynamic is the ""greed"" gene. When is enough well enough? The old we will never get caught or just one more never holds true. The funny thing about lying, cheating and stealing is that it works until you get caught. Getting caught ruins everything! LOL This is the type of movie you want for your DVD collection and it has so many memorable scenes that you don't tire from watching it. Another dynamic that visits with the viewer is the point made via hindsight in this movie. Both the characters and viewers see what could have done and should have been done but wasn't. The question remains as to why people don't listen to hindsight which is a clear convincing message as to how we did not know in the moment what we do. The real question is why don't we? Ponder that! Great movie to eat a meal with a tasty drink and a nice snack. Popcorn or sunflower or pumpkin seeds will do nicely to keep the fingers busy and the adrenaline under control. Now why doesn't Hollywood figure out by now as to what works and what doesn't? Enough talk! Feel the HEAT...now",

577,9 October 2004,A_Coprophiliac,10, Michael Mann in a candy store (Possible Spoilers),"This movie is excellent. If you don't like reviews that talk about how good movies are then go somewhere else. Let's get the whole Robert De Niro/ Al Pacino thing out the way first. Yes they both give terrific performances but it is near impossible to decide who gives the definitive performance. Al Pacino is on top form in all his Hoo-haa glory, chewing up almost every scene he's in. Robert De Niro also gives one of his best performances, so suitably subtle in the role of Neil. Both characters are driven by obsession, both professionals, both will not stop until the job is done. The character, I feel, that has the most depth is Neil. It is not enough just to get the job done but he feels it necessary to tie up all the loose ends as well, which is ultimately his downfall. He focuses on nothing but what he has to do like a laser beam on a specific point- witness his house, an unintentional post modern, empty, hollow space, much like Neil's life. He wants to have something in his life that can make sense and have meaning, and that's where Eady (Amy Brennemann) comes in. Of course, this doesn't end to well with Neil driven by his principles to leave her. Vincent (Pacino) also has depth but he is more aware of the things that drive him than Neil is of himself. He's your typical cop on the edge but with a twist, he's been married three times, a step daughter with problems (Natalie Portman) that favors him over her real father, again driven by an obsession to get his job done. Rather than waiting for help, he chases Neil through the streets of L.A. when a friend of his, Bosko (Ted Levine) is shot.",

And did somebody find such an intense suspense as the moment where Hana and his crew are peeing MacCauley and his fellows attempting to steal the platinum, especially when McCauley notice a little strange noise, did somebody find such a suspense in another movie??? I'm the kind of guy who prefers viewing 10 times the same good movie than 10 not-very-good different ones, I don't know how many times I viewed Heat but it seems to never bore me. And a thing I noticed : Mann knows how to prepare the action with some seemingly relaxed scenes, he mixes danger with love! A man and a woman looking at the city by night, from a high height, seem so little things floating in the air, we can feel the space, and the space between Hana and McCauley is sometimes decreasing, sometimes increasing, it's a fascinating way to show the work between hunter and prey, and when the prey becomes hunter the hunter feels that the enemy is really strong. It's like a chess game where each one can't come back against time, each one has to improvise the best answer, each one has to enhance his amount of information about the other, each one has an army under his command, one army is numerous but heavy to command, the other is a few but more quick.",

It also stars some good character actors like Val Kilmer, Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo and Jon Voight. The movie is set in LA and is about the lives of detective Vincent Hanna( Pacino) and thief Neil Mcauley (Deniro). It's not a typical fast- paced cat-and-mouse thriller. It spends time in developing characters. It tells you about the problems in the characters' lives. The performances are excellent. Everyone has done a terrific job. The best scene of the movie is the coffee shop scene where Hanna and Mcauley come face to face. The shootout scene was brilliantly executed. Michael Mann's writing and direction are superb.

A heist thriller starring two of the greatest actors of all time in Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, what more could you ask for? The film is about a thief Neil McCauley and his various acts of crime involving a team, which involves robbing banks and settling scores violently with enemies. On the other hand, Vincent Hanna is a detective that is endlessly hunting McCauley down. We get a wonderful game of cat and mouse and plenty of action to boot.

Now, after watching it almost a dozen times, I believe history may look at this movie as the best and most personal film of Michael Mann's career. The flaws are there, but this is an example of a movie so big and splendid that it is capable of gobbling up its own missteps (like Ashley Judd's performance). The style, while not overwrought, really brings Los Angeles to life. This is a sprawling movie with a sprawling cast that could easily suck if it weren't for Mann's obvious visual talent (Michael Bay of Bad Boys fame could take a page from the Mann book of cinematic style) and the great acting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. This film will always be in my ""top five.""",

Along with the two very strong leading performances, this crime drama also puts on display the terrific filmmaking abilities of Michael Mann, who manages to bring a great deal of passion and the feeling of sensation to the genre. The story is rather typical, but the unexpected emphasis on character development lifts the film, as interpersonal relationships are explored in a very compelling way. Although the film is perhaps a bit too long, and as a result feels slightly flat at times, it is carried by tremendous acting and ultimately does offer the audience a very solid ending. Heat succeeds in presenting the duality between the police and the criminals, while also providing the necessary action alongside it, which ultimately does differentiate the film from others in its genre.",

Often voted as the top two actors ever in television polls, these two men are like box-office gold dust. Therefore, when intensity genius Michael Mann decided to direct 1995's ""Heat"", he must have felt like he was on cloud number nine when they both agreed to starring roles. The notion of De Niro versus Pacino is an idea that fans drool over, and in ""Heat"" for the limited time they are on screen together, it works wonderfully.

Now I don't want to spoil it for you, but there's one scene in particular where you actually FEEL like you are THERE living in that moment.

It is delightful to see both ""Mafia- Godfather"" actors together. Here Pacino is a policeman while De Niro is a thief. The director, Michael Mann did very well when he left enough spaces for each of them in his own role to show his problems and feelings. Pacino is tough, but with good feelings, obviously always with the obsession to capture any guilty man, in this case De Niro, no matter how and when. De Niro is a criminal, but not a vulgar one, he has some literacy and is able to love a beautiful lady. The best scene of the film is the direct dialogue Pacino- De Niro had in a cafeteria and how both politely explain their intentions. The end of the film is a bit bias, nobody will try to make justice if he/she knows that police is behind you.

This is one of those rare movies which is virtually flaw free. The length is a bit excessive but not a minute is wasted and the running time is full of blazing action set pieces containing one of the best shootouts of all time but the human drama is jaw dropping. Every single character is developed. The film is incredibly powerful, with the ending being genuinely tear jerking and frequent emotionally intense scenes, but what's the show stopper? 2 men having a cup of coffee.",

Possibly my favourite of all time, Heat takes the viewer on a never less than enthralling trip into the world of the cop and the robber, the hunter and the hunted. I'm not going to go into the storyline suffice to say that Michael Mann has taken a tired and seemingly unoriginal genre and slapped it around until it resembles something altogether different. (But not that different obviously.) By giving as much of the film's focus over to the criminals as the cops trying to catch them, the film achieves an unparalleled level of authenticity with each side reacting to the others best attempts of capture/evasion being one of the films great strengths.",

Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro bring gravitas to the tired roles of the dedicated cop and worn out robber, their first and last meets are touching in a way. Jon Voigt also brings considerable depth to the performance. The best scene in the film is between Voigt and DeNiro, the two are conversing on the phone for the last time before DeNiro is to escape, the simple words they say and the meaning beneath them (set to Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing score) almost brought me to tears. Michael Mann is the best filmmaker working, and this is by far his best film.",
644,13 May 2023,robert3750,8, Well done crime drama,"Fine, tough, gritty crime drama, with well written dialogue and well shot and choreographed robbery scenes. Al Pacino as the Los Angeles police detective and Robert Deniro as the heist mastermind appear together for the first time. No one does tough, reserved, soft spoken, yet explosively violent characters better than Deniro, although I have to say he's never been convincing as anything else. Both play characters who are utterly dedicated to what they do, even at the expense of personal relationships. Both are very intelligent and experienced. The supporting cast is excellent, among them Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Danny Trejo. It's all especially interesting to me because I was living in southern California in the mid 90s, so I know what it felt like. The bank robbery shootout is very impressive visually and aurally. Michael Mann recorded real gunshots at a real location. No fake dubbing. My only criticism is that Pacino hams it up a bit much. He's fun to watch, though.",

Best scene in the movie is the restaurant scene with Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. Every MIchael Mann movie an individual has to wear Gray , Heat - DeNiro, Collateral- Cruise, Theif_ James Cann. it goes on. If you like a cast loaded movie , watch heat . Great acting both on the giving and receiving end , probably Pacino showed lots of compassion towards the subject, so did DeNiro but Pacino had better lines. Hank '' HOOOo pacino"" What are you a fu#@i*g owl.....",
647,22 August 2009,alek-kelly,9, Simply Fantastic,"Michael Mann understands character(s). This is why 'Heat' stands out as an original piece of work that can demonstrate to young writers and filmmakers on how important character is to a film. There is so much depth given to the two central characters that it may propel some to question its use in several scenes. Yet it is precisely why this film is effective in juxtaposing the parallels of good guy versus bad guy, highlighting how De Niro and Pacino's characters are identical though on opposite sides of the spectrum. Subtle dialogue and actions are incorporated early on in the film so we are able to determine that when the two finally do meet, well into the second act of the film, we have already established that they mirror each other. Thus when the dialogue flows, we are well aware of this observation and allow the scene to naturally flow without the need to reiterate this fact. Fantastic--fantastic--fantastic!!",

649,26 November 2003,DaveVdH,10, Probably still the best cop-villain saga ever made.,"I saw this film when he got released in 1996. I must say, it was the period where a lot of important films where made; such as Se7en, Usual Suspects, Underground, 12 Monkeys, etc, etc. Those films set the tone for a lot of other movies. There are a million things that can be said about this movie and I believe that others have said those million things through the years, repeatedly. I have recently seen the film again on a big screen and I must say that the film didn't loose his charisma. That is maybe the best compliment a movie can get. Despite 'Ali' (2001), I think that Michael Mann is truly a great director, and I am sure he won't disappoint us with 'Collateral' (2004).",
650,3 February 2007,anchorman360,9, It Was Alright,"""Heat is a crime thriller about a cop played by Pacino who tries to catch Robert De Nero as an expert thief. There is some action in it but overall there is lots of blah blah blah then a little excitement then some more blah blah. Several famous actors have parts such as Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner and several others. The movie runs for just less than three hours which is about 45 minutes too long in my opinion. When Michael Mann makes movies he has a tendency to make the film drag and run a lot longer than it should be and try and make up for it by putting a scene where there is a lot of action. In Heat there is a big shootout after a bank robbery but it takes forever to get to that point of the movie. So if you want to rent a big action movie that is really intense than just rent something else and just catch it on TV.",
651,2 December 2005,primepro25,10, Excellent,"One of the best crime saga movies ever made in film history. I mean even the director himself stated that it took him and his crew some time to plan the movie out and study the concept of criminals to start filming the picture. Michael Mann himself wrote this picture, he also hand picked the two main stars Pacino and Deniro. Two well known actors for their ability to study their characters and bring them to life on a screen. There are also lots of crime films as in scarface, the godfather trilogy, goodfellas, carlito's way, casino, blow, dead presidents, etc..... I can go forever. My point is that Heat is like the king to these movies....now wait...I know scarface and goodfellas and godfather is more classic but heat compares it's crimes to real life situations that happen now in days back then mobs and mafias are already old. What movie have you seen block a whole main street and start a bank robbery in public with full automatic weapons M-16s. Cops around the country have said Heat has been the most truthful movie to ever come close to the big screen.

654,1 January 2005,suspectfenster,10, Simply Incredible,Heat's plot can be best summarized when it is compared to a heated boxing match. There is no clear bad guy and good guy; both men certainly do not hold up to practical moral standards and both men are fighting for a justifiable cause.

Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are two of the greatest actors of all time and both have dynamic chemistry that is played out beautifully in what will go down as one of the greatest scenes ever filmed. The other star of this film is Los Angeles itself. The use of colour and architecture by Mann is brilliant and lends the city an almost haunted, souless landscape, which is mirrored by the characters. Alided with the production design by Neil Spisak, the cinematography by Dante Spinotti, and the score by Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Mann has made a film that surpasses every other cop movie in this genre and turned ""Heat"" into one of the greatest films ever made.

The amount of planning that went into this film is unbelievable: including the weapons training, the character development, and the casting. The atmosphere between De Niro and Pacino is electrifying, right down to the final scene. There is a real restaurant in Los Angeles where one day of the week police detectives sit down and eat together, and on a separate night, known ex-criminals have dinner in the same room. Michael Mann placed his actors(police with detectives, and bank heist crew with mobsters) in the same room to listen to their stories, to get a feel for their role, for their character. It is this type of preparation that makes Heat one of my most cherished films. I would highly recommend viewing the special features disc because of stories like these that further explain the expert craftsmanship of Heat.",

660,5 May 2019,PCT1970,9, Diner Scene,"This is Mann's best film and one of the greatest crime dramas to date. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score and acting. The entire cast delivers the goods. In particular De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer, Judd and Voight are superb. The buzz around this film was that it would be the first time that two icons of Hollywood, De Niro and Pacino would appear on screen at the same time and they don't disappoint. The plot revolves around master thief Neil McCauley and Lt. Hanna. Neil is trying to deal with the consequences of a heist gone wrong due to the actions of a last minute add on to his crew. He is trying to hunt down this rogue member who has gone off the grid while at the same time planning to pull off one last heist before retiring from his profession. He is also trying to simultaneously deal with issues occurring in the life of his most trusted member Chris Shererlis. While this is going on Lt. Hanna is on to Neil and his crew and is hell bent on taking him down. Lt. Hanna is also dealing with his own personal issues with his wife and stepdaughter. Neil and Lt. Hanna meet at a diner and over a cup of coffee make it very clear that they are the best at what they do and no matter what it comes down to one or the other is going to lose. This conversation creates a bond and mutual respect between the two but does not prevent either from going through with their plans and promise. The plot is clever, intense, violent, intelligent, thrilling, action packed and has a poetic ending. There are many memorable scenes in this film, none more mesmorizing than the diner scene. When Neil and Lt. Hanna claim to be the best at what they do, it is symbolic of De Niro and Pacino. There are also many memorable quotes such as Neil's, ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner"". This proves to be vital and crucial advice. This is an unparalleled film in it's genre and has yet to be surpassed at this time.",
661,21 March 2005,clerks2109-1,10, Mann+Pacino+De Niro= Heat,"First off I would like to say that Heat is one of the best drama films in a long time personally in that decade. Mann is a very talented man but all his films he made before heat were OK like Manhunter, The last of the Mohicans, Thief and his writing also in Miami Vice. I am not knocking him down and saying all the film before that were bad or not that good they where good and his writing has improved so much over his carrier its amazing. and his directing well thats been good to, But Heat is what I personally think is gonna to be one film a lot of people are gonna to remember him for I mean his screenplay was like a novel with a pulse the dialog was well written and the Chaterter Developmeant was beautiful I mean every person in that movie had everything in a chain circle and the way he made you have a felling towards Lt. Vincent Hanna (AL Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro)it wasn't like I was meant to favor one better then the other instead I learned what it was like to live both life's and what the Pro's and con's are.Now for Al Pacino this is one of his best movies after this His acting wasn't really that terrific granted he did a awesome job in Donnie Basco, and the Insider but man when he talked you knew he meant it when he was with his Wife, his co-workers, even with DE Niro stand in.I mean this man was on the ball and he knew how to deliver expression with the lines. Robert De Niro is an other actor who i think this was his last terrific film after this was what Analzie this and that give mean break When I saw De Niro come off that train in the intro I knew he meant business and he didn't have no born to lose tattoo to his chest. I mean his performance was right on the ball including when he talked to his pal's people and even Pacino's stand in. They were both solid actor's with a solid Script / Director. Let me tell you some what that one scene with De Niro and Pacino was like noting to describe it was perfect each person told about them self s and said to each other plain and simple this is what I do and this is how I plain to do it and nothing is going to come in my way no matter what. All and all this Movie is amazing and to see two actors come together in a film with plenty of other well know actors like Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Natile Portman and Tom Seizmore they where all awesome I mean what a great job they helped carry this film it wasn't just two actors it was the cast and crew and Mann who made everything alive.

Mann puts in a lot of work to make this film feel authentic and real, while also telling a compelling story. Showing the unique contrast AND similarities of the lives of cops and criminals. The writing also does a fantastic job of fleshing out the main characters, almost to the point where you want to see BOTH sides succeed. Heat's gritty, realistic feel comes mostly from fantastic use of location in the city of Los Angeles and immaculate sound design that still blows me away today. It's a truly tansportive movie that tosses you right in the middle of the action, and it's absolutely riveting. The action sequences in Heat are filled with both tension and raw fiery that will give you goose bumps and make you feel anxious at the same time, which makes Heat one of the most entertaining movies you will ever see.

The dry sound and the bullets are the only stuff that can balance the brilliance and fiery characterization of the cop and the thief. Also the gray mist of the filter to portray the city of asphalt that LA is. Where everything happens but life goes on. Contrary on the 80s movies with crime thematic, here there is no neon lights, no special crimes happening at evening with all that fancy nightlife, here is just gray concrete and dryness of the soul.",
668,5 June 2004,pswanson00,8, Almost great.,"This comes close to being a great film, but is stuck at being merely good. If it were re-edited to eliminate between 45 and 60 minutes of the touchy-feely relationship crap, its greatness would be complete. This is not the observation of a misogynist action-film maven -- romantic comedies are among my favorite films -- but of a movie lover who's upset by what appears to have been conscious insertion of structural flaws into the plot in order to appeal to a wider audience. The pacing of the action is wonderful until about an hour before the end. We then must digress into the personal lives of the central characters to see ""Awww, they do have relationships and lives outside of work."" We then get back to resolution of the film's primary conflict, and on to a satisfactory ending. This is not the film for that sort of thing, and it is flawed for that reason. It's still worth seeing, just leave the room about 2 hours in, make a sandwich, and return about 45 minutes later.",

671,23 August 2008,Crane_94,9, An excellent and intelligent movie,"The two leads, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are dynamite. Pacino and De Niro have played plenty of cops and criminals in their respective careers and this would have to be a major highlight in their impressive filmographies. Al Pacino portrays Vincent Hanna as an intelligent, tough, no-nonsense, obsessive and relentless yet flawed character. Vincent might be a highly decorated cop, but he is so consumed with his work, that it takes its toll on his personal life. He has been divorced at least twice, his daughter is messed up, and his third wife is ready to divorce him. It shows that his job as a cop is his entire life. He's not the type of person to sit around all day. Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley is more restrained than his other characters in the past (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear). Neil McCauley though a career criminal, isn't portrayed as such a bad guy. He is portrayed as a human being with a life. He too, has a personal life which is parallel with Vincent's. He is intelligent, precise, violent and private, though he is lonely and does not have any attachments in his life. The only friends he has are the other criminals he works with and the love interest in his life which plays a big part in the movie later.

680,22 May 2023,mjpiro,9, High Powered Cops and Robbers Action Happens in Heat!!,"Heat is one of the best cops and robbers movies to hit the silver screen in over the last seventy years!! Starring Al Pacino (The Godfather) as Lt. Vincent Hanna and Robert De Niro (The Godfather Part II) as Neil McCauley, Hanna plays a highly charged Los Angeles Lieutenant after McCauley, a cool criminal who - with his gang - has stolen a sizable amount of money from a downtown Los Angeles bank. Heat also stars ace actor Val Kilmer (Top Gun) as Chris Shiherlis, a member of McCauley's crew who is having problems at home with his wife Charlene played well by Ashley Judd (Where The Heart Is). Veteran actor the late Tom Sizemore (Major League) is also a part of McCauley's crew playing Michael Cheritto with fellow veteran actor Jon Voight (Transformers) performing as Nate, something of an overseer and advisor to McCauley and his crew. Heat really is about relationships and how all of the ""robbers"" relate to each other and work together to pull off all of the jobs that they do in this movie. In most ""cops and robbers"" movies you get just the action, the robbing of a bank and a shootout with the police but what director Michael Mann does differently in Heat is he delves into the relationships and psychology of many of the top robbers and top cop. It makes for a more compelling movie. Needless to say pitting two of the greatest actors of all-time against each other in Pacino and De Niro makes for outstanding film making!! Rarely on screen do you see the two together in movies in general, take the Godfather Part II for instance where they were in the same movie but De Niro's parts were part of a flashback. Pairing them together for this movie made for memorable filmmaking!! The action in Heat was outstanding!! The shootout at the bank was something that you would see out more in a war zone than at a normal bank robbing with all of the automatic weapons both sides were using!! The acting, by ALL ACTORS AND ACTRESSES was tremendous!! The direction by Michael Mann, bringing the two legends and all of the talent together to tell a compelling story was very good!! Mann also did a terrific job telling this story that kept you glued to your seats wanting more!! Elliot Goldenthal did a terrific job with the orchestral soundtrack part of which is still used from time to time setting up pieces for sporting events and the like!! Deborah L. Scott did a very good job costuming all of the different characters!! Heat received an R rating and is somewhat long at two hours and fifty minutes but goes by relatively quickly while watching!! Heat is not intended for those under 17. It gets my rare 9 out of 10 stars!!",
681,27 March 1999,vcsel,10, A clash of leaders,"This is not your typical cops & thieves story... Hanna (Pacino) and McCauley (deNiro) are two faces of the same coin as they set in a collision course. Like opponents in a live chess game, they like and respect each other even as their fight unravels. Each has his own devoted crew. They elicit respect and loyalty from them because they set the example by throwing themselves first in the line of fire and sacrificing their personal lives in the process. What for? you may ask. The answer is the excitement of the chase, more than the result: ""regular life? what the f*** is that? barbecues and ball games?"" is what McCauley despises most of all in the most dramatic encounter of the movie. Their rejection of ""regular life"" is what sets them apart from your ""regular fellow."" Whether you agree or not, you can't help but immerse yourself with them in their deadly game, and wish that you could achieve their detachment from the rest of the world, just for one second, in your own pursuits....

It uses characters to move the plot around instead of violence and you get to feel the pain of every character. The acting is superb, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are excellent, not their best performances though. The supporting cast is equally as impressive, great work by (a young) Natalie Portman, John Voight, William Finchter, Tom Sizemore, etc. Micheal Mann keeps the violence on a low level, there are only a couple of scenes in this movie that have shooting and they're extremely well done. The script is smart, each character has their own life, their own personality, and you can relate to some of them. The cinematography is amazing, though I can't picture LA being quite so dreamlike. The ending is satisfying, but sad as well. There is also the memorable bank robbing scene in this movie that is one of the best action sequences in cinematic history. The music is crisp and fits like a glove with the tone of the film, especially the end credits song by Moby. This film also teaches you about morals and crime, and how peoples actions can so easily dictate the rest of their lives.

Even if one scene was deleted, the movie would not have been as good as it was. Another criticism of the film is the ""weak"" ending.

It sees the first on-screen pairing of the legendary Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, and it was shamefully ignored at the Oscars that year. The film is so well made with such a superb Michael Mann atmosphere that it demands to be seen. It is nearly 3 hours long and yet the time flies by because the film has everything.

Pacino's over acting was even a little endearing. After that hour and 45 minutes of good it all goes to hell. These super star thieves pull a smash and grab of a bank. There's no way they'd be able to rip keys off a guy and open up a vault with millions. So they stuff that cash into duffle bags. Bags that big filled with money would weight like 200lbs. DeNiro is just tossing 2 around like it's nothing. Then somehow the detectives get on the scene first. They are sitting in a cop office somewhere, get some call and somehow make it before anyone else. They also make it there armed to the teeth and in broad day with thousands of people around get into a shoot out. And not just a shoot out, they are blasting indiscriminately everywhere. Full auto into a crowded street. One guy is letting loose with a shotty. There would be dead innocent bystanders littering the street. And of course you see one guy reload once. Like thousands of shots fired and one reload. A 30 round mag is dumped in under 3 seconds. Then we get to the best part. Dude picks up a kid as a hostage. Pacino takes aim and shoots him between the eyes. That's when I turned this piece of garbage off. Considering there's an hour left, I guess they get away? I don't know, it's not worth finishing.",

713,4 November 2021,michaelheiser-25099,5, Not great heist film,"Not great heist film. It was also responsible for real-life robberies that killed innocent people. The film centres around a 'crew' of thieves, in which the leader is seemingly Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley, as enforced when they stand around following the realisation that the police are onto them and each of them seem to look to McCauley for guidance: a blurry eyed Michael Cheritto (Sizemore) somewhat weakly exclaiming ""Whatever. I'm with you."" to McCauley when faced with a predicament that will either change his life or end it. The others are a gambling junkie named Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer) and a Mexican named Trejo, played by Danny Trejo. On the flip-side of the coin, Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna, a serial crew foiler, attempts to rid Los Angeles of McCauley's crew in taking them down. This is perhaps where the inspiration for the title of the 1989 version of the film derives; harking back to my earlier point, the title of this film: ""Heat"" derives more from the criminally minded of the two sides, in particular McCauley's ideology of walking out on anything and everything if you smell the police (heat) closing in.",

First the story,a group of professional thieves are forced to pull a big one after the last job went stale. Apart from them, the cops who are tracking them are on the constant move when their thieves make a move. Second, the character build up is by far the deepest of any movie I've seen. Al Pacino plays a detective who is struggling to keep his work out of his personal life. Robert De Niro is a thief who plays the cool and composed professional but yet is isolated from everyone else.

In listing the best movies ever (or favorite movies) no one will mention it.  Maybe people did not like how long it was (171 minutes is pretty long for this type of film).

The scene sequences in my opinion are still unmatched to this day (2014). When you watch a movie about good vs bad guys, the natural tendency is to root for the good guys.... That premise doesn't apply here. From the opening scene to the last, this was nothing but an adrenaline rush! The acting, writing & direction of this film was phenomenal! Every part worked. Most people avoid seeing a movie twice in the theater no matter how good it was, me included. This movie is still the only one I've watched twice on the big screen. The effect watching it the second time wasn't diminished. I rented the DVD when it came out thinking I'd have gotten over it...far from it! If you like action movies that carry a story well and doesn't waste precious minutes with empty filler scenes, then you have to watch this film. If only this film had been recorded in HD (which wasn't available back then), you'd been in awe nearly two decades later! easily among my top five films ever made.

However, just having spent 3 hours of my life watching the DVD, I'm somewhat surprised to report that story & characters are by far the weakest link in the movie. Like other reviewers have reported, the film is overly long, mainly because Michael Mann tries to cram way too much subplots in, none of which work since the characters are all tragically generic, the women especially. Also - and I always hate it when scripts do this - much is made of the supposed cleverness and intelligence of the Pacino and De Niro characters.

Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the best. I love them both. I find it impossible to take my eyes off the screen. I think the movie provides great character development of McCauley and Hannah who are basically the same but on different sides of the law. They both have the same drive and commitment in what they do. They will not stop until the job is done. Great supporting cast also. Even though I have seen it many times it never gets old. I believe because of the drama and intensity. The first time I saw it the ending was not what I expected. There are also comedic moments especially by Pacino. It is a must-see.,

Intricate plot details had to be caught in order to fully understand this movie. I fell in love with Chris (Val Kilmer) and his warm, dedicated love for the woman he loved. Robert De Niro enthralled me as Neil, he was sexy and strong, with an air of sophistication not usually associated with a cocky crook. Pacino was a ""spirit of the law"" cop that knew he had a job to do. ""Heat"" blurs the line of good guy/bad guy, yet continually instills a sense of right vs wrong through real life structure in the movie.

This film is known throughout the universe for having the largest cast of stars in history- you could play 6 degrees of Kevin Beacon with this alone! Yes, if you have a favourite actor or female actor you can be sure they pop up here somewhere. Let's have a closer look: We have Alfred Pachinko starring as a disgruntled cop on the hunt for disgruntled bank robber Robin DeNiro. DeNero has a gang of criminals under his claw; Valerie Kilmar with her lovely donkey tail, Tim Sizeless as a disgruntled fat man, Charlston Heston as a mob warlord, Ralph Lungren as a bodyguard, John Fought as a grizzly old something, Will Smith as the wise cracking kid from the hood, Dani Trey-Ho-Tep as a Mexican smuggler, Steve Busheemee as The Man With No Plan, the list goes on. DePesci wants out of the gangster life so he divorces his current femme foetal Charlotte Theron and chases weather girl Amy Bremmennemaneman. She is his one chance at freedom, but will the love of a gangster's life prove to much for him? Val Killman is married to Ashleigh Dudd and has a skinny daughter called Natalie Porter. He is always cheating on his wife though with a list of women and strippers played by the lies of Angelina Jolly, Nichole Kilmer, Hank Wazarea, Grace Jones, Mad Una, and in a shocking camero Kirsten Dunce. Al Pacman lives with his 'slow' brother Jimmy Depp and is getting divorced from his wife Diane Keaton. They have a suicidal daughter played by Amidala Portman. His police force consists of Paul Weller, Art Metro, Donald Sutherfield, Harrison Sierra, and Harvey Kitten. There are a few shoot outs and some excitement moments but mostly it's just talking and crying. I like films with lots of actions, and this is a film about cops and robbers so there should really be more shootings, cars flying over jumps, snakes in suitcases, poison darts, and pens that shoot fire etc. Plus it's at least 4 hours long, and as there are so many characters and actors double crossing each other I just got confused. This must be based on a Shakespeare novel or something. I am very upset at this.",

Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer are introduced as the bad guys, but can't be seen as such, while Al Pacino plays the good guy facing personal troubles. The acting is superb, the scenes are amazing, the feelings towards all the characters are intense and the movie only goes on to thrill and educate the watcher. The title of the movie is explained in the movie (you have to find what it is yourself). De Niro can't be anything less than a criminal who puts his business over everything in life, making him the man he has to be, while Pacino can't be anything less than the best Cop he could be.

751,25 August 2010,nazgulero_1,1, Top 10 Worst movies of all times candidate,"Awful. That is exactly what describes this film. I think the main problem with this movie is its desperate attempt to be meaningful, to be some sort of saga. It never is. Why ? Because it moves so slow, and because it is so predictable, and because many of the scenes are just so ridiculous and because the acting is at times so horrible. Imagine being around someone who is ALWAYS reflecting, and always melancholic, it makes you...run ! The lack of humor adds to the dark mood it creates, there is no one in this film to lighten things up. The bank robbery and subsequent shootout are breathtaking, due to really bad dialogue, incoherent action, and thousands of bullets flying without one hitting its target, and without the apparent need to reload. Of course detective Hanna manages to down one of the gangsters who, after apparently taking a head shot, but where is the blood, goes down slowly and controlled, probably because he has a hostage in his arms. The famous coffee scene...did anybody notice that McCauley uttered the exact same words earlier in the movie, in an earlier futile attempt to be meaningful ? Saying the exact same thing twice annihilates its effect. A lot of the violence simply does not make any sense, such as the prostitute being killed in the beginning, what is the point here ? There is something wrong with every single scene in this movie, it is either too slow, the cops are acting too stupid, the action is not credible, and the characters are simply never believable. The lesson to be learned: if you want to create depth, do not ever show it, but show the opposite. Heavy dialogue must be used only very very seldom, this increases its effect by a factor of one million.",

761,20 September 2008,amraampk,8, this film perhaps led to north Hollywood shootout,"Heat is a kind of film with multi star cast including AL pacino, Robert DE Niro, Val kilmer , Jon voight and many others. The movie shows a game of deception and competition between LAPD officers and group of crooks. The lead officer in pursuit is Al pacino and the gang is led by Robert DE Nero. Both the cop and criminal had quite a few things in common , they both have courage to fight not to give up till the end , they had perhaps unhappy childhood and some family problems. It was great combination of these 2 heavy weights of Hollywood , They had developed some respect and regard of each other. I liked one scene of pacino very much when he confronts the boy friend of his wife in home. That was ,,"" u can come to my home, u can eat my food, stay around here for some while, u can even f*** my wife(f*** my wife , its free of cost ,dont miss the golden opportunity, u re welcome) but u can never watch my t.v"". The most special , when the fire fight is started outside a bank which was being robbed by the bandits , the first shot is fired by val kilmer and then a very much realistic street gun battle , i never in any drama except war movies they are however are different story. This fire fight looked very much real like in front of ur own eyes. As a matter of fact national geographic presented a documentary about north Hollywood shootout in situation critical series. They show Larry Phillips and Emil mataserreanu rampage the streets with gun power towards L.A police and civilians. When the bandits are dead after a so much long gruesome battle, they searched the apartment of Larry Phillips , where they also found a copy of heat from his VCR. It was speculated that perhaps this fantasy took over the mind of both robbers coz there was incredible similarity between the movie and shootout. It had shown in the film as mentioned before and in the end that bandits even fought till the end , even they were ready to die and not to turn their back regardless whatever the odds are.

If there was ever a movie that you could call an ""Epic"" this is the movie. I don't think there has ever been a more realistic, enjoyable and smart cops and robbers flick. Just because Robert is the gangster in the movie, doesn't mean he is the ""bad"" guy. He is just doing what he needs to do to survive.. Pacino respects him, and knows that they don't get much better. I love the way this movie paces itself. It's like you are planning the heist with DeNiro. And it also puts you in the shoes of a cop. You get to go under cover with Pacino.

Took me 2 days but I finally finished it, and honestly it was the most predictable ending ever, so if you get bored it's okay to turn it off.
The cinematography is really cool, there are some beautiful shots. But other than that...
De Niro is an incredible actor, and it shows, it made his character the hero. Al Pacino's on the other hand was just annoying to me. Maybe it was intentional, but I didn't sympathize for his character at all.

Every time I watch this film I marvel at how well it has been made and I find something new in it each time. I can't think of one bad thing about this film.,
781,24 March 2000,Nebola,10, An Epic Tale of Crime and Obsession,"This is certainly the most impressive movie of this past 10 years.For once, a director take the time to develop the less important characters.The main ones are not the only interesting protagonists. This make this picture so unique, so epic. Michael Mann rules!",
782,10 May 2017,xenazues,10, If you are looking for a gangsta movie this ain't it,I rarely give 10 out of 10's on movies. I'm not even sure if the godfather got a 10 out of 10 on my review and that to me is the greatest movie. But there are a lot of gangsta movies out there and to be honest I love the godfather 1 and 2 but I also love casino and goodfellas (yeah im a mafia fan). ,
783,28 July 2000,sadcam,10, This is one of my all time favorite movies.,This is a classic story of crime from many different perspectives. This is the first time Deniro and Pacino appear on film together. They've been in the same movie before be never interacted with each other directly. The unbelievable shootouts and the emotional rollercoaster keeps you unbias until the very end.,
784,26 May 2000,bdeturck,10, Giant meets giant,"Finally, the two current best actors in the world meet each other. The confrontation De Niro - Pacino is wonderful: the scene in the highway coffee house is one of the most famous and exciting scenes in cinema history.",

786,24 November 2003,hefe-2,10, this movie is so underrated,"I consider Heat one of the most entertaining movies I have seen. It has never deserved the credit it deserves, for example here at imdb.com it sometimes makes it to the top 250, when in my opinion it should be at least in the top 100. Many people don't like this movie because of the length, its long but its because there are so many sub plots and the details are incredible.",
787,23 December 2003,ubercommando,9, Michael Mann is THE crime movie director of the last 20 years,"Mann wrote and directed a tv movie called ""LA Takedown"" in the early 1980's and for those people who don't like complexity, character developement and want straight A-B storytelling which doesn't challenge them, then see that version.  For those who like movies, of whatever genre, to challenge, dazzle, involve and intrigue, then plump for ""Heat"" in all its 3 hour glory. Mann is on top of his form in the crime genre; building up from ""Thief"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Camarena: The Drug Wars"" this is his magnum opus.  It's not enough that we have cop versus robber, this delves into the character's souls.  Pacino and DeNiro are men who want to connect with a partner, but ultimately are loners incapable of supressing their drive to make a relationship work.  Kilmer has a dysfunctional relationship, but ultimately his wife's loyalty wins through to save his life, Sizemore is portrayed as a family man (despite his criminal job) but is prepared to use a child as a hostage.  Everyone sacrifices something in this movie.  And what makes ""Heat"" a great movie is that a) it has an excellent script which is b) backed up by brilliant set pieces.  The gun battle has been talked about as one of the best ever in movies.  It's not just the action, or the amount of lead fired; it borders on documentary style photography and it uses sound brilliantly.  The shots echo off the buildings, giving the fight a sense of scale and depth.  I saw the film with an ex-army officer who said that was the most realistic depiction of a gun fight he'd ever seen on film.  But a review of ""Heat"" cannot go without mentioning the two stars.  For me, there are two moments which sum up why casting Pacino and DeNiro isn't for the headline value.  First is where the cops are staking out the bank at night whilst DeNiro's crew fiddle with the electronics.  A cop makes a noise in the surveillance van; DeNiro spins around and stares at the source of the noise.  Look at his eyes, it's chilling.  The second is the part where Pacino's team are lured to the docks, he realises that he's not the hunter, but the hunted.  Again, notice Pacino's eyes and his body language.  As for the bit in the cafe, I think it's clever that Mann never shows them together in the same shot.  Forget the conspiracy theory that the two actors hated each other and refused to be present on set with one another.  If Mann had showed us the two in the same shot, the audience would all be going ""whooo, look at them, two greatest method actors of their generation sitting together!""  Instead, we are drawn into the scene and we can concentrate better on the dialogue.",
788,9 July 2000,Mr. Rooney,10, Good stuff from Michael Mann,"A good crime thriller, with some excellent talent both behind the camera and in front of it.  Perhaps one of the only films which features both De Niro AND Pacino, and they actually interact here!  The only really gripe I have with the film is that there is very little chemistry between Brenneman and De Niro, but they seem to do their best anyhow.",
789,13 November 2000,"Dj""Erkki""",10," Beautiful, with very strong characters...","Great action, great acting, unforgettable music. I posted this just because was very touched by the music in the end after the shootout. And i finally found the song for it. Preformed by Moby, the song is called ""God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters"". It's glorious.",
790,30 December 2003,rojola,10, A superb movie!,"A superb movie with memorable performances by Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. Contains the best street shoot-out ever! The only thing I don't understand is why the director did not use this opportunity to get DeNiro and Pacino in more scenes together... two of the best actors of this time in one film and only a couple of scenes in which they are both seen at the same time... Well, never mind that! Just go see it! :-)",

793,31 October 2001,tofagerl,10, Am I sick for crying at the end?,"This a marvelous action film, as it combines some heavy-duty action scenes, with maximum realism (except maybe for the old machine-guns-who-never-run-out-of-ammo thing, but I'm so used to that I hardly react to it anymore.) and great work by both the director and camera people, with some actual in-depth views on the lives of both the 'good' guys and the 'bad' guys (represented mostly by Pacino and DeNiro respectively) portraying them both as something in between good and bad, yet making a clear distinction as to who we're supposed to be rooting for. And yet, we end up liking both characters, and I found myself actually hoping that DeNiro should get away free. And the end could really have been bad, I mean the whole film is a buildup to the final confrontation, but it was actually pretty OK. Sure, they could have done it better, but nine out of ten other directors/writers would have done it worse. There are of course a few things I really would have liked to see in this movie, but as it was already pushing at three hours, it's understandable that it stops where it does, even though it leaves more than one string of plot unfinished. Finally, yes - I cried at the end. It was the music, I'm a sucker for Moby ;)",
794,24 August 2006,tingnting,7, Good but not fantastic,"This ""De Niro Vs Pacino"" showdown could never possibly live up to the the hype surrounding such a movie. And this is basically the problem.

Al Pacino plays Los Angeles Homicide Detective Vincent Hanna, the man on the hunt for his prey. He has no social life, no time for his family, and no time for B.S. The man's sole purpose is to go after his prey, nothing more.",
796,4 March 2001,mastrunner,10, Humanity conveyed to film.,"The significance of Heat is not that it boasts, perhaps, the greatest shoot-out scene of all time, or that it was a big budget film with top quality effects, or that it had big name actors.  The significance of this film is in the original script written by Micheal Mann.  The characters are REAL people, not some exaggerated freaks or stereotypical one dimensional types.  The characters have good qualities, bad qualities, they do good things, bad things, and have flaws that we, as people in the REAL world, can relate to.  They do not suddenly change, but at the same time are dynamic in subtle ways.  They have distinctive characteristics which define who they are.  The nature of each is responsible for the best in each of them and is the source of their flaws.  These are flaws, which at the end of the day, cause them misery and are responsible for their self-destruction.",

It's very entertaining and action car chasing blah blah, Few days back. I downloaded ""HEAT"" I wanted to see a solid action movie.

801,24 June 2006,Solid-dave,10, a cop movie like no other you ever seen,"this is the movie where al pacino and robert de niro are at there best. both actors are guided by the vision of director Micheal mann. to me Micheal mann is a director that when it comes to action he shows it in a realistic way and not in a typical Hollywood kind of way. let's not forget the way he write's and shoots strong dialog scene's it's sometimes like looking at a battle of words,specially between de niro and pacino. i also like the way of how these two characters both live on different sides of the law yet they have the same kind problems with there personal life's. however one is a bank robber the other a cop but show a great respect for each other.that make's it a kind of hard for you to choose a side. the score in the movie is great and the music of moby makes it even better. in short if you like a cop movie this is the one!",

The movies has an amazing cinematography and of course great acting from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. This movie also had some amazing action scenes and i loved every single on of them.
I think my only issue with this film is probably the length. I felt like I could have given it a 10 if the movie was 20-30min shorter.
But this movie wasn't a waste of time and I enjoyed it!",
803,20 January 2007,FReese1,10," ""Heat"" is by far the best crime movie of all time!!","How could you ever go wrong with a movie pitting two of Americas greatest actors of all time against each other. Al Pacino plays L.A.P.D detective Vincint Hanna who is hunting down master thief Neil McCauley(Robert DeNiro) and his team before they can make their next heist. With an all-star cast built up of Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, and Tom Sizemore, ""Heat"" is a non-stop thrill ride filled with gun fights, explosions, and a great story line. It is also important not to forget the stars of those off camera. Written, produced, and directed by Michael Mann, ""Heat"" was the movie that truly placed Mann amongst the pack of greatest directors. With his devoted involvement to the film, ""Heat"" surpassed all viewers expectations for the first show down between Pacino and DeNiro. ",
804,29 March 2003,eugene5,10, Best example of an improvement of an own work,Heat is the remake of Michael Mann´s TV Movie LA Takedown. As I saw Heat the very first time in the cinema in 1996 here in Germany I was very surprised that I watch a movie where I know what happened next. But Heat is the perfection of LA Takedown. It has replaced Scott Plank / Michael Rooker with Al Pacino / Robert De Niro and this with the combination of the very good cuts of this movie is the secret of the success of this masterpiece from Michael Mann.,
805,5 August 2006,s_schatz,10, great movie,"One of my favorite movies of all time. I don't know who's better in this movie. Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro. If you asked me to choose, I'd be hard pressed to pick. They can both play 'bad guy' or 'good guy' equally well. And doesn't Pacino get a chance to act? At times, he's over the top! I love it when he gets a chance to do that! The scene with Hank Azaria in Vegas. Wow! No one does it better. DeNiro is cool & calm throughout, even though he's a hard core killer. The supporting cast is right on the money. The entire film is a work of art. The bank robbery scene lasts 12 minutes & the music is right on the money! I watch it over & over & never get tired of it. Diana Venora is so smooth as Vincent's wife. Her line in the bar about 'sifting through the detritus' is so cool. Overall, one of the best. Thanks Michael Mann.",
806,5 December 2010,stathisvoukelatos,7, What a great film!,"Michael Mann's Heat is literally a great movie.The movie is about a group -so to speak- of some men -who performs with high intelligent and technique very impressive robberies- which is being chased by the police.But more specifically it focuses on the personal relationship of the hunter and the hunted,the relationship of the ""chief"" of the gang Neil and the ""chief"" of the police department Vincent.This relationship is all about mutual respect but the two men are making it clear that they will not hesitate to pull the trigger if it is to choose ""me or you"".On one hand Neil is a very smart man but kind of lonely until he meets Eady and falls in love with her.On the other hand Neil is a very smart man too but his family condition has struck rock bottom.To cut the long story short,Heat is a marvelous movie,it has great plot,wonderful direction,everybody is superb on his role especially Pacino,De Niro and Kilmer on the roles of Vincent,Neil and Chris respectively and in general it is a great film!",

808,3 July 2001,scot_myles,10, Arguably Michael Mann's finest work of art!,"I could not believe how excelent this film was when I first saw it for the first time. It absolutely blew me away. Pacino and DeNiro are great together, and Mann assembled a fine cast of supporting actors such as Val Kilmer and Jon Voigt. The action scenes are unforgettable in their realism as Mann brought in Andy MacNab to be the technical advisor. You can really see the military influence in the combat scenes. But what really sells the movie is the story and script. If less intelligent than ""The Heist,"" it is much clearer and easier too understand and much better. Another great aspect is the fact that there really isn't a ""good guy"" or vilain. While DeNiro is supposed to be the bad guy, you find yourself wanting him to end with a good ending for him. While the very end of the movie may not be up to scratch and not really believable, it is very good and should not discourage people from seeing it. My recommendation is not is rent it, but buy it IMMEDIATELY!",
