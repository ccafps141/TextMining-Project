2,27 October 2004,Quinoa1984,10, an modern artistic triumph for all involved,"Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of ""little"" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind).

7,19 March 2004,JAKastner,9, The Moose Hole - Review of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love . If you haven't experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real 'love connection' per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can't be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is . utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.",/

10,19 September 2010,AlsExGal,10, Absolute power corrupts absolutely,"This film has both Jim Carrey and Kate Winsett playing roles that you are probably unaccustomed to seeing them in. Jim Carrey plays plain-vanilla introvert Joel and Winsett plays extroverted salesgirl Clementine who likes to express herself by dying her hair an odd combination of colors and dressing up potatoes like Barbie Dolls. At the time he meets Clementine, Joel is living with someone named Naomi that he mentions several times during the film in only positive terms as ""very nice"". Joel must be searching for something other than ""very nice"" since this doesn't prevent him from throwing over this woman that the audience never sees for the unpredictable unknown quantity, Clementine.

15,10 March 2011,Tweekums,8, An interesting sci-fi romance with a difference,"Usually when I sit down to watch a Jim Carrey film I end up getting a little irritated by his excessive gurning; thankfully there is none of that here. Carrey plays Joel Barish a man who decides to skip work one day and takes the train to Montauk where he takes a walk on the beach, later he meets Clementine, a girl with bright blue hair who he gets talking to on the way home. He offers to take her home and then something strange happens he goes to see her at the shop she works in and she acts as if she doesn't recognise him and later he is told that she has had all memories of him clinically erased! He goes to the clinic and after learning as much as they are free to tell him decides to have all memories of her erased too. Things then get rather complicated as he relives various moments in an apparently long relationship as they are deleted, during the procedure he realises that he doesn't want to forget her and tries to find a way of protecting at least one memory of her. Meanwhile the people erasing his memories are having their own problems; one of them is trying to seduce Clementine himself and while he is off the other loses Joel so must call in his boss which in tern leads to more secrets being exposed.",5

17,6 April 2004,DonFishies,10, Simply brilliant in all dimensions of the word,"I had no idea what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was about until the end of March. I had heard some small rumblings about it around the Internet for a few months, and also saw a few short TV trailers for it, but that was about it. Basically, all I knew was it was another dramatic Jim Carrey film, written by the same guy who wrote two of the weirdest and somehow great films to come out in a long time, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. But does this film succeed to be just as weird yet excellent as the other two? Or is it even better? A big yes on both counts would be highly appropriate.",/
18,20 October 2019,nicholls905-280-546911,10, Incredible,"Easily one of the best films from 2004. Kaufman and Gondry are at the height of their skills and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a highlight on their resume. Carrey carries incredible restraint here, but Winslet is one of a kind. Great film that deserved more attention.",?
19,29 December 2014,The-Sarkologist,9, To forget is not always the easiest solution,"It took me a little while to work this movie out because it was a little odd at the beginning. Okay, I knew it was about how a man (Joel) was having all memory of his ex-girlfriend (Clementine) erased from his memory, and that it is basically a love story in reverse, but as I said the beginning left me a little baffled. Basically Joel goes to the beach and meets Clementine and they begin to hit it off and after their first date he parks outside her house so she can get her toothbrush and some guy comes up to him and asks him what he is doing. Suddenly it jumps to a scene where he is driving home crying, and for a while I thought there was a sudden jump of two years to when they had broken up. When, later on in the movie, the scene where they first met was completely different to the opening scenes of the movie I was under the impression that there was a huge continually stuff up. However, how can a movie, with a huge continually stuff up, get a rating of over 8 on IMDb? Well, all is explained in the end.",r
20,15 February 2006,Hitchcoc,8, Real Food for Thought,"This is a real mind bender (no pun intended). I really liked the premise because it opens up great implications for us all. How far are we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the ""butterfly effect ""of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being ""forced"" back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture.",e
21,4 November 2019,acedj,8, Jim Carrey show a serious side,"This movie is a deep dark look at loss and regret, and the desire to forget forever the things that cause us deep emotional anguish. Jim and Kate play a couple that had a rough break up, despite the fact that they were deeply in love. Jim goes to a company that will come into your house, and while you sleep seek out and destroy painful memories. What makes this interesting, well there are many things that make this movie interesting, but what really stands out is the way that Jim's character struggles within himself to hold on to the memories he so wanted erased initially. This movie is a sobering look at the thing that makes us what we are, our choices and the pain or reward that they bring. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do a phenomenal job in this movie.",f
22,22 February 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9, You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story,"''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' is a big and strange name, but it matches perfectly this movie. I can say this is one of my favorite films at all, and one of the things that makes it so special to me, is the fact that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. Jim Carrey finally has a serious role and Kate Winslet is great as Clementine, the very extroverted girl with the most hair varieties you can imagine. (It is different from the British girl characters she is used to play)",_

24,22 January 2018,newyorkcine,10, Oh My Goodness,"This film is just SO GOOD. It is a masterpiece.
Original yet simple, Touching but not sappy.
It has no political agenda, It's just for you, human being.

25,17 September 2019,educallejero,10," So, you are telling me Romance movies can also be smart?","After the first 15 minutes I thought I was watching a lesser versión of ""Before Sunset"", with sci-fi touches.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
This is a masterpiece on every facet of cinema.
The story is complex, with an original structure and super natural and deep dialogue.
The acting from the protagonists was amazing (hard to believe this was the same actress that made Titanic, and even Jim Carrey disappears on the role, except for two or three moments). Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Dunst weren't that great (in smaller roles) and the rest of the cast was serviceable/good.
The score couldn't possibly be better (well, maybe it could've been, but it was still great).
This is an extremely romantic movie with sci fi touches that makes easier to get into the philosophical and existential themes they approach, all without losing anything in the entertainment department",t

Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned."" - Alexander Pope Is ignorance truly bliss? And if you could erase a person, what would the consequences be? ""Eternal Sunshine"" answers these questions, in a way that most Hollywood movies could not. Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have created one of the most original, touching, funny, and unique films of recent years. It explores the mind and the heart, deeper than other movies have dared to do.",_
27,12 December 2004,swestgat,10, Imagine.,"This movie gives us what we all secretly wish for-- a chance to forget something that's hurt us in the past. The viewer can almost live vicariously through the two dysfunctional characters that are remarkably just like ordinary people. The relationship problems are the same. The little fights and bickers are things we all can relate to. The acting was amazing- throughout the movie, I actually forgot that I was watching Mr. Ace Ventura himself. Carrey and Winslet pull off a great performance, both ditching the typecasts that they've been shackled with. Not only did the film give us the opportunity to see what it was like if painful memories were erased, but it also gave us the opportunity to see that everything deserves a second chance. The way it ends leaves the viewer to imagine how the characters' lives will end. The idealist may say that they lived happily ever after; the pessimist may say that they just reverted to disliking each other again. Either way, it leaves you to imagining your own ending; a characteristic many films leave out. Basically, this movie makes you think, ""What if...?"" It truly gives new meaning to the phrase ""You never know what you've got until it's gone.""",u

After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.",
32,31 March 2019,Keemshave,9, Thought provoking and Unique.,Not many films can combine serious dramatic elements and science fiction so seamlessly. The film will constantly having you guessing and will have you wondering where it is all leading. Not many films can manage to confuse you and fascinate you in such a way that keeps you thoroughly entertained. Carrey gives a career-best performance here and only proves his overall talent as an actor.,

35,29 October 2004,classicsoncall,10," ""Technically speaking, the procedure IS brain damage.""","After repeat viewings, it's still difficult to understand if this movie is brilliant or a director's simplistic mind game.

Because ultimately, we are our memories, and without them, we are merely shells.",
36,28 January 2022,jameszxcvbn,10," Movie that gets better as it ages, alongside with you","I stumbled upon this film early 2010s when I was still a high school student and remember thinking ""What a beautifully shot film"", without understanding much about the emotional message between the everlasting love story of two heartbroken lovers. This film is one of those films that I was come back to watch every once in a while to remind myself that there is still a relatable drama. Watching it in 2022 certainly has a different vibe to the film as I have aged leading up to the protagonist's age to understand the emotional turmoil which have been portrayed by the characters in the film. The film is certainly beautiful to convey the message of the everlasting of true love, even when the memories are wiped clean. It does this so well from the gloom acting in the start of the film (signifying the ending of their love story) to happiness in the ending (the very first moment of their encounter). Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet portrays their beautiful love story of when they first met to the devastation of a relationship. The director has focused on even the littlest things like the beeping sound effect, to when the books are becoming blank in the library scene to illustrate Jim's memories being erased. The soundtrack is very fitting and the one played at the very last memory of Jim and Kate in the beach house is very heartwrecking. I believe this is one of those film that gets better with age because the storyline is very relatable to many people who will be experiencing some sort of true love and heartbreak throughout their life. Hoping to come back to watching this film again and again to remind myself that there was a film that made me both happy and cry.",

38,22 November 2009,TOMNEL,10," Trippy, strange, but also very emotional and moving. This movie is perfectly balanced.","Jim Carrey is known for his roles in screwball comedies, and it seemed as there was no way to get an actual clean break off from his normal goofy persona. It may have seemed that way, but this movie proves otherwise. What we have here is a mature film, with some funny moments, but instead of a stupid Carrey performance, we have a deep and moving performance, in a very strange and original, but nonetheless deep and moving picture.

39,11 December 2005,alexhayes,10, A difficult film to watch,"There's absolutely no way I can write about this film without a spoiler, as I think, judging from the comments written up on this site, many seem to have difficulty following the plot. As a general guide, if you're having difficulty following the chronological order of the scenes, it's necessary to follow the changes in color of Clementine's (Kate Winslet) hair. It starts off green, then changes to orange and finally finishes up blue. In the film though, it starts off blue, then goes to orange (the predominant color), then green and then back to blue.",

43,2 October 2022,DoubleMaitre,10," This may not be the best movie ever made, but it is my favorite","It is still a mystery to me how Kaufman was able to capture and communicate emotions at such an unbelievable depth using basic ingredients: a camera, actors, a script and a soundtrack. Although not everything this movie has to say is said out loud - or even implied.",
44,8 September 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Truly beautiful and surreal,"Wow... this had me spellbound. Deep, intimate piece. If one wasn't already convinced that Jim Carrey is an actor, not just a comedian, one would be so after taking this in. Winslet does incredible, as well(and both are playing against type), as does everyone else that I can think of(Dunst also impressed me). You have to pay attention during this, and a second viewing may help, but it's not so abstract and loose that it's difficult to understand. This is the third work of Charlie Kaufman's that I've seen(the other two are Being John Malkovich and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), and by far my favorite. Anyone who has ever loved can relate to this. I can't promise it'll be pleasant, in fact, it's possible that it won't, but this is absolutely absorbing. This is mature, smart and does not try to distance itself, or its audience, from the subject matter. I haven't seen any other work by Gondry, but he directs this magnificently. Masterful visuals, and somehow apparently with little to no CGI. The editing and camera-work are excellent. Story-telling and characterization are of such high quality that I'm not sure words can do them justice. The ambiguity of the final moments is perfect. All of the special effects are amazing. The movie pulls you in, it is thoroughly engaging throughout. I'm not sure any viewer can avoid being affected by this. You may not recognize every scene as something from your own life, but the feelings, the impressions... they're universal. I don't remember when I've last been this into a big screen experience. Anyone who can watch films that are personal, and emotionally powerful should consider this. There is some strong language and sexual content, as well as drug references and the like. The DVD holds two featurettes, one of which I will review on its own page here on the site, interesting deleted scenes, a fake commercial, a music video, and an informative commentary track with the Michel and writer Charlie Kaufman, all of them also well worth your time. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a relationship, and who don't need their cinematic experiences spoon-fed. 10/10",

However over the years watching films I've noticed there seems to be that one film that is hugely popular, but when you sit down to watch it, you can't understand why it's held in such high regard.

49,22 January 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6, 2 stellar performances lost in the script,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" may be a contender for most pretentious movie title of all time, but at least the film is not as bad. Actually, it has a couple good moments and Kate Winslet delivers a serious contender for career-best performance. Nice to see her nominated for an Oscar here. Jim Carrey is not on the same level, but still very good and it would have been nice to see him nominated too. For anything. What a joke the Academy has still not nominated him for his many great performances. Unfortunately, this is also almost all positive I can say. The film was directed by Michel Gondry and also written by him together with Charlie Kaufman. The duo won an Oscar for the film's script. I certainly prefer Gondry's ""L'écume des jours"".",

What is that neverending partying scene in Joel's bedroom? Are we supposed to laugh at that? What about Joel's interaction with the memories of Clementine and taking advices from them? Nonsense over nonsense... The movie could have been much better, had the screenwriter made a better research about the unconscious mind and the director introduced less agitation. All of 6 points are for Jim Carrey.",
52,21 May 2012,nickmesafilms,9," Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) - Don't Erase my Memory, Please!","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of the many masterpieces that proves why we all love film in the first place. Directed by French director Michel Gondry, and written by accomplished filmmaker Charlie Kaufman, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is equal part romantic comedy, psychological thriller, science-fiction, and non-linear narrative. Taking a break from comedy, the film stars Jim Carrey in a more dramatic performance as a man who volunteers to erase every single memory of him and his ex-girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, whom coincidentally has already done the same thing. The film then takes us on a wonderful and imaginative journey through this one man's mind, as he tries to fight against those who try to steal his memories away, while at the same time, trying to fight for the woman he loves. First-time director Michel Gondry makes his second directorial debut in such a stylish fashion. He perfectly guides the movie with enough clever execution and brilliant uniqueness. Writer Charlie Kaufman has written such a beautiful script that contains witty humor, sharp characters, and true dialouge, which was able to win him a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. Besides Carrey and Winslet, this remarkable cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson, all bringing such memorable performances on screen. But it's the romantic relationship between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet that carries the movie, and their adventures into trying to keep their memories together from falling apart. Jim Carrey may be more noticeable in more comedic-driven films, but he still provides great dramatic performances, and this is one of those movies that shows how great an actor he is. But, Kate Winslet is the scene-stealer, as the light-hearted, charismatic girlfriend, with a different choice of hair color in nearly every scene. It doesn't matter what role you give to Kate Winslet, because no matter what, she will still be awesome in the role! This movie also provides some of the beautiful uses of imagery that I have seen in a while. In a usual Charlie Kaufman movie, something weird always has to happen. Accompanied with a memorable soundtrack, beautiful effects, and stylish editing, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is pure filmmaking at it's finest. Although there were some characters that kind of got me annoyed, especially Elijah Wood's character, who seems sort of lost into his given performance. It was just a few moments where the movie loses a bit of it's magic. But, that doesn't hurt the movie's momentum, though! Those flaws are out-shined by how beautiful this movie has been made to look. This is probably one of my favorite movies, and it will definitely be a memorable one, as well. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", in my review, ""a magical romance, fantastically well-made film"".",

56,13 July 2005,jboothmillard,7, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"The first time I saw it I was pretty confused, but seeing it again I can almost understand the plot. Basically Joel Barish (another more serious role for BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey) wakes up with no memory of the night before, and his car scratched. He skips work and heads to the shore, and as he travels he keeps seeing Clementine (no jokes, e.g. Huckleberry Hound's ""Oh My Darling, Clementine"") Kruczynski (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet). First she is asking if they know each other, then they lie together on the thick ice of a lake, and then all of the sudden it cuts to Joel upset because of their split. He finds out that she went to Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and had all memories of Joel erased from her memory, so he follows her. As his memories are erased, his mind rediscovers past passions, and he almost tries to escape the procedure. Meanwhile, out of Joel's mind, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) is carrying out the erasure, while his partner Patrick (Elijah Wood, after the last Lord of the Rings) is trying to create a relationship with the now Joel-memory erased Clementine using Joel's stuff. Stan is also trying to continue his relationship with co-worker Mary (Kirsten Dunst), but she finds out that she had memories of a passion with Dr. Howard erased. When the erasure is complete, you find out the segments at the beginning was after the procedure, so Joel and Clementine pretty much start their passion all over again, even after Mary gives them back their opinion chats of each other back. Also starring Jane Adams as Carrie and Scary Movie 2's David Cross as Rob. It might be complicated inside Carrey's mind, but it is a very inventive story about how memories can construct our minds. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and the David Lean Award for Direction for music video director Michel Gondry, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay.

This movie, which is a purveyor of many Molotov Mardi Gras emotions, authenticates an equivocal potpourri of ideas that are indicative of numerous independent production company films!! This movie also bears a striking similarity to Elia Kazan's intensity to itemize belligerent confrontation!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is sort of a counter culture version of the film ""The Arrangement"". Many films that are run of the mill mainstream Hollywood movies immediately hack out a succinct and concise mindset of everyone of the major character's feelings. In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to say that Joel's (Jim Carey) feelings were introverted, would be a paramount utterance of understatement!! Joel's relationship with Clementine,( a name we associate with a folklore about loving regrets, also, with a particular type of orange) evokes a vivid presentation which signifies an emotional diligence. The illogical transition to their pursuing ideas and trepidations compound an inexplicably and unnecessary intransigence for both of them!! The ephemeral activities in this film perpetuate a cerebral anguish which becomes the heinous culprit to Joel and Clementine's difficulty to adequately dissect their conceptions about one another!! I could see this film 100 times and still not capture every intricate detail to it!! Set in a New York City neighborhood, it depicts a realism about imperfection being ubiquitous in all of the character's lives!! This movie had a foreign flare to it as well!! In fact, I initially thought this film took place in Montreal... After viewing a couple of scenes, I, of course, blew that contention out the window!! My first clue was when I saw the New York License plates on every single one of the cars!! Jim Carey is FABULOUS!! in this movie!! Originally known as the box office star of copious high profit zany comedies, his enormous popularity garnered an auspicious association with the light hearted!! In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", his role was very serious and complex!! Think about it though, if someone were to handwrite a silly comedy, and then, all of a sudden, he was required to change this screenplay to a serious drama, it would be a case of simply needing to borrow someone's erasure for no more than 18 seconds!! Kate Winslet is superb in this film as well!! I did not even know she was British!! When the acting in a movie is so excellent, it almost appears as though the writers and directors of the film are getting paid only about a buck above minimum wage!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a remarkable movie, and is considered to be one of the best films ever made according to this website!! The step by step thought process to this film puts this movie in a category all by itself!! Marvelous flick!! Focus Productions always gives way to the unorthodox, perhaps you as a movie viewer should try doing the very same thing once in awhile too!! FIVE STARS!!!! ABSOLUTELY!!",
61,4 April 2022,AfricanBro,7," ""Some things you just can't forget... until now""","I watched this a long while ago and never wrote down what I thought about it, but it holds a special place in my heart. The type of movies that make you believe in love. It's so unique and original, and even though I rated it I think it's one were you either love it or hate it. Imagine a world where you could forget all your traumatic experiences; someone shatters your heart into pieces so you just erase them completely, move past it. You never have to heal. But what if the person who hurt you also happens to be the love of your life? Joel erases Clementine from his memory and realizes this, he fights his fading memories because even though he was hurt, he still loved. It's a beautiful because it's a representation of human emotion on screen, and that's complex, it makes the movie more than just about love. The dialogues also amazing, as his memories fade he decides to stop fighting it and instead enjoy all the mements with her he's reliving for the last time and I feel like there's something to be learned from that because he had something special, it hurt him in the end but that's no reason to forget about it. It was once beautiful so just because it ended in pain doesn't mean it's not worth remembering. It's as emotionally draining as it is beautiful. It's a movie where sci-fi meets romance, giving stunning visuals a beatiful story to tell(It might not seem so stunning to look at now considering things like cgi are more advanced now but in 2004). And because we live through Joel's memories and the timelines nonlinear it all feels like a personal dream, and to exhibit something so chimerical and personal onto the screen is stunning art to me.",

I wish it had come out later in the year so Kate Winslet would have won the Oscar she so dearly deserves. One of the reasons I loved this movie was because of the wonderful role reversal. Jim Carrey, whose comic performances have been lauded and dramatic roles almost universally reviled by critics, is superb as the normal, every-man Joel. Kate, who almost always plays the uptight proper lady, is hilarious and heartbreakingly too real as the quirky, emotionally disturbed Clementine.

Like the rest of Kaufman's self-absorbed hallucinations, Eternal Sunshine fails to jump the ""who cares"" hurdle. What an overwrought mess of a movie. As far as that mind-surgery-memory-deleting helmet goes, why in tarnation was Jim Carrey's character--a self-described uninteresting bore--so very talented at resisting the program? No mental giant, he would have succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film. Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang of assistants who are giggling morons. What a sad, confused, irrelevant film. I was reminded more than once of the forgotten French mind-game films of the sixties. Marienbad, anyone?",

71,23 September 2017,nzswanny,10," An emotional, dream-like movie that never feels excessively soppy with an incredibly subtle performance by Jim Carrey.","When people ask other people what Jim Carrey's best acting performance is, people usually light up and say, ""The Truman Show!"" Although I would say that he gave a good performance in The Truman Show, in my opinion I think that he gives a much better performance in this movie, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Although this opinion definitely isn't everyone's, I think that this is Jim Carrey's best performance because he goes out of his daily routine as an actor that works in comedy and stand-up and usually he acts in his films with the same personality which is undeniably a humorous one. But with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey goes out of his routine and gives us a subtle, grief-causing performance that is entirely the opposite of his usual personality and yet it still feels natural as if it were his usual personality. In this film I saw a lot of serious acting talent shine through him that I had never seen him show before and if you're like me and enjoy seeing actors be in a different, unusual personality that they usually aren't in I think you'll enjoy this too.",

The main idea, in spite of not being bad, is not completely original and the way the plot was developed was not the best. I think it turned too much melancholic, repetitive, and too centred in this night of the ""erasing memory"" process The ""surrealism"" of this movie can only be connected to the mentioned process itself or to some weird settings that appear in some scenes of the film, since I don't think it's a ""traditional surreal"" story.

74,19 July 2013,StoryCharts,10, Love as Fate and Willing Acceptance,"ETERNAL SUNSHINE's narrative is essentially a love story told backwards. It deals with the traditional problem of reverse narrative in a new way. The traditional problem is that if the audience already knows the ending (bitter breakup), then telling the story in reverse asks the audience the question of ""is it worth it?"" as we watch the story back to the beginning (falling in love). This intellectualizes the experience rather than giving us dramatic action. ETERNAL SUNSHINE deals with this problem of intellectualization by giving the protagonist an active role in the reverse narrative. Joel is able to interact with his old memories to try to stop the process of erasing; this attempt to escape is the major sub- plot of the film. The catharsis of the audience comes with his rediscovery of his love for Clementine as they try to escape together. They fail to escape at the climax of this sub-plot and his memory is erased. But the lovers meet again by fate and once again fall in love. This fake climax of the main love-story plot is placed at the beginning of the film and again at the end of the film – the audience realizes the despite losing all their memory, the lovers meet and fall in love again. If the film ended there, it would have been a good film, and the central idea would have been ""Love happens because of fate"". But the problem would have been that Joel went through this huge journey of discovery and change but that all seems to go to waste if fate was just going to put them together again – he needs to be the one making an active choice that demonstrates his internal change at climax. The real climax of ETERNAL SUNSHINE comes out of the reversal at the end, in which the Joel and Clementine discover their bitter past and must choose whether or not to commit despite their past. This resurfaces Joel's inner journey. He and she choose to commit, completing Joel's journey of internal change with an external action. The central idea now becomes ""Love happens because of fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love"". This real climax fueled by true character change, dilemma and choice is what makes the film great. The climax completes the audience catharsis experienced through Joel's rediscovery of love; as a result he wins the girl and we are touched by a great story.",

97,25 May 2004,django-1,3, clever but shallow and pretentious film-school exercise,"Ten minutes into ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, it was clear that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has a limited bag of tricks. What was clever in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH the first time I saw it became pretentious during the second viewing and insufferable during the third viewing. ADAPTATION was a similarly too-clever pretentious exercise in modernist style with no substance. ETERNAL SUNSHINE mines the same vein, but this time around the results are about as substantial as cotton candy and as permanent as a fireworks display. Except for the cutesy plot device--which was refreshing decades ago when handled by the likes of a Godard or a Philip K. Dick or a Harold Pinter--the film is like a second-string Woody Allen project fed into a blender (or rewritten by Donald Barthelme). The ""insights"" about relationships in this film are, as one critic aptly described it, about as profound as those in a Hugh Grant movie. And as ""experimental"" as Kaufman may think he is being, the plot is as predictable as that of any b-movie, once one figures out the premise of the story (which the slowest audience member will do in about 20 minutes). And what's the point of the murky faux-cinema-verite visual style in many scenes? The three points out of ten I awarded this film are primarily for the actors, Jim Carrey in particular. When will the Hollywood establishment and the critics finally learn that Kaufman is a one-trick-pony? The emperor is not wearing any clothes here. As someone who has championed and supported TRUE avant-garde filmmaking for decades, I see this as a cheap Hollywood pastiche of the avant garde. Those who found John Sayles' LONE STAR to be ""multi-layered"" instead of cliche-ridden will find much to praise and discuss in ETERNAL SUNSHINE. While Kaufman is not as bad as P.T. Anderson (at least Mr. Kaufman manages to honor traditional story structures while re-fashioning them, and at least he can create REAL if shallow characters, something Anderson hasn't learned to do), my evening would have been better spent watching a straight-to-video action film or some obsscure 1950s Allied Artists post-noir crime film.

Jim Carry has never been better and probably should have been nominated for an Oscar. Kate Winslet is completely superb. Those moments are strong and enjoyable and decently directed.

104,26 February 2020,christoph_ascher,10, Just perfect. A truthful film about relationships.,"A very insightful story about relationships. Are they really that hard? The answer is: Yes, that's what relationships are like. You do remember how you met and why you fell in love. All the happy memories are there. But then, there is also all that other stuff. The things you start to hate about each other. The unrepairable mistakes you made. The regrets. And at some times they end up on top, covering up the foundation of good things, the common ground, the reason why you started to build up the relationship together.
""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" has an absolutely fascinating way of depicting that mechanism. Funnily, it starts with a Valentine's Day reference in the opening scene. That is to say: This movie is going to be in strong contrast with the banality of Valentine's Day greeting cards. Valentine's Day celebrates naive, young love, love that is confident because it is oblivious. In the climax scene the movie contrasts the protagonists' (and our own) wish for a happy end with the tape recordings of both ex lovers spelling out each other's most repelling qualities and the reasons why they crave for the relationship to be wiped off their memories. The movie is about love an still is the contrary of Valentine's Day banality: It celebrates love, conscious and aware of the problems and backdrops. It admits: Maybe you get through it together, maybe you don't.",

Some of the scenes seemed either badly acted or badly written, or both. The scene when Joel first met Clementine on the train seemed like it was written by middle school wannabe writers.

The film spends most of its run time flashing to and fro between a romantically involved couple's happy days and a sort of lame white out job of their memories of each other. The upside to this flick is its solid cast and remarkable public and critical approval. The downside is it's an ill focused, pathos drenched mess with peripheral nonsense which detracts from the core theme making the ""buy-in"" difficult.

118,26 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind takes the romantic genre and injects a quirky sci-fi concept right into the heart.,"Over the years this has developed massive acclaim and a cult following, with many stating it's one of the best romance stories available. Whilst I do not slot into that following, I can appreciate the admiration that viewers give this. Joel falls in love with Clementine, they are complete opposites but are attracted to each other's qualities. Her impulsive nature does not always sit well with Joel, and suddenly the two have each other erased from their minds through a specialist company that deals with this procedure. Halfway through the process, Joel changes his mind and must attempt to savour his last memories of her. Concept aside, what separates this from other similar films is the editing and overall creative environment. One minute they are in a library, only to transition outside on a frozen lake. Inside a cosy lounge? Don't worry, rain will start to pour down. It reflects how the mind works. The scattered nature of the narrative, consistently switching from scene to scene, resembles our brains and how memories are mapped. There is no linear path to memories, when you think of something nostalgically you then suddenly think of something else. You may find this jarring and slightly confusing, but it works. It's an intriguing concept that is thoroughly explored both in technique and the moral implications. We even have subplots regarding the team who are leading the memory erasing process. I do find this detracts from the focus on Joel and Clementine which is the more important element to the film. Having said that, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have ample amount of screen time. Both playing roles that they do not typically perform, yet the chemistry felt real. At no point was I thinking ""this feels like typical Hollywood fabricated romance"". The indie feel of the film allows the filmmakers to explore themes of memories and the mind without tarnishing the central romance. A creative and intriguing drama.",

And anyway, the SF treatment is administered by Tom Wilkinson, who never disappoints. Speaking of actors, the ever brilliant Kate Winslet is at the top of her game here. It's so easy to go over the top when you're playing the crazy one and just take us into zany land and leave reality behind, but the story demands that she keeps it more real and she exercises such exquisite control. I wonder how Jim Carrey would have played that role! Don't get me wrong, he's fantastic too here as the more down-to-earth one - probably his best performance that I've seen and a clever bit of casting. Wait, I've got an odd feeling in my gut.

The film gets kudos for being clever and quirky and well-filmed, in a Being John Malkovich kind of way. Clever, quirky, but there's a spiritual barrenness underlying it. Shouldn't art be more than clever? Shouldn't it reach deeper? Limericks are clever  we don't call them art. The underlying message in Eternal Sunshine isn't all that original.

It is unfortunate that two fine performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Wislet were wasted in this film. The best scene was their initial meeting where we actually saw a believable and interesting relationship unfold. In the combination of Winslet's quirky character and the mild-mannered Carrey, I was reminded of a much superior film and screenplay in ""The Sterile Cuckoo."" With the outstanding dialogue and unforgettable performance of Liza Minnelli, the film actually shed light on human relationships and the emotional pain of breakups.

Eternal Sunshine is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us  to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works? ",

When the film finished I wasn't sure if I wanted to sit down and write an essay on the failings of my life or sprint out the front door on a mission to find true love. Often times I watch a film for the director or the stars, for Charlie Kaufman I go solely based off of the fact he's the writer. Kaufman could write a film filled starring only crippled seals, directed by a goat and still the weirdest thing would be his story. He manages to take these crazy concepts though and somehow takes them into some of the most emotional, heartfelt places a film can go. You see yourself in his screenplays in a way that sometimes makes you uncomfortable but is more honest and holds more truth than any other writer has managed. Charlie Kaufman is a god when it comes to writing.",

I can't say I've seen a romance movie anything like it but my heart was torn at by Joel and Clementines relationship. So often we desperately grasp for the love we've felt in the past and I've never seen that feeling so honestly depicted in a film. It's heartbreaking to see Joel have his world, a world of the past, ripped away from him. All the memories first bitter than pleasant have had a profound effect, yet in a rash decision such a substantial part of life can be taken away. What is truly profound about this film is how impactful our partners can be whether or not things work out for the better. The film's ending really makes you think about whether or not our relationships would work if given a second chance. There's no way to know, but there's something beautiful about the journey in Joel's mind through his relationship. We forget how often take for granted the memories we've had with our past lovers. Rarely does a film depict romance in a unique and personal way which stings even after you view it. Don't watch this film unless you're ready for an emotional burden, but if romance is something you value, this might resonate in a way which truly feel like a painful yet profound punch in the gut...",
154,21 March 2004,gsfword,1, I wanted to like this movie but just couldn't.,"Despite my desire to enjoy what I hoped would be a unique film, I found it dark and self indulgent.  The superb acting couldn't overcome a script that is centered on a failed relationship that never makes sense to the viewer or to the lovers.  In the end you feel like this is ""Adaptation II"" - yet another film about a brooding self-centered guy who can't really relate to anyone beyond his own fantasy life.  The dramatic device ultimately used in the film of having the main character fight to preserve his memory fails because it comes across as a clever but unsatisfying rendition of psychotherapy.  The subplot is banal and adolescent.  In many ways this entire film comes across as something that was done back in the 60's, but which now falls flat.",

And I have to say the hype is well deserved.
The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind centers around an estranged couple's decisions to erase their respective memories of each other. this movie has a very unique/surreal approach of arranging sequences, with the bulk of the plot unraveling in a dreamlike state, which is a considerable divergence away from Jim Carrey's previous slapstick efforts. We see him reflecting on his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) in an almost melancholy undertone. He proved yet again, after his stellar performance in The Truman Show, his acting talents, as well as The Academy's biases against comedians.
That being said, this movie is far from perfection. For me the subplot of Kristen Dunst and Tom Wilkinson could be further explored, as it accords with the theme of this movie. And the placement of the opening sequence may be a tad questionable. But who cares? at the end of the day The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind is without a doubt one of Jim Carrey's finest works and will be remembered and revered for years to come.",

167,25 June 2020,aaronstpwilson,10, A True Masterpiece!,"To truly understand and appreciate this movie, you have to first understand the quote from which the title of the film originates. The film's essence is perfectly encapsulated by one of the quotes stated during its third act: ""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" Now before dissecting the quote, it is important to keep in mind that the film employs a circular narrative. That is, rather than providing a traditional resolution/conclusion that ties together the film's ending, it provides closure by returning to the opening material. This also ties in with the word ""eternal"" in both the film's title and the quote, being that the plot exists in a loop. In simple terms, the quote alludes to blissful ignorance. The ""blameless"" vestal referenced in the quote represents someone who is set apart from that which is blemished or tainted with pain or grief; they are innocent, free from the harsh realities of their choices. Both Joel and Clementine represent blameless vestals, as they both underwent the procedure to ""erase"" their memories of each other due to the pain caused by their relationship. Their memories being erased symbolizes a sort of cleansing, which turns them into ""blameless"" vestals. Moreover, the mind is most fulfilled in what is spotless, new, and exciting. That's why the beginning of a relationship often feels the best, as there is minimum baggage between the two partners. Each person is excited about what lies ahead in the relationship, as there only appears to be blue skies and sunshine ahead. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman then attempts to convey (which he successfully does) that eternal sunshine (eternal happiness) can only be found in those with a spotless mind (a mind free from emotional turbulence and free from feelings of unhappiness). This is depicted in the final scene of the film which shows both Joel and Clementine playing around on the beach where they first meet, accompanied by a white (spotless) backdrop. This scene does an amazing job of displaying the circular narrative I mentioned the film employs. As they run along the beach (in the final scene), the scene cuts 3 times with them starting from the same position they did before, implying that they continue to undergo the procedure over and over again. Kaufman is informing the viewers that in order to maintain or relive eternal happiness (which we all desire), one must always be of a spotless mind (something we can never achieve). By showing us the circular nature of Joel and Clementine's relationship by the film's end, Kaufman is indirectly encouraging us to either let go or continue with our relationships, which includes both pain and happiness. Through their experiences, Kaufman also informs us about the importance of acceptance. Halfway through Joel's procedure, he begs to keep a few precious memories of Clementine. He is then reminded by Dr. Howard that he cannot have them and to remember the agreement he made for all memories of her to be removed. This scene is crucial. Many of us in our relationships would love if we could erase all the negative aspects and keep all the positive and beautiful ones. Kaufman reminds us, however, that we cannot have our cake and eat it too. We have to learn to either accept all that comes with our partners/relationships or be willing to let them/it go. Therefore, we should avoid seeking eternal sunshine, as it exists solely outside of reality. Instead, we should strive to look forward to and enjoy the various seasons each of our relationships bring!",

Way too much of the movie involves the flashily filmed fragmentary memories, dreams, half-memories, fantasies, etc. etc. experienced by the Jim Carrey character as he undergoes this improbable procedure (which proves the excuse for a number of special effects). Watching such fragments, on and on, is about as tedious as listening to someone recount his dream.

Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves. At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.Evren Buyruk",

The subject matter would best befit a short science fiction story, and indeed the content of the film is so slim that it quite noticeably outstays its welcome. Like most short stories, the film would have best been told from a first person point of view only. The film threads in the story of the operators, just not just the operated too, however. This causes the film to become distracted from the more interesting part of the tale, and as a result, it is at times quite bland. It is not that the viewer does not understand  there is just no reason to care.

I feel goofy from watching it. You don't so much watch it as suffer through it. Perhaps this is the vogue nowadays to have jerky sequences signifying nothing much at all but a morass of frenetic activity pass as avant-garde film-making, but it's lost on me. I read a review by a famous Chicago reviewer who claims there's emotional involvement of the viewer with the main characters. Well, not with my friend and me. We were put off by these two sad cases - Jim Carrey a subdued and lonely, rather conservative man, and Kate Winslet as a hoyden given to obscuring her beauteous charms under flagrantly dyed hair ranging in shades of Day Glo orange to Mood Indigo Blue. What a waste of this fine actress. The only good thing I saw was the welcome tamping down of Carrey's normal ebullience to a rather more approachable and assimilable sort of male creature, albeit shot through with insecurities and given to impulses only made understandable by watching the flick through. But who wants or needs to see what happens to either of these (again let me use the adjective)GOOFY characters? Not we! I chose this film on the basis of the awards it has both been nominated for and has garnered, the crown jewel being Winslet's nomination for the Academy Award! Who nominated her for this schlock? I rather think she should put a bag over her head! Try to hide this one from her resume! What is to be happy about in a role so chaotic and obscure? I know nothing about this flighty, maddening woman, having watched this film! Who would want to hitch their wagon to Winslet in this movie? A lunatic!

Kirsten Dunst proves she has not an ounce of fat as she hops about prior to copulation with wild-haired Mark Ruffalo and then, unsated, begins an immediate seduction of her boss, the grand suave Doctor of this mad Lacuna outfit.

We kept debating whether to walk out but stayed in the bleak hope that there might be one small gram of redeeming humor or insight in the entire 2 hours.  Where do I begin to dissect this abortion of a movie?  The characters that Carey and Winslett play are both visually disgusting (everyone in this movie badly needs a bath and a wardrobe that has not been acquired primarily from dumpsters), and are whiney, and utterly annoying creations.  Carey is dull, lifeless, totally uninspired and looks physically ill.  He NEEDS to go back to the comedies for which he has a true gift rather than making these dreadful ""artistic"" movies.  Winslett's character is obviously insane, and if I were a man to whom she made advances I would flee in horror.   The ""impulsiveness"" she attributes to herself would obviously be the hallmarks of several major mental illnesses in real life.  When you put these two together, the only party who could gain any advantage from the match would be a manufacturer for razor blades. The desire to erase either of these grungy losers from one's mind would be only natural and logical. The movie simply makes no sense - the ""plot"" is extremely difficult to follow as the movie jumps back and forth with no apparent logic or design.  The effect is jarring and nerve-wracking.  There is no apparent editing, which might have created the semblance of a cohesive narrative.

It is understandable to show a story told from a different perspective, but a filmmaker has to set limits. It makes no sense in trying to confuse the audience as much as you can. That does not make the film intelligent or original. 'Eternal Sunshine..' is too full of itself; it says, 'look how creative I am, telling this story in such an odd way. I dare you to figure it out'. Nobody will gain anything if the filmmakers are trying to make the audience look stupid. It only creates an exaggerated ego for those who do understand it. ",

It's almost like a romantic version of Inception (but without all the suicide). The movie takes place inside Jim Carrey's characters mind and takes the audience through a series of non-chronological flashbacks to fully explain the complicated relationship between Jim Carrey's Joel and Kate Winslet's Clementine. The plot, without spoiling it, is like something out of a science fiction movie but instead set in modern time and with very realistic, grounded characters - one of the many reasons why this works so well. The characters are entertaining, but at the same time delicate and real. Jim Carrey gives a great performance (one of the best I've seen from him), but it is Kate Winslet who really takes the cake. Her acting in this movie is fantastic - probably the best I've seen from her. The supporting cast consists of Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst; each of which fit into the story very well (they all appear in present time, and not in the Jim Carrey's mind or the flashbacks), and each plays their own important part to the story, subtly adding something unique in their own right.",

Just love from man and woman for her/his couple. As simple as that, the way modern teenage know it too well. Contemporary love we can call it, and contemporary movies we often watched it about this kind of love. So, what's so special about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)? It is the unusual but still romantic idea about love. A science-fiction indeed, not about alien, computer, future, but simply about the way to move one from a man or woman. Ordinary teenage problem, and how this era help teenage to do it. Of course, it has been one decade since it was first released. And technology looks so different even just past 10 years. So, let us just focus on 2004, only cell-phone, and so few of social media. I think the more modern humans are, the harder they will move on, especially for young generation.

In Being John Malkovich, he deals with identity, aspirations, and the hard reality of existence. Adaptation is about the creative struggle and the need to adapt and evolve with the circumstances. In Synecdoche, New York he presents us with a stylized look at our perception of life and other people. In Eternal Sunshine he searches through the meaning of love and memory. All of these descriptions are trite, insufficient, and probably inaccurate. They are, however, what I recall learning from and seeing in the films.",
211,4 March 2005,tolbs1010,5, Good idea lacking necessary depth,"Eternal Sunshine is neither the masterpiece that many people will have you believe nor is it awful as the backlashers claim. Once again Charlie Kaufman takes the kernel of a great idea and overloads it with his own obsessive personality. The idea of a couple fighting to retain beautiful memories of their past together while undergoing a memory erasure is ingenious. Kaufman definitely hits some poignant notes along the way (he's great at communicating the mundane pleasures and comforts of relationships), but Joel and Clementine's characters seem like mere sketches rather than fully developed people that the audience can care about. Joel in particular is maddening because he's the same schlubby protagonist that is in all of Kaufman's scripts: it's Charlie himself. The man is simply incapable of creating characters outside the bounds of his own personality. Also, the movie isn't as enjoyable as it should be. Though I wanted to see how it ended (even though I predicted the plot twist about 30 minutes into the movie), Kaufman denies the audience the pleasures of human connection with the characters in favor of convoluted, intricately distanced storytelling. The characters come across as rats in an experiment or pawns in a chess game or any other omniscient metaphor you can think of. And the subplot between the workers of Lunaca fits but in an unimaginative, convenient way. I must say that all of the performances were excellent (except Elijah Wood, but he didn't have much of a character anyway), particularly Winslet and Mark Ruffalo. Director Michel Gondry and his team of technicians give the movie an appropriately jittery, jagged rhythm and look. It feels like the work of a writer on anti-depressants and Valium filtered through the mind of a director on a 3-day caffeine binge. That's not necessarily a bad thing because without the energy and gimmickry that Gondry brings to the film, the emptiness of the conception would be all the more glaring. Don't believe the hype but don't discount the film altogether either. It seems that many people are discovering something profound in it. Self-doubt and emotional shallowness might be the new status quo.",

With the exception of cases where the person really disliked it for reasons whatsoever, i would say one big turn-off for the first time viewer is the complexity of the movie, the various changes (space/time-wise) and levels through which the story leads us. Here's one tip: try to follow Clem's hair colors, they are basically the greatest element of orientation for us. Of course, only after a number of viewings you're going to realize that, no point trying to rush things. By the way, for people who like puzzling characters and story lines, this is a handful, every time you watch it, there's something new to discover. And, speaking of the characters..to me, Joel and Clementine are already featured on the list of one of the best couples ever to hit the screen. They're like water and oil, and yet, they're the perfect yin and yang for each other, cliché and true. Clementine is often labeled as a so-called ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl"", but i don't agree at all. I won't go into detail of the meaning of the term, but Clementine is so special and unique that i don't think she is fit for any labels, quoting Joel: ""I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane"". Kate Winslet gives the best performance of her career, so far. Jim Carrey, too, is nothing short of spectacular, he is surprisingly comfortable in the role of an introverted and shy man, defying all judgments we may have made of his dramatic talent. And yes, throughout the entire movie, we basically only see Joel's mental representation of Clementine, based on the memories they had together...but, even so, who's to say she's not real? Besides all the wonderfulness fore-mentioned, the plot deals with lots of intriguing questions, which are relevant to anyone who's ever been in any kind of relationship (hence my disbelief look when people tell me they didn't like it!). I think the main idea for the story (let me just take a moment to say how i find Charlie Kaufman a genius, and this partnership with Michel Gondry even more), has always been present in people's subconscious, the possibility to alter time and reality somehow, by erasing unpleasant memories, who wouldn't at least consider it? The great thing about the movie, what makes it so real and true, is that we learn that the sentence ""blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders"", can be questioned. This is what Joel finds out, but we can't shake off the feeling that it's something he (and all of us) knew all along.",

Even in its darkest, saddest moments, this is a thoroughly beautiful film, emotionally potent all around, exacting every emotion your system can handle almost with complete impunity to your senses.

In this film, he tries to forget a failed romance with the irreverent Clementine (Kate Winslet) through a procedure that is, in practice, a brainwashing. But he regrets that with the process ongoing and tries to find a way to keep his memories. The film seems quite original and, in fact, the script has merit for trying to create a romantic comedy on a premise so different from the normal, but a large part of the plot is highly predictable. Another problem was the dialogues. In a film so light and so romance-oriented why insist on profanity or heavy slang? Some special effects look good, in particular the fading things and the passages from one memory to another at random, allowing us to have a wider knowledge of Joel's past. The soundtrack is quite kitsch and match the taste of both main characters but displeases the ears of the audience. Carrey was perfect in the main character, maintaining a good chemistry with Winslet, who also didn't disappoint.

And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture.",
251,19 September 2014,Seraphion,8," Great romance, even the side plots are nice","The story is very touching. It opens up subtly soft with the ending, and then builds its base conflict straight up. The details reveal themselves very neatly afterward, and the turning point and main conflict is then presented in a very touching yet somehow funny and cheerful way of story telling. I like how this movie even has spare time to develop a side conflict between the supporting characters. The main conflict and the side conflict both serve neatly designed twists that are quite unpredictable up until the very moment they're about to arrive. The acting is very nice. I love seeing Jim Carey doing something other than comedy, although he still doesn't leave his funny-man aura. Kate Winslet gets into the carefree and careless Clem very nicely. The appearance of Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson made this movie more alive especially with those extra twists.",

Like a favorite movie that you bought and watched over and over again. What if all that was gone when you woke up? What if someone has you erased from their mind completely without you being aware? In Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jim Carey plays Joel Barish, an average Joe trying to survive. When Joel finds out that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him and all the times they spent together erased completely from her mind by a doctor who specializes in the field, Joel gets very upset and has the exact same thing done to her. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his three employees, Mary, Stan, and Patrick (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood) go to work on Joel's memories. Howard is the man in charge, Mary is the secretary, Stan is Howard's assistant, and Patrick is sort of Stan's assistant and gets himself into quite the pickle when he decides to date Clementine using Joel's memories as a guide to her. Now the process of erasing Clementine begins.",

Jim Carrey is charming and hard working in this, hard working because the script certainly doesn't help him - it is paper thin. Parts of it even sound improvised. I got a small taste of chemistry between the two principals who are broadly drawn, very little depth. The attraction of opposites is inferred though not enough. Kate Winslet is a fine actress but here she is woefully miscast as colourful Clementine, the wild child who works at Barnes and Noble in what looks suspiciously like her underwear. No one knows what Joel does for a living, it would have been interesting to find out, he is so tamped down. I rather liked the character of Mary, played by Kristen Dunst, and felt a story around her would have captured my interest more. I guess the point was that chemistry will triumph over and over again even if the memories are dumped. But do we want our memories, no matter how painful, deleted? For aren't our memories all we really have? To shape and strengthen and even change us for the better. What am I doing? Re-working the pitiful script? A good cast wasted.

In both scenes the figure we are watching onscreen ceases to be Joel Barrish and becomes immediately recognizable as Jim Carrey. The mugging and mewling Carrey brings to these scenes might be funny in another context, but they relate to nothing else in the tone or content of the film. One almost wonders whether there's a rider in Carrey's contract insisting, ""Star retains the right to do something rubbery with his face at least once during project.""

If you like his unique angle of vision, you'll probably love this film. If you don't, you'll doubtless find it un-involving and ultimately a bore. I'm in the second category. I've yet to see anything Kaufman has written that I've really liked. On the face of it, this one would seem to have possibilities. Two characters -- Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet -- with exasperating personalities have fallen in love and then out of love. They each go separately to a doctor who claims to be able to erase a person entirely from the patient's mind. It works on Carrey's character but not entirely. Not an original plot but given a Kaufmanesque twist, played for laughs and romance rather than for mystery or horror. As in other films Kaufman has written, there's a hall of mirrors aspect to the film that deliberately confuses the viewer. Ho hum. Despite a charming performance by Winslet and pretty good ones by Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo in the subplot, this movie lost traction with me about half way through. Frankly, I didn't give a damn what happened to the characters. The ratings the film received from critics and from contributors to this site would amaze me except that I long ago learned that ""no one ever went broke underestimating"" the taste of young American sophisticates (with apologies to the author of the original quote).

Kate Winslet plays kind of a freaky girl - quite a departure from what you're used to if you saw her in Titanic or Sense and Sensibility. Jim Carrey plays a very dark depressed and sad individual - even sadder than the role he played in Cable Guy. The movie is hard to follow, starting out at what you think is the beginning, only to be shifted and twisted down a disjointed and confusing path. You really don't get the feeling that the two main characters have any chemistry between them at all. In order to enjoy a movie, you really have to care about the main characters and what happens to them. Carrey's character comes off as desperate and sad and Kate Winslet's character comes off like a crazy witch with a capital B - I started not to care whether they got back together or not within minutes of watching.

281,1 July 2005,ryan_kuhn,9," ""By morning, you'll be gone...""","Charlie Kaufman has done two movies now that take personality bending to a new level. In Adaptation, he wrote himself and his imaginary twin brother into a story about white orchids, and here in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman plays ""what if"" with two people who are really in love but only remember the bad times and decide to have each other erased from their memories. This is a movie the viewer needs to see more than once, probably more than twice, to comfortably experience the film. Kaufman and director Michel Gondry plays with the time line of the film, and on first viewing, it's sometimes difficult to separate what is happening now and what has already happened. Seeing the film a second time will help the viewer understand the story, but the emotional feelings remain the same. The great revelation of film is that two people have a relationship for a reason, and unfortunately, we only remember the bad times, and forget the good times. For the characters in Eternal Sunshine, this revelation comes way too late for them, and there is a sense of desperation as they try to hang on to the memories they have. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish who is a quiet, laid back guy who meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), a wild child who's spontaneity scares, yet intrigues, Joel. Carrey once again shows that he's not just a comedic actor, but rather a serious all-around actor. He immerses himself into the character Joel, making us forget this is the same guy who was the Cable Guy. Winslet received an Oscar nomination for her job as Clematine, and it's deserved. She relays Joel's desperation in the last third of the movie, heightening the emotional roller coaster this movie takes us on. After one fight too many, each seeks out Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) who is able to remove the memories of anyone from a person's brain. Joel's procedure is lead by Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood), but turns out to be difficult case. This leads to a subplot involving Dr. Howard and his secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst) that ultimately leads to a crushing final act to the film. It's a powerful and appropriate finale, where the characters understand where they stand, and their decision makes total sense. Kaufman and Gondry won an Oscar for this original screenplay, featuring a story that is science fiction, and like most great works of science fiction, is not really about the science, but rather the results of technology. Eternal Sunshine is a movie where there is much more than what appears on the screen; each viewer can put themselves into the film, identify with the situations they recall, and perhaps leading the viewer to remember those good times that we each take for granted.",

The performances also make this film worthwhile, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are absolutely perfect in the leads, both deserve Oscar nominations last year if you ask me. Also two actors who i usually do not like much in Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are at the absolute best here (partially due to them, mostly due to the great script).

Jim Carrey romances Kate Winslet but when she has her memories of him erased he decides to have the same procedure done only he may not want her erased at all so he attempts to hide her image within other memories. Visually stunning and a more unique romantic agenda than usual. Stylish directing by Michel Gondry with unique visual appeal as memories overlap. Jim Carrey is sympathetic as he goes from abrupt closure to a fear of losing what he initially loved to begin with. Kate Winslet with a punk like appeal completes the chemistry realizing what she was willing to lose is what she will ultimately fight to obtain. Tom Wilkinson heads the clinic and will be called upon when complications arise with Carrey's memories, but certain facts surface that haunt him. Kirsten Dunst works at the clinic and falls into a romance until she learns certain facts that lead her to realize why she is at the clinic to begin with. Elijah Wood is featured as someone whom seems to replace Carrey and fill in where he had once been although his attempts prove frustrating. Original and solid analysis about memories while regretting those times that brought no sunshine. Score: 10 / 10",

To classify (wholly unfairly) it as genre, it's a romantic sci-fi (and how many of those do you see?), set in a world where disillusioned lovers can have their memories of each other erased. There's plenty of natural material in this concept, but unfortunately, Kaufman and director Michel Gondry are arguably guilty of trying a little too hard: the middle section of the movie takes place inside the characters' brains, for no real purpose in terms of plot: the film fills this logical vacuum with some evocative cinematography, but its impact is lessened because the film-makers have first licensed themselves to show anything they want. What they do get right, in combination with the leads, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett, is to show real (positive and negative) chemistry between the protagonists; if anything, at times they appear almost too adorable, but at least there's a spark. And although daft, the film is wholly watchable and actually not bad at manipulating the viewer's emotions; but perhaps Kaufman didn't need to make his script jump through quite so many hoops.",

It's been two years since I first watched it, and with a poor memory like mine, I have completely forgotten what it is all about. The only memory I have about it is the essay I wrote as an assignment, from which I know I didn't feel a thing about it as many people do. I also remember one of its lesson, that is you can't just ignore your mistakes, you have to look them in the face—look them really hard to be able to learn something from them—otherwise you are gonna to make the same mistakes again and again. Unless you make a change, this will be a never-ending process. Lots of things have happened since the latter half of last year. I have experienced many frustrations, I have been under huge stress, and I began to be aware of my own existence again—the last time that I did was in my junior year, when I was involved in a vortex of mixed feelings dealing with my contenting roommates. When I repeatedly make the same mistakes, the lesson of the film comes to me, and I tell myself: ""See how you got here. You are careless to the lessons life teaches you. Be smart next time."" Therefore, I want to watch the film again, to see if I will change my mind, since it has such a depth, it helps me avoid old mistakes. But after I finished it, I still don't like it. I did change, however. The problem with it, as I see it this time, is with the way the director presents it. The humor, which he may think as a plus or as something that will make it entertaining, is exactly what ruins the film. He could have reduced some of the humorous scenes because they don't fit in with the whole tone. For example, people will laugh when they know that the young guy from the clinic steals Clement's underwear. But what't the point of that? Or, the scene that while Joel is trying hard to keep his memory, Mary and Stan were actually having a party on his bed. Maybe he wants to indicate the absurdity of the whole erasing thing, or that's his satire of the commercial world where people only care about money and are not sympathetic to your feelings, but he could have used another way. The sad love story and the kinds of humor of irresponsibility and all form a really weird combination. It may be better if the director sticks with only one of them. As for the love part, I don't feel a thing, either. Maybe I have passed the stage of life when you dream about a person who will love you as if you are the only thing he has. Rather, I respect the fact that we are two equal people, we have our own concerns, and we are together because we seem to form good partners to live the rest of our lives. I don't want him to interfere with my life too much, because there are many things to do except love. By the way, Jim Carrey is very handsome!",
298,1 November 2004,supertom-3,9, Carrey's Best Film!! Oscar time?,"From hot screenwriter of the moment, Charlie Kaufman comes this superbly quirky and unique comedy/romance. It's a strange blend of humour and drama with a science fiction premise. Basically after he breaks up with his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), Joel (Jim Carrey) finds out that he has been erased from her memory by the lacuna corporation. It's a technique that puts patients into a dream as the relive memories of what they want erased and as they relive them they are wiped out. Joel then decides that he wants the procedure because the pain is too much.",

I think what sold me on this film is the way it straddles and selects themes from many different genres. Overall it seems mostly to be a romantic comedy of sorts, though even this could probably be debated. But while mostly centering on romance with a comedic touch the movie seems to carry a strong message, which it conveys with events that seem to resemble psychological thrillers and maybe even sci-fi at a stretch.Because it uses so many elements of so many genres it is an interesting movie to look at from an analytical standpoint. It brings together many motifs to tell a compelling story that draws upon an entire range of emotions, making it very engaging to watch. Overall I really enjoyed it.",

Jim Carrey is excellent as a single man looking for love...and perhaps finding it with eccentric clerk Kate Winslet; unfortunately, a double-header secret from both their pasts may come back to haunt them. Gondry, who also worked on the original story with Pierre Bismuth and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, is masterful with a flashy scenario (both figuratively and literally), and he works surprisingly well with his eclectic group of actors. However, the characters in Kaufman's script aren't especially likable (particularly Winslet's argumentative love-interest) and the film is acutely chilly, with everybody bundled up and shivering. As the plot thickens, it also becomes convoluted (and, purposely one assumes, splintered). Despite these missteps, Gondry steers viewers nimbly through the mechanisms of the narrative, and there several engaging and arresting sequences. Similar in tone and spirit to ""Being John Malkovich"", which Kaufman also wrote, and blazing with deft, daring originality. **1/2 from ****",

While not at the level of ""Being John Malkovich"" or ""Adaptation"", this Kaufman script takes the film-goer on a ride to prove that's what it's all about.  The only thing that life in general and relationships specifically, offer are the memories and experiences.  Results matter little.  Jim Carrey bashers will surely crucify his dramatic turn, but most will see the depth he brings to the role.  He can act ... it is just difficult for many to get past the Carrey icon. Kirsten Dunst again proves she is so much more than a pretty face.  She leaps off the screen with pain and joy and eagerness.  Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson provide steady supporting roles, but the biggest disappointment is Kate Winslet.  Think knock-off of Madonna in ""Desperately Seeking Susan"". She does not have the edge necessary to pull off this role.  Her scenes come up empty when it is necessary for her to step up.  Many will liken the film to ""Total Recall"", but thanks to the writing, it will take you much deeper in your feelings than Arnold ever has!

323,7 November 2017,mike48128,3, I hated it. Boring and repetitive,"The reverse of the classic Philip K. Dick story ""We can remember it for you wholesale"" (aka ""Total Recall""). Three people, Joel, Clementine, and Mary, are interconnected by the fact that they have all attempted to have painful memories completely erased from their conscious and unconscious memory. The technique is only partially successful. At the end, all 3 remember fragments of their thoughts. The initial device looks just like a beauty parlor hair dryer a la ""The Stepford Wives"". Joel wants to forget Clementine, so he has the procedure performed in the doctor's office and then completed at home. Something goes terribly wrong and he almost can't be ""snapped out of it"" as he remains unconscious for a dangerously long period of time. Thus, the viewer is forced to relive the same imperfectly-erased memories many times and for me this became quite tedious and boring. As expected, Joel and Clementine both tried to erase each other, (she first) and Mary almost forgets her love affair with the married doctor where she is office manager. Good effects, as fences and buildings all dissolve metaphorically as the memories shift and change. Almost like the movie ""Brainstorm"" but not in a toxic or shocking way. I didn't like it at all and I don't care how wonderful and original everyone else thinks this movie is. The only good thing about it is that in spite of all the odds against it, Joel and Clementine finally reconnect and try to start again, possibly indicating that they really belong together after all. It's not worth 108 minutes of my time for just that revelation. As usual, Jim Carrey gives a good off-beat performance but Kate Winslet is wasted as his love interest. A minor ""sexy"" scene as Mary and the technician ""get it on"" at Joel's home and accidentally leave him ""plugged in"" too long, like a bag of burning microwave popcorn!",
324,18 April 2005,MLDinTN,5, The best part of this film was its originality,"This movie was very original, which is why I thought it was OK. I didn't think the concept was anything that great though. It's basically a romance. But instead of showing the two meeting and falling for each other in the conventional way, it's all shown in memories as they are being erased. In the film, there is technology that can erase memories. Joel learns his ex-girlfriend, Clemetine, had him erased, so he goes to have the same procedure done to him. But, during the procedure, part of him doesn't want to lose all the memories. So, most of the latter part of the film shows things that Joel and Clementine did together. And once Joel realizes he doesn't want her erased he begins dragging Clementine throughout his memories and trying to hide her. It's rather weird, but the way it's shown makes sense.",

327,13 May 2014,CMTiago,9, A beautiful awakening,"Translated to ""The Awakening Of The Mind"" in my country, Sunshine is an homage to the beauty of love, but also its ugly side. Combined with a scientific feel, the movie delivers a funny and witty love story that makes some rather important questions that are mainly associated with moral and ethical dilemmas. The plot revolves around a man that chooses to have his former partner erased from his mind, after finding out that she did the same procedure. The leads are played wonderfully by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who show off their acting skill by playing characters not usually associated with their type of roles. The direction and co-screenplay by Michel Gondry is a visual and quirky feast for the eyes and will suck you in right from the start. The supporting performances are also very pleasant, as they deliver what we ask of them. A very beautiful film and a true awakening from the complications of life, Eternal Sunshine nails the mark.",

330,28 December 2004,ilikeimdb,10, One of the most inventive movies I've seen,"For three quarters of this movie, I kept asking myself ""How can the director sustain (and even build upon) this level of intensity and inventiveness?"" The relationship intrigue unfolds like Ten Little Indians, except with what you think are just two characters. This movie will win the best original screenplay Oscar or we should never watch the Academy Awards ever again. I should add that Jim Carrey gives us another Truman Show performance, showing again that his real talent lies in more serious acting. Kate Winslet also makes a believable, nuanced foil in this twisted tete-a-tete. So, what happens in the last 1/4 of the movie? Well, there's a rather silly subplot that makes fun of the state of American workers (and of relationships in general) that takes away from the emotional momentum. The ending isn't entirely satisfying either...perhaps others who have watched have a better ending suggestion. Nevertheless, this movie's superb acting, dialog, and directing deserve special mention -- for 3/4 of its length, it is pure, unadulterated genius; and for the last 1/4, merely very fine.",

One of the worst parts about it was the fact that the audience knew pathetically little about their apparently 2 year relationship or the threads that weaved their hearts together in the first place nor the cracks their love fell through. And why on earth anyone would want to be soul mates with the impossibly dimwitted, arrogant and offensive Clem is beyond all capacity for understanding.

This created a very surrealist feeling to the film. If you've seen ""Un Cien Andalou"" or another film from that era, you can understand what I'm trying to say. I'm not trying to be prude, but the experience of watching the film was so strange, that I could only think of that way to describe it.",

What I like the film most? the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Unbelievable, that Jim Carrey can act like that. Not stupid but boring man. Usually I seen Jim Carrey movie like comedy such as Ace Ventura, dumb and dumber. But he is kind of different he. He really merge to Joel Barish character. Boring man but make us pity and love him at once. Kate Winslet, did a good act too here. I love the way Kate Winslet express the Clementine character. She made Clementine lovable, cheer full but also insecure. very human. Michel Gondry did a good job here and also Charlie Kauffman (I also like Being John Malkovich, very original).. the point is, eternal sunshine is the most romantic film ever...Two thumbs up.",

Combining the narrative complexity of a Nolan film, the visual inventiveness of a Burton film, and the pure heart of a Spielberg film, it manages to reconcile all three concepts and become a truly magical film. As with most great films, I didn't fully appreciate it the first time I watched it, but a second viewing simply blew me away and now it's one of my favourite films. You could watch this film a hundred times and still find things to admire about it. The script is one of the most original and probably one of the best of all-time. Kate Winslet is terrific, but it's Carrey's reserved and nuanced performance that drives the film. The supporting cast are all very much supporting, but they're still great characters brought to life with equally great performances. Visually, the film is astonishing not for an overabundance of money shots, but for the subtlety and uniqueness of the effects present within it. And the love story feels true and genuine while still remaining romantic. All in all, one of the most innovative and wondrous films of our time.",

Conceptually intriguing and cinematically inventive, ""Eternal Sunshine"" is truly an deep adventure into the magnetism and torture of interpersonal relationships. Kate Winslet is absolutely brilliant as the cuckoo girlfriend and Jim Carey' characters vulnerability lets us feel his decision more than explain it. With a soundtrack that is perfectly quirky and timed exquisitely, this is a thinking and feeling film, and draws out compassion for the concept of relationships. The vehicle of specific memory erasing is done through editing genius and cinema magic and is a fascinating study all in itself. It openly acknowledges that we hinder our possible success due to failures of our pasts which the bittersweet ending sheds light on.",

373,18 February 2014,nrak24,10, film critique,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an eccentric love story between two different people who initially have a great relationship but it goes sour when realizing their extremely opposite personalities. They try to erase each other from their memories, but in doing so, realize what they had and how important it is to keep those special moments. This film shows how love makes us do silly things and how powerful it can be when two people share that affection. The film takes place during the winter in New York, where the cold weather can either make you feel like searching for warmth in someone's arms or it can make you feel lonely. Jim Carrey as Joel does an amazing job at interpreting a timid and introvert character while Kate Winslet, as Clementine, plays a spontaneous and energetic woman whose personality can go to either extreme in less than a second. The choice of slow and melancholy music helps portray these emotions throughout the movie as it takes us through the different memories they once shared. Most of the movie consists of several soliloquies where Jim Carrey, or Joel, exposes his inner most thoughts about a certain someone or something but does the opposite when Clementine is around. The dialog shared between the two also molds their characters and shows how distinct they are, and how their opposite personalities are what attract them.",

The plot is pretty hard to describe and I'm sure you probably already it by now but if you don't read it somewhere else. This is one of Jim Carrey's best films beside Man on the Moon. I haven't seen Kate Winslet too many films and i liked her here but she was better in Heavenly Creatures.

Despite all of the favorable criticism, to me ""Eternal.."" is a corny love story decorated with pretentious elements, such as the editing. The director and writer have stolen son many little things of other great movies (particularily from Europe) that in America people could think this is an original stuff. That's understandable where even people who know about cinema do not know anything about movies from other countries. It's like a remake of a movie that has never been done. I am suspecting that audiences' memories are erased from time to time. This is the only way you think ""Eternal..."" is original.

Mixing humor, science fiction and a heart breaking soundtrack (try and listen to Beck's version of ""I Need Your Loving"" and tell me you didn't cry), Gondry managed to tame the ever so wild Jim Carey, who in return delivered one of his best performances to date  tied up there with his portrayal of Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon. In case that's one too many Kaufman's for you folks at home, Eternal Sunshine also offers stunning performances by a vary of esteemed actors and actresses, including Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom), Mark Rufallo (Collateral)  and the ever so adoring and lovely Kate Winslet (Titanic, Finding Neverland).

Jim Carry also gives a great performance and for some reason Jim Carry and Kate Winslet didn't get the Oscar and that has mad me mad, even though it dosen't matter that they win or not. The co-stars did a great job and worth being notice. To my point of view this screenplay is the best that has ever been written and may stay that way for a long time. The filmaking of this movie is great too and should be like by movie gores. This is only romance story I could relate too even though I haven't found love yet. There's only been two films that have change my life on this level and there are this movie and Fight Club. This is also the movie that got me into the romance movies and have become my favorite movie genre.

But when the sci-fi memory erasing kicks in and they attempt to erase each other from their respective memories is when this movie gets interesting. It is a colorful, wild ride. Not my favorite movie, but it was entertaining. I suppose it was inevitable that Kirsten Dunst's character turns into the woman scorned who returns everyone's memory tapes, but that whole part of the film was a little sleazy. I think all of the performers did amazing characterizations. It was truly unique and gets points just for that. If you are not fond of the weird and the deep, rent Laws of Attraction.

396,28 November 2004,chrissythecat,10, Eternally My Favorite Film,"I don't know how to describe ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Cliché, I know, but there doesn't seem to be words to describe just how exquisite a film I think it is. I feel like I shouldn't even comment on it because I can't do it justice. There don't seem to be enough adjectives, in any language, to describe how amazing a movie it truly is. But, I guess I have to begin somewhere. Eternal Sunshine is an indescribably marvelous film (isn't that an oxymoron? No, I think I'm probably the moron here,lol). It's a love story unlike any other I've seen before. It isn't filled with the typical Hollywood melodrama that so many so-called ""love stories"" possess where the perfect girl and the perfect guy love each other and want to be together, but they don't know it at first, and somehow, despite their perfection, they can't admit their true feelings until the end when they live happily ever after. Cue the doves flying into the sunset. Eternal Sunshine is nothing like that. It isn't the love story of two otherwise perfect people living in this ethereal and ideal world where the problems are so easily solved. It's a love story between real characters with real faults and flaws, quirks and idiosyncracies. Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are human. He's shy, timid, and introverted, she's outgoing, vivacious, but yet somehow broken and sad, unable to maintain a sense of normalcy and familiarity. Clementine becomes bored quite easily, and Joel is threatened when Clementine cannot be exactly what he wants her to be. He gets annoyed at her for the very same reasons he fell in love with her, and their relationship suffers as a result of their incapacity to be what the other needs, and to keep their romance fresh. Clementine opts to undergo a new procedure to have her memories of Joel wiped clean, and he has to come to terms with that and decide if he really wants to erase her from her memories. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, so I'll wrap it up here. You'll fall in love with them both. So, watch it because it's a great story, it doesn't have a linear plot but you will be mesmerized by the acting and the vivid visuals and the overall beautiful cinematography of the film. This film has left me with Eternal Sunshine of my Spotless Mind.",

The early part of the film is pretty much all set up for the later part, and while it's not bad, it's not exceptional.  But once the movie gets going, it goes all the one, creating an exhilarating and utterly fascinating experience that is funny, touching and wildly imaginative.  ",
411,18 April 2017,ElMaruecan82,7, Of Understanding Feelings and Loving Personalities,"""The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know."" Pascal's famous quote exudes a sense of instant obviousness on the irrational aspect of love, love as feeling, love as a bridge between two souls but once you dig deeper in that notion, you realize that it's not much about love being irrational but maybe of love being built on 'fantasy', as a euphemism for lies. We can love someone, this is a sentiment human beings are most capable of, but take love as something other than a feeling, as a contract, a commitment and then the word 'fantasy' takes its full meaning because only through a fantasized version of the other, one can sacrifice his freedom of being true to his and her nature, becoming a fantasy in return.",
412,29 October 2009,KineticSeoul,7," Bizarre and yet beautiful exploration of love, just not brilliant","Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) is informed that his ex-girlfriend Clementine(Kate Winslet) who he was romantically involved with has had her parts of her memories erased, the memory of there relationship. The procedure was done by Dr. Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson) and the people that work for him. Mainly to get even he decides to get the same procedure done to himself. While the people that work for Dr. Mierzwiak go to work on Joel Barish, Joel changes his mind but the procedure is still going with his body paralyzed, but he struggles in his mind to save the memories of Clementine from being deleted. And that is basically the premise of the film, and when I first read the synopsis I thought it would be a dumb film but decided to give it a try anyways and too my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a bizarre but intriguing film and it's wonderful in some areas as well, it also strives to be original as well. A lot of aspect of this film is absurd especially the whole procedure although it is some what fascinating but just ridiculous, but it's entirely forgivable since entire erasing of Joel's memories serves as just a backdrop to the whole film. Watching this film was like watching a bizarre dream come to life, with it dealing with love, romance and memories. The time period change can get a bit confusing though since Gondry's visual 'clues' are subtle and the character Jim Carrey played wasn't lovable and don't care as much if he able to overcome his angst, which is some of the gripe I have with the movie. It would have been nice if they pushed the character creativity a bit further. I also found it to be a bit self indulgent which is okay, but also seem to drag the film at times. The film isn't complex or deep as some people claim it to be, it's a straight forward story but a good one.",

If it wasn't for the fact that this film was forced upon me on two occasions, I wouldn't have touched it with a barge pole. It is basically a story of a shy recluse called Joel (Jim Carrey) who meets lively and eccentric Clementine (Kate Winslet). They fall in love but their relationship is turbulent due to their contrasting personalities. Finally, an accident involving Clementine and Joel's car ends the relationship and Clem goes to have her memory of their relationship erased. She says during the interview before the erasure that she wants to erase Joel because 'he's boring'. In an act of spiteful revenge, Joel decides to erase Clementine as well. It is during the erasure process that he finds out that he actually wants to keep his memories as there were some moments of the relationship which he treasured. In his mind, he contrives a agreeable Clementine who is eager to help him preserve the memory of them as a couple, which is very ironic as Clementine erased him first.",

416,5 November 2004,dromasca,7, Over-rated and Artificial,"I sincerely do not understand what the buzz about this film is about. Charlie Kaufman's story is based upon the idea of erasing memory and the way it affects relationship and love. For science-fiction fans the idea of memory manipulation is not that original at all. Recently the 'Bounty' series or 'Paycheck' brought it to the big screen, and did it in a more attractive way, leading to good action films. The relationship story in 'Eternal Sunshine...' is rather banal, and even Kaufman could not resist to a quite routine ending. A lot of screen time is spent into simulating the effect of memory erasing, but I found much of it not-inspired and artificial. Jim Carrey is mis-casted, he wears a monkey grimace much of the film that let me ask how he could raise the emotional interest of Kate Winslet. Kate is better than Jim, while Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst do good supporting roles. Overall, I did not find the film too interesting, it's just fair entertainment that tries but does not succeed to be something else. I cannot share the enthusiasm of many other viewers about it, and gave it a 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",

We medicate ourselves to avoid both physical and psychological suffering, confident in the belief that the elimination of all sorrow and discomfort will somehow lead to happiness. But what would happen if someday we developed the technology to systematically wipe from our minds the memories of a person with whom we fell out of love or who fell out of love with us? Given the choice, which would we rather have, a painful memory of a failed relationship or no memory of that relationship at all? It's not an easy question to answer for, after all, don't sadness and pain play every bit as vital a role as happiness and joy in defining who we are as human beings? Don't we need those low points to make the high points that much more meaningful and real?

In ""Eternal Sunshine,"" Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules stuffed shirt, ground down by routine and unsuccessful in the ways of love, who meets and falls head over heels for Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-flying free spirit who opens up new vistas of experience for the nervous, unadventurous young man. However, if it is true that opposites do indeed attract, they also have the power to repel, and Joel and Joel and Clementine soon find themselves drifting apart over their many innate differences. In fact, they are drifting so far apart that Celementine has decided to undergo a medical procedure that will effectively erase all traces of Joel from her memory. When a heartbroken Joel learns that she has done this, he retaliates by doing the same with his memories of her. The vast majority of the film takes place in Joel's jumbled mind as he is undergoing the procedure to nullify his one true love - and regretting his decision halfway through.",

It delivers for me, but for this film, I appreciate the film for its inventive story, cinematography and cool love story with realism and the chemistry between Carrey and Winslett were perfect indeed, but I don't think it is a great story or an unforgettable experience.

Winslet does a nice job and is not nearly as annoying as she usually is. The problem with ""...Spotless Mind"" is that it takes itself a little to seriously. If it wanted to be serious, I think they would have been better off being a straight science fiction movie. As a romance, the ending is telegraphed way too early.

That's when i discovered it was labeled science-fiction and so this kind of erasing memory is indeed the right stuff of my favorite writer PKD ! It's all the more close to his work that it features a really nobody, simple couple that we don't see very often in American productions ! For this kind of intimate sci-fi romance, the french touch of the director is really fit and he is really great at filming past collapsing: There's great, poetic visuals and haunting visions of this erasing and this sort of man vs machine keeps awake. It's true that it's maybe one of the best job for Carrey because for one time, he doesn't have fun! Kate is always wonderful, playing a straight, direct girl who is full of energy!

Joel decides to undergo the same procedure himself, but decides midstream that some memories are worth hanging onto. Charlie Kaufman's films explore the workings of the human mind: 'Adaptation (2002)' traced the neurotic exchanges between an artist and his art; 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)' is about how memories influence our relationships with others; I'm yet to work out what 'Being John Malkovich (1999)' was all about, but at least it had fun going about it. As was the case with Spike Jonze, Kaufman found in Michel Gondry a director who shared his unique perspective on life and art. 'Eternal Sunshine' is eccentric without being outwardly quirky, and Gondry's creative flair for optical trickery (sharpened through his work on music videos) is perfect for recreating the labyrinthine cubicles of the human mind.",

455,5 May 2004,Chris_Docker,8, Fabulous and inventive storytelling,"The idiosyncratic pen of Charlie Kaufman, who brought us the quirky and inventive Being John Malkovitch, has excelled himself in this offering with a movie that not only boasts originality of plot but a tender love story that avoids all excesses of sentimentality with razor-edge script and magnetic performances from Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. At the end of an unusual and loving relationship with Carrey, Winslet's character answers an ad to have the (now painful) memory 'erased'. Carrey, dumfounded, follows suit, only to become resistant half-way through the process. What sounds like a dedicated sci-fi story is presented in such a way as to be perfectly ordinary and acceptable to a mainstream audience, allowing us to focus on the real dynamics of relationships and memories rather than get caught up in some high tech idea. Lacuna, the company that does the 'erasing', is headed by Tom Wilkinson - a very homely type who has hit on a process that combines psychology with zapping pinpointed areas of the brain in a sort of limited intentional brain damage exercise.

457,4 December 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10, a film that everyone should see,"Films like Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind come around once in a lifetime, if we're lucky. I watched it when I was too young to fully grasp much, and it flew over my head. In the last few years I had a revisit and was knocked flat. Few stories out there have the power to mine deep within the human psyche and search for the complexities, contradictions and puzzling flaws that lie in the beautiful disasters we call human beings. A contemplative yet fast paced meditation on relationships, love, heartbreak and reconciliation doesn't even begin to paint a picture of what you're in for with this uniquely told and one in a million film. Sagely ragamuffin Michel Gondry, not one for the easy way out, has truly outdone himself, as has screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who is never short on wild ideas with emotional heft that sneaks up and blindsides you. Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) ditches work on a whim one morning, and hops a train out to snowy Montauk. Through fate's mysterious grasp, he meets free spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet), and the two hit it off immediately. He's reserved, cautious and calculated, and she's an impulsive wild card. They couldn't be more different, but somehow they work. Until they don't. Joel is devastated to learn one day of a radical brain alteration technique that effectively removes the memory of an ex from your mind, and Clementine has taken the plunge. Joel is confused and lost, and while the iron is still hot in his beating heart, he decides to undergo the procedure as well. Then the film really turns your world upside down. Whilst the staff of the Institute (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst) go to work on his mind in his sleep, he has a change of heart. With the memories of Clementine radidly disintegrating, he races through the internal landscape of his mind in order to find and save her, hiding her in obscure corners of his data log where she won't be found. It's a genius way to tell the story, taking a delightful turn for the surreal as both of them find themselves catapulted headlong into various moments of his life. On the outside, a tragic subplot unfolds involving Dunst and the the head doctor at the program (Tom Wilkinson). Kirsten and Tom have never been better, treating an often used trope with dignity and gentleness. For all its tricks and psychological whathaveya, the film is first and foremost about love. It isn't interested in showing us any generic or clichéd depiction of it either, like most of the pandering fluff that gets passed off as romance these days. It strives to show love in all its brutal and painful glory, the fights, the hurt, the time spent alone, the resentment and the willingness to batter your way through all that, against better judgment and logic, if it's worth it. Is love a force of its own, a measurable influence that can transcend a procedure like that? Is it it's own element, or simply always a part of us? Carrey and Winslet (and, to a lesser extent, Wilkinson and Dunst) tenderly search for the answers to these difficult questions in what are the roles of a lifetime for both. Carrey has never been so vulnerable, so open, and despite his brilliant comedic work elsewhere, his performance here is a direct window into the soul, and his best work to date. Although the film is quite labyrinthine and jumps around quite a lot, it never, ever jumps the track or misses a beat. It's always concise, deliberate and crystal clear, if you have the patience and dedication to watch it a few times in order to let all the beautiful images, words and ideas sink in. Movies are first and foremost for entertainment. You give the man your nickel, he fires up the projector and you watch the lone ranger chase down down a speeding locomotive. Every once in a while you get one like this, one that challenges and inspires deep thought, intangible feelings and teaches you something, maybe even about yourself. Every once in a while, you get one that alters your life, and that is what is so important about that little spinning machine that opens up worlds upon a simple flat white canvas where before there was nothing. A masterpiece.",

Perhaps a dozen of Gondry's videos are so clever and rich that I had hopes his movies would be too. The preview for his next one looks to be on the grating and precious side; something out of the 80s. I was truly surprised that this movie is such an overwrought trifle. Overwrought in that the relationship is barely even registers with a viewer before it requires saving, and a trifle in that many pivotal scenes and the resolution are so weakly written that any of three other relationship in the movie seem more dramatically interesting, and more scaled for the focus of a feature length movie. They don't bear the burden of having to prop up Gondry's rep with some gimmick. The Carrey/Winslet relationship tries to wrestle itself out from under the FX but it never has a prayer.

They end up having a relationship but one day it all goes wrong and they split up. Joel wants her back but discovers that she has had him erased from her memory.

Kaufman's world is realistically populated through often funny and occasionally painful dialogue, interesting characters, and unexpected twists and turns. Kaufman is able to take full advantage of the cinematic art form by bending the conventions of film structure forming a work that combines narrative and nonlinear storytelling as well as brutal realism and wacky surrealism. This is not a film full of clichés, it is not a tragedy, nor is it a straight up comedy, but it contains a great bit of both. It is a film of reality; however, not in the sense that it is boring or painstakingly mundane, for it is quite the contrary.

472,15 April 2008,imdbfriend,10, Sunshine!,"Eternal Sunshine is one of the most intelligent, romantic comedy movies ever made. Any kind of praise will not be enough for this movie as for me everything related to this movie is just perfect, be it acting, directing, screenplay, music, dialog's, cinematography and everything else. Acting by Kate Winslet is one of the best and she is one of my fav actresses and this movie made me enjoy her acting even much more than ever. Jim Carrey too is perfect in his role, though I am not a big fan of his earlier movies but I was simply flattened by his acting in this one. Both the actors are at their witty best, sensible, and all. I love Charlie Kauffman's script and this one is just way ahead of all his other movies, he is one of the best script writers present in the industry. Direction by Gondry is top notch, the techniques he uses in the movie and the way movie is presented is just too good. Music too is very good and hits the right notes with the scenes all the time. Dialogues in the movie are witty, sensible, and intelligent. It will be a crime if I don't mention the supporting casts in the movie (Dunst, Ruffalo, Wilkinson, and Elijah) all are very good in their roles and done full justice in the movie. I love movie from the start to the end but I do have few of my favorite scenes and they are: 1. When Joel and Clementine meets for the first time at the beginning of the movie. The chemistry is just too good. 2. When Joel and Clementine goes to the ice lake in the night. 3. When Mary tells the quotations to Howard in Joel's home, the quotations, her recital of these, the background music and then the parade are all just awesome. And many many more scenes involving Joel and Clementine are too good. So if you haven't already then do watch this movie and before writing it off try to get into the movie mood and enjoy it. As many of my friends didn't get it for the first time and forgot to enjoy this masterpiece. Give it a fair chance.",

As delightful as Winslet is in this movie - clearly the best thing in it -, the central insecurity of her character is never thoroughly explored (but then, maybe that was never the point).

501,7 November 2008,ravenwood80,10, beautifully perfect,"It's now been nearly five years since Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was released. I have commented on quite a few films, and why I never commented on this before is beyond me. The story sees a normal guy who has broken up with his girlfriend. He then finds out she has had some modern medical procedure to remove their relationship and him from her memory. He then decides to kind of get his own back and get it done too. then halfway through his procedure, whilst under a deep sleep, he realises that he still loves her and wants to keep hold of every memory he has of her. its sounds strange, and what do u expect it comes from the mind of Charlie Kauffman. I cannot stress enough how beautiful this movie is. Michel Gondry deserved an Oscar nod for his direction, its out there but suits the tone brilliantly. Jim carrey does an amazing job as Joel, showing he is not the one trick pony many thought. Yes he is great at physical comedy, and has made us laugh out load for the last fourteen years, but he is also a very very brilliant actor, capable of showing true emotion through heartbreaking scenes. Kate Winslet is already known through the film world as being a hugely talented actress. Here is no different, she plays a deep eccentric character, who has an edge. She is terrific. All the supporting players are very good too. Elija Wood, Mark Rufflo, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst all succeed in their roles, showing that even in background roles they still shine. What I believe to be an important part of this movie is the soundtrack. The haunting piano music for different scenes is fantastic. There are not a lot of films people can call perfect for its genre, the shawshank redemption, the godfather and American beauty maybe. I claim this to be a perfect film. Its upsetting yet uplifting, a very rare breed indeed. Everyone has to see this once, and when you've done that, watch it again. This in my eyes is the greatest film ever made.

Like Being John Malkovich - I think - Eternal Sunshine... revolves around the existential notion of the self-creating individual. What comes to mind is the story ""Metamorphosis"" by Kafka, where a man finds himself transformed into a cockroach one day and finds how his life or he himself turns out to be totally inadequate. The story plays upon the ""what if.."" - things would be so great if I were somebody else, what if I were John Malkovich, or if a part of me I don't like could be erased, like in Eternal Sunshine... Existentialism holds that it's ridiculous to think you could be somebody else, as there would be no you anymore. The self-responsible, self-creating individual cannot take shortcuts without failure, as we can see in the case of Joel, who chooses to delete all of his memories of a past girlfriend, only to find that he really needs them. Most of this movie takes place in his mind. Like ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" feels like a European movie shot in Hollywood. It's just a great movie, with extremely good, natural performances (Kate Winslet rightfully received her Oscar nomination for this role). Just go and check the Awards and Nominations list.

As far as the latter is concerned, he did a good job, but WHAT ABOUT THE ACTORS? Damn, they were great. Well they were all good, and Kate Winslet was great. She really played her character excellently. I just loved her and I could just imagine, sitting there, how it must have been for Clementine with Joel and for Joel with Clementine and yet I felt it was more due to Winslet's performance than with Carrey's. I do not know what it is with her, and I definitely DO NOT like all of her movies (although I've seen a lot and hate none). I sense an Oscar nomination for both her and Carrey. Although I think she'll walk away with one (for this OR Finding Neverland which I have not seen yet) and Carrey will not.",

I have NO IDEA why this movie is rated #33 on IMDb! That just shows how weird people are. Maybe I wasn't all that interested in the characters and their interaction or development, but rather it was awkward, confusing, and such a waste. I didn't like the characters AT ALL, and there wasn't really any good chemistry between them. They were miserable together, and they ended it, and then they chose to give it another shot, even if it will be miserable again! Now, I give them the credit for going along for the ride - but relationships aren't supposed to be like that. There are actually good relationships out there, but this superficial world seeking for pleasure in temporal and destroying substances is indicative and portrayed in this movie. It's interesting that they needed alcohol to make things romantic, always. It shows a lot about their character, and the character of those people who loved the movie! I just couldn't wait for the movie to END! This movie is really terrible. It made me dizzy and confused. I had NO GOOD feelings come out of it, and felt I had wasted 2 hours of my life.

536,2 April 2005,Son_of_Mansfield,10, The absolute brilliance of Charlie Kaufman.,"My best picture of 2004 is a love story in reverse as a man attempts to erase his lover. As with Memento, this movie would work backwards, forwards, and sideways. It is an extremely well written character piece with a lot of wit and intelligence about how some things can't be erased. Joel and Clem, well played by Jim Carrey(snubbed again by Oscar) and Kate Winslet, are two full, distinct characters. Joel is a completely average man with nothing to lose who sees only the flaws in himself. Clem is seemingly the opposite, a lively, one of a kind woman who ignores or drowns what is wrong with herself. One of the many great aspects of this movie is the idea that there are little things that we say and do that expose us more than we could ever imagine, that are only recognized in hindsight. These two people, who seem so different, are really two sides of the same coin when you examine them more closely. Clem becomes more like Joel as he attempts to be more like her. This pegs the idea that everyone is in a state of flux with certain characteristics emerging and receding at will. Then, there is the oily Patrick, who uses Joel's memories to seduce Clem. Who hasn't thought, when they liked a girl or a guy who was with someone, that if they could just do what that person does, that they could be the one? I know I have thought that before. The ending is amazing. Unlike other romantic films which tend to make a union seem so easy, this movie's ending isn't full of hope, but it is completely natural ending for this shaky couple. This script is nothing short of mind boggling in it's depth and is brought to vivid life by the stellar cast. I wasn't a big fan of Being John Malcovich or Human Nature, but I was intrigued by Adaptation and I am won over by Charlie Kaufman with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I can't wait to see what he will come up with next.",

Also, i found it unnecessarily confusing (which i feel may have been deliberate, but ultimately not beneficial to the film). Above all, though, i just couldn't bring myself to empathize with the lead characters. What can i say? I just don't like Jim Carrey or Kate Winslet. To me, Jim Carrey has yet to convincingly play a serious role, and i've honestly never liked Kate Winslet in anything she's been in.

Charlie Kaufman's screenplay tells the story of a world where there is a company called the gap, a company that erases people from their memories so that they do not suffer. In this world there are Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) A passionate couple who insist on forgetting each other, seems like a simple script, but he comes from a genius aligned with a complete simplicity that touches, from his argument Kaufman could elaborate a mega future, where several couples erase, the Consequences, etc, etc., etc. But not Kaufman simply tells the story of a couple in love. ""Eternal Brightness of a Mind Without Remembrance"" shows us the power of love, shows us the importance of pain, erase a person from memory and end suffering, is not evolutionary, we learn from pain, from suffering, even by erasing The memories come back to make the same mistake - As shown 2x in the film - we fall in love with the same people, because the feeling of love is beyond the comprehensible, this film is one of those that we should watch in different times of our lives that with certainty We will have completely different interpretations, it is a film that will survive the test of time, because its theme will always be and will always be a highlight because it is intrinsic to the human being, the eternal brightness of love will always shine in a mind, even if it does not know. We have many merits for Kaufman, but we can not forget Michel Gondry who can cinematically reproduce Kaufman's abstract script, with scenes that refer to Lynch, Michel uses and abuses the camera, with tight, focused plans, playing with light, blurring and Playing with the dimensionality of the screen, always maintaining a palette of blue colors, photography is the least cameleão of the film, with a beautiful and unique soundtrack, it sends all the joy of the discovery mixed with the anguish and sadness of forgetfulness, despite the Confused time line, and to constantly lose its rhythm, and even to take away the climax created in its secondary history, the film technically enchants with its resources and translations of the human psyche, mainly because it is simple and real. It seems that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are changed, Jim making a focused and focused character and Kate making a laughable and funny character, fun, curious and cheerful, are 2 spectacular actors, Jin manages to pass an incredible dramatic charge, and Kate is gorgeous, In addition, we have a generally wonderful cast. We can conclude by saying that the film goes beyond a common cinematographic work, it appeals to the feeling, it not only appeals, it touches, it causes reflection, it is a film that we have to watch every 5 years, every stage of life, We will see how we will have different interpretations and reactions of the same, finally, we have a work that walks along the linear of the perfection.",

I think the acting was fine and that Jim Carey is a great actor, but, unfortunately, the movie was just so boring. Also, I do not think there is anything novel about the idea of erasing one's memories of a person to try to make your life easier for you after a breakup, or trying to recapture these memories once you realize you love them (the action flick total recall, and I'm sure, a bunch of other flicks have such concepts). This movie is just a sappy love story that is way too psychedelic for my tastes. The weirdness of it all and the constant frenzy to retain memories and the weird special effects actually gets annoying after awhile and detracts away from the central theme of love in the film because it is too mind distorting. In short, this film is good for sappy artsy fartsy people who enjoy commenting about how unique something is, when really; it's not that original and actually gives you a psychedelic headache.",

It is also a political movie in the best possible sense, the American pioneer myth of being able to forget the past and start all over again being given an extraordinary twist. Altogether a great work of art, worth seeing again and again and again. Strides ahead of MALKEVICH and ADAPTATION, those excellent movies can be seen as very enjoyable apprentice projects.

Gondry's film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind explores love in a different way; what happens when its over, and you want to move on by destroying what had happened before. Can somebody continue living life after forgetting events that had occurred to him or her years ago? This concept is very unique, quite bizarre, but is handled so perfectly it speaks to the soul, becomes food for thought, and is a blessing disguised in 108 minutes of deep, insightful popcorn entertainment. Flawlessly written by Kaufman and Gondry, wonderfully acted by Carrey and Winslet, and beautifully directed by Gondry, Eternal Sunshine is a bittersweet movie that should bring out tears of joy and despair in anyone that has been through the highs and lows of love.",

So goes the secondary label of the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a rom-com sci-fi drama by Michel Gondry. This quirky, uniquely funny story uses elements of a psychological thriller and nonlinear narrative to explore the nature of memory and love.
Joel Barish, a broken man who crashes and burns over his ex-girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski, finds out that she has erased him from her memory by hiring Lacuna Inc., a firm performing such brain damage procedures in their clients' sleep. Enraged, he decides to do the same to her, but only to hit the rock bottom reality of his persistent love for her midway through the procedure. How will he deal with the erasing Clementine in his sleep? How will he manage to keep her memory when he wakes up in the morning? What does it take to forget the past and start anew? Charlie Kaufman, known for his use of warped logic, gives the answer beautifully in a tale of love that lives but doesn't last.
The Academy Award winning surreal screenplay by Charlie Kaufman entangles and unentangles upon a multilayered story by Kaufman, Gondry and Pierre Bismuth. Ellen Kuras and her positively flimsy cinematography synchronize romantically with Jon Brion's Oscar winning soundtrack giving flavour to what Eternal Sunshine stands for.
Equally praiseworthy are the performances by all. Carrey and Winslet work magic and acquaint you to Joel and Clementine powerfully, supporting Kaufman's character foundation. There's a precision in the mechanism of the film as it unfolds and blends together all the performances giving rise to one of the greatest films of 21st century.
Interestingly, the pivotal character is that of Mary Svevo, the receptionist at Lacuna. Kirsten Dunst fulfills Mary's emotional portrayal effectively, stealing the screen from Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood playing Mary's colleagues Stan and Patrick and Tom Wilkinson as Mary's boss, Howard Mierzwiak. Proof is the title scene where Mary recites a quotation from 'Eloisa To Abelard' which is probably a scene that'll be remembered for years in the cinematic universe.
When the credits roll in, Eternal Sunshine ensures you leave the theatre with wet eyes and a bloomed heart. The movie talks about all the mess of an adult relationship with wisdom. It leaves you wondering whether the time of events matters in a relationship. And when all is said and done, we know how blessed one can be to share a bond like Joel and Clementine.",
591,6 April 2007,jeremy3,7, Beautiful photography. A little too Simplistic plot.,"The photography in this film was beautiful. Surrealistic scenes reminiscent of a Fellini film. Carey was brilliant as ever as a depressed lover who can't seem to be able to pay enough attention or have enough say-so in how his relations are going. Enter a new concept, have your memory of a relationship erased at a clinic. While the main character's memory is being erased, he ponders over all the mistakes and sagas of his relationship that failed. By the end, you realize that Carey and his lost lover (Winslet) really did find a niche with each other - and is knowing that every relation may end, but that shouldn't stop you from trying. The main flaw of the movie is that it sounds like an idea tried out on the old Twilight Zone. I will need to look into this. The movie seems a bit too formulaic, and expects us to be in constant awe that one's memory can be erased through a computer program.",
592,20 October 2004,CelluloidRehab,9, Blows yours mind. Literally !!,"This is a movie about a couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). Clementine decides she is unhappy and undergoes a procedure where all her memories of Joel are erased from her mind. When Joel finds out, he decides to undergo the same procedure. Another masterpiece from Charlie Kaufman. Where Adaptation is about Charlie himself and about a screenplay he is writing, this movie goes back to the brain trek from Being John Malkovich. This movie makes commentary on relationships, memories, reality, and the Pandora's box that is technology and medicine. The overall theme that I perceived was most relevant is that without memory or a recollection of the past we are inevitably forced to repeat it (whether we realize it or not). Also that painful, traumatic memories sometimes go hand in hand with the happy memories. When one starts to erase the unhappy ones, so go the happy ones. This is a great movie and I recommended it to everyone.",

Few films today are successful at touching the viewer emotionally, and if anything, this one does TOO good of a job. So i commend the cast and crew of this film for their excellent work.

Interestingly, that Jim Carrey's best films were his two dramas, this and The Truman Show (also based on a science fiction concept of an artificial city of actors that created an artificial life for the one non-actor in the city, Carrey). That's fundamentally because comedies lack the dramatic firepower and affecting depth that can be reached by drama.

624,1 May 2004,Tiger_Mark,10, Can you erase fate ?,"It seems like Hollywood is fascinated with the question of whether things are destined to happen or whether freewill determines our actions. Donnie Darko delved into that issue in a brilliant, but somewhat complex way. In ""Eternal Sunshine"" we are treated to an examination of the stated issue, but in a clear and rather easy to understand way. Joel has had a both wonderful and difficult relationship with Clementine. However, after the fun has ceased to be, Clementine decides to call the whole thing off, actually, she attempts to erase all memories of the relationship. By using a new type of medical procedure, one can remove all memories about something you no longer care to remember. Just think of it, taking your most traumatic memories at getting rid of them forever. Of course, Joel is not aware that Clementine has done this. When heartbroken Joel finds out, he decides that turn about is fair play, so he will cancel his memories of her out. However, as Joel soon discovers, relationships might always end badly, but they were not always bad. Can Joel keep the good times in his memory? If meeting someone is fate, can two people destined for one another really be prevented from meeting or forgotten?

The main drawback of ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" was the sloooow deadpan pace of the film. This movie was in desperate need of more humor. In fact, the few humorous moments were the highlight of the whole darn thing. It also needed to ditch the subplots - very boring - and spend more time on the romance or in Jim Carrey's mind. Charlie Kaufmann had a great concept, but I can't say he delivered. Elijah Wood is also going to have a tough time excelling at not being Frodo.

The movie is directed by French Director, Michel Gondry. Gondry always brings some absurd stories for his movies like in ""The Science of Sleep"" (2006) which I also like very much. The story is about dreaming the past but only you can actually feel it as it just happens at the present time. Sometimes it happens based on what you remember. Thiz is an interesting part, at one of the scenes the two characters (Carrey and Winslet) have interaction with each other and then they are surrounded by people who have blank faces, because Carrey's character don't remember how the people look like, so the scene describes those people with blank faces. The Director is so lucky to get Carrey and Winslet in appropriate time, Carrey who just desperately wants some serious drama beside his comedian roles, and Winslet wants to prove her true acting skill after ""Titanic"" (1997). Thiz movie doesn't contain an extraordinary storyline, but surely it can reflect the description about how the event happens.",

655,8 November 2004,slofstra,6, Why the movie doesn't work ...,"These comments are mainly directed to those who have seen the movie. If you haven't seen it, by all means do. My tag line is a little misleading, because in some ways the movie does work. By co-incidence I've recently viewed both this movie and ""The Matrix"" for the first time. Both movies use the technique of 'mediated reality', where the main characters lie prone for much of the movie while they are 'fed' a version of reality: a virtual reality in the case of The Matrix, or a dream sequence in the case of this movie. The problem with the use of this technique is that the reality space of the movie risks becoming non-contiguous with that of the viewer - viewers may not be able to relate to what they are seeing. The technique does allow the director a great deal of latitude in the turns the movie will take, and one tends to feel off-balance because everything is so unpredictable. In the case of The Matrix, I became annoyed with the way in which 'Neo's superpowers were simply escalated to get him out of any given situation. (Good eye-candy though). While 'Sunshine' is a much more intellectually interesting movie than The Matrix, I'm still left a little cold. Does this movie relate to anything in my life, or offer any relevant insight into our experience in general? Relevance to our experiecne is not precluded by the use of 'mediated reality' as a technique. The Truman Show, for example, is very relevant to our post-modern experience. But this movie doesn't say much to me, beyond trying to be very clever. Perhaps whatever message is there, needed to be made more explicit. (Or perhaps I'm too old or too thick, take your pick). The final section of the movie, where the leads resume their love affair, offered possibilities, but ended too soon. ",

Gondry's visuals give this movie a very particular touch, but they constitute a limitation, too, in that one would like to see Gondry's directing talent emerge in a very ordinary setting, without the frills that characterize his videos. Will he be able to stand the normality of an everyday life drama/comedy? He has to prove that video directors can be great movie directors without making a 2-hour version of the videos they're used to directing. Anyway, Gondry has succeeded where other high-profile video directors have failed (see Joseph Kahn's ""Torque"", which is as badly edited and confused as his U2 ""Elevation"" or Britney ""Toxic"" videos, or Mark Romanek's ""One hour photo"", which is so clean and neat it's almost boring like Lenny Kravitz ""if you can't say no"" or Jay-Z ""99 problems"").",

In a hurry, he ditches his usual train, and hops into another train to Montauk, where he meets and falls in love with an impulsive girl, Clementine, only to know later that, it wasn't the first time he was meeting her.",

I'm sorry to say but is was a very big disappointment. The theme was interesting, but not THAT interesting to look at. Two great actors in strange shots. 50 % of the shots should be erased and filmed again. More picture than story. I don't understand the vote of 8.6 and I'm curious why people are that positive. I read the comments and still doesn't understand. I watch about 2 of 3 movies a week. That doesn't make me a specialist, but I had to make this comment ! And I'm not the only one who doesn't understand. Donnie Darko : great movie. Adaptation : also. But this : I voted 2. Could not make more of it.",
689,15 December 2013,z-samanta,8, Great ending to a thought-provoking movie,"The ending was great. It shows that no relationship will go perfectly all the way. At one point or another, it will turn sour, you will be bored, you will feel like you don't know her at all. Why is she like this, this is not the person I knew. Truth is, no one is perfect. There is no such thing as a 'spotless mind'. A quote goes like this 'it's not about finding a perfect person, but loving an imperfect person perfectly'. As the relationship goes, you will find a lot of things that you may not like from her. But before you give up and just throw it all away, reminisce the memories you have. You have to feel it, what made you crazy over her? What made you love her so much in the first place? Being with a person is to accept her fully, her good and dark side, any kind of shitty baggage she brings with her. You don't deserve her best if you can't even stand by her in her worst.",

Gondry and Kaufman's film collaboration is phenomenal. It's a film that started a new era of film making in this clichéd genre, setting aside every other film of 2004 and undeniably making it the best.",
692,28 December 2004,rokkomanguitar,7, good but not brilliant,"The fundamental problem with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is that, unlike the other films made from Charlie Kaufman's original screenplays - Adaptation, Being John Malkovich - there's really basically only one idea at work here. The acting is excellent (probably the best work that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have ever done, and kudos to the great English character actor Tom Wilkinson), the digital effects are great, and the elliptical plot is quite emotionally moving for something so clever, but once you know what's going on (and i'm not going to ruin it by saying what it is) then all you can do is sit back and wait for the Halloweenish funfair ride to finish. The great thing about seeing Being John Malkovich for the first time was the sheer mind-blowing inventiveness of the story, which left you constantly wondering what the hell was going to happen next; and likewise for Adaptation, which was just as original but had even more layers upon layers and circles within circles that Kaufman's laser beam of a brain always managed to refer back to the various disparate threads of the plot(s) without letting the whole thing dissolve into a self-canceling tangled mess. Even though the ideas and the intellect on display in the writing of these films are dazzling in their brilliance they still manage to move your heart as well as your brain, and while Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind will also make you laugh out loud at certain scenes and (possibly) cry in others, it's my opinion that maybe if Spike Jonze - who directed Adaptation and Malkovich - had directed this one as well then he would have pushed Kaufman creatively a bit more, because by halfway through the movie you pretty much know what's going to happen for the rest of it. I did really enjoy it but i'm looking forward even more to the next Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonze collaboration which is currently in production.",

Jim Carrey and Kate sucked with their acting as the movie went on in the similar sucking manner.......",
695,11 August 2004,ALauff,8, One of the year's best so far,"This inspired inquiry into dreams and memory—suffused, like ""Waking Life,"" with certain metaphysical questions: Can we exert control over our dreams? Can our waking actions be affected?—is proficiently anchored by both Gondry's visualization of memories being ripped from the protean grasp of desire and the heart-rending account of an afflicted couple trying to outwit their own self-destructive impulses. It seems that after his ambitious but not quite satisfying attempt to climb inside the artist's head during creative constipation and compromise (Adaptation), Charlie Kaufman has found a director who can not only evoke his flighty genius in image, but who can reign in and expand his ideas. And it is a rare film that can so skillfully say opposing things about the nature of relationships: They end in suffering and misery between hopelessly incongruous people, but they still require careful consideration and a selfsame willingness to suffer despite the stacked odds. Hell of a conundrum.",

700,9 July 2017,newblu,8, Peep This Reviews,This some how manages to be the most unique and wonderful romantic comedy/drama ever but also the most depressing. Anyone who has ever gone through the break up of a serious relationship will identify with this film. Easily one of Jim Carrey's best roles. He masterfully handles the mix of drama and restrained humor.,
701,22 March 2004,victor7754,9, An exploration of time and human emotion.,"Eternal Sunshine is a cleverly crafted film put together by an entourage of gifted artists. The script is superb. The film contains the element of memory, an item that has been popular in films since the wonderous Memento put it to good use.  What if you could erase someone out of your life and have no recollection of any events, thoughts, ideas, epiphanies, love, spite, anger, revenge... foregiveness...? Sounds absurd? The film tries to make us believe that some people would risk an unsafe ""unwarranted"" brain scanner to probe areas of their mind...manipulating time and emotion. Somehow, it works.  There is a marvel to the idea and the film pulls off a unique exploration of it as we walk at times through the mind of Carrey and yearn for him to beat the system and save his only happiness, Kate Winslet who reacts terrifically to Carrey's dopish goofiness.",
702,21 November 2020,Mcnabbbeasty,9, The Gem of Gems; Eternal Sunshine is An Unforgettable Piece of Art,"Kaufman's greatest piece of work? I watched this film for the first time at around 10 years old; I had no idea what was going on but could tell there was something unique and special about it. Watching it again at 23, I view ""Eternal Sunshine"" as a trippy masterpiece of emotional depth. This film brings alternative romance (if that's even a genre) to a new level. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both should of won oscars and the movie itself should of been best picture acknowledged. This film is a beautifully tender and dreamy experience that i will always regard as one of my favorites. A true gem.",
703,12 May 2023,sanadalsalt,8," Erased Embrace: A Journey through Love, Loss, and Rediscovery","This movie delves deep into the themes of loss, regret, and the desire to forget painful memories that haunt us. Jim and Kate portray a couple who experienced a difficult breakup despite their profound love for each other. Jim's character seeks the services of a company that enters people's homes while they sleep to locate and eliminate painful memories. What makes this movie intriguing is the internal struggle Jim's character faces as he grapples with holding onto the memories he initially wanted erased. It serves as a poignant exploration of how our choices shape us and the subsequent pain or reward they bring. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet deliver exceptional performances in this film.",
704,4 May 2019,Andreus3000,10," How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.","The movie is a labyrinth created by the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play Joel and Clementine, in a movie that sometimes feels like an endless series of aborted Meet Cutes. That they lose their minds while all about them are keeping theirs is a tribute to their skill; they center their characters so that we can actually care about them even when they're constantly losing track of their own lives.
The movie is a radical example of Maze Cinema, that style in which the story coils back upon itself, redefining everything and then throwing it up in the air and redefining it again. To reconstruct it in chronological order would be cheating, but I will cheat: At some point before the technical beginning of the movie, Joel and Clementine were in love, and their affair ended badly, and Clementine went to Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) at Lacuna Inc., to have Joel erased from her mind.
Discovering this, Joel in revenge applies to have his memories of her erased. But the funny thing about love is, it can survive the circumstances of its ending; we remember good times better than bad ones, and Joel decides in mid-process that maybe he would like to remember Clementine after all. He tries to squirrel away some of his memories in hidden corners of his mind, but the process is implacable.
For Jim Carrey, this is another successful attempt, like ""The Truman Show"" and the underrated ""The Majestic,"" to extend himself beyond screwball comedy. He has an everyman appeal, and here he dials down his natural energy to give us a man who is so lonely and needy that a fragment of memory is better than none at all. Kate Winslet is the right foil for him, exasperated by Joel's peculiarities while paradoxically fond of them. The shenanigans back at Lacuna belong on a different level of reality, but even there, secrets are revealed that are oddly touching.
The insight of ""Eternal Sunshine"" is that, at the end of the day, our memories are all we really have, and when they're gone, we're gone.",

BIG WARNING HERE: If you are susceptible to motion sickness, do NOT try to watch this movie. It's filmed mostly handheld, not steadycam, and the constant jiggling of the camera nearly made me barf.  I had to leave the movie about halfway through and find out from my family what happened in the second half.",
706,10 July 2006,Data1,10, Amazing!,"I love this film! I'm not usually into romance films, but this film is so unique. It's quirky and by no means generic. The story is not put together in chronological order, so some people don't get its brilliance. I personally LOVE the way the film is done, and Kate Winslet's character and performance is great.(Clementine is so wonderfully eccentric!). Jim Carrey delivers an equally great performance(Joel is sensitive and introverted, not traits you often attribute to Jim Carrey, but he plays it SO well!). It deals with themes like the pain of love, consequences of actions and even the boundaries of science (in regards to memory erasure). This film is thought provoking but not soppy. Watch this film! it's amazing!",
707,12 July 2005,acrisisblog,8, are certain memories worth keeping?,"The title comes from the poem ""Eloisa to Abelard"" by Alexander Pope. It is so nice to know our screenwriters are literate in our pop culture that rarely 'quotes' anymore. Charlie Kaufman penned this one as well as ""Being John Malkovich"" so he is very much into getting into our heads. If you could wipe the memories of a love affair gone sour, would you? Time has a way of helping us with painful memories, so that eventually only the good memories remain, should we accelerate the process? Relationships, the fabric of humanity, is what we are all about, finding them, enjoying them, hating them, leaving them. Every couple in divorce court filled with disappointment and anger once sat looking into each others eyes, feeling madly in love. The film is a little choppy at times, but you can navigate the course. The point is that every couple has strengths, weaknesses and it can be easy to forget the good bits in a bad moment. So what would be the consequences if your partner had the memories of you erased after your relationship hit a bump in the road? It's a thoughtful story, and will add a bit to your intellectual repertoire if you have ventured away from your romantic poets.",

709,7 January 2005,jcavhs,5, I don't understand the hype,"One of my friends asked me to watch this movie with her saying that it is a fantastic movie. I agree and I was very disappointed. It has an interesting premise but I thought that what was done was very boring. I spent most of the time wondering how much longer it had to go. I don't know if you were supposed to figure out that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's character met again after they had their memories of each other erased, but I figured it out about 10 minutes into the film. From there, I was pretty much able to guess what would happen. I felt that Jim Carrey did do a good job acting. I just wish there had been less footage of him unconscious on the bed. I also felt that the antics of the technician and secretary were completely unnecessary to the plot.",

Life is only a pause in time, all meaning in the moment it happens. No matter how many times you repeat, when you meet love again, you will still feel that the world is beautiful.",
