0,20 April 2014,lee_eisenberg,10," nothing can show us the full brutality of slavery, but this comes close","Solomon Northup's story of his kidnapping and sale into slavery got widely read upon its original publication but then disappeared as the Confederates built up an idealized image of the antebellum south (exemplified in ""Gone with the Wind""). Now that Northup's story has gotten brought to the screen, it's important for everyone to see it. ""12 Years a Slave"" not only takes an uncompromising look at the sheer brutality of slavery, but also shows how nothing could take away Northup's dignity and his hope that he would one day be a free man again. One of the ugliest scenes is the whipping of a slave for perceived disobedience.",/

5,24 February 2014,Sergeant_Tibbs,9, 12 Years A Slave earns the right to be called one of the best films of the year.,"If any contemporary director deserves to be in the mainstream spotlight without compromising their style, it's Steve McQueen. His debut, Hunger, already had the hand of a confident filmmaker taking a fly-on-the-wall style to the grimy art-house. Shame was one of the finest films of its year for its impeccable depiction of an addiction to one of humanity's primal survival instincts resulting in self-destruction. I'm so happy that his latest film has gracefully conquered early Oscar favourites from the output of David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and the now delayed film from George Clooney to become this year's Oscar frontrunner. During its festival run when the buzz first began, I took it upon myself to read the screenplay. While I can usually sink scripts within a few hours, the poetic density of 12 Years A Slave took several sittings across a week or two. Even on the page it was a harrowing, exhausting experience. It's a film that needs a have a gut to truly display the length of time, but the script is bloated in its brilliance.",e

7,19 March 2014,asda-man,10, 12 minutes of heartbreak (plus an extra 140),"Steve Mcqueen is proving himself to be a director to look out for. I wasn't a huge fan of his debut, Hunger, as I found it too pro-IRA and slow. However, I thought that the directing was pretty outstanding and it had a distinct style. Shame is a film I've yet to see, but I've heard plenty of rave reviews. 12 Years a Slave looks to be Mcqueen's masterpiece. It's film-making at it's most effective and powerful. I cam away from the film feeling incredibly moved as I sat there in silence along with the rest of the crowd as the credits came up. 12 Years a Slave dares to bare all in a way that most mainstream films would be afraid of doing. Mcqueen shows all the unflinching brutality to create an overwhelming sense of power. I'm used to watching harrowing and depressing films, but these are normally little known like, Dancer in the Dark and The Seventh Continent. 12 Years a Slave is very much mainstream, yet I still found it incredibly harrowing and brutal. Mainstream audiences are go to in for a nasty shock.",/
8,12 January 2014,gsygsy,10, As high as cinema can go,"It's rare that a movie lives up to its hype, even rarer that the hype is transcended by the actual achievement. 12 YEARS A SLAVE does both. Aided by powerful performances and cinematography, director McQueen exposes the barbarity of dehumanisation, of treating people as property. Reviews focus on the brutality on display, and it's true that the film is not easy to watch, with its powerful juxtaposition of sublime scenery and human degradation. But to me the final scene is the most powerful of all: we are party to the kind of raw emotion that in the hands of lesser artists could easily descend into tawdriness or sentimentality. Here, as in the rest of the film, it is raised up high, as high as cinematic art can go.",r
9,22 September 2013,tigerfish50,9, Abducted to a Southern hell,"Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana, which is backed up by legal records.",w
10,26 November 2013,tavm,10, 12 Years a Slave is quite a compelling depiction of slavery at its most harrowing,"Just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working friend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home state) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who paid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and I have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I highly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here. Oh, and nice shots of the Louisiana locations.",5
11,20 October 2013,maurice_yacowar,9, Black northerner sold into slavery and survives,"Like the whipping scenes we uncomfortably witness, in 12 Years a Slave the sting comes in the tail. The end titles tell us neither the slave pen manager nor Solomon Northup's kidnappers were punished. Solomon is saved, but that individual justice does not redefine the terrible system. Racism, slavery and savage injustice persist at film's end. Of course, the point is that even after the Civil War, the freeing of the slaves, the Civil Rights Movement and its legal and societal successes, racism and injustice persist. Hardly a major daily newspaper passes without a reminder, whether it's a regressive change in the voters' rights laws or a Florida bully justified in ""standing his ground"" against the unarmed black kid he hunted. 12 Years a Slave reminds us what contemporary America grew out of and where too much of its roots remain.

12,9 September 2013,LetwitJr,10, Another masterpiece from McQueen,"I attended the premiere of 12 Years a Slave at the Toronto International Film Festival. Having no tickets, we had to wait close to 4 hours hoping they might let us in. I have to say it was definitely worth the wait and it is hands down the best film I've seen at the festival. ",3
13,19 March 2014,binducherungath,10, Soulfully depicts the human tragedy...,"Twelve Years a Slave is an adaptation of the 1853 memoir of the same name by Solomon Northup, a New-York state born free Negro who was kidnapped in Washington D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for twelve years before his release. It is depressing, sad, annoying, frustrating to watch what Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) went through his 12 years as a slave. A great performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor whose act of bewilderment, despair, anguish, trying to survive is just outstanding. There are moments when with no sound and little movement, he projects what hopelessness looks like. His 12 years of unthinkable abuse, backbreaking labour, fading dreams of happy family, desperateness to figure a way out to his freedomevery act moves us. The brutality, dehumanizing acts of the masters make it so tough to even look at the screen.",0

16,23 April 2017,Kingslaay,9, A Powerful film experience,12 Years a Slave is a shocking and brutal look at slavery and the reality for many during those horrible times. It does shy away from the harsh realities of slave life and viewer does not get a veiled look of their lives. It is this journey and story of Solomon Northup that makes this a beautiful film. Without warning a respectable and free man is taken away from his family to the inhumane life of slavery. Harsh truths of life during those times are shown at a nonstop pace. It is also interesting to note the disparities that existed within a country from free states to slave states. On some level viewers might even relate to Solomon's plight. What if one of us was displaced from our comfy lives and put in an unknown and foreign place where people didn't care about laws and men? ,0
17,3 November 2013,george.schmidt,10, One of the year's very best; Ejiofor gives an Oscar-worthy performance in courage.,"12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) **** Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Brad Pitt, Garrett Dillahunt, Michael K. Williams,  Kelsey Scott, Quvenzhane Wallis, Cameron Zeigler, Scoot McNairy, Christopher Berry, Bill Camp, Devyn A. Tyler, Willo Jean-Baptiste. Remarkable true- life account of slavery in America based on the biography of freeman African-American Solomon Northup (Ejiofor in an incredible performance that is truly Oscar-worthy), who is tricked and abducted while on a trip from New York to Washington and sold into slavery against his will where he burdens many hardships in his long journey into hell. John Ridley's powerful adaptation of Northup's book is a surprisingly clear-eyed, warts-and-all blinding depiction of how history can be a personal gauntlet in spite of the tremendous odds against surviving. Filmmaker Steve McQueen uses all the archetypes of the Southern 'hospitality' usually seen in the genre of a Civil War treatise but doesn't flinch at all in the underpinnings of what is a true blight of humanity. Equally powerful in their acting (and award noticing) are Fassbender as Solomon's cruelest master with nothing but pure hatred broiling at the surface and a heartbreaking stoic turn by newcomer Nyong'o as the 'personal' slave he terrorizes to no end. One of the year's very best films.",/

Therefore, if I'm going to see a film about a horrible subject (which I'm not opposed to), I want to feel like I'm being subjected to it for a reason. I want to feel that the filmmaker has something to add to the conversation about it, draws some conclusions, makes a point that hasn't already been made. Otherwise, I feel like that much more badness has been added to my life for little purpose.",r
20,29 January 2014,bkoganbing,9, Degradation and Despair,"During the days of the big studio system slavery was a topic that was generally avoided. The standard interpretation of the era's history made such work as Birth Of A Nation and later Gone With The Wind the way we saw the era. It was the Civil Rights Revolution that opened a lot eyes and now with a bit of perspective there, a film like the incredible true story 12 Years A Slave could be made.",e
21,11 January 2014,ironhorse_iv,9, A powerful movie that brings in new light to the dark topic of slavery.,"12 Years a Slave is indeed a very powerful movie. Directed by Steve McQueen, and written by John Ridley, the movie is an adaptation of the 1853 autobiography by Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a New York State-born free man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery in the South. Chiwetel Ejiofor did a great job, acting as Solomon Northup, and it wouldn't surprise me, if he wins a couple of awards for it. The supporting cast is just as amazing. I give mad props to both Benedict Cumberbatch, and Michael Fassbender for their performance as plantation owner, beloved William Ford and crude Edwin Epps. There are too many powerful performances scenes to count, but I had to choice some, it would be, the scene where Solomon is nearly lynch by John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and he is just hanging out there, while the other slaves couldn't do anything about it. Last is the trials and misfortune of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) with her being abuse by both Epps and his evil wife played by Sarah Paulsen. The movie doesn't have too much over the top moments, and seem very accurate. The movie puts a lot of insight, you wouldn't see in much modern movies today. First off, there is the good heart, slave owner William Ford. You would never see that in any other movie, as movies about slavery have all slave owners as a crude one-dimension evil human beings. Second off, you wouldn't see a white field hand (Garret Dillahunt) working besides the slaves in other films. To accurately depict the time period of the film, the filmmakers did a great job capturing the language, the look, and locations of the time. Still, the film did take artistic license, and create some new drama like the scene where a sailor kill a slave. One thing, I didn't like about the film is some of the music. Don't get me wrong, I found the songs, Roll Jordan Roll, and the classical American folk music great, but the soundtrack by Han Zimmer is kinda sound not new. Most of the emotional music being play in the background, remind me too much of 'Time' from Han Zimmer's 2010 soundtrack for the film, 'Inception'. It's seem recycled. Another thing that is bothering people is the flow of the film over the 12 years. It seems to go, really quick over the years. When he was kidnapped in the beginning, his children were kids and he looked about mid 30's. Throughout the movie he doesn't look any older at all or aged. The point is, they could have done was to add the age look for the characters because you can't tell that 12 years are going by or let us know that time is passing by. But it didn't feel like 12 years for me. It more felt like a matter of about 4 months. Maybe if they had showed seasons changing or done makeup on the actors to show them getting older it would have been better. About the brutality of the film, it was there, it wasn't too gruesome in my opinion. It was a lot harder to watch 1997's Amistad than this. I wouldn't say, this movie is for all audience, but I do agree, young mature adults should watch it. I don't find the movie, putting a white guilt to anybody, nor do I say, this is a movie trying to start hatred against whites for their ancestor mistakes. If anything, it is part of the healing process, for the most part, I found myself, not anger, but understanding what people went through back then. Most black audiences would agree with me. I have to say, all people of every race need to see this film, even if it's not teaching you anything new that you don't already know. The reason why people should see this film is indeed, while slavery seems like old practice, it still acts upon the modern world through sex trade, and the misused of illegal workers. Such modern sense of slavery need to quickly end. Indeed, if you like this movie, do check out, 1984's TV movie, Solomon Northup's Odyssey starting Avery Brooks. It's well done as well. Overall: While it did had a limited release, it is a must watch.",f
22,8 March 2014,bbewnylorac,8, Good film,"As a non-American, I find it really interesting that so many reviewers here are uncomfortable with the explicit violence and nastiness portrayed in this film. How could it possibly be true? They seem to say. Surely Americans have never been that vicious and uncaring? But for hundreds of years, some of them were, and this film depicts it well. It's not a pleasant film but it does hold your attention and would make an excellent film for history classes. The film's creators depict Edwin Epps, the main slave owner, as an unapologetic bigot, manipulator, rapist and sadist. Generations of slave traders lived their lives like this. The slave of the film's title, Samuel Northup, did, at least, live some of his life in the relative comfort of the North, but it's sobering to realise that generations of slaves lived in total misery, with no way out of their situation. I found Brad Pitt's small role -- as the saviour who contact Samuel's friends and family, who rescue Northup from slavery -- as a little patronising. I.e. the white guy who saves the day for the black guy. But my companion pointed out that often blacks' only hope would have been someone helping them.",_

In 1841, he is lured by two men who hire him to play his violin. When they arrive in Washington, he is abducted and given the false identity of a runaway slave. He is smuggled back into the deep south to be sold to the somewhat kind William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). However he runs afoul of the jealous chief carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and Ford sells him to the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is the best cotton picker and she's constantly raped by Epps. His wife (Sarah Paulson) knows it and targets her anger on the helpless slave.

26,4 November 2013,PWNYCNY,10, A candid depiction of a depraved institution.,"This movie provides a candid and dramatically powerful depiction of the institution of slavery in the United States. This movie touches on and in some ways dives into the many different themes associated with the institution. First, the movie shows how it corrupted everyone involved in it. No matter what their involvement, the institution brought everyone down. Second, the movie dramatizes the political consequences of slavery, how slavery exacerbated sectional conflicts and distorted political discourse. Third, the movie dramatizes the deleterious psychological effects of slavery. Unwilling to come to honestly come to terms with the nature of the institution, the movie shows how slave owner rationalized their own conduct toward the slaves, with devastatingly tragic consequences. Fourth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the United States to follow its own creed of liberty and justice by showing how free blacks were denied the full protection of the law. Fifth, this movie dramatizes the essential barbarism and degeneracy of slavery in the way it brought out and validated the worst in people. Sixth, the movie shows how slavery was a form of state-sponsored vigilantism in the way an entire class of people were subject to the full weight of the state with absolutely no protection. Seventh, the movie pulls no punches in showing the brutality of the institution, e.g., graphic depictions of beatings, whippings, fighting, psychological torture, humiliation, dehumanization, inadequate food, clothing, shelter, and terrorism - all happening under the color of law. Eighth, movie dramatized how by 1841 there was those who already realized that the United States was heading toward a civil war. Ninth, the movie shows how economic self-interest drove slavery, that slavery was profitable. Tenth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the religious community to take action to end slavery and instead used scripture to justify slavery's existence. This movie features many excellent performances, most notably by Michael Fassbinder and Brad Pitt, the latter giving one of his better performances. As for Fassbinder, his performance warrants an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His portrayal of the angry, troubled, vicious slave owner who is deteriorating physically, mentally and spiritually carries this movie. This movie is worth watching. Don't expect an upbeat story, because it isn't. But do expect a powerful dramatic treatment of an unpleasant yet historically important subject.",_
27,29 March 2017,mihai_alexandru_chindris,10," What more can I say than ""wow""","This movie had a positive impact towards me because it made me realize the cruelty of others to enslave people to do the hard work for them, no matter what was it about and the irony that today we are still fighting for this kind of stuff, I mean human rights. It is impressive, by the story of a man, who struggles to keep his identity and dignity, in a period when slavery was like a dice game and you didn't know where life would bring you after. The life of the main character is like an odyssey, with good and very, very bad times, but I think this is all about life, in the end, to be smashed and moved backward, and then to get up and move even forward.",u
28,24 November 2013,Ajtlawyer,2, 2 hours of sadism,"I was hoping to really enjoy ""12 Years a Slave"" but wasn't expecting a 2 hr long movie of very long, ponderous slow camera shots of nature and hardly any compelling dialog or character development. This was then broken up seemingly every 10 minutes by a savage flogging or a vicious rape or some other sadistic cruelty being inflicted on the movie's hero, the hapless Solomon a freeman sold into slavery, and the other slaves. Except for Brad Pitt's Canadian abolitionist and a gentleman from Solomon's home town, virtually every white character in this movie is portrayed as the very embodiment of evil. No nuance, nothing but unremitting sadism.",r
29,12 March 2014,DarthVoorhees,10, The movie we needed...,'12 Years a Slave' is a hard film to assess and watch. I think I like what it represents as a piece about Hollywood almost more than the film it's self (don't take me the wrong way. The film is excellent). I recall seeing 'Django Unchained' last year and sadly thinking that Tarantino's cartoony spaghetti western with all it's eccentricities still probably portrayed slavery more accurately than any Hollywood film had up until that point. Along comes '12 Years a Slave' less than a year later and as I watched the film I couldn't stop thinking that this was what was needed. I've come to find that the Academy Award for Best Picture has nothing to do with a film's worth but I will say that this film deserved a Best Picture award to find an even broader audience. Steve McQueen and Chiwetel Ejiofor in one feel swoop have made a film together that so brutally destroys the myth of American exceptionalism. '12 Years a Slave' is much like the much heralded 'Schindler's List' in it's blunt depiction of historical evil but McQueen has no time or respect for Spielbergian catharsis. '12 Years a Slave' is a brutal and honest.,v
30,29 November 2013,meeza,9, Northup's Odyssey captured here!,"""12 Years A Slave"" is a powerful picture on the challenging struggle of real-life free-slave Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and put back to the horrors of slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor's name will be pronounced numerous times during movie awards season for his riveting starring performance as Northrup. In fact, the whole movie was freed from lousy acting with other impressive performances; most notably from Michael Fassbender as the villainous slaveowner Edwin Epps, Sarah Paulson as his horror story-esque sister Mistress Epps, and Lupita Nyong'O as the tortured slave Patsey. Director Steve McQueen's work here will propel him to elite auteur status. But believe it or not, John Ridley's screenplay was a bit too detached for my taste. Nevertheless, break the chains and witness for yourself the gripping ""12 Years A Slave"". **** Excellent",

33,18 October 2013,hal9341,10, Astonishing and heartbreaking,"I just saw this at LFF. It is a brilliant piece of cinema. Clearly it's central theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easily reach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about wider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It is violent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story of Solomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about the way Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it so astonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, not because the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heart strings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer. This really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough to understand it.",
34,10 March 2014,cosmo_tiger,6, Good & heartbreaking but just because its one of the most important movies of the year doesn't mean its the best movie,"""My name is Solomon Northrup. I'm a free man."" Solomon Northrup (Ejiofor) is a free man living in the north in the year 1841. One night he meets two men who offer to take him out for a drink and talk about business. When he wakes up the next morning he finds himself chained to the floor. Before he realizes what is happening to him he is shipped to the south and sold into slavery. When his new owner Edwin Epps (Fassbender) starts to break him down Solomon does everything he can to stay strong and fight for his survival and hope for freedom again. I'll start by saying before I watched this movie all I heard was that it should win Best Picture at the Oscars. So I was looking forward to watching this even though I expected it to be brutal and hard to watch in some parts. About halfway through I was left wondering what all the hype was about. The movie, to me at least, seemed very slow and boring. To me this a perfect example of a movie that makes you feel guilty for not liking it. The movie deals with a very important and serious part of history but the movie was really nothing more then look how bad slavery was, over and over. On one hand watching what Solomon goes through is gut wrenching and knowing its a true story makes it that much more powerful. On the other hand when the movie is over and you find out about the rest of his life I couldn't help but thinking if they would have done those events it would have been a better movie. This is not a terrible movie but I thought it was very overrated. Overall, one of the most important movies of the year in terms of subject, but that is different from being the Best Picture of the year. I give it a B.",

I would recommend this film to anyone, there are some tough to take scenes in here of physical abuse, and some graphically violent scenes through out, but it is true, and real, and people should know, and never forget. I Enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but you must remember that this sort of thing is still going on in the world, and not so far from you. If you see something wrong speak up.",

Thinking about the times in history when we actually used to do these atrocities on other human beings makes me cringe.To imagine waking up one day and find me in chains just because I'm a colored man and living my life like an unwanted child of god makes me question humanity altogether. Just sitting through a little over than 2 hours and watching this movie made my heart bleed, I can't even begin to think of the people who lived their entire lives as SLAVES... 12 years a slave heart breakingly makes you feel the pain and suffering of almost the entire human kind at one point of time or other. Direction by Steve McQueen is brilliant.Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a helpless slave in Solomon Northup to the hilt and also the small but impactive role played by Brad Pitt as a man with conscience is superb.Lupita Nyong'o's Patsey too was depicted heart warmingly. You can't help but question yourself that how could MAN stoop such low and do these cruel acts and that too over such a prolonged period of time without even a single ounce of doubt in his mind for what he would have to pay for his actions..

50,1 March 2014,planktonrules,8, Among the better films of 2013,"""12 Years a Slave"" is an unusual story about slavery and its evils because unlike most films, this one is based on the true story of a black man who was free but was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the early-mid 19th century. Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was a happy man--with a wife and kids. However, once kidnapped, as the title suggests, he disappeared for 12 years and was treated brutally. The film shows his MANY trials--including beatings, attempted hangings and witnessing rapes and other atrocities.",
51,9 July 2020,dr_clarke_2,10, A film guaranteed to enrage and appal,"Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award for Best Picture winner 12 Years a Slave is a film guaranteed to enrage and appal, both in its depictions of slavery and in the specific injustices inflicted on its protagonist Solomon Northup, a free man from New York State kidnapped and sold into slavery in New Orleans. The fact that it is a true story however makes it even more potent and McQueen's handling of the material is memorably powerful.
Based the memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, the film follows him as he is abducted, enslaved and sold to a plantation owner, nearly lynched, and sold to a truly evil master in the shape of one Edwin Ebbs. It makes for uncomfortable viewing, a feeling enhanced by an entirely convincing performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup who is forced to accept his fate with no hope of escape until he has a chance encounter with a Canadian labourer and abolitionist named Samuel Bass who agrees to help him regain his freedom. It has a happy ending of sorts for Northup, who is released and reunited with his family, although it is a bittersweet ending: he gets no recompense for the horrors inflicted on him, and fails to bring his kidnappers to justice. Moreover, because the film is based closely on fact rather than fiction, dramatic rules and conventions are rendered irrelevant: thus, Northup's fellow slaves remain enslaved and Ebbs suffers nothing for his cruelty except for the frustration of losing a man he sees as his property.
McQueen uncompromising shows the sheer brutality of slavery, from Northup's flogging and near-hanging, to the agonisingly unpleasant scene in which Patsey gets flayed half to death. However, the film also effectively demonstrates the more banal evil of the slave trade and its cold mechanics, as Paul Giamatti's Theophilus Freeman literally treats slaves like livestock and separates parents and children. Benedict Cumberbatch's William Ford shows compassion for his slaves in general and Northup in particular, but he still owns slaves and is too weak-willed and afraid to challenge the status quo. Others are more overtly cruel, from Paul Dano's profoundly unpleasant John Tibeats to Michael Fassbender's vile Ebbs and his equally callous wife Mary, who tries to hide her lack of humanity beneath a thin veneer of manners. Fassbender gives one of his most impressive performances as Ebbs, a man with no redeeming features whatsoever. The fact that he is based on a real person is chilling.
McQueen gets note-perfect performances out of every member of his cast, with notable examples including Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey and producer Brad Pitt as Bass, whilst his mise-en-scéne shows an eye for perfectionism and an attention to detail that has cemented his reputation as one of the twenty-first century's most interesting directors. Considerable research went into the period detail of the sets and costumes and it shows. Hans Zimmer's often discordant soundtrack underscores the film's drama nicely.
12 Years a Slave is not an easy film to watch. But it is a film that should be watched, if only because more than two centuries after abolitionism, the old maxim that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it remains valid. As a potent demonstration of man's capacity for inhumanity towards his fellow man, 12 Years a Slave is essential viewing.",

53,5 March 2014,thinker1691,10," "" The Suffering inflicted on the body, is slight compared to the scars left on the Soul ""","From the deeply painful and agonizing pages of his own life's story, comes this gripping tale written first hand by author Solomon Northup and directed adroitly by Steven R. MCQueen. His memories reveal what took place 1n 1841. The place was Saratoga, New York and Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is making a living playing his violin and enjoying his life with his wife and family when he is tricked into believing he can earn more money if he will accept some temporary musical employment in upstate New York. The ruse results in his being abducted and sold into Slavery. Once in chains, he is drugged, manacled and whipped into submission, then thrown into a dark prison cell. Once in bondage, he decides to accept his fate until he can find some way to extricate from the chains of captivity. The movie itself is a frightening and terrifying expose on what Black Americans had to endure during their years of punishing captivity. For the audience, one has to refrain from displaying an immediate reaction to the torturous and barbaric scenes in the film. The cast which includes Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt (In a cameo Role) and the incredible script left me stunned watching the painful legacy of our own history. Mr. McQueen wore a tapestry of both sorrow and triumph with the autobiography penned by Solomon Northup himself. It's little wonder why the movie has garnered so many accolades, awards and prestigious honors across the country. A hardy 'Well-Done' is called for upon seeing this masterful work of art.

Chiwetel was very exceptional at playing his role. He also showed a mass amount of emotion which made the film, once again, believable.

61,6 January 2014,thefadingcam,9, The historical confrontation through an unique visual experience,"12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen is on those authors whose movies will be remembered for many, many decades. This movie, just like Shame and Hunger, goes beyond the masterful aesthetic of the picture and camera to a sober, solid and honest drama about a free man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery on the United States. 12 Years a Slave embodies by nature the characteristics required to be considered an award winning movie, that is sure, but the movie goes a lot further and disconnects itself from that award aura. The north-American slavery theme is not a recurring one in cinema, even if the recent Django Unchained walked those steps one year ago. McQueen proposes a well paced movie that chooses feeling over gore, atmosphere over shock. The movie develops and gets better over time, presenting a lot of well written real characters that end up being shadowed by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender's unbelievable performances, only matched by Cate Blanchett's Blue Jasmine this year. 12 Years a Slave is not an easy movie to sit through, nor is it a particularly hard one. It is, above the drama, a contemplative movie that respects the audience. This is not a candy to chew on, but a gourmet dish to look at before tasting.

70,17 November 2013,zardoz-13,9, A Powerful and Evocative Epic About Slavery in the Old South,"A searing indictment of chattel slavery in the antebellum South, ""12 Years a Slave"" depicts the tragic odyssey of a free-born African-American violinist shanghaied and sold into slavery by unscrupulous white chiselers. Solomon Northup's literary chronicle implicates himself as much for his own naivety as the avarice of the assailants who hoodwinked him for monetary gain. Two smooth-talking con artists in top-hats persuade our hero to leave the safety of New York so he can play his fiddle at a concert in Washington, D.C. They assure Northup that they will pay him handsomely for his services and reimburse him for any expenses incurred during the trip to and from the capitol. The surprises and shocks that ensue as a consequence of their mendacity turn Northup's life upside-down. British-born, black director Steve McQueen and ""Red Tails"" screenwriter John Ridley pull few punches in their largely realistic portrayal of Northup's exploits. They adapted Northup's eloquent autobiographical account of his captivity between 1841 and 1853. Of course, nobody should be flabbergasted that Northup's memoirs contain a far greater wealth of information than the film. Naturally, McQueen and Ridley had to eliminate some Northup's various adventures to make a movie under two-and-a-half-hours in length. Northup's hanging provides one clear example. Three bitter whites resolve to string up Northup until an overseer intervenes. In Northup's memoir, he was never actually hanged. In McQueen's film, Northup is hanged, but he manages to balance himself on the tip-toes until somebody cuts down. "" Mind you, this isn't the first time that Northup's horrific ordeal has been presented in the media. ""Shaft"" director Gordon Parks produced ""Solomon Northup's Odyssey"" back in 1984 for PBS's ""American Playhouse"" anthology television series. After its original telecast, the Parks' teleplay came out on home video as ""Half Slave, Half Free."" Inexplicably, McQueen had never heard about Solomon Northup and his plight when he was searching for a story to shoot about slavery. Unlike Parks and his ""American Playhouse"" production, Mc Queen and Ridley were not restrained by the straitlaced standards of television censorship. As much as ""12 Years a Slave"" is a yarn about courage in the face of wholly insurmountable odds, this Fox Searchlight release qualifies as a horror movie that provides little relief from our protagonist's travails until the end credits roll. Happily, McQueen doesn't paint all whites as unrepentant dastards. Indeed, our hero survives this adversity because compassionate whites stand up to unsavory whites. Nonetheless, for all but a quarter-hour of its running time, ""12 Years a Slave"" makes you abhor the individuals who abuse Solomon. The worst plantation owner of the bunch rapes his most productive black female slave repeatedly on a regular basis while his jealous wife dreams up schemes to drive the object of her husband's lust from their property.",

Some of these films radiate overwhelming joy, while others leave a bitter aftertaste that is hard to get rid of. 12 Years a Slave has the rare distinction of being both a triumphant story on the persistent power of the human spirit while simultaneously dwelling into the darkest recesses of the human soul. Although generally mistaken for the same thing, there is a glaring difference between the human spirit and the soul because only one of these can be tainted with racial prejudice.

80,11 March 2014,neebanne,9, excellent,"I am a southerner and when I watch movies depicting slavery, I am usually suspect. Most films depict Southern plantation owners as evil, cruel, despicable individuals. What I liked about the film, was the fact that it showed the political insanity of slavery, and those who owned slaves as the people they were. Some evil, some defective and some indifferent, and some, just trying to run a business. Notwithstanding the evils of slavery, in some cases the owners knew the horrors of slavery, yet the system was set up by a national government indifferent to the horrors of such evilness. How the lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofore did not receive the academy award, shocks me. The entire movie showed a character who persevered in circumstances inconceivable to most. The story line was straightforward, and since I will not write a spoiler, I am happy to say that the facts of the story appear to be told without undue political banter. I think it is the best movie ever made, and God knows I think Matt McConeghy is adorable, and Dallas Buyers club outstanding, it was a tie for Best Actor in my mind.

83,20 February 2014,bix171,10, A Great Film Experience,"Steve McQueen's calculating, unerring eye shows you everything you need to see to form a judgment, but he wisely collaborates with both the great John Ridley (""U-Turn""), whose script gives ""12 Years A Slave"" a deep texture, and actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, who, working with committed filmmakers, allows his presence to become a blank canvas for McQueen and Ridley to convey their fear, anger, frustration and compassion. (Other examples of this in cinema are Catherine Deneuve and Luis Bunuel in ""Belle de Jour""; Adrien Brody and Roman Polanski in ""The Pianist""; and Brad Pitt and David Fincher in ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"".) The result is a riveting, unrelenting and ultimately tragic story of slavery set against the backdrop of the lush (and indifferent) beauty of the Deep South. McQueen's focused tracking shots (the rich cinematography is by Sean Bobbitt) draw you into Ejiofor's point of view only to separate you at crucial moments so that you feel the crushing emotional weight of each character (in particular, during a brutal lashing that becomes the film's devastating climax). There are deeply felt supporting performances by a brave Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch (sympathetic in his conflict), the frequently overlooked Paul Dano, Lupita Nyong'o (whose despair permeates the film) and Michael Fassbender as the cruel plantation owner who comes to represent the South's many paradoxes; but note should also be made of Sarah Paulson as Fassbender's wife--it's her outrage at both her husband and her surroundings that lends the film the critical addition of sexual tension.

Written by John Ridley, the Oscar- winning screenplay of 12 Years a Slave is based on an 1853 autobiography of the same name by Solomon Northup. 12 Years a Slave can best be described as a propaganda film censuring stigmas of racism and slavery in the antebellum United States. Made in the vein of the Blaxploitation films of the '70s, 12 Years a Slave is a powerful social commentary that poignantly depicts the heinous, racial exploitation of the Black people at the hands of their White masters who atrociously abuse them in more ways than any sane human being can possibly imagine.",

102,10 November 2013,zetes,10, Heartrending true story of slavery,"This year's sure thing for Best Picture. I don't personally think it's the best picture of the year, but no doubt it'll be one of the more deserving of that award (it ranks #6 on my 2013 list as of right now). It's an utterly devastating picture, doubtlessly the most thorough, accurate and brutal portrayal of slavery in the American South ever committed to film. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as a free man in the North. While touring as a fiddler with circus performers, he is kidnapped by slavers and transported to the South. He becomes the property of plantation owner Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a fairly benevolent master, but he soon crosses ways with his overseer (Paul Dano), and Cumberbatch is forced to sell him to a much crueler man (Michael Fassbender). Fassbender is keen on raping his slaves, in particular Lupita Nyong'o. Ejiofor, who at this point realizes that the only way he can survive is to keep his head low, becomes entwined in the drama between Fassbender, Nyong'o and Sarah Paulson, playing Fassbender's wife. Ejiofor has been a fantastic actor for over a decade now (I first noticed him in Dirty Pretty Things, but he also had a major role in Amistad, which I never did see), but this is the role he'll be remembered for. He gives one of the subtlest performances in recent memory. In many ways, he has to. His role is all reaction - while he does get a couple of big emotional scenes, mostly he's playing a man who has to keep his head down. He's an educated man, and if his masters catch wind of it, they could very well kill him. What he witnesses, though, in addition to what he suffers himself, is so horrifying that it becomes impossible not to react. Of the rest of the cast (which also includes Brad Pitt and plenty of other familiar faces), I think the only other one who deserves accolades is Nyong'o, who just kills it. Adepero Oduye, as a woman who refuses to stop weeping for her children, who were sold elsewhere, also impresses. In my estimation, none of the white actors really deserve too much praise. Cumberbatch and Dano are probably the best. Fassbinder's likely to get all the awards attention, but I thought he was pretty unsubtle, almost to the point of mustache twirling. McQueen's direction is very subtle, almost to the point where you won't even notice how good it is. One major complaint I have is that you don't really feel the time pass. If it weren't called 12 Years a Slave, you wouldn't even think more than a couple of years had passed by the end of it. Honestly, it could have been longer. But, then, it can be such a harrowing watch that I don't know that I'd want to see any more. I wouldn't say it was painful to sit through, though. I'd see it again in a heartbeat. It's rare you get a film so genuinely powerful.",
103,17 January 2014,freemantle_uk,10, An emotionally draining and important historical film,"2014's Oscar nominations are in and 12 Years a Slave is one of the leading contenders for awards, for deserved reasons. Steve McQueen's stock as a director continues to rise as he delivers a powerful piece of cinema, unflinching and historically detailed film about the brutality of slavery as people are beaten and families are broken up in heart wrenching ways. McQueen's style of wide shot and long takes are perfectly suited for screen, particularly a brutal whipping sequence and showing when Solomon is left hanging and people around him go about their normal lives. There is a natural look in the setting and the cinematography uses natural lighting to great effect. The acting for the story if of a top level, being bold, emotional and theatrical throughout. The excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor centres this film, giving a great performance as an educated man whose spirit slowly breaks due to his years of captivity and being treated as nothing more than property. He is surrounded by a top cast, all giving excellent and complex characters showing the different parts of the society of the Deep South before the Civil War. Lupita Nyong'o and Adepero Oduye were both excellent two women who suffer greatly due to Slavery, and we get different perspectives, from Bendict Cumberbatch's William Ford who is one of the kinder slave owner, but overall a coward to the more brutal Michael Fassbender, playing one of the most vile characters in cinema in recent years whilst still giving the occasional moment of be human.",
104,8 July 2020,TruthSeeker82,7, It's a summary of the book,"I watched this movie right after reading the book and it felt like watching the summary of it. Events mentioned in the book are presented mostly accurately but some events are squeezed to save time. Plus, I didn't feel like emotions of the book portrayed as well as they are portrayed in the book. For example, Solomon's life before enslavement and Eliza's Separation with kids, which is very emotional and difficult part of the book, seems rushed over. Probably because of it, viewers of movie can't connect with this part of story as well as the readers of the book. They also skipped one important event mentioned in the book. Solomon had a fight again with Tibeats and he successfully escaped to save his life but after some time, he returned back to Ford. They also didn't mentioned that why he didn't escape, like there were guards, hired by planters, patrolling the roads and anyone can ask slaves for the travel paper and in the absence of it can hand them over to authorities. There are also some other events mentioned in the book skipped in the movie for time or some other reason .

What I did go in expecting was a good performance by great actors and I must say the acting was fantastic, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a complete train wreck. I felt it had potential at first and then that feeling quickly dissipated after watching the first beating commence and continued to diminish after seeing the attempted hanging where he walked around on his toes for at least a good twenty to thirty seconds and we had to sit and watch. I didn't think it was possible for the movie to get more boring but then they threw in yet another thirty second scene where we all proceeded to stare at the main character's face while he sat idle, occasionally moving his head from side to side. I wanted to feel emotion for these poor characters but every emotion that I had was quickly ruined by incredibly long, drawn out, and unnecessary scenes. Not only did I have to sit through the agonizing, stretched out scenes but whenever there was about to be a significant lapse of time within the main character's life they'd add in a bonus five to seven seconds where we stared at a bunch of trees. I'd like to say that I was moved by the movie or felt some sort of enjoyment in watching it but in truth the only touching moment I truly had was at the end of the film when I realized it was FINALLY over. I'd liken it's boringness to The Fifth Estate but honestly it was far worse.

McQueen's earlier movies, 'Shame' and especially 'Hunger', were raw, visceral portrayals of life under a certain sort of inescapably grim reality. But 'Twelve Years a Slave', while it contains many horrific moments, is basically full Hollywood, with emotional background music underscoring the emotions we're meant to feel, and a narrative that stresses the possibility of the individual triumphing against evil and misfortune through strength of character alone. Of course, this is a common solution, because depicting unameliorated misery could make for a grim movie: the audience prefers 'The Shaswhank Redemption' to a story ending in prison suicide, or 'Schindler's List' to a drama actually set in the camps. But McQueen has previously skirted the thin line between truth and unwatchability with considerable skill: this outing, though made with a much bigger budget, is a less ambitious effort.",

He's just kind of there, taking in all the cruelty and insanity around him. It would have been far better to have concentrated less on the too-familiar beatings and humiliations and show us more of his life before and after the kidnapping/horrors he endured. As it stands, there's not much context. What is shown of his prior life seems almost ridiculously Utopian (the North was NEVER free of racism) and afterward... well, we don't get much despite some notations that suggest the REAL story might have been his attempts to use the legal system to find justice for the crimes against him.

140,10 March 2019,Raybets,5," Very important issue, Bad execution","The ending left me very disappointed. It was hardly a closure. You can't just cram injustice and suffering into 2hours and then abruptly finish it with a passing ""mailman"" messiah and slap the audience with a pitiful apology after a long-awaited reunion. I mean yeah but that should not be all to it. Can't we at least have a true ending to make up for that 2 hours of hell? There was no emphasis of raw emotions other than pain. No compassion, curiosity and worry from the family's perspective (i.e. Running, screaming, hugging, closeup shot on Solomon's face, showing apparent tears and a genuine smile). Despite it being a very brutal situation, it doesn't touch me at all because the movie doesn't show anything besides suffering... Too scared to show any happiness. Just constant pain, anger, and hurt. When in truth that's not realistic. He must've made temporary friends during that 12 years with little joys here and there - which were not included to guarantee maximum agony. Perhaps in the hope that audience will sympathise better but no, it does the opposite. You see I did not watch this movie because I enjoy sadism but that's about all this movie had to offer. If you're going to touch the subject of slavery at least make it educative and inspiring. Some love at the end, some countermeasure, changes, revolutionary movement, true liberty.. would've completed this film. If you're looking for a moving beautiful art, no you won't find it here. Stay away because this title really has nothing other than sadism that would leave you feeling absolutely terrible.",

It's really horrific that this could even happen, but it did happen and the results for Solomon Northup are equally horrific. The treatment that Solomon, and all the slaves suffer is so unjustifiably cruel that it's honestly hard to watch. Despite all of this it is oddly hard to develop and true emotional connection with the film. So many of the characters are so narrowly drawn in such black and white terms as to become caricatures.

150,19 October 2013,aglowery,10, Wow,"""I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportunity""  For her crime of fetching a bar of soap in order to rid herself of her  own unbearable stench, a young slave girl by the name of Patsey (Lupita  Nyong'o) is secured to a wooden post and relentlessly whipped by a  ruthless plantation owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Combine  this with an earlier scene in where the camera lingers in a torturous  long take over Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), as his back is  brutally savaged by assorted instruments, we know that Steve McQueen's  12 Years A Slave will not be an easy watch. As Patsey receives her  unjust punishment, Sean Bobbitt's unflinching camera captures the act  of cruelty and all its agony. The girl's skin peels of her back as the  whip tears through her flesh, exposing the blood and bone beneath. With  every anger-filled lash, you cringe deeper into your seat, sheltered in  an auditorium that has suddenly become rather chilly.  The year is 1841. Based on a true story, this historical period-drama  sees Solomon's life as a free family man stolen from under him when he  is kidnapped and sold as a slave, first to the benevolent Ford  (Benedict Cumberbatch) and then to the less-humane Epps. Throughout his  journey from Saratoga, New York to a plantation in Louisiana, Solomon  (slave name Platt) must keep his true identity and talents a secret if  he hopes to survive; ""I don't want to survive. I want to live"", says  Solomon and with every day that goes past, his chances of freedom grow  increasingly unlikely.  In response to the inevitable comparisons to Quentin Tarrantino's  Django Unchained, McQueen's masterpiece proudly tackles the  long-untouchable subject of slavery in its own way; ""Either we were  going to make a film about slavery or we weren't  and we chose to make  a film about slavery"" says McQueen during the London Film Festival,  ""making a slavery movie without violence would be like making a World  War II movie without shooting anyone."" If the pulpster's cartoonish  Django Unchained were to be considered little more than an appetiser to  slavery, then the raw and difficult 12 Years A Slave is very much the  main course and what a taste it leaves.  As Michael Fassbender's illustrious career screams for an Academy  Award, up steps McQueen  given that this is their third collaboration,  with Hunger and Shame both drawing Oscar blanks, 12 Years A Slave puts  the duo on track for third time lucky. The Fass's rendition of slaver  Epps A.K.A the ""nigger-breaker"", whose mood is lightened whenever he  delivers punishment to his ""property"", is truly remarkable and matches,  if not surpasses DiCaprio's exceptional turn as Django's Calvin Candie.  Ejiofor, our lead, graces us with a powerhouse performance as a broken  man whose eyes know nothing but pain. His formidable rendition of a  wrongfully enslaved man (not to say that any form is slavery is right)  claws at our heartstrings with as much mercy as the winter shows its  wildlife.  Where the cinematography could be described as beautiful in the  inspired way it allows the action to unfold, it feels very wrong to  attach such an adjective to a film with visuals that are actually quite  detrimental to one's peace of mind. Nonetheless, the creative  camera-work encourages Slave's cinematic scope and as it lingers in  close-up over the many lost faces, on some level this helps to restore  their identities; we're given time to remember who they are.  The title hints towards an inevitable conclusion, but nevertheless,  this is a fantastic feature that confirms McQueen's directorial  prowess See you at the Oscars. As the credits role and the auditorium  falls into darkness, nobody moves. Silent. Mesmerised.",

You will be be thrown in the middle of a bleak story of violence and hopefully condemn any form of racism and understand how evil have been white men, at that time in that place. No questions the movie is well done, with beautiful scenarios, very good acting, a good script, etc... but at points I wondered why should one keep watching this kind of violent and depressing stories (is it for people who ignore such things happened? then I would say its target should be schools and young children, but this is definitely not a movie addressed to them). I cannot agree with reviews saying this is a masterpiece, as I cannot find particular reasons for that. Where is innovation, creativity, poetry? A good movie it is, but mainly due to the fact it rediscovers the story of an otherwise forgotten hero. Personally I would have probably enjoyed it more if the movie kept telling the story of its hero in his fight for justice over his white masters and against slavery (for his contribution over a wider problem). Ultimately I believe this might be the reason why the main character should not be forgotten today and can be seen as a hero: for his contribution in fighting for an equal world. But this is only quickly written in the end titles. The movie is mainly a ride across violence and despair. Not the main reason I enjoy to watch movies.",

Following in the footsteps of Django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence. The film begins in the home of the central character, Solomon Northop, a free black man, who lives a genteel life with his family in New York.

The first thing that jumps out is the cast - one of the great all-time casts, with each giving a great performance, particularly Ejiofor, Nyongo, and Fassbender. Ejiofor really connects emotionally with the viewer and his changes as slavery wears on him were visible and devastating. What elevates this movie to another level is McQueen's direction - he clearly shows how slavery is a complex, ingrained structure and the he keeps you immersed in Solomon's life nonstop. While some were bothered by the lack of mention of time passing, I think it reinforces the idea that it feels like it will never end and keeps the viewer dialed in.

Based on the true story of Solomon Northup, this powerful and disturbing film is a sharp lesson in how awful man can be to fellow man. Solomon is a free black man from New York who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. He encounters dreadful cruelty and yet stumbles across a little kindness. Superbly shot, this film drags you into the pure desperation felt by the slaves at the utter hopelessness of their situation. It is a film that will remove you far from your comfort zone, and given the subject, so it should, as it drags you into the epic battle to stay alive and to face every single day knowing how awful it will be, and not knowing if you ever see the sunrise of the next day. Solomon is played by Chitwetel Ejiofor with a compassion that is mesmerising, and his cruel owner Michael Fassbender attacks his role with such passion that I could feel the hatred oozing from his pores. An unexpected role for Brad Pitt which suited him well and gave an insight into just how well he can act when the role truly suits him.

I will try to express why I felt so underwhelmed by it. I know this is a depiction of the horrors of slavery, but I expected more than that - and that's all I got, relentless and horrific. There was something off and pointless about it. In terms of characterisation, we are shown how Solomon lives with his family as a free man in New York, seemingly oblivious to the plight of slaves. Then he gets kidnapped and spends the next 12 years under sadistic evil masters and has to survive. Then he gets an enlightened Northener to get his freeman papers and rescue him. He is back with his family in the end, but all we get is his relief to be out of that hell. How is that a new angle on slavery? There is a scene early on with Solomon buying a travel case, observed by a slave, but given the context of the film it is a bit of a loose end and not tied properly. In short: Pros: Some of the acting is very good, especially Lupita N. and Michael Fassbender. Some good set pieces, great costumes, production design, sound design.

The entire cast shines in this movie, with Fassbender delivering a bone- chilling performance as the cruel slavemaster. Although 2 hours and 15 minutes long, it feels much longer due to the bleak outlook of the main character. Every member of the cast delivers a stellar performance in this cast, with particular mention to Paul Dano who has shown once again how far he has come from the Girl Next Door days. I also appreciated that they added the character of Benedict Cumberbatch to show that there were certain people at that time that were not completely against slavery nor cruel as Fassbender's or Giamatti's character. It was important to show that these kind of people existed at the time, and acted as enablers of slavery, without actually demonizing them. Steve McQueen, also does a great job using the cast and creating some great shots with excellent cinematography. One of the shots that stands out is after Solomon has been kidnapped and how the camera simply focuses the dark, deep whirring of the propeller of the steamboat. I found it almost similar to how a certain, sometimes mundane detail is focused upon in terrible nightmares. One minor nitpick would be the presence of Brad Pitt. In spite of his important role as producer, I feel that another actor should have been given his role.

The underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor conveys the controlled fury of the hero as he struggles to survive in a society where he is solely considered a commodity. The only problem with the narrative - and this is something I first noticed when I first read the book, in my teens - is that many of the white characters seem like caricatures of Southern cruelty and disdain. This is, of course, an interesting inversion of the depiction of black characters in the literature of the day. It is to the credit of many of the supporting cast that they come convincingly to life. Benedict Comberbatch's Mr Ford is a study in kindness blighted by moral cowardice, and the paranoia and psychosis of Michael Fassbinder's Edwin Epps is a genuinely unsettling, and all too believable, real-life monster. A nicely understated and utterly heartbreaking performance by Lupita Nyong'o, as the molested slave Patsey, is worth the ticket price, alone. Well worth a look.",

So the story is very clear how it's going to be and automatically audience should expect some torture scenes, and in my opinion director Steve McQueen does a great job showing them on screen. Although, these scenes aren't sadly painful for me to watch due the violence in movies in the past few years, but what personally destroys me the most and difficult to watch is the fact someone is being tortured or being in a very difficult situation and others are careless or incapable or even coward to offer a small simple help – in my opinion, when something like that happens there's a massive problem in that society. This film most likely is slow for some audiences, I think it's only a few minutes longer than 2 hours, but I remember after the movies was done, in theater some people were saying ""gosh it was long."" Let me tell you this, you shouldn't expect every shot or scene to move the story forward, they are there to capture the feeling of that environment and the emotions of the characters. Again, Steve McQueen does such solid job on showing them on screen, a good example of it is when a difficult scene occurs next to a pig farm, and you see how a human is being valued less than them. That also brings me to praise the cinematographer, Sean Bobbit, because he's done an astonishing job here, absolutely beautiful images and they're so well framed (especially those long shots), and also so well colorized, which I personally love it a lot- I love it when a dark theme story like this has a lot of colorful images on screen. Another element that Steve McQueen has done perfectly is the cast, this is the best ensemble on screen that I've seen, everyone brings wonderful performances, no one disappoints at all, and indeed Chiwetel Ejiofor deserves an Oscar nomination. Also about Michael Fassbender, the guy is just a fantastic actor and his performance here is flawless, but I'd like to talk about his character. I assume people who have seen the trailer automatically expect a brutal, menacing character, but I don't see him that way at all. I see Edwin Epps a weak person who is being controlled by his wife, I see a fool who has a power and extremely abuses it. Sarah Paulson as Mistress Epps is wonderful and surprising in this role, she's the cold person with no mercy, she's the menacing person, and honestly she's the true master of that plantation. Regarding the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer does a decent job here; I personally feel the score is the renovations of a track he did for Inception, ""Time,"" which I personally have no problem with it, some might get disappointed, but I think it fits the theme.",

209,1 December 2013,cultfilmfan,10, 12 Years a Slave,"Steve McQueen's masterful, 12 Years a Slave, is one of the most hard hitting and powerful films that I have ever seen. The film is brutal in it's depictions of slavery and the unjust treatment and attitudes that were directed towards African Americans at that time. The film, which is based on a true story, is a film of tremendous artistic merit and also when you watch the film and leave the theatre, it leaves a profound effect on you. After the film was done and I was watching the end credits roll, I felt a lump in my throat and my eyes were beginning to irritate me because they were becoming watery and deep down inside my body and my soul, I knew that I had just seen an excellent and undoubtedly accurate depicture of mankind at one of it's lowest and most unforgivable times. I hated watching these slave landowners in the film and I felt deep down in my heart, both empathy and pity for the way these characters were treated by these racist and evil men. The film hit home in such a way that after I left the theatre, I was quiet for quite some time both getting over emotionally, what I had just saw and witnessed, but also the feeling the film left me with which was as I mentioned a feeling of horror and disgust and also a sense of awe and sheer appreciation towards filmmaker Steve McQueen and his wonderful cast and crew for creating a film based on facts and bringing it to be so lifelike and realistic that the film left a profound impact on me and left me with a lot to think about afterwards. Yes, the film is brutal in it's depiction of what these slaves go through and at times it can be extremely hard to watch because the film does not shy away from the brutality, mistreatment and torture that these slaves went through. It can be hard to watch, but at the same time, I felt the decision the filmmakers chose, to show the film in that intense detail was what added to the film's power and the overall effect it left on me. I know that unfortunately some may shy away and decide not to see the film for that very reason, but I strongly urge those viewers to reconsider, because 12 Years a Slave, is a film that I honestly think that everybody should see. It's important to see because of the injustice and poor treatment that is basically a part of our history and a part of history that should not be forgotten, or ignored. At the same time it presents an unpleasant and harsh look at American history, it also shows that in some ways things have improved over a span of several hundred years. Right now America, has their first African American President of the United States of America. Whether you are a fan of Barack Obama's policies, or not, is not important here. What is important is that as a people we have come forward a little bit. Something like that would not have even been dreamed of in the days of slavery, or even the racist attitudes going through the 1950's and 60's, but I think we are on the right path in a way. Unfortunately though, you will still have people who are set in their closed minded and bigoted ways who through their own learning and behaviour, still harbour racist attitudes. I know I have met and heard of people like that and I think that we all know that it still exists. These are some reasons I am still glad that 12 Years a Slave was made. It was a powerful portrait of one man's hellish journey through slavery and the many others he met while there as well. The film boasts an incredible cast who all deliver top notch and Oscar caliber performances. The screenplay is excellent by both drawing us in and keeping us glued to our seats and by invoking power, feelings and thought through it as well. The cinematography was beautiful and Steve McQueen's direction paid much attention to detail and helped further the message I think the film was trying to leave on the audience. I also liked how the film did not use bombastic music, or fake sentimentality to make us cry, or to get the emotional feelings across to the viewer. I felt the way I did at the end of the film and during it because the film made me care for these characters because these events actually went on and seeing them in their brutality and allowing us to care for these characters and the injustice they went through, hits home in a way that my writing could not do justice to. Let me just say that this, as I mentioned above, is one of the most powerful and emotionally overwhelming films I have ever seen. There are still a lot of 2013 films that I haven't seen and still need to see, but as it stands now, the one that should be taking home Oscar gold next year is clearly and undoubtedly in my mind, 12 Years a Slave. Don't miss it while it is still in theatres. One of the best films of 2013 and one of the most powerful and moving films of all time.",

A well-respected black man (Ejiofor) is kidnapped and sold into slavery where he must witness and be victimized to extreme cruelty by his owners. Other than showing how brutal slavery can be, there is no point and the film goes nowhere. Just Negroes getting beaten throughout the whole movie because they can. I know that this movie is supposed to be hard to watch, but that's no excuse to leave important film components out. Pay It Forward was sad, but it has theme, it gets somewhere, there is plot development. 2007's The Girl Next Door had a theme, the plot actually went somewhere. 12 Years A Slave just didn't have a point or story.

230,26 January 2014,dndcullens,8, Good movie,"Having watched DJANGO UNCHAINED and LINCOLN, I was interested to see another film on slavery and like the two mentioned it did not disappoint. For most sane people the idea of slavery or a Holocaust is something unfathomable and the rational behind such horrors is something that should be included in any movie on such subjects. It isn't enough just showing slavery or the persecution of certain people there has to be a reason (albeit a stupid reason at best) as to why this is happening. Leaving aside the horrors of the Holocaust as that is death with elsewhere, slavery is one of those things which seems almost like an act of stupidy. Now there are no doubt reasons why such things happened and apparently it is also sanctioned in the bible but when you look at it you think to yourself what the hell is this happening. So it was that slavery happened for whatever reason and a civil war had to be fought to end it. Those that argue about states rights and the rest are totally missing the point that the civil war WAS fought because a President was elected on a no slavery ticket. So when it comes to movies about slavery the reasons for it are not properly explained. Nor are the plight of the slaves. The slaves were latterly treated like dogs. Sure you have a dog you like, sure some treat their dogs nice but in the end if they are no use to you or they cause trouble or get sick you get rid of 'em. And so in this case you get a man who was free suddenly thrown into a place where he didn't even have a voice and where death was just an insult away. In that way the movie strikes a cord and shows us all the arguments we would use to get out of such a situation to be useless. A really good movie and some excellent performances.",

I don't know a great deal about slavery in America in this time but I didn't realize it was so inhumane. Although this film is touching and one can really can sympathize with the main character the brutalities are horrific. The scene with the young girl 'Patsey' getting lashed was extremely hard to watch. It really puts life in these times into perspective, I can't imagine what people in those times must of endured. All in all the actors were amazing acting these parts and the movie was touching and definitely one that is hard to pull away even at the confronting parts. I had never seen the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor before but in this movie he was outstanding and he deserved the BAFTA award 100%.",
233,23 April 2014,JonathanWalford,6, Mediocre attempt at the slavery story,"This film had the opportunity of being the Schindler's List of American slavery, but it fell short. The story was engaging enough, but the filmmakers took just enough liberties with the facts in the real story to plunge the film into mediocrity. To begin with, there is a completely unnecessary sex scene in the opening that adds a non-sequitur to the true story and immediately sets the film off on the wrong foot. ",
234,21 January 2014,rjun67,3, A TV Movie with a splash of Colour,"I first heard about this film when reading about the upcoming Oscar nominations, so falling victim to the massive hype the film was receiving, went to see it. The films starts off interestingly enough, a black man and his family seemingly living a middle class existence in New York in the 1840's (I'm sure plenty of us thought all blacks were still slaves at that time in America). Our hero plays the fiddle for a living and is kidnapped by unscrupulous showman who trick him into performing in Washington DC, and sell him to slave traders who ship him to Georgia. By now he has gone through the usual 'Roots' rites of passage stuff, and is quickly sold off to a number of slave masters, good and bad. As the film drags on to the end, all the same clichés appear until his friend from New York shows up to free him from a nasty slave owner. After the film finished I could not help thinking this was not a big screen epic, more of a Fox TV movie, it was cheap, the characters had no depth and the plot was simple and stretched out, it never made me want to read the original narrative, and is a very poor relation to other much more cinematic films, such as the excellent 'Amistad'. The message of the film speaks volumes about the film makers, ""lets use a slave story and we can reap the awards"" (just as Holocaust film makers use the same tactic). Don't waste your money, you will be bored to tears by this film which at best, should be on at 3pm on a weekday afternoon.",

236,11 November 2013,superwomanproductions,10, Deserving of Oscars,"The intensity of this story had me awestruck throughout the film, to the degree that I was unable to show any emotion as I watched a depiction of slavery that showed how those who had gained freedom or were born free were systematically and strategically kidnapped and forced back into it. This film showed a different side of injustice. Not only was I amazed at how black people were treated in that era under such circumstances, I was amazed and hurt at how black people treated each other. When some may have considered Solomon Northrop to be weak, he was truly courageous. He kept his mind more positive than a lot of people could under those circumstances. Although he did work as a slave, there was always a glimmer of the determination of a free man within him, destined to escape the life he was forced into. Northrop was always seeking an opportunity to gain assistance from those willing to listen and was cunning enough to adapt and protect himself when betrayed by those he trusted. This film was well written, well acted, thought provoking and historically relevant. Steve McQueen and Brad Pitt took a chance with this film and in my opinion it paid off well. If you're offended by the use of the n-word (ala Spike Lee), then you may want to stay home or see something else. Without the use of the word, it would be historically inaccurate. The film doesn't just show us injustices of our past, but they bring a perspective to the present and hope for the future. I would recommend this movie to be included in African American History classes in schools across the country. Doing so may show young black people that we have a history of being determined and that many people have lived worse than we could ever imagine in our modern times. If you didn't leave the theater touched or enlightened to treat each other better and at the same time honor those who came before us by appreciating the opportunities afforded to us, you should watch it again until you do. *Side note: the audience at the theater where I saw this film was predominantly white Americans, all of whom were in tears midway through the film.

Next thing, you see him in shackles and in a dungeon. he is beaten and you find out, that he has been kidnapped and sold into slavery. So far i find the film interesting. Then for 1 hour and 50 minutes you watch people being whipped, beaten, hanged and a black slave crying throughout the film. all the white people, with the exception of the slaver Ford and the Canadian Abolishinist, played by Brad Pitt, look as if they are portraying the character Simon Le Green from Uncle Toms Cabin and Pitt who is supposed to be playing a Canadian, sounds more like Patrick Swayze out of North And South, which in my opinion is the best ever depiction of that period. A story like this cannot be told in a couple of hours anyway. A far superior film to this was Amistad by Spielberg, which was also based on a true story. Yes you see whippings, but you see the the taking over of the ship and then the court proceedings. In this film you only know what happened to the bad guys at the end credits. My opinion is this was like a rehash of two other terrible movies based on two very good books, Mandingo and Drum, also with fine actors and actresses. Although this one is better made. Very disappointing.",

239,15 December 2013,Robert_duder,8, Critical darling impresses but didn't floor me,"Let's just get this out in the open...12 Years A Slave will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Picture. I'd put every dime on it...99% guaranteed. It has everything the Academy loves. It comes in on the tails of the impressive Django Unchained which was a very different style of slavery story but still shares some common ground. A tale set in the South during the mid-late 1800's seems to me to be an easy spot to write a good story that moves people. 12 Years A Slave does exactly that. It has a few unique ideas in it but at the same time it didn't really bring anything new to the table either. There were some very good performances, very good scenes and a powerful story. It was a great film. Best film of the year? I'm not entirely sure. I felt like some of the sexual scenes were forced and gratuitous and unnecessary. I also understand what they were trying to convey with some of these scenes. 12 Years A Slave does one of the best jobs I've ever seen of making you understand the intense humiliation of slavery. The story is very different given this is about a free man from the North who is kidnapped and sold into Southern slavery. Its a terrifying idea and the things he must go through will move you. This is a film that puts you firmly in the shoes of a man forced into slavery and every humiliating aspect. He is an educated, intelligent family man forced into this condition and its hard to watch at times.",

246,3 February 2017,filipemanuelneto,8, An excellent movie about a disturbing subject.,"This movie is one of the most remarkable I have seen in recent times. Slavery is a theme that has been approached in cinema, giving rise to such grandiose films as, for example, ""Amistad"", a film with which we can make comparisons, since both are close: they approach the same theme from a similar perspective, situate Its history roughly the same time and both start from true stories. However, this film has the added beauty of showing us the cruelty to which a slave was subjected by its owners. And I say the word beauty because we sometimes need to see in order to understand. From this point of view, this film, based on the memoirs of Solomon himself, is an interesting document that allows us to understand the history, the past, the cruelty of those acts. Needless to say, I loved the story and I think the script is great. I do not know to what extent he is faithful to the book, but it seems quite true to reality, to what really happened then. The sets and costumes were also well made and reliable. Chiwetel Ejiofor gave life to the main character and filled the screen with feelings, nostalgia, anguish and pungent pain, in an excellent interpretation. Dickie Gravois is the name, I think, of the actor who plays the foreman of the last plantation where Solomon worked, and I must congratulate this actor as he has made his character truly worthy of our hatred.",

253,10 June 2014,nicola-orofino,7, The worst title for a movie,"I understand that the original title is from a book on which the film is based, but it is one thing to read a book called ""12 years a slave"", another to watch a movie: you do not enjoy, nor the beginning, because you already know that will be captured, nor the middle, because you already know that will be released, nor the end, because you would expect from the entire movie. In practice, two and half hours of film ruined by a very wrong way. Then it is no true that the film has made me so enthusiastic. It seems built for very captatio benevolentiae, without much skill on the part of the director and screenwriter. The audience becomes attached to the protagonist, but can not forget the thousands of other slaves who were not already ""free men"" and therefore will never come to be. It has been chosen to tell the story from a heartbreaking point of view, too much personal; if that's okay for an autobiographical book, not the same can be said for a film nominated for an Oscar. The only ten minutes by Oscar are those in which he starred Brad Pitt; I also believe are the ten minutes the most interesting of the whole movie.

254,9 November 2013,Richie-67-485852,8, History and Entertainment,"This movie does not break new ground. The subject has been brought up many times and each time the premises is the same. The dark side of America at one time and how mans inhumanity to man reaches down into the soul past conscience and for some leads to salvation for others damnation. It is not a pretty site to see men mistreating men. Nature can do it, acts of God take place and accidents will happen. To see mankind mistreat mankind deliberately and without cause recalls the very history of the human race into question and it isn't pretty. What throws a type of Holy water on it is that Christianity is seen supporting this questionable behavior by men who are oblivious to their own hypocrisy as they make the scriptures come alive in their favor. But America is made up of these little pockets of history and mishap which at some point leads to liberty and justice for all. But for those who had to endure the journey from the learning curve perspective, it remains brutal and it testifies that we all need salvation from one thing or another. Those that stood by remain guilty as those who carried on. I like this movie because it gets to the point and the point is where you have to go the sooner the better. I am also reminded that ignorance if allowed to travel uncorrected recruits its like kind. Bravo to the acting, directing and story line which is nothing less than one mans testimony of his life.

256,18 August 2015,JoeyCunninghamLennox,5," All subject matter, no movie quality.","I cannot objectively find justice that this movie received critical  acclaim and best picture Oscar. yet again, it seems that the subject  matter was enough to guilt-trip people into believing this was a great  movie. Well it's simply not. Film producers seem to sit around and  decide not what movies to make, but which movie they are going to put  forward for the best picture award. It's easy, you don't need  imagination, creativity or an excellent screenplay - you just need the  right subject matter; something historical, a biopic (almost always  with a 'snappy' title taken from the subjects last name) or something  related to war, civil rights, anything political, anything about  disabilities or social injustice. Although these movies do not win the  award, you can be sure as hell they will be in the running, movie  producers have that power at least.  There is no style to this movie whatsoever - anybody could have made  it. I don't believe Steve Mcqueen had any opportunity to express  himself. The movie was not his idea, but again the idea of Oscar hungry  producers who got a hold of an 'Oscar worthy' idea and decided what the  movie would be. I'm sure they knew exactly what they wanted before  hiring Mcqueen for his name, which would be powerful enough to bring in  more attention, while he himself is not so established a director as to  threaten the studio with his ambition or movie making principles.   Two cameo appearances rubbed me up the wrong way. Firstly Paul  Giamatti's role as some form of slave trade administrator, which lasted  about a minute and a half. Earlier in his career Giamatti was known to  have played these bit-parts and although perhaps not quite a household  name, he is a well recognised face who one could imagine taking the  lead in an Oscar winning movie. The fact that he appears for such a  short time suggested his inclusion was a cheeky nod from the director  to say ""Look, it's Paul Giamatti. We are friends. We must be friends  otherwise why would he agree to such a minor role?""   The second cameo that bothered me was where Brad Pitt popped up about  half an hour from the end. Now I love Pitt, but again this is not the  role for him. I had the horrible feeling that the producers managed to  hire him for one afternoon before he had to rush back to making  whichever movie he was really interested in making. Pitt appeared in  two scenes, made one medium sized monologue about the injustice of the  slave trade (which was far too blunt) and had a short conversation with  the lead about delivering a letter which would see him freed. When you  are this far into a movie you are supposed to be glued to the story. If  you go to see a Brad Pitt movie where he is in a leading role, you  should be forgetting that it is Pitt early on and only be thinking of  the character from there on, but when Pitt showed up about one hour  forty into 12 Years a Slave, it just drew me out of the movie. Instead  of thinking ""Who is the new character at the plantation"" I and I am  sure everyone was thinking ""Oh, Brad Pitt! I didn't know he was in this  movie."" I also guarantee many viewers were not listening to what his  character was saying as they too busy giggling at the sight of him  kitted out in the appropriate clothing complete with old-timey facial  hair.   Cameos should be left to more lighthearted genres where it is OK for  the audience to be well aware that they are watching a movie. These  cameos felt like such amateur mistakes.   The fact that the producers hoped the subject matter would be enough to  win the Oscar is so evident from the lack of substance in the movie.  All that happens is that a free black man is abducted (somehow) and  lives as a slave for many years. He has a horrible time of it as do the  other slaves...that's it. The movie ends very quickly so as to disguise  the fact that they did not know how to finish the movie. Nothing occurs  between the time the lead actor asks Pitt's character to deliver the  letter (despite talk of the risks involved in delivering the letter -  this goes nowhere and we see nothing) the carriage shows up to free him  and that is that. Predictably, what details of Solomon's life the  screenplay could not find room for was hurriedly read from the screen  prior to the end credits.   Least favourite moment for me was where Soloman was strung up by the  neck and left on his tippy-toes in the mud, struggling to keep himself  upright enough as not to choke to death. This was supposed to be  horrible and uncomfortable and I understand that was the purpose of the  scene and the reason for it's longevity - but they overdid it. The  scene felt like about 3 minutes long and soon I was not just keen for  it to end because Solomon was choking, but rather I was irritated at  the sound of the mud under his feet. When one is more concerned with  his own ears than the main character's neck, it is pretty clear that  errors have been made.  The 5 stars I have given this movie are for the actors, make-up  artists, costume department and visual effects people etc.",

It was well done and if you want to see a simplistic movie showing slavery at its worst this is your movie. The setting were beautiful and the actors were well cast. However there was not much new about the story short of his being made a slave and his inability to escape. The slaves seemed to have no lives of their own or concerns of their own short of reacting to the master, and to have a stronger sense of themselves and their misery than anyone told all their live they were chattel, would have. The most scary and discouraging thing I ever heard on the subject was a former slave saying she had 11 kids and the master must have been really glad of her. This was missing from the movie. It is based on a book meant to be propaganda for the abolitionists and while true is probably an amalgamation of unpleasant stories the author knew of combined with some he experienced.

263,19 January 2014,TiagoRicardo,9, A powerful story about slavery,"At last I had the chance to watch Steve McQueen's adaptation of the Solomon Northup's book ""12 Years a Slave"". Solomon Northup (brilliantly interpreted by Chiwetel Ejiofor) lived in New York with his family (his wife and his two kids). His life was stable, he was a free black man living the ""American Dream"", until he was invited to join two other men to preform in several places, since he was a brilliant violinist. But unfortunately for him, the invitation was just the beginning of the worst time of his entire life. Solomon ended abducted and sold into slavery. While being a slave, Solomon faced the cruelty of some white men who just treat them like their property and a series of events that are really tough to watch. In fact, there are only a few things that are easy to watch in this 2-hour drama. Fassbender's character was really powerfully and I must confess that there were times where I was really angry about it. So much power and greed drove him to complete madness. Fassbender was really great portraying a slave owner, giving a huge touch of cruelty and evil to the film. It was really hard for me to imagine how could someone treat another one with such amount of cruelty. Without only a little amount of hope, Solomon sees him self trapped in this ""nightmare"" and tries to survive to the whole thing. After long years of suffering, Solomon sees at last the opportunity to escape after meeting a Canadian abolitionist, Bass, interpreted by Brad Pitt. This powerful and tough drama is also filled with brilliant performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and Lupita Nyong'o. Hans Zimmer also strikes again with a really great soundtrack that involves the audience into the film. But there is a lot more in ""12 Years a Slave"" than just slavery. I left the theater in complete silence, astonished for what I had just seen. A message of hope, a portrait of the cruelty of men and a powerful story that is tough but also captivating. Steve McQueen really got me with this one. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a 2- hour drama that will shock you and that sometimes will make you feel angry but there is so much substance in this film that it is impossible for me no to advise you to go and watch it. ""12 Years a Slave"" is more than a must-see, it is a true masterpiece!",

The girl who played Patsy was quite good, but her part was really not big enough to warrant an Oscar. Chiwetel, who I like a lot, just didn't quite get the ball past the goal line. The complexity of emotion that one would expect from his character wasn't quite flushed out. The final scene felt restrained and unrealistic to me. I cannot believe that this won Best Picture.

What I was not expecting was to be put through an emotional mangle that left me pretending I had something stuck in my eye that need a good few minutes of ""tearing up"" before I could leave the cinema - and I was not the only man doing this. I have never had it brought home to me so forcefully what the concept of slavery in the USA of the 1850's was about. How white folk treated black folk as chattel was an ethereal idea for me often coloured by films such as ""Gone with the Wind"". Steve McQueen's film confronted you with the brutality of it by showing you the viewer what it entailed unflinchingly. To do this he has gathered a technical team and a group of actors and committed them to being at the top of their game in order to show the cinema-going world what slavery is, so that the next time you see a newspaper headline that talks of ""human trafficking"" you are aware that slavery has not completely gone away and still needs to be stamped out and its' perpetrators brought to summary justice. What would a modern equivalent be? Emily Watson criminally drugged up on a night out and then enduring a ""taming"" process in order to end up in a middle-eastern harem. Fanciful thinking? There are too many stories in the press of girls from Eastern Europe and China enduring this shameful activity for you to realise that slavery has not gone away.",
272,16 February 2014,faresjam,4," Forced, pretentious and predictable","The most overrated movie of 2013. The movie shows you the psychological horror of slavery with the protagonist not really taking a part in anything. There is no lesson to be learned here, just showing how horrible things were for African Americans at the time. Feels very forced and tedious, and five minutes in it you will know exactly what's gonna happen. Unimaginative or creative at all. I think the director wanted to say: ""Feel pain, cause I said so. I won't take the time to build characters or weave an interesting narrative"". The movie says let's paint everything with a big general brush-which is OK for action movies- but not for a historical drama.",

274,10 November 2013,FilmMuscle,7, An Emotionally Draining and Thought-Provoking Cinematic Event,"With 12 Years a Slave comes a dour and distressing story about Solomon Northup, a freedman and a talented violinist, who was kidnapped one night and sold into slavery. This true story vividly captures his struggles and grueling journey through a very dark time. Now, slavery has recently become a relevant topic even though it no longer exists, but several films have released nonetheless, forcing us to relive the horrors that beset a once troubled race. As a matter of forewarning, this film is raw and relentless in its presentation for it's bound to disturb and place you in a level of discomfort that's rarely visited. You will be forced, as a viewer, to witness atrocious scenes of torture and whippings specifically as misty blood sprays into the air and the sight of deep and thick cuts makes you cringe to no end. By the end of the film, half of the theater was in tears, blowing their noses and withdrawing their tissues. It was certainly difficult to bear the missed opportunities and even larger troubles in a stricter environment. ",

It totally omitted any sense of the long years Solomon spent in slavery and how he reconciled himself to it. There was no surprise with the sadism and inhumanity; as far as I am concerned, moreover, it added nothing new to the already tragic picture of slavery in America. It would be more interesting to understand how humanity was able to deal with slavery and why it produced such extraordinary sadism in the white population. The lack of decency was finally resolved with the arrival of Brad Pitt; I found that casting troubling as well.",

It is no surprise that this movie did not come out of an American director but an English Grenadian born if that is correct. Solomon is the main character played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. He feels so real as do the people around him. Accomplished, educated and talented, he is prime pickings for the slave trade. How could this happen in America to Americans? The movie has to cover a lot of time and events and the viewer could feel some of the short cuts but it came as a relief to me. I almost walked out early on as it was too painful.

289,12 August 2014,DarylKMiddlebrook,9, A Film That Vividly Displays The Inhumanity of American Slavery,"I hesitated seeing this film because I couldn't wrap my mind around watching another slave film where there's that white character who is so understanding of the African slave's plight. I just couldn't fathom watching another movie where there's that sadistic, over-acting white master, who we're so obviously supposed to hate that we cheer when he gets his just desserts. I definitely didn't want to be subjected to that well-known sympathetic white wife or child who battles their own soul to find balance with the Ol' South's tradition of slavery, and it's apparent evil against mankind.
Finally, I didn't want to see another Django Unchained, which, I'm well aware, many people found enjoyable. However, Quentin Tarantino's grindhouse Blaxploitation rip-off left a bitter taste in my mouth, as I felt he dealt with slavery in an almost whimsical, comical manner. As an African American, I found this appalling since White America has never apologized, given restitution, nor accepted its role in one of the most-inhumane periods in human history. However, this is a film review, not a history lesson, so first off, let me say that 12 Years a Slave IS NOTHING LIKE DJANGO UNCHAINED! They are two different movies, two different genres, and two different directors. 12 years A Slave is the horrific journey of Solomon Northup, a black man born free who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. What transpires is one man's visual diary of the atrocity, hypocrisy, and inhumane world of Southern American slavery. There are no heroes, no melodramatic Hollywood moments, only a man trying to find his way back home to be with his family.
What sets this film apart in my opinion, are the magnificent performances of its cast, in particular, Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ms. Lupita Nyong'o. Where there are no over-emotional moments, no grand Hollywood speeches to the white master, these two actors succeed in taking us back in time, and drawing us into the character's lives and pain. Ejiofor's Solomon Northrup tells us his internal pain with his eyes, as they seek out justice but find only despair. His words are few, but when spoken, they convey his slipping grasp on his former freedom, something he will not, can not let go of, throughout his living nightmare.
Rising up with the same breathtaking performance is talented newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, whose portrayal of Patsey is the counter opposite of Ejiofor's Solomon. Patsey has known nothing but slavery; her life consists of survival, doing what's necessary to keep the lash from her back. However, even that's not good enough, as she must also contend with the master's lust, and the hatred of his wife because this black woman is her husband's mistress. Through Nyong'o performance, we're aware of Patsey's troubling slow-death. Hers is the coupling that connects the two worlds
of the Negro in America; Solomon, born free, an educated man of talents, with a loving family, and Patsey, uneducated, a workhorse who's known nothing but hard labor and the lust of her perverted master. Two separate lives, two separate existences, bound together because of one skin color.",
290,10 November 2013,blanbrn,8, A raw true big screen telling of a brutal and sad life that one had to wrongly live.,"""12 Years a Slave"" may not be everyone's cup of tea to watch as, true it's a true account of the slave days of one kidnapped man Solomon Northup, it's manner in which the brutal beatings and whippings of blacks is cruel, violent, and very sadistic. The film is so raw and brutal with it's scenes that it may turn many off still director Steve McQueen went to great measures to show how brutal and savage that blacks were treated by rich spoiled white land owners in the deep south. Based on the true accounts of one Solomon Northup(in a raw and emotionally honest performance from new guy Chiwetel Ejiofor)who in 1841 is in the northeast in upstate New York working as an actor and stage play person when one night he is lured to a trip to Washington, D.C. and is kidnapped by two southern men and taken to the deep south and sold into slave labor. Here on the plantation the cotton fields life is tough with beatings and whippings and chains are a daily occurrence for all blacks especially with all the sadistic ways of the owner(in a wicked performance from Michael Fassbender)who even has sex with many female black slaves. Most supporting is the meeting that Solomon has with a Canadian abolitionist(in a fine performance from Brad Pitt)this propels Solomon to be set free emotionally and mentally to actual freedom. Overall ""12 Years a Slave"" is a brutal and somewhat sadistic film still it's one man's true story of courage and will to live as he faced the wicked and evil establishment for many lost and wrong years that he had to spend his life away from freedom and reality.",

In other hands this story might have appeared to the viewer as more of a strict sermon on the evils of slavery, with an overemphasis on melodrama perhaps and a fair amount of ""worthy"" speech making. It is, after all, awards season and the cynic in me cannot help but look around each year and pick out the formula ""Oscar gold"" winners and lament the presence of a film which deserves them.

But the thing that really stood out for me as I watched this was that for the most part it was surprisingly lacking in anything that could be called passion. I won't deny that there were moments of great passion - and that in an overall sense the movie certainly tugs at your heart as you consider Solomon's plight, and the nightmare into which he was suddenly transported, but there was also just an overwhelming dryness to it for lack of a better word.

When I watch a movie I like to be captivated and taken in for the ride. So much of it was so bad that it jarred. When slaves were supposed to be digging a paddock they were just tapping hoes on the ground. When slaves were cotton picking they were just playing with the cotton. All the slaves were over weight, and wore clean un-tatty clothes. Quite often the actors looked as though they were uncomfortable doing what they were doing. Those prolonged whipping scenes did not feel real. When he was left hanging, this again did not seem to be at all real. Someone wriggling a bit on the end of a rope. Where was the suspense and drama? Instead an overly long scene. Boring! It could have been a great film. But for me, it did not work at all. It would have been good to hear the story after he was released from slavery.

With the exception of Quentin Tarantino's 'Django Unchained', which was more a fantasy and revenge flick on slavery, British director Steve McQueen's '12 Years A Slave' is a phenomenal film from top to bottom, yet it's extremely rough to watch in certain parts due to the emotional content of the story.

The atrocity of Northup's story within the atrocity of slavery itself makes 12 YEARS A SLAVE a film that needed to be made. Emotionally difficult to endure and excellently acted, with not a single cast member holding the film back in any way. McQueen's trademark of long takes should put this one at the top of the list of any aspiring directors or cinematographers out there; however, there are a handful of shots that linger on close-ups with seemingly no other purpose than to force the characters' feelings on the audience even though it had already been successfully established moments earlier.

He was soon taken with other slaves by ship to New Orleans and sold into further slavery. He eventually came into contact with a Canadian abolitionist, who was able to notify his family of his whereabouts. In 1853, after the intervention of an official agent of the state of New York, he was freed. He filed charges against his kidnappers but after a long trial, the charges were dropped on legal technicalities and Northup was never compensated for his years in slavery. He orally related his story to a New York legislator, David Wilson, who published it in a book titled '12 Years A Slave.' The book was published less than a year after Northup's freedom and it sold over 30,000 copies. He is believed to have died in 1863.

320,12 December 2013,mspolk2006,9," A review from someone who read the ""12 Years A Slave"" narrative","I have seen both versions of this story committed to film. The 1984 version was directed by the great Gordon Parks (if you don't know who that is look him up). This film is beautiful, I have to say that from the very beginning; the footage of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana is gorgeous. The thing about this story isn't that is unique, what is unique is Solomon Northup enduring bondage for 12 years without becoming bitter. There are moments in this film when you cringe, I literally flinched in moments; the moments when I cried weren't as numerous as I thought. However the thing that is conveyed to the view is the strength of spirit that slaves had to endure in order to live, not just survive but live. There is a scene where Solomon is talking to Eliza about her open mourning for her children, when they start arguing about how best to survive this situation, Solomon yells at her ""I will stay hardy until freedom is opportune."" There are so many moments in this movie when I was just in awe of how they took this narrative and translated it into pictures, a narrative that doesn't require much imagination to bring you back to the mid-1800s and how it was to be on a plantation in Louisiana. Patsy, a slave who is her master's prized cotton picker, 500+ lbs of cotton a day, the master's relationship with her is to caress her with one hand and beat her with the other. Lupita Nyong, as Patsey, is so beautiful it broke my heart, when Master Epps is describe her as ""queen of the fields"",she turns away from him and for a moment, I saw the beauty of all those women who were stolen away from Africa, her profile was so classic. This movie had a conversation that was ""for movie purposes"" but Master Shaw, a neighboring planter has a 'kept' slave woman, played by Alfre Woodard, she entertains Patsey, though Master Epps is worried that Shaw will touch Patsey. Mistress Shaw, tells Patsey, in a calm but sober voice that I can only say gave me chills ""In His own time the good Lord will manage them all"". Master Epps wife, hates Patsey and refuses her the basic necessity, like soap for which Patsey takes a savage beating. Steve McQueen took this narrative that I have loved since I was in junior high school and managed to produce a piece of art from it. The funeral scene, where what I grew calling an ""old church mother"" sings ""Roll Jordon Roll""; which she pronounces 'Jerden', brought me back to Sundays in church, and I found myself singing with her in my heart. Finally, I wanted speak to the actual narrative and the man that Northup seemed to be in his narrative, he seemed a humble man, a kind man and that come through in this production. There is a scene toward the end of the film when Chiwetel Ejiofor looks into the camera, breaking that 'fourth wall' and all I could see was Solomon Northup staring at me across 160 years and I cried for him. Solomon's fate was lost to history, no one knows what became of him but I pray his last wish was granted.",

It should have had one. The movie will expose you unsolicitedly to massive amounts of racism, physical violence and psychological cruelty. And for what reason? Is there anything in the story that alludes to historic events we did not know about? Will we walk out of the theater as better human beings than we were before? Does this production leave us with an experience that bears relevance for the way we live our lives today? Unlike you may expect me to answer these three question, I'm going to say yes.",

The entire row of people sitting behind us on the way out I glanced at - all were sobbing. I don't mean a few little tears I mean deeply affected, balling their eyes out. The music is incredible, if you've seen Shame - same kind of stuff. Sarah Paulson, Cumberbatch and Giamatti are perfect but all are out shined by Michael Fassbender - who is incredible. I was a big fan of his before this but he has further proved he deserves to be in the discussion of best actors in his generation. Luptia Nyong'o who plays a young slave girl and the object of Fassbender's psychotic infidelities will probably hear her name for a nomination on Oscar night. Most likely Fassy will as well and possibly Paulson. And then we have Chiwetel Ejiofor - my god man, you are AWESOME. This is the biggest slam dunk best actor Oscar since DDLewis in TWBB. If this is an indication of the films coming out this award season, I am so stoked. Easily the best film of the year, my buddy asked as we were going in ""Wonder if this will be better than Gravity?"" That question now seems incredibly silly as this film makes Gravity look like the freaking Smurfs. I'm hoping American Hustle can give it a run for it's money but I'm starting to think there isn't a chance. This is a rare, once in a decade treat. 2 hours and 15 minutes of raw emotion.

Not just the time Northrup spent, or the time that slaves were already there for generations by this point of the 1840's, and that it was an institution completely set in its place, but in cinema. Case in point is when Solomon - aka 'Platt' by the slave-trader who put him away - is strung up following a fight with one of the 'masters' played by Paul Dano, and he would be hung but there's a problem with doing that without the main master on hand. So, Solomon is just left to hang. For hours.

332,27 January 2014,jboothmillard,9, 12 Years a Slave,"I heard about this film during it's release, I knew it had the star of Love Actually and The Shadow Line in it, and then awards season started, this was one of the most nominated, I had to see why, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame). Based on the autobiography of the real man, in the year 1841, Solomon Northup (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man living in the society of Saratoga Springs, New York with his wife Anne Northup (Kelsey Scott) and two children, and he makes a living as a violinist, but his life is snatched from him when two men, Brown (Scoot McNairy) and Hamilton (Taran Killam), take him out of town to what he believes will be a music gig, but he is drugged and chained up. Northup is sold into slavery, given the name of an escaped slave, Platt, and taken to the deep south of New Orleans, upscale but callous slave trader Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) sells him to good-willed plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), the master is kind to let him have a violin. Tension rise between him and racist carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) who verbally abuses him, to the point when they fight, afterwards Northup endures hours of agony in a noose, Ford sees the only way to save him is to sell him to Edwin Epps (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michael Fassbender), Ford has a debt to pay so cannot listen to his pleas of his identity. Epps is a vicious master, believing he has the right to abuse his slaves according to pro-slavery verses in the Bible, both true and false ones, he encourages the slaves to accept whatever they endure, and they will be beaten unless they pick up to 200 pounds of cotton every day, one slave who is praised lustfully by Epps, picking up to 500 pounds a day, is Patsey (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Lupita Nyong'o), who Northup becomes close friends with as they endure their traumas. Patsey is violently abused by the envious and nasty wife Mistress Epps (Sarah Paulson) at many opportune moments, and Epps himself rapes the girl repeatedly, and Patsey feels so weak and horrified with her situation that she asks Northup to assist her suicide, but he refuses, he meanwhile along with other slaves are leased to a neighbouring plantation due to cotton worms, apparently a godly plague, and there he gains favour from the owner who lets him play his violin at a wedding anniversary celebration and keep his earnings. Northup wants to use his earnings to try and send a message home, he pays white field hand and former overseer Armsby (Garret Dillahunt) to send a letter to his friends in New York, the man takes the money but betrays him, Epps is informed but is just about convinced by Northup that the story is untrue, and he is tearfully forced to burn the letter, his only hope for freedom. Patsey one day goes missing from the plantation, she returns revealing that she was fetching soap as Epps' wife refuses to give her any to clean, and in anger Epps orders her stripped and tied to a tree, the wife encourages her husband to get Northup to whip her, he reluctantly agrees and does so, but Epps takes the whip wanting it done more savagely, and she is lashed until severely wounded and unconscious. While Patsey heals Northup starts building a gazebo with a fellow construction worker, white Canadian carpenter Bass (Brad Pitt, also producing), he is opposed to slavery which displeases Epps, but Northup confides in this man about his kidnapping and formerly being a free man, he once again asks for help sending a letter to New York, and Bass agrees to risk his life and do so. Eventually the local sheriff calls Northup over, he is asked a series of questions based on the letter of facts received, and he instantly recognises the shopkeeper with him, they have come to free him, Epps is angry at his slave being taken and Patsey is devastated to lose her friend, but he is taken away immediately. Having been enslaved for twelve years Northup returns to life as a free man and an emotional reunion with his wife, older children and a grandchild, the end text tells that the law could not convict those who forced Northup into slavery, and also that the details of his death and burial have never been found. Also starring Adepero Oduye as Eliza and Alfre Woodard as Mistress Shaw. Ejiofor is absolutely compelling as the black man who has his life stolen from him as he is forced into slavery, Fassbender is fantastic as the unsympathetic and malicious slave master, Nyong'o is magnificent as the female slave often hideously raped and beaten, and Cumberbatch, Giamatti and Pitt all do their supporting roles very well also. Apart from Django Unchained, this is one of the only films about slavery from the point of view of an enslaved person, the period detail is impeccable, the brutal and shocking material such as constant ""N"" words, torture and violence is poignant, and the emotions of suffering, misery, courage and hope seen throughout truly impress, McQueen is a true perfectionist and this film is absolute must see, a brilliant period drama based on a true story. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Hans Zimmer, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Original Score.

334,4 January 2014,valadas,8, Explosive images and superb acting,Black is beautiful. This is in my opinion the best movie about slavery ever made. Because it portrays the drama of slavery not only in the usual general terms but also the personal and individual drama of the main protagonists with great depth. A free black man who lives in the north with his wife and children is abducted and taken to Georgia where he is turned into a slave to work as a farm labourer in extremely hard conditions. Through the story dramatically very well told in images and scenes we are also aware of the process of slavery with all its course of violence and the severe violation of the most basic human rights of men and women. The images and scenes are powerful and extremely impressive. The acting by all performers is superb and there is a remarkable set of black performers who do an excellent job. This is in fact an unmissable movie.,

Yes this is a tragic and appalling story but no more so than that of any other slave. A free man taken as a slave! Well forgive me but weren't all the slaves free men before they were taken? There have been many many movies on slavery over the years and imo this is not one of the best but the Oscar spin machine is in full overdrive banging on about this movie. However that being said I have come to understand that my views quite often differ from the general populous but this film is long and boring and doesn't tell a particularly gripping or entertaining story, far from conveying the horror of slavery this portrayal seems to show the protagonist living a life far better than other slaves that have had their stories told. This year Hollywood seems to have produced the most drawn out boring movies for decades. The desolation of Snores is another one on the list. 1 BOOK 1 FILM JACKSON YOU'VE RUINED IT!!!.

Steve McQueen (the director not the great actor whose fame he is possibly benefiting from)undoubtedly knows how to create emotion in the crudest of ways using scenes which would abhor any fair person. However there is very little signs of skillful film making just a formulaic hitting of peoples emotional and moral buttons.

Neither the directing, the acting, nor the story itself were even close to Best Picture quality. It was slow, wooden and full of clichés. Chiwetel Ejiofor's acting was nothing special; I got tired of his perpetually pained expression filling the screen. Why didn't he age or grow thinner? Did they have to portray all slave owners as sadistic? And that final scene was so painfully stiff and staged it seemed as though the director and screen writer just ran out of energy.

Similar to Schindler's List in a way, in that it's important material that's well-acted and deeply moving, but also very tough to get through in places. That comparison isn't completely fair, of course. Though Chiwetel Ejiofor serves well in the leading role and Lupita Nyong'o is memorable (if one-note) in support, there is no Liam Neeson-level central performance in this picture and the cast very quickly falls into camps of good and evil with little middle ground. Michael Fassbender fares best as the deeply troubled alcoholic slave-owner Epps, but he's present largely to be despised and as such his character lacks a thorough inspection. The other name actors, shoehorned in as bit roles, only serve to distract. We can slap an Amish beard on Brad Pitt and throw him onto a plantation, but it's still Brad Pitt in those suspenders and there's no getting around that.

It's hard to get your head around the fact that this is pretty recent history and it's still an open sore in America. The acceptance by the majority of white society at the time, of the concept of ownership of a human being , is something that still mystifies me. Mind you if you watch a few episodes of Downton Abbey and see how the staff were treated even up to the 1940s you will get a good idea where it came from. Can you believe that a Naval Architect from Liverpool was given an award for a design that allowed for more slaves to be jammed in at the prow of a slave ship? But I digress. This is raw and emotional stuff and it hits you right in the solar plexus. With that in mind, you don't really need to linger with shots of extreme anguish such as the scene with the rope, or the close up of Solomon Northup's despairing face.

They drug him and he is then sent on a boat to the American South, wherein slavery is legal and these kidnappings were apparently common. Northup is sold though this black market slave trade and is given a new Name ""Platt"".

These long shots mimicked life, what the viewer would really see if he or she stood witness to the atrocities. Based on the true life of Solomon Northup, a man who was captured and stripped of his rights, escaping 12 years later and writing his story: Solomon is an educated man, exquisitely played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, from New York in the late 1800s, who lives happily with his wife and two children. He is kidnapped and taken on a ""reverse underground railroad"", eventually deposited in the deep South, his identity beaten out of him, watching as others in captivity like him are abused and murdered for trying to escape, speaking, for following orders, after crying for stolen children. We follow this man from plantation to plantation, sometimes picking cotton, other times building homes, hacking sugar canes, etc. etc. meeting different Masters and their wives. Through Solomon's eyes we see the system of slavery that entrenches every character, man, woman, child, black, white. Solomon keeps trying to survive long enough to escape and see his family again, back in New York, but as he so eloquently explains to another man while in captivity who suggests he ""keep your head low, don't let them (those keeping them in captivity) know who you really are"" (lest he is brutalized or murdered for knowing more than a slave should know), ""I don't want to survive. I want to live."" The final Master before our protagonist is released after more than a decade in captivity exemplifies so many conflicting character points. A drunk Master, unpredictable, charmed by his slaves (rousing them from sleep many a night to entertain him in the parlor, dancing to songs that he demanded our protagonist play on his violin) like a person who collects Pokemon cards, picking up or discarding at whim, while Master wife looks on in disgust and contempt. He is charmed enough by his slaves that his wife, violently wracked by jealousy when her Master husband singles out a slave girl and rapes her every night, threatens to leave him often and questions his loyalty to his own white race. He's superstitious and admissions that there is no ""intrinsic truth or justice, just what is financially his"". This character hates himself for liking his slaves, for lusting after one, and his jealousy when his chosen rape slave produces soap given to her by another plantation owner moves him to whip her within an inch of her life. My debt, my money, my property. His anti-thesis is the Brad Pitt character, ""What is good for one is good for all. Laws change. What if one day our rights are lost and we (the whites) become the slaves?"" The script is powerful. The words heavy and time appropriate and illuminating.",

The film has a screenplay by John Ridley, based on the book by the same written by Solomon Northup in the 1860's on his encounter with the slavery that makes you bind as well as bite your nails and even sympathize with the circumstances shown in the film, then the cinematography by Sean Bobbitt not only captures the best of the slavery and brutality but also reminds us of the camera-work as we saw in the film of John Ford. The production design by Adam Stockhausen, costume design by Patricia Norris and even the sound design by Leslie Shatz and Bryan Arenas are simply perfect to say the least. In the performances, Chiwetel Ejifor, Dwight Henry, Kelsey Scott, Scoot Mcnairy and rest are simply riveting and convincing as well.

If Chitwitel Ejiofor didn't give the best performance of 2013, I don't know who did. What an incredible actor. Every shot in which his face takes up most of the frame you can see it in his eyes.

Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, a carpenter and fiddle player who is sold into slavery after being misled into another gig. Away from his family he keeps to himself yet still receives brutal treatment by those whom see him as property to do with as will. Set in 1841 director Steve McQueen addresses individuals who were freed and taken from their lives in the name of greed and corruption. He previously directed Shame another film about an individual trapped in a lifestyle with hopes of escape. Ejiofor holds strong during the tough times yet striving with the hope of eventually regaining his freedom. Michael Fassbender plays a racist plantation owner named Edwin Epps whose wife is jealous with his constant sexual flings with Patsey, one of the slave girls. Lupita Nyong'o plays Patsey, in constant pain with several sexual assaults as well as abuse from Epps's wife. She is eventually whipped nearly to death with Epps forcing Solomon to do the deed. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Solomon's first owner who tries to protect his interest but eventually has to sell him to Epps. Brad Pitt plays a listening and sympathetic ear that results in him taking a risk to do what is right. Director McQueen creates an emotionally draining film that really captures the era and one man's strong hold of twelve years before his hope becomes a reality. Score: 10 / 10",

I know that seems an odd thing to say, but Hollywood's past is littered with well-intentioned dramas that, driven by the need to appeal to the widest possible audience, have filtered their racially- charged stories through the eyes of sympathetic white characters, who are there not merely to right moral wrongs and to alleviate the sufferings of the afflicted, but to make the audience feel better about themselves, secure in the knowledge that THEY would surely never have participated in anything so vile or unjust had they been there at the time. Not that that aren't a few ""decent"" slave owners around - ""decent"" being but a relative term here - but those who made ""12 Years a Slave"" have no intention of letting the audience off the hook so easily. As Eliza - a woman who has had her two children cruelly ripped away from her and sold to someone else - points out to a fellow slave when he begins to describe the plantation master as a decent man, no person who buys and sells other human beings as property can ever be described as decent or good.",

Those guilt ridden white suits dare NOT give it an Oscar right? Or maybe it's a trade-off: they get to use the word 'nigger' (otherwise known as the n-word) as much as they want in a movie and in return black people get an Oscar or two. 'The Help' which was nothing more than a polite regurgitation of an old sore and was hardly worth an Oscar so I wasn't expecting much from this one. Fortunately it's actually a good film with an A-list cast. But as movies are heightened reality we do get an overly racist and sadistic plantation owner (great performance by Michael Fassbender) just as every German in a WWII film is a jew-hating killing machine who deserves to die in the most horrible way. Hollywood just likes good and evil to be nicely separated. They gave an Oscar to Ralph Fiennes as a sadistic camp leader in Schindlers List, so I expect the same for Fassbender here folks. With all this being said, despite it's 134 min runtine, it will pass in no time as it is just incredibly well made and is worth your time.

The film may be Oscar-bait, but that doesn't stop the film from being a powerful, unflinching take on the brutality of slavery in the Antebellum Period. The film is very hard to watch and some scenes, especially the violent whipping scenes, I had to turn away. But the film tells the dark side to American history in such a cold, unforgiving manner. That makes the film even more powerful and emotional as we view the exploits of the main character, Solomon Northup.",
416,14 November 2013,james1844,8, Twelve Years Stolen,A bit slow to start and yet a movie with a delivery unlike any other. The story seems to be simple and yet it pulls at your conscience. The outstanding performance of almost all the cast makes this a truly deep and realistic portrayal of the injustices that were an everyday way of life in the slavery states during the PreCivil War era. ,
417,17 January 2014,philthegreatone-786-63058,9, Masterpiece,This is based on a true story about the writings of Solomon Northup. A freeman in 1841 who had a wife and family. He was a violin player who was tricked into the promise of a job by two men who drugged him and sold him into slavery for 12 years. Now this is not an easy film to watch. Some very harsh scenes on how slaves were treated on the south back then. Solomon played by Chewitel Ejifor in a great performance spent his time with 3 different slave owners. All treating him in different ways. The pain and suffering he had to endure was moving and very inspiring. Michael Fassbender plays the harshest owner he faced and he is amazing as a cruel human being who believes he can do what he wants with his property. Steve McQueen the director puts us in the thick of it and really shows the brutality of slavery. The music in the film is great as well as the performances and whole production looks great. This is a film that stays with you and can affect you with the harshness of the story. This film should win best picture at the Oscars in March. I highly recommend this great and very moving film.,

Why on earth did those men who were meant to be kind just betrayed Solomon North up like that? I swear, this film makes you so darn angry by the way the whites treated the blacks, it was cruel, disgusting and shameful. What did they do to deserve the abuse? Absolutely nothing!

A true story of a free man taken in to slavery and eventually escaping! A moving story, well played by all involved. The main actors are brilliant unknowns and the Director - Steve McQueen - has just captured my future attention. Brad Pitt even appears without his usual spastic moves. This movie is perhaps more worthy than Roots as the best depiction of the broken humanity that slavery caused. My odds-on favorite for several Oscars. One weak point - and I'm not sure if this is in the book: the ease which the main character appears to be 'captured'. That a family man would tell no-one of his plans leaves one to wonder what's being left out.",

424,12 March 2014,truth-teller,4, Massive Yawnfest,"12 Years a Slave, had it been conceived, written and directed by a 12 year old, might have deserved its lavish praise. As it was not, it is unfortunately the most over-hyped movie in a while. For youngsters who were not yet born, nor old enough to remember the TV series ""Roots"", 12 Years a Slave may well seem shocking, and a serious and meaningful stab at bringing this subject to life, but the superficiality, plodding pace and relentless sermonising killed any emotional impact it could have had. It wasn't short on suffering, most of it endured by the audience who suffered right from the start, as the first 10 minutes or so was irritatingly shot in semi-darkness and extreme close-up, making it jerky and difficult to follow. This broke any rule of ""grab their attention right from the beginning"", as the stream of apparently unrelated scenes made it seem as though the director couldn't decide on how or where to begin.",
425,6 January 2021,hmnorman,7, I wished for more,"This movie was good. The timeline seemed a little lost to me because I wished that the directors would have done a better job showing the time that Solomon was a slave. The only indication we have of Solomon's timeline is his signs of aging and the title of the movie itself. With that said, all of the events in the movie seem smashed together and theres no true indication of seasons or years or any celebrations of holidays or birthdays in any of the characters. Giving a deeper sense of the 12 years would have helped audiences understand the true length that Solomon was suffering.
Cumberpatch and Ejiofor's performances are stunning, and there is plenty of suspense in the movie. However, I also found myself yearning for more emotional scenes throughout the movie but there are truly only a couple. One specifically in the beginning and one at the very end.
Also, they never explain the ""sex"" scene that open the entire movie. The woman is insignificant to Solomon's time as a slave because she's never seen again throughout the entire movie. I wished they would have explained this scene because it's explanation would have added background but it feels like it was just supposed to be a shock-scene to get people's attention.
The fact that this is a true story about a very real man makes this movie compelling, and the film truly does make you wonder how we as a society were ever okay with slavery. The actors did a lovely job. I might watch again.",

Slavery and racial discrimination although were in prime focus as shown in America during that era but that exist in other periods, including present day in many parts of world as well which can be conterminous to human trafficking, inequality and human rights violation as such.
The screenplay, the use of verbal skills were apt. Accents were spectacular. The songs in the farms and others scenes as shown were much needed. Solomon's continuous urge describing himself as 'freeman' make us realise what freedom actually means. The lynching of Patsey all over just a piece of soap was absolutely heart racking as the cruelty solely signifies how delirious a person can go for the obsession of totalitarian regimes.

433,12 March 2014,higherall7,9, Down the Rabbit-Hole into Slavery...,"'Twelve Years a Slave' is a tightly written, well-crafted film that further explores Ingmar Bergman's assertion that Film has nothing to do with Literature, but shares greater affinities with Painting, Music and Photography. The film itself is beautiful to look at; owing to its Director Steve McQueen and its Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt as well as its Film Editor Joe Walker. While others I talked to found the film 'brutal', I found it remarkably restrained and its narrative compelling without being driven by the roller-coaster pyrotechnics of films post Indiana Jones. The film explores a set of issues with intelligence albeit going down a well-trodden road. The Three Laws of Fred Williamson are applied here for once with a subtle sophistication and a hint of profound implication rarely to be seen during the Blaxploitation Era.",
434,26 January 2014,l_rawjalaurence,7, No-Holds-Barred Depiction of Slavery's Iniquities,"12 YEARS A SLAVE doesn't pull its punches as far as the depiction of the sufferings of slavery is concerned. There are several harrowing sequences showing the ways in which the white masters exert their authority, especially at Edwin Epps' (Michael Fassbender's) plantation, where slaves and whites look on as Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is whipped for little or no reason. In Steve McQueen's film, there is no such thing as a 'good' master: although Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) understands Solomon's (Chiwetel Ejofor's) suffering, he feels unable to intervene; as a slave, Solomon is part of a debt that Ford has had to pass on to Epps. The one 'good' white, Bass (Brad Pitt) is not an American, but a Canadian immigrant and therefore 'untainted' by the whites' creed during the antebellum era. The film is not without its questionable elements: one wonders whether a slave would be forced to whip a fellow-slave (most slave-owners had white overseers to undertake that task); and the issue of Solomon's release is perfunctorily handled (Bass delivers a letter which leads to Solomon's release from servitude, despite Epps' justifiable objections. Surely Epps, as the legal owner of Solomon/Platt, would have been able to challenge the decision in court. Nonetheless, it is a vivid dramatization of Northup's 1853 autobiography, reminding us that, even in the post-civil rights era, there are still people doomed to a life of penury with little hope of redress.",

437,7 November 2013,tadpole-596-918256,8, This movie and GONE WITH THE WIND can't BOTH be true . . .,". . . so let's use some common sense to resolve this cinematic contradiction. Tempting as it may be to give the more recent ""history"" of slavery the ""benefit of the doubt,"" this fallacious mode of thinking gives in to the ""tyranny of the NOW."" In WIND, black workers in Georgia get room & board, are generally well treated, and are proud to fight side-by-side with their white owners to perpetuate the only civilization they've ever known during the U.S. Civil War. In 12, on the other hand, Peach State slaves frequently demean each other with the ""N-word,"" are mercilessly raped and flogged, and cower on run-down plantations devoid of ballroom dancing. Which of these pictures is more accurate: WIND's or 12's? WIND's vision, in which Blacks work patiently toward a better tomorrow, was given the Best Picture Oscar for 1939--a distinction that is re-validated each year it is not revoked (not to mention the fact that WIND set all-time box office records). In today's climate of Political Correctness, its dozen Oscars would be snatched away quicker than you could filch 200 victories from Joe Paterno if there were anything truly objectionable or inaccurate about it. By contrast, 12 has a much more meager musical score, and its lack of action scenes classify it as low-budget fare relegated to play only at so-called ""art houses"" to date. This probably is for the best. Whereas WIND was a stepping stone allowing Blacks to take home their first Oscar (presaging Jackie Robinson with the Dodgers, everyone with the NBA, and Obama in the White House), 12 seems Hell-bent on perpetuating racial conflict today by its implication that white American Southerners of the early 1800s were racist beasts (with the men looking so scruffy in their unkempt beards that they could fit right in with today's Boston Red Sox!). Just as documented anti-Semite director Mel Gibson's flogging ""torture porn"" was a widely perceived and obviously delusional attempt to besmirch American Jews a few years back in his PASSION OF THE CHR!ST, 12 director Steve McQueen's use of flogging torture porn (against the plantation's most compliant and best worker, no less!) may have a similar misguided ulterior motive.

This is largely down to the performances of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o who were both convincing in their respective roles - I really felt for them and found myself trying to empathise with how much they must have suffered, but I feel it's impossible to truly appreciate the appalling treatment that these slaves must have suffered back in the 1840's.",

Let's start with pros: excellent cast performances (with outstanding Mr. Eijofor towards the end, Mr. Fassbender all the way, Miss Nyong'o and Mr. Dano, whose destiny is to play psychotic maniacs). Let's continue with the mediocre: direction, cinematography and editing. Now let's finish with bad: writing. The story is simply mixed up: writers could not decide what was important and what wasn't. The movie is simultaneously too long and too short. It has some unnecessarily extended scenes (probably symbolic but with no meaning in context), which should have been cut out, and lacks character developing. The final product a superficial portrait of an American antebellum era, even today looking almost as bad as the Nazism. To think that the capitalist economy has been built on theft, robbery, slavery and hypocrisy (justifying it through the Bible) and almost all the guilty got away with it! I guess that's why today white Americans are so patriotic: they not only took the land from the native inhabitants, but built their welfare on slavery and exploiting anyone who was not white (Chinese building railroads and so on). But, this film barely touches any of those problems as it should. It's just an excerpt from one man's (and his book) life. Nothing too deep or truly emotional, almost cheap like the articles in tabloids. This is not a good movie. It could be far more better but it isn't. It has moments (mainly main characters performances; therefore 6 stars) but as a whole fails to deliver an important message on humanity (as well as some political and moral messages) and be a movie that makes sense.

Chiwatel, Brad Pitt, and Lupita Nyongo, and Michael Fassbender all do marvelously and are so Oscar worthy. I also love how they didn't shy away from being graphic and realistic, because a film like this needs to be graphic and violent in order to portray the realistic quality. They also didn't shy away from showing some sex scenes and some pretty graphic nudity, which once again is very necessary in order to be true to how it really was back in slave times. This movie did go a little bit too slow I think, I do think that a couple of scenes drug on a little bit too much. But that was just a minor issue that I had with it, it was minor because the fantastic acting and the great visuals overshadowed it. Keep in mind that this movie is NOT for the weak stomached people or people that become queezy easily. The script is pretty good too, I was pretty impressed with it. 8/10 for 12 years a slave.

As far as I know, it is a question that has been answered already. But the Academy can't help but pat themselves on the back because they have, for the first time, given their Best Picture award to a film written and directed by black filmmakers. Instead of feeling proud, I may instead wonder why they haven't been giving awards to filmmakers of diversity all these years. I suppose they are an American institution and they focus on American films and films that engage with the American sensibility. In this case they have chosen to acknowledge an issue which has largely been sorted in the American cultural mind. ",

Although it wouldn't have been my choice for Oscar, it is worthy of the award. I was prepared for the brutality, almost over-prepared, as I thought it would be akin to Schindler's List, but it is a much different movie. I noticed Chiwetel Ejiofor in ""Serendipity"" a while ago, and it's good to see him in a meaningful movie doing an excellent acting job. He acts his character as dignified yet confused and vulnerable, and still hopeful. Director McQueen also deserves praise for attention to detail. Being almost 150 years since Slavery's abolition, the oldest person in the world is still likely 2 generations removed from it. There is no-one left to give 1st person accounts of it. This story helps to try to bring it front and center to remind us that it was real and a bold stain on America's young History. Indeed Slavery's roots though are much older.

461,4 June 2016,lorraineesimpson,10, Great movie,"I resisted going to see this film at the cinema because, to be honest, it didn't particularly interest me. I'm not keen on Hollywood when it tries to be worthy and demonstrate a social conscience, and if I wanted to be preached at for a couple of hours I would still be a church goer. So, when the film came on TV I was a bit hesitant but there was nothing else worth watching so thought I would give it a try. So glad I did as this is a very good film which largely avoids sentiment or overstating any aspect of the disgrace that was slavery. ",
462,19 July 2014,brando647,9, An Exceptional Film; the Best of 2013,"I can't remember the last time I've watched a movie as powerful as Steve McQueen's 12 YEARS A SLAVE. It's an epic film bringing to life the horrors of American slavery in the nineteenth century. We learn about the atrocities in school but it doesn't quite deliver the message as well as witnessing them with our own eyes. The plight of early African Americans has been covered in countless other films but McQueen's film has a level of authenticity I don't know that I've seen before. It's a period piece that spared no expense in bringing the plantation-era South to life and it's filled to the brim with brilliant cast. It's based on the true story of Solomon Northup (portrayed in the film by Chiwetel Ejiofor) though, as is the case with any true-life film stories, I couldn't tell you how accurate the events might be. Solomon was born a free man in the North and was living a successful life with his wife and children in New York when he was kidnapped and smuggled to New Orleans to be sold as a slave. Over the course of the next twelve years, Solomon would experience horrors no man should endure and fight to maintain his humanity when treated as nothing more than personal property. He starts on a plantation with the kind-hearted Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) but circumstances force him into the employ of the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Epps and his wife are evil incarnate with total disregard for the lives of their slaves, frequently utilizing humiliation and brutal punishment to crush their spirits. With hopes of reunification with his family in the North, Solomon must scheme to regain his freedom while remaining under the nose of his violent, alcoholic owner.",
463,11 March 2014,thepepperlanders,5, The Book is great......... The movie ? ...so ...so,"If you want to watch how modern day Hollywood elites view slavery then by all means watch the movie. The visuals are outstanding. If you prefer historical accuracy, you should read the book (free online since the copyright has long since expired. In the movie, Soloman Northrup is kidnapped and taken aboard a slave ship with other blacks (and of course with evil white sailors) and sold into slavery. In the book he is kidnapped and held by a decent crew. One crewman even sends a letter to his family in New York letting them know about the kidnapping. His family contacts the governor of New York and all decide that it's best to wait until he is purchased to better find him. In the movie his decent owner doesn't want to hear about any kidnapping. In the book Soloman Northup's biggest regret is not telling his decent owner of the kidnapping because he later realized it's likely he would have been released from bondage. The book is an outstanding read about slavery from an very observant and wise man. He sees the world in shades of grey. Some southern whites are good and some are bad, just like up North. He is consistent in finding slavery as a terrible institution but also understands how a persons environment shapes their beliefs. An interesting tidbit is that the original asking price for Soloman Northrup is $1500. In the book, he gets smallpox and gets very sick soon after arriving and is sent to the hospital where he says he is treated decently. After a few weeks he comes back pockmarked and is sold for $1000. One should note that most people couldn't own slaves and that there were even a few wealthy blacks that owned slaves. The price of slaves ran from several hundred dollars all the way up to several thousand (not surprisingly) for a beautiful & female slave. The average income of a printer in 1850 (a well paid profession at that time) was over a bit $300 year. The majority of whites in the south didn't make enough money to even own one slave. The dialogue of the whites and blacks in the movie is a terrible interpretation of a wonderful book that should be required reading in all American middle school classes. Unfortunately Americans don't read and the movie will become part of our ""official"" history. My advice, read the book instead and you will get a much better understanding of what he went though and the institution of slavery.",

""12 Years a Slave"" was certainly the most important movie of 2013 and the most difficult to watch film in decades thanks to its spot-on depiction of the horrors of slavery in the American South. Unlike slavery in South America, it was illegal in the U.S. to teach slaves reading or writing, they could not marry, they could not gather in groups except for religious services, they could not own anything, and they were nothing more than chattel. Manumission was generally impossible. The brilliant acting, directly, and writing of ""12 Years a Slave"" brought this all to life. It is impossible to watch this film and not ask how we could allow the South back into the Union without executing its leaders for treason and how we cannot allow the flag of the rebels, the Confederacy to be flown within our borders. I can't think of any other nation on earth that was so forgiving to those who engaged in high treason and rebellion.",

It wasn't because I felt guilty for something my ancestors may (or may not) have had responsibility for, but because occasionally I felt that the movie wallowed in its own misery. It also felt exploitative and emotionally manipulative at times. That said, if one does not come away from this absolutely detesting slavery as an institution, there is something truly wrong with you. Fortunately, this story has a happy(ish) ending. Otherwise, the oppressive atmosphere might have choked all the life out of the story. On a technical level, the movie is astounding. Steve McQueen is an auteur to watch, now having three critically praised films under his belt. I also loved the score by Hans Zimmer, which was stark when it needed to be, but also filled with tenderness and longing. There are also several Negro spirituals peppered throughout which were also uplifting. Overall, this is a must-see film, not just because it's won a lot of awards, but because it treats a touchy subject with the honesty it deserves. However, I wouldn't watch it more than once unless you're a glutton for punishment.",

It was one of the most grim periods in American history. Slavery, however, is realistically demonstrated in this historical drama, based on a novel and real-life tale. Chiwetel Eijofor plays Solomon Northup, a free African-American husband and father of two, who is devastatingly stripped of his innocence when he betrayed by white men and sold into slavery. There, Northup struggles trying to survive the harsh reality of slavery in the Louisiania plantation, run by William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). ",

The beauty of a film titled 12 Years A Slave, is it's straightforwardness and self-aware narration. Like so many movies before it, this remarkable tale of Solomon Northup's unbelievable journey of survival, may not be familiar from the character names, but the story shares many narrative arcs of other slavery driven melodramas. Fortunately for us, 12 Years a Slave breaks its cliché stigma thanks simply to one of the greatest living directors working today, Steve McQueen. McQueen, an enigmatic British story teller, has had indie success since his riveting Hunger and more importantly, the sadly overlooked Shame. Having an incredible visual understanding as well as dramatically perverse eye, McQueen captures an unapologetic and extraordinary film of the tackle of evil, and the eventual glory of justice.",
472,9 October 2021,owen-watts,7, A wild BRAD PITT appeared!,"Decided to take a dive into McQueen's filmography after falling in love with the granular and earthy Small Axe series. This, his big breakthrough, is a hypnotising and earnest retelling of the disturbing experiences of Solomon Northup, a free man taken into slavery in the 1840s. Everything feels authentic here and at times you can feel like you're staring starkly back into the past itself. The performances are largely brilliant, but by design or not it's hard to ""feel"" the 12 years tangibly pass without many seasonal signifiers (it was filmed over just a few summer months). It's also difficult to get a grip on any other enslaved characters (with the exception of the painfully trapped Nyong'o) and Brad Pitt's sudden appearance as the man who emancipates Solomon is almost comically abrupt like a heavy-handed cameo. It wrenched me right out of it, in fact. Still - a dense and remarkable film - and further into McQueen's canon I'll go.",

It's just amazing to think that with the treatment that Solomon or Platt went through for 12 years and separated from his family at the kidnapping and still fought through it for so long to get freed. The amount of courage that it takes and will to live to just take 100 lashes a week and basically be bullied severely every day for being black for 12 years is astounding, most of us don't have it.

Without a doubt this is a film everyone should watch, and I can only guess why this story is not as well known as it should be (hopefully thanks to this movie it now will be) is purely down to white guilt. The direction here is sublimely good throughout, the writing is perfect and never manipulative or forced, the characters believable and Ejiofor couldn't be any better in the lead role. It's not an easy watch at times, just as it should be, but it's so worthy of a look as an overall finely-made and important piece of cinema. And as such this comes highly recommended.",
478,11 February 2014,badajoz-1,5, Worthy but very predictable and dull,"The subject of this film is so worthy, it cannot be criticised. The slavery of Africans and their descendants in the USA in the years after independence is obscene and horrific. There I've said it in a sentence - this film beats you into submission in over two hours' running time by depicting the horrors and obscenity over and over again. It has nothing new to say, and with 150 years distance between the events, we can all leave the cinema feeling good about ourselves and how much more civilised we are today. I just wonder why Samuel L. Jackson questions the movie and points out today's racism!? But back to the movie - plot, free black man is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South of America, surviving by accepting his position and not fighting back despite witnessing rape and whipping and getting plenty of lashings himself. Again one sentence's worth and you have the film of over two hours. The script is relentless - some exploration of the economics of slavery might have helped point out its ridiculous and violent meaning. The direction is full of overlong imagery that is so obvious and bores the audience. The acting is perfunctory to say the least - Chitewol Edifor almost has a permanent look of bemused disbelief as he keeps his head down, Fassbender just goes over the top as a mad man so no blame to southern citizens really then, the rest just put up a cliché of the symbol they are meant to represent, eg suffering beautiful female slave lashed to smithereens, and Brad Pitt swaggers in as a symbol of liberal Hollywood coming to rescue all 'God;s chillum.' But it packs a punch and tells a tale to remind the arrogant, greatest democracy in the world of its dark past, when most Americans looked the other way for so long. It is a pity that the aftermath of Northup's release is not touched on except in a few words over the final credits - but that would have implicated the US too much like the portrayal of the Emancipation Act in the much better 'Lincoln.' Remember 'Amistad' failed at the Box Office because of such scenes as a British sailor telling the US that the UK had long abolished slavery - Oops.",
479,17 May 2015,ericschneider-42656,7, Could Be A Hell of a Lot Worse,"There is not much I can really say about this movie. This is one of very few films that leaves me feeling neutral. The acting is very impressive throughout. However, even great acting can't save a movie from a faulty plot. The movie has a very narrow range of intensity. In order to excite, a movie needs to go from 0 to 100 and then back to 0 quickly, and repeatedly. This movie starts out at a good 30 and eventually gets to about 60. C'mon guys, its a slave movie; if you think whipping is going to feel intense in that context, you are mistaken. Overall, the whole film is predictable, even the resolution. All that said, I can move beyond that and get through it without feeling as if the time was truly wasted. The only intense criticism I have stems from a brief sex scene at the beginning. After reading up on the basis of this movie, I found that Northup's autobiography no where states that he violated his marriage by having sex with another slave. This modification, supposedly warranted by ""artistic license"", just feels like a cheap and distasteful stab at Northup's legacy, though probably not intentionally. Again, some really great acting, but nothing too special about the movie as a whole.",

I may sound cynical, but if there's one thing I've learnt you can never be TOO skeptical as far as cinema politics are concerned. Movies frequently win prizes because of the 'issues' surrounding them, not due to any specific quality.

""12 Years a Slave"" (R, 2:14) manages to solve this problem. While making the lives of slaves look and feel more real than most portrayals of the subject, this film also manages to humanize the slaves' suffering – and underlying dignity – more effectively than I've ever seen it done before.

To get to the reason why, here are two questions: Two questions for you dear reader (and those who have seen this film). 1. What did new things you learn about slavery because of this film? My answer is quite a few things (that free people were kidnapped into slavery, how they were sold, how they lived, how they were gagged, etc.) Maybe not revolutionary things but still. 2. Describe to me what you learned about the lead character? My answer would be: he's a educated man who loves his family and can play the violin. That's it. This, to me, is the major flaw of this film. I don't know this man. What does he think? What are his doubts? Why don't we see him do anything to try to get out or how he plans to survive this ordeal? Why does he try to run away so late into his plight? Why not try again? And most important: what 'arc' did he have? How did he change because of what happened to him? Did he learn anything? Did he grow? Did he change (for better or worse)? It's a classical approach to storytelling that goes back to the old Greeks for a reason. If a character doesn't dramatically change, there is no point for the drama. I respect the film and what it tries to do.

Hollywood tapped into a number of films exploring African American suffering in 2013 (Lincoln, Fruitvale Station, The Butler), but this particular film's examination of violence and the submissive character reactions has a timeless quality. It could mirror how after September 11 political prisoners were detained without legal rights and physically and mentally abused under the suspicion of not sharing the same political and religious values: such is the film's contemporary relevance and power, which is pertinent and unforgettable.",

Unfortunately, what I got was poor plot, little character development, and scenes that made you want to leave the room. Let's be honest; it is not necessary to incorporate a 5 minute scene of Ejiofor staring into the distance. It is absolutely 100% boring and left me appalled on how this won best picture. The only reason why I gave this film a 3 was because of the superb acting by Lupita Nyong'o who gave the movie a small dose of hope, but it didn't last very long.

Michael Fassbender's flogging of the slave he's been regularly raping (Lupita Nyong'o) is as savage as anything Mel Gibson has put on screen, and Paul Dano's psychopathic overseer is almost more disturbing than Fassbender. Chiwetel Ejiofor's solid performance as Solomon anchors the film, but compared to Spielberg's epic AMISTAD and more recently Tarantino's vivid DJANGO UNCHAINED, there isn't a great deal of story here. At the end we're told what happened to Solomon, but the fate of his fellow slaves, like poor pathetic Patsey, is left for us to conjecture. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a harrowing 19th-century prison drama (OK, a false imprisonment drama) but it doesn't actually add anything to our knowledge of the inhuman evil that was slavery (and still is in parts of the world we're not encouraged to mention).",

But the good thing is only one of his slave masters was actually good t him and his name was Ford (played by Benedict Cumberbatch.) but too bad Solomon only has him as a slave master for only two years>) and Solomon was sold to Ford by a guy named Freeman (played by Paul Giamatti) in which Solomon is sold along with a girl named Patsey (played by Lupita Nyong'o in an Oscar winning performance.) Then after two years pass by Solomon and Patsey are sold to cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps (played by Michael Fassbender in an Oscar nominated performance.) along with his wife (played by a mean but brilliant Sarah Paulson) where they both get tortured, beat up, and Patsey gets raped in one scene. The way McQueen directs this movie is kind of like the way that Spielberg directed Schindler's List (1993), or Amistad (1997) (but to me this film is much better than Amistad.) but totally different. The movie is arguably the best movie of 2013 that really showed how horrible it was for black people who were enslaved by white people all because of their skin color, and fortunately none of that happens anymore even though there is still some racial prejudice going on the world a lot of times without even realizing it.",

504,7 March 2016,oOoBarracuda,7, 12 Years a SLave,"Steve McQueen's 2012 Best Picture winner, 12 Years a Slave provides an unflinching gaze into being black in the pre-Civil War United States. A film that touches so many levels of our nation's history, politics, economics, and morality; the film exists as a cornerstone for attempting to understand the struggle. One can never study too much, or gain too much of an understanding of something that shaped a nation and still contributes to today's understandings of individuals. If this year's presidential election is any indication, we need to be weary of the dark spots of our history so we avoid repeating them. 12 Years is a good place to start to gain a sense of that understanding.",
505,27 December 2017,simonsilvacreative,3, 12 Yrs Of Disappointment,"Anytime anyone makes a movie based on a controversial social or historically important subject, it automatically gives it spot in awards or importance. Although the subject matter in this movie is/was incredibly important to revisit, as a movie I felt it wasn't ""Best Movie"" worthy. The story telling was overwhelmed by the brutal scenes and sometimes a death or brutal scenes can become a low blow to the crotch. Overall the movie was fragmented and the inclusion of Brad Pitt with his poorly done accent lowered the believability of the story. The best part of the movie was the AMAZING performance by Michael Fassbender as the plantation owner. Michael's performance carries the whole movie and was well worth watching for his spectacular performance. Personally I believe that the movie Gravity was a much better executed movie overall!",

The perpetual violence dulls the mind to the point that the story becomes boring and perhaps is mostly made up. Anyone with bad experiences will exaggerate those experiences, especially if it is for commercial gain. I came away from this movie unimpressed. We all know slavery is bad so why try and make us guilty of it. It belongs to a different era with different ideals that we cannot contemplate. So if this movie is meant to shock me or profound me then it has not. Far from it. Perhaps the movie should be about the real protagonists, those behind the buying and selling of slaves in USA. They were most definitely not of Christian faith as is always portrayed by Hollywood.",

510,12 October 2014,Rickting,9, Difficult to watch but worth the effort,"12 Years A Slave tells the story of a free black man who was sold into slavery and remained a slave for 12 years before a chance encounter freed him. I love going to the cinema and in general it's a happy experience but this is easily the most depressing trip to the cinema I've ever had. 12YAS, which is in many ways even more depressing than Schindler's List, is a relentlessly unflinching and harrowing look at slavery which is crafted with great skill and brilliantly acted. Perhaps it is Oscar bait, but it genuinely deserved the awards attention it got. It's not a masterpiece or an all time classic though. It's slow and long, and there are various times when nothing is really happening and those scenes feel pointless as a result. Overall, it is a worthy film on a very depressing but important and rarely explored in cinema topic that gets most stuff right. Steve McQueen used to be an artist and it shows as his direction is excellent with a lot of stunning cinematography and effective long takes.",

I imagine it is authentic but the problem is that I could only catch about half of what was said. Chiwetel is great as the main character but when one can only follow parts of any conversation it spoils the effect of those parts of the script. It must have been a difficult task for the actors to treat each other so appallingly, even given they were only acting. It really is not a film that one can be said to ""enjoy"" it is more a question of appreciating it. Steve McQueen took on a difficult and even controversial subject in this film and it was never going to be a blockbuster. It has been honoured more for the subject and the bravery it took to make it than for it's quality.",

This movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a while and it has an incredibly moving story. The role played by all the actors in this movie are great and it made you believe that you were actually watching a documentary about slavery rather than a motion picture. Even though movie is dark at times it is a really good movie. I definitely think that some of the actors in this movie will be up for an Oscar and I also think this movie should be up for best picture. I really do recommend that you go and check this movie out because if you don't you will regret it.,

It's pitiful to see and angered me greatly throughout this film. The stage sets and clothing were believable. You had a feeling of entering this time in history which helped the film incredibly.

519,6 November 2021,OneAnjel,7, A poignant portrayal of this 180 year old ordeal,"This film had an artistic presentation that was almost sing-song and Off-Broadway. The historical dialect of slaves and use of words were not utilized (except in song), but rather the Director focused on having each verbal set staged as almost a poem or sonnet. At first, this feels like poor writing and delivery but becomes an important character in itself. It feels drawn out at times as the Director attempts to let us linger in the emotion. Overall, I think this is a poignant presentation that touches anyone with a heart. Ejiofor does a great job, and Pitt is a very seasoned actor, which shows in his small but important part.",
520,24 July 2015,hoernkeem,10, One of 2013's best film examines the brutal harshness of southern slavery adapted from a true story,"It strikes me that one of the best movies of last year was Tarantino's exploitation, revenge flick 'Django Unchained' revolving around slavery in a brutal yet stylized way. Arguably one of the best movies of this year '12 Years' is another brutal exploration of slavery in the pre-Civil War south yet it's brutality comes from the very realistic aspect of its presentation. The story surrounds a free black man living in upstate New York who gets duped, kidnapped and sold into slavery. From there the audience is continually presented with a myriad of archetypes illustrating the harsh reality of this institution that we as a nation allowed to exist and stain our soul for a hundreds of years from the establishment of the colonies through the birth of the nation. The film is simply shot allowing for the gravitas of what's occurring on the screen, the character interaction and the depth of the performances to truly sink in. The performances as a whole are impeccable and amazing to behold. To watch this and understand it is to imagine a world without hope; a world where men are not created equal; a world in this day and age seems foreign and strange although we still fought civil rights battles well into the 1960's and 70's. More than anything watching something like this gives true appreciation to those who fought so hard and so long and laid down their lives to bring us to a place where we could understand slavery for the abomination that it is.",

This movie throws in some excellent performances like our main star Chiwetel Ejiofor and a brilliantly horrifying performance from Michael Fassbender. This movie must have been a great challenge because many great films have been made about this subject,to be remembered this movie had to be truly mesmerizing which it is. Like I mentioned earlier this movie is not a two hour gore fest that sends messages down your throat, we get to know the characters first and when bad things happen to them we are even more horrified.

536,21 April 2014,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,7," Best film about slavery? - ""Sansho the Bailiff"" still in the lead!","I get the feeling that Steve McQueen is still more of a visual artist than a storyteller, so that, for all the talent and craftsmanship on display, ""Twelve Years"" seems surprisingly detached and uninvolving. In the only scene that did connect for me, Solomon joins in, with increasing fervor, as his fellow slaves sing ""Roll, Jordan, Roll"" beside the grave of an old man who collapsed in the cottonfields, and here, I think, the effect may be the opposite of what McQueen intended as Solomon's steely stoicism gives way to something like Christian resignation. A low-key episode in which Solomon's logistic skills as a lumberman and raftsman, acquired as a free man in the North, excite the murderous envy of a white plantation carpenter seemed more effective than the expected lashings and lynchings and sexual exploitation.

539,12 April 2014,doug_park2001,9," ""I simply ask that you use all of your senses before rendering judgment""","Directed by Steve McQueen and crew, this is definitely one of the very best films to come out in recent years. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is expertly filmed and gives an immediate recreation of the antebellum South. The acting by just about everyone is similarly outstanding, with special kudos going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northrup, Sara Paulson as Mistress Ebs, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, and Paul Dano as Tibeats. This film truly captures the barbarity of slavery in America and slavery in general: The empathy with its victims is disturbingly keen. Scenes such as that of the mother being separated from her young children at the auction are realistically heartrending. This film is also revealing of the Biblical justifications that slaveholders often used and the frequency with which female slaves were raped by plantation owners and overseers. At the same time, however, all of the characters are well-rounded. Without sugarcoating anything, 12 YEARS A SLAVE portrays even the cruelest of its subjects as eminently human and shows the varying degrees of humanity and inhumanity among slaveholders. Plenty happens, with a number of reversals and surprises, but, as in many intelligent dramas, there isn't any one defining climactic moment. There are one or two vague spots, and the sheer number of characters can be confusing. Nevertheless, I cannot imagine anyone with a normal attention span and interest in the subject matter failing to be engrossed by 12 YEARS A SLAVE. Yes, this subject has been done before in a number of earlier films, but it's still done very well here.",

541,26 January 2014,saschakrieger,9, One man's life,"12 Years a Slave, the new film by British director Steve McQueen is the latest in a series of filmic treatment of slavery, one of the darkest chapters in US history. After Quentin Tarantino's revenge tale Django Unchained and Lincoln, Steven Spielberg's political drama about slavery's official abolition, it leads us into the heart of human degradation and cruelty, and to the core of an American trauma that has not been properly dealt with in the past, that still lingers in all the unsolved issues plaguing US society today. Perhaps now the time is right. For the first time in history, a black man is holding the highest office in the land, living proof how far the country has come. A look at America today, however, shoes the long distance still ahead and maybe a film like 12 Years a Slave can serve as a reminder that the wounds that the system of treating humans as things, extending the principle of property to living souls, has created have not healed.",

546,10 December 2013,huntthejest,10, A Story About Cycles and Futility,"I went into this film anticipating solid directing (Steve McQueen) and good acting (Ejiofor, Cumberbatch and Fassbender), if an unoriginal story. Every few years, it seems, we get another installment of ""White Guilt: the Movie."" I was not disappointed by the former, and pleasantly surprised by the latter. The film follows the slave story we all know(bearing not a little resemblance to Frederick Douglass's more widely known memoir), but with the twist that the protagonist was born free and kidnapped into slavery. We see Solomon object that he is free then beaten into submission, and made to accept his name(Platt) and his station. He travels first to a slave auctioneer's, played by a very understated(and possibly underused) Paul Giamatti. He is auctioned off at a higher price for his ability to play the violin. He goes to a compassionate owner played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who makes excellent use of screen time to turn an otherwise one-note character, into a conflicted man of principles. He gains favor with his master for his intellect, while also running afoul of the wicked overseer(played gratingly by the ever-punchable Paul Dano; seriously I was hoping for Daniel Day Lewis to show up with a bowling pin) for the same savvy. There is a disagreement that leads to the overseer trying to flail him. He instead turns on and whips the overseer. He ends up at the end of a noose, but is saved from death, only to dangle for a squirmingly long amount of screen time, unflinching and unyielding in it's brutality as he shifts from toe tip to toe tip to keep his windpipe intact. This act serves as the apex of the cycle. Master Cumberbatch must then sell him to keep a lynch mob from killing him, but the only master who will accept him is a cruel one. Enter Michael Fassbender, chewing his way through every scene and reveling in the evil Master Epps. He and McQueen could've been content in letting the characterization end there since Fassbender creates it masterfully, but they add in a touch of self-loathing and doubt that makes him a real, albeit horrific, person. His inclination toward his favored slave, Patsey, puts our protagonist into predicament. The cycle comes back around as Platt is forced whip Patsey in the worst flaying scene since ""Passion of the Christ."" He becomes the reluctant purveyor of the lash. It is now that he breaks his violin, before the talisman that linked him to his old life and his intelligence, and resigns himself to his yoke. He joins in song wholeheartedly, while before he sat in silence. He has become the archetype slave. Earlier on, he attempted to send a letter by way of a white hired hand that had drank himself into debt, who betrayed him to his master. It is later, through trusting a second hired man, a forward-thinking Canadian abolitionist(played to great distraction by Brad Pitt, sounding much more like Benjamin Button than any Canadian, that he actually does regain his freedom. And, as before he had to have the name Platt beaten into him, he is coaxed into revealing his true identity to the sheriff, and taken away home. His reunion scene with his family leaves lingering warm feelings; until the scrolling text reveals that no one paid for this crime. A fantastic film that chose earnest over preachy, and visceral over cliché. The performances were spot on(aside from Dano's screechy one-note and Pitt's aforementioned out-of-place cameo), and deserve both Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'O(Patsey) at least a nomination for supporting actor/actress, while Chiwetel Ejiofor definitely should get a nod for best actor, and hopefully start getting some long-overdue credit. McQueen, meanwhile, remains artful, if not gruesome in his depiction of slave life. He and Nicholas Winding Refn are contending for art-house shudder king. An excellent piece, definitely bringing something more than a rehash of a familiar story, even if the story is familiar.",
547,23 April 2014,BradSweden,2, Done to death,"This type of slave movie has been done so many times before. In my opinion, the movies ""Roots"" and ""Django Unchained"" conveyed the message so much better. The main actors in this particular film weren't convincing and neither was Brad Pit's cameo appearance. It really was a waste of time and I personally found it disappointing. I am surprised to see that the rating was so high here on IMDb. Am I missing something here? It fails to connect, and falls flat compared to the two afore-mentioned predecessors. Really... don't bother. I really can't understand why it won so many awards. Perhaps it was due to guilt or something. In all honesty, how many slave-whipping movies does a person really need to see?

The supporting work from Woodard, Oduye, Brown, and especially Topsy Chapman who does more with her face, body movements, and singing than anyone else does with dialog also kept the film poignant. Cumberbatch and Dano deserve the credit they have gotten for solid supporting performances of characters with layered dimensions. Brad Pitt also executes well the plum supporting role he gave himself. Berry, Chalk, Giamatti, McConnell, Dilahunt, Evermore, and Dylan all score in the one or two scenes in which they are featured. The cinematography and score are both terrific and give the film vitality to take us through the torturous moments. The costume design also deserved its Oscar nomination.

555,9 September 2014,TheMarwood,9, A great film without a false note,"I went into 12 Years A Slave with a lot of reluctance after immensely disliking director Steve McQueen's previous two films, especially Shame which I found reached hysterical heights of such inane drama that I shuttered at the thought of him tackling this subject matter. From the opening until the very last shot, McQueen has a masterful command of his craft and his film doesn't have a false note - he made a great picture. Chiwetel Ejiofor does fine work as an educated man from New York who gets kidnapped and sent down south to be sold into slavery. What he endures over the next 12 years is a degrading nightmare that makes your blood boil at such wretched humanity. Fassbender is a particular standout amongst a strong cast, as a grotesque slave owner who brings many layers to this villainous role that easily could have fallen into a one note archetype in a lesser actor's hands. Pitt shows up in a small role that doesn't require much from him and in what could have been a throwaway day player role, Giamatte makes the most of his slimy character. McQueen never over sells the drama and while scenes show humanity at its worst and most cruel, the film is surprisingly not grueling to sit through. One of the best films of 2013 for sure.",

Be prepared to be repelled by what you see. I was prepared, having read the book and studied this period, but my daughter was not. She cried in the car afterwards. She had no idea how brutal these subhumans actually were with their casual cruelties and dehumanizing treatment of helpless humans caught in a nightmare from which there was no escape.

In a year where Leo DiCaprio and Matthew McConuaghey gave enormous performances, Chiwetel may have to settle for the nomination. This is also an actors movie by excellence, so much that I highlight from the large cast Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o, both Oscar nominated performances. McQueen's take on this tale is one of a very dark nature, one that is not for everybody. One particular scene is terrifically cringe worthy as you see a sight too horrible to behold. While it may not feel as fresh as other contenders, 12 Years A Slave is a wonderful film that depicts a dark time in American history. Recent movies about slavery have been getting a little backlash as they are becoming far too insistent. I believe that when well done, like in this case, it's no problem that this topic is presented.

How Solomon had acquired such wealth as he appeared to have I do not know. He was nothing more that a fiddle player, certainly not a concert violinist and yet he is dressed in fine clothes as are his wife and children. On visiting the local store his wife buys an item without any thought, interest or askance of the cost.
When we see him having dinner with Brown and Hamilton, the food and wine is freely flowing, so I would ask, did they pay his fare and the bill for the evening and if so just how much did this cost in relation to what they got for selling him into slavery? It must have been considerable for their outlay.
The rest of the film is too long, and the nudity is simply gratuitous. Solomon's hair remains exactly the same for the entire film and the only concession to his age is slightly shown at the end of the film when his hair looks like some flour has been blown into it in attempt to show grey! As his wife did not appear to work I would like to know what she had done for the previous 12 years as she still lived in the same house and still dressed up to the nines!
As for Solomon's life after he went home, why did he attempt to take to court those that had wronged him, knowing full well that a black person could not(under the law at that time) prosecute a white man? Also as such a high profile individual, how is it that his demise could not be ascertained as to when, how and where?

Felt like not wholly developed. He is shown to have cried and lived fearfully but that was very cliched, not original acting. The same performance is seen in Hotel Rwanda by Don Cheadle. I will write about it btw. Perhaps the director was in a hurry to complete the film but Why ? On the other hand, brutality shown in the film deserves a praise. It will make your heart heavy though. I think it's the horrible trade of human beings that made people inhuman. It was never the white vs black. It was the spiritual vs material idea. And materialism won in most of the events, implying the episode as horror. But the movie didn't emphasize upon the main concerns of slavery, its pros, cons, merits and demerits & so on.

Solomon Northup used to live in New York with his family happily, until he went to work with two men in Washington. He starts making music there for their circus and they become good friends. One morning he wakes up in chains and everything changes. This is the true story of Solomon Northup based on his biography of the same name. After being freed he campaigned to have the kidnappers jailed but the trial collapsed. Solomon disappeared 4 years after he was freed and nobody knows where he went to and where he is buried.

Chiwetel Ejiofor is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He turned in a powerful performance, drawing in the emotions of the character Solomon Northup, a MAN, who was kidnapped and stripped away from his family and sold into Slavery. I could feel the emotion from the Character, but could not fathom being in that predicament. I will not make this review very long, simply because I could write an essay on all the good points of the film. The dialogue between Solomon (Pratt) and Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o was astounding, heart-breaking, and explicitly honest. The communication between the 2 characters capture the despair, misery, and hopelessness felt by my ancestors during that time of National injustice, moral decadence, and Godlessness in the Laws, behaviors, and attitudes by Slaver owners, and Slave smugglers.

Both movies were absolutely horrible to watch, but left me thinking deep questions about society,and my part in it. Sadism sells,you only have to look at the Saw Franchise to see this. Saw became so successful financially that it even has it's own fairground ride. To use violence in cinema effectively requires a great skill for not only the actors but the plot,the characters and direction, all have to remain very focused. Each slave in this film has their character developed so when they are objectified the viewer knows the slaves inner working, their humanity. 12 years a slave has excellent acting, extremely emotional performances from all it's cast. And with ironic thing , is there is a theme of suppressing one's emotions and intelligence in order to not draw a small minded society's wrath. The plot allows the gradual mental decline of a 'master.' to move with the mental discipline of a 'slave.'Like the raiders of the lost arc in poses the question of does absolute power drive people to mental and spiritual desolation? If you are ready for a film that will emotionally challenge you, then watch this film. It may make you build empathy towards black history.

Lastly there is also no doubt that everyone involved with this movie (with the exception of Brad Pitt) puts in fantastically believable performances. Standouts for me were Chiwetel Ejiofor (fairly obviously) and especially Micheal Fassbender who gives an absolutely awesome turn as a man who clearly revelled in having the power of life and death over other human beings. Fassbender's performance alone is worthy of the entry price. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Brad Pitt as the one-and-only ""good"" white man portrayed in this film, but luckily he's not in the film too long, and his acting is quickly overshadowed by the other towering and nuanced performances on shows.",

As with Shame, it features an incredible lead performance, this time by Chiwetel Ejiofor. He plays Solomon Northup, a born-free black man who was kidnapped off the streets of Washington D.C. and sold into slavery. In addition to the performances, the main stars are the art direction and score. McQueen has a clear eye for striking imagery, but only when he finds time for it amidst the atrocity.

Otherwise, if you have already read the book you are bound to be disappointed by the changes, alterations, omissions, and other discrepancies that directors are forced to make within the time constraints of a typical movie. Even a mini-series does not allow time to include all the valuable elements of the printed story. The book ""12 Years a Slave"" provided many more details about slave life and relationships than the movie could. And in the movie some key events, such as when Solomon Northrup convinced Bass, the traveling carpenter, to alert his friends in New York State that he had been kidnapped and kept in bondage for 12 years, were abbreviated and presented with less depth than in the book. Also, I must confessthat I didn't fully understand Solomon's relationship to his various masters, even in the book. He was apparently transferred from one to another to settle a debt but it was never clear to me how that worked. In the book, he remembered fondly his first ""owner,"" Mr. Ford (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) as basically a good man trapped in an evil established social institution. However, he believed his cruel master, Epps (played by Michael Fassbender), deserved all the torments that Hell had waiting for him. My advice to anyone who has only seen the movie is to be sure to read the book. It will increase your appreciation of Solomon Northrup tenfold -- or more.",

The greater significance of the film is that it is so intuitively displayed on the screen about all aspects of slavery in the South Manor - dirty, cruel, especially hypocritical.",
606,28 January 2014,mom-29-22843,10, A beautiful Story that really makes you think,"I have to say I was skeptical about this movie when we first decided to go see it.But, I am obsessed with slavery and the Civil War. I've read Uncle Tom's Cabin, yet I am not old enough to have been part of the civil rights movement. I understand why this movie got so many Oscar nominations. It's excellent from beginning to end and so true to history. This movie made you think. My heart broke many times in this movie at the treatment of the slaves. It was heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time. They lived in torment yet they bore it together. There is so much heart in this movie, both by slave owner and slave. I don't want to give much of this movie away because there is so much that the viewer needs to see. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I truly enjoyed it and I give it 5++++ stars. I will in the near future be reading the book by Solomon Northrup, if it is anything like the movie (and I know books are always better) I will enjoy it.",
607,4 November 2022,greekdx,9, Sureky masterpiece,"12 Years a Slave
With thanks to netflcx once again I have watched a block buster movie that not only impresses but also shocks and puts the term slavery to the point as it I based in Solomon's Northup real story as directed by the well known actor Steve MC Queen",
608,28 February 2014,tristan_rogers,10, You Can't Look Away,"The genius of Steve McQueen in all his films is his willingness to not say cut. In Hunger and Shame, he forced us to watch unpleasant scenes for much longer than we would like and with 12 Years a Slave it is no different. The brutality and horror of the life of Solomon Northup is shown through his unyielding lens and as an audience we have no choice but to sit up and consume this harsh truth. The performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor is superlative and must catapult him to a very high plane indeed. The film is also indebted to, for my money, the best supporting actor and actress of the year in Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender. Sarah Paulson's turn as Mistress Epps is also very worthy of note. Despite Brad Pitt's late attempt to torpedo this deeply moving tale, 12 Years is a wonderful piece of work from McQueen and DoP Sean Bobbitt, whose searingly beautiful photography of the American South contrasts so powerfully with the actions of those that Northup encounters. A film not to be missed, for if you do not miss it you cannot ignore it.",
609,19 January 2019,nr-11888,10, good,"""12 Years a Slave"" is one of the favorite movies. I think it makes us think about discrimination both at that time and today. I knew black people worked in plantations as slaves, but this movie told me more about that serious situation. In each scene it was easy to understand their real life at that time. Moreover, this movie is nonfiction. I imagine if I were Solomon Northup. It's so terrible and I was sure I couldn't stand the life. He was actually a free black man, but he was kidnapped and forced to work on a plantation. Today the world still has multiple kind of discrimination from racial discrimination through sexual discrimination. It may be decreasing thanks to media coverage but will it ever end? If you watch 12 Years a Slave, you can consider our society's failing. I really recommend it.",

611,17 September 2016,Mario64,9, A Very Moving and Important Story,"12 Years a Slave, directed by Steve McQueen, is, if not a perfect film, among the very important pieces of modern cinema. It's based on a true story of a man named Solomon Northup, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, a free black man in New York state, who one day is tricked and kidnapped and sold down south into slavery in the early 1840's. Seeing his life, and then seeing it suddenly ripped away is truly disturbing and heart-wrenching. It's not that we should feel worse for him than those who were born into slavery, who treated as bad or in many cases much worse; but telling the tale through the contrast highlights, extremely effectively, how inhumane this slave culture was.",
612,28 June 2020,mocaler,8, A worthwhile movie,"This is a difficult movie for me to rate. On the one hand, it did add some odd things which was not in the book. But Solomon Northrop's book, ghost written by a white man, also appeared to not be entirely accurate. But that does not detract from the importance and impact of the book. And I think that the ""creative license"" used in this movie does not detract too much from the importance of the movie. Alterations to facts usually lesson the quality of movies for me. But that was less for me with this movie.",

614,10 April 2016,Mobithailand,10," it is one of those movies that not only Americans, but all the movie-going public needs to see.","A true story provides the background for this tragic, and incredibly thought-provoking film. As many have already stated, there is a surprising dearth of feature films that deal with this most uncomfortable of subjects – slavery in the USA. Even more surprising – or maybe predictable, depending on your point of view – is that it has taken an English Director and largely European actors, to bring to the silver screen the tale of Solomon Northrup; a free black man living in upstate New York in the 1840's, who was kidnapped and sold into southern slavery. Director Steve McQueen, writer John Ridley, (an American), actors Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the stellar cast have, without any doubt, produced an immensely moving and highly watchable film.",

616,23 February 2014,aldri-feb,9, Definitely the best movie of 2013,"There's almost nothing could be complained from 12 Years a Slave. It has an incredible story, organized plot, powerful performance from ensemble casts and beautifully filmed. Perhaps the theme is quite common about slavery and racist thing but 12 Years a Slave offers something that other kind of movie doesn't have. The movie has heart and flows smoothly without any flaws. Credits also should be given to three main casts (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o) who steals attention with their unbelievable performance. It's no doubt that this movie has put the highest standard of a slavery movie which usually comes out every year. 12 Years a Slave is simply a masterpiece and one of my favorite for sure.",

And now they are writing stories and making movies illustrating how morons and savages they were ... may be racism is still existing until that moment, but it is confronted with public hate and disgrace to such acts.... After watching some of those movies i thought about that one day we will reject our foolish inhuman acts which is sadly not only racism, but also "" ignorance , dictatorship, Violence, hatred ...etc."" ... No matter how bad is that fact, No matter how long will it takes to reject it, but that day will come, that day when our children or our grand children will sit their backs reading stories or watching movies about how ""Morons"" we are to kill, hate & disgrace each other ... i'm sure that they will feel sorry for us, there will be tears, there will be pain, they will wonder why we did do that to our selves! .... i'm not sure that they will find any excuse for us, but what i'm sure of is that they will never return to be like us ... because who savors the taste of freedom, will never return to the shackles and darkness of ignorance and racism!.",
619,15 September 2014,hazysistersunshine33,8," I would definitely recommend this one, but prepare yourself, it ain't pretty","This film deservedly won several Oscars. It is beautifully shot, daring, intense and poignant to boot. It's inspired by a real person and a real event, so that makes it have even more of an impact. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a free African American black man, Solomon Northup, who gets sold to slavery, by a couple of scheming opportunist. It's about how he survives. He often has to compromise his ethics and morals and do some pretty crazy and brave things to get through it all. Some of the scenes are just heart breaking. Some people walked out on it when we saw it at the theater. I don't think they thought it was a bad movie per-say. I think they just couldn't take it anymore. I mean, I don't think I'm giving anything away, since it's about slavery, but there are whipping scenes in it that are disturbing. The acting by everyone from Brad Putt to Lupita Nyong'o and especially Michael Fassbender are just superb. Steve McQueen, as I said has an interesting style to get a point across. There's one scene that is an uncomfortably extended single camera shot for, what would be to long if any other director tackled it, but he plays it off perfectly and it really hits home. I would definitely recommend this one, but prepare yourself, it ain't pretty.",
620,4 January 2014,neverever121,10, An incredibly powerful and moving depiction of slavery,"12 Years A Slave is a very honest, raw and heartbreaking depiction of Solomon Northup's story.

621,26 January 2014,AlexDConstantin,3, poor performance and lack of originality,"If you haven't seen The Soloist and Django Unchained then you might enjoy this film. The title could be as easy as ''1 year a slave'' . When I was watching the film , the 12 years were not there no matter how boring were the repetitive scenes. The Plot is weak. Performance of the main character lacks in character development, equal from start till end. Instead of picking a violin not so far from a cello like in The Soloist, the character could have any other instrument, maybe jazz instruments to be more plausible and really show the afro-American important contribution to music and culture. That would add more life to the character and film. Lots of unnecessary scenes. Predictable ending. Would not see this film again.",

The first time we see Solomon, he's already enslaved. He has three {or four?} inconsequential flashbacks to his freedom, his family, whom we don't even get to know, and his violin playing, and that's it. They're there to give us facts, that's it. No relationship with him is formed, and the abduction comes out of no where, leaving us at a loss of a reason to really care about him. We care because he's a slave, but he's not going through anything any of the others aren't, so what sets him apart? What makes him our hero? He's not. The dialogue and setup of the scenes were stilted and overly dramatic emotional bombardments of points, not a nuanced unfolding that we can settle into and care about. You are not immersed, but instead simply watching. And cringing.",
