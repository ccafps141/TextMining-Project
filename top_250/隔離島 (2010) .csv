0,30 August 2010,classicsoncall,10," ""Men like you are my specialty, you know?""","There are a number of films I've seen more than once, and if they're good (the only reason really, to watch them again), they become a richer experience and one gains a greater appreciation of them. ""Shutter Island"" might be the only picture that on subsequent viewings, becomes a DIFFERENT film from the one originally seen. I say this because the first time around, there's no way to take the character of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) other than at face value. He's a detective investigating a missing person case on an island. Not your normal island, but one that's home to an institution for the criminally insane. Every interaction he has with a character in the picture is one between himself, Detective Daniels, and that character. As we come to learn, all that changes when Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) reveals the twist near the end of the story, at which point, one is left either totally disillusioned or utterly blown away.",/
1,22 July 2019,jackgdemoss,9, One of the most memorable plot twists of this decade,"I originally saw this film when it came out but couldn't remember it well enough to give it a rating or write a review, so a rewatch was in order. I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice.",r
2,24 September 2017,ruhsa,10, The movie is perfect psycho drama,"Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshal sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.",e
3,22 May 2010,napierslogs,9, Shutter Island is at the top of its genre,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making ""Shutter Island"" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.",v
4,29 July 2018,NpMoviez,10, Movie of the decade.,"It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being ""Inception"". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found ""Shutter Island"" to be much more superior, as ""Inception"" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.",i
5,27 February 2010,Tania_Chesala_R,8, Don't be side tracked by the obvious twist.......there is more than one,I know there is already a spoiler warning up top but I am going to warn you again. Don't read this because I am going to give everything away.,e
6,8 July 2011,planktonrules,9," I know it's convoluted and slow, but stick with this one...really.","2010 was very good to Leonardo DiCaprio. Shedding his pretty little boy image, he played in two very gritty and similar films, ""Shutter Island"" and ""Inception"". I saw them both and enjoyed them both. And, to buck the tide, I'd have to say I actually liked ""Shutter Island"" a little more...really. Now do NOT just rush out to rent this one, as I can't see this film appealing to everyone. It IS confusing. The plot can feel a bit tiresome and slow. But, if you are very patient, it all comes together perfectly--with the last 15 minutes totally enthralling me. I think part of it is because I am a retired psychotherapist and psychology teacher--and the film is a great psychological drama. And, the story actually is consistent psychologically and is actually plausible.",w
7,16 April 2010,dvc5159,8, I can't look away...,"Finally, a horror/thriller that actually, genuinely scares the crap out of you. Not because it has fancy villains in masks or sadistic buckets of gore throughout. No, it scares you because it messes with your mind. Most will hate this movie, they don't like their brains being tampered with. I loved it. It's what we needed after all those gory R-rated and sometimes lame-duck PG-13 horror crap-fests.",/
8,29 March 2021,davidmvining,10, One of Scorsese's best,"This movie's ending is a case study in how to read movies. If you consider what was said before, what was done before, and the basics of the character's journey, there is literally only one way to read the movie's final moments. Everything up to that moment builds to the finale is designed to feed a specific end point, and it helps the movie as a whole that everything up to that point is incredibly well done. Scorsese had one early foray into big budget filmmaking with New York, New York, which wasn't really any kind of success, but his turn into big budget filmmaking with another two decades of experience under his belt has been far more successful as he is able to still coax quality performances from his actors while working with more traditionally narrative based scripts (this time based on a novel by Dennis Lehane) and much more intricate and larger production design.",r
9,23 February 2010,TheDeadMayTasteBad,9, All it Takes is One Line of Dialogue to Make an Impact...,"There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn't be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese's film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane's already great story.",w

11,21 February 2010,stednitzrules250,10, No one likes to be messed with.,"Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I'm contradicting myself? ",2
12,6 August 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9, Atmospheric and clever- really makes you think deep,"I like Martin Scorsesse a lot, and I was interested in seeing Shutter Island. It had a truly intriguing concept and my 17-year old sister was raving about how brilliant the film was. Shutter Island is not Scorsesse's best, but it was atmospheric, clever, incredibly thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing too.",1
13,29 December 2015,Irishchatter,9, A fantastic film with DiCapro,"I thought this film was fantastic, i wouldn't call it scary or easily frightening, I would call it a mystery thriller masterpiece. As usual with Leonardo DiCapro, he was always excellent at playing the right roles. Gee, he had to play two characters - Ted and Andrew which could make you confused to which one is he really acting as. That must be really challenging but i say Leonardo is well able to do any role at the same time!",0

15,17 February 2010,slothhead54,9," Of all the movies in theatres to see, this is worth your time","I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer.",4
16,19 February 2010,bain0038,10, Don't miss this one - review from a skeptic.,"From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?",2
17,19 February 2010,IamtheRegalTreatment,9, Counting down the days until I can add this to my DVD collection...,"Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I'm glad I was wrong.",/
18,30 August 2010,Hitchcoc,8," OK, Play with My Mind!","I was told on several occasions to skip this film. While I felt it took a long way to get to the point, I found it intriguing and engaging. I've really grown to like DeCaprio and find him to be an interesting actor. One reviewer did criticize him for hanging around the dark side a bit much, but that could be said about Nicholson and a host of others. This is one of those mind puzzles that force one to guess a good deal. Because of the pace, I eventually figured it out. Nevertheless, it is told in a very interesting way. With ""Inception"" capturing the box office recently, this seems a mild effort to explore the subconscious. It is multi-layered and complex. It throws curves and red herrings, but I never felt toyed with. This is certainly worth a shot.",?

Normally there is a mob present, or in most cases, a tough brute who loves to flash the ""F"" bomb in almost every sentence. But what about a thriller? I mean sure, we have seen it in ""Cape Fear"", probably one of my personal favorite remakes. But what about a top notch mind bending thriller that really makes you think.

23,31 December 2015,Screen_Blitz,8," Twisted, somber, but hugely entertaining Scorcese thriller","Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together.

24,13 March 2010,bkoganbing,7, Mind Games,Shutter Island is a body of land in Boston Harbor which has a hospital for the criminally insane. It's run by a pair of doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow who have certainly essayed roles of some very deep villainy. Couple that with the fact that this film is set in post World War II where America has just been fighting with people who have mysterious accents like Von Sydow and Kingsley. It's a recipe for a Hitchcock like thriller.,t
25,23 February 2010,czavaleta73,9, Great a must watch !!,"I saw this and I knew what to expect going in to the film as I had already read about half of the book but never got the chance to finish it. But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the original material.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I saw some cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directed Bringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyone was top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though I would jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. All in all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performances and for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far.",t

27,15 January 2011,Theo Robertson,7, A Disappointment From A Master Director,"Martin Scorsese is in my opinion the greatest living movie maker . He started off during the New Hollywood era in the late 1960s and is described as a "" movie brat "" , a film maker who was brought up on a fine diet of cinema during his formative years and it shows . He is very much an aficionado of cinema and this in depth knowledge shows in SHUTTER ISLAND ",u

31,28 March 2010,mrcibubur,8, No Hitchcock horror but a brilliant chiller thriller from Scorcese!,"I watched this in the cinema on a Friday night and expected a horror film because it was hyped as a horror film. Make no mistake, this is a chilling psychological thriller and I can quite see why Scorcese likes to work with Leonardo (from 'The Departed') and with Robert Richardson from the cinematography for 'Inglorious Basterds'.",
32,16 February 2010,tsquared226,10, Another Excellent Film by Scorsese...,"Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you see this at the next Oscars...",

34,10 June 2010,gradyharp,10, The Mind as Prison,"Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic. Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated. Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision. ",

37,14 February 2010,tbmforclasstsar,10, Shutter Island Lives Up to the Name,"From the first note of the score, to the last shot on the screen I was completely enthralled by Martin Scorsese's latest Picture. Shutter Island, the story of two federal marshals investigating a patient escape at a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane, is very simply put: an experience. Shutter Island works because it pulls at all different emotions. An audience is both humored, and on the edge of tears; jumping out of their seat, and sinking deep within it. For 2 hours and 18 minutes, one is completely submerged into a Gothic, noir like world that is intriguing and horrifying at the same time. ",

39,15 March 2011,moonspinner55,5," Artistic curlicues decorate a thin, derivative script...","Once director Martin Scorsese attained widespread acceptance from moviegoers (and mainstream critics) with the massive commercial success of ""Cape Fear"" in 1991, he quickly turned into a 'blockbuster' filmmaker, one who had his pick of top-rank collaborators. The Scorsese name became a brand--like Spielberg's--however, the movies he has chosen to work on since do not always echo the interests of the young, raw Scorsese. With ""Shutter Island"", an adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lehane, the stamp of Scorsese becomes interchangeable with that of Shyamalan, De Palma, Polanski...even the ghost of Stanley Kubrick, whose ""The Shining"" seems to be an inspirational starting point for this thin, shuddery yarn. Leonard DiCaprio plays a U. S. Federal Marshal in 1954 investigating the disappearance of a female mental patient from a locked-down asylum in the Boston Harbor. Elements of other films keep turning up in Laeta Kalogridis' poor script, which incorporates (at various intervals) concentration camp detail with a triple homicide that is both exploitative and distasteful. The large cast is solid, for the most part--Scorsese has retained his uncanny ability to bring out the best in his actors--though I'm not sure how deeply DiCaprio is feeling his role. His frequent scowl doesn't reveal anything but a petulant nature, which, coupled with his youthful appearance, doesn't lend much conviction to a character who is alternately a soldier, a family man, and a government employee. DiCaprio is making a career out of seeming miscast; since this entire house-of-cards plot rests on the star's shoulders, the final denouement isn't the heart-breaker it should have been. The picture is vividly atmospheric and features excellent technical detail, yet it is a glum undertaking burdened with overwrought profanities ill-suited to the era. This is what Martin Scorsese wants to bide his time with? ** from ****",

As it stands, the rest of 2010 has a long way to go in terms of matching the quality and effectiveness of Scorsese's new picture.

In case we needed some exposition Leo meets a women in a cave and he exclaims ""you're the real..."" in case we couldn't figure it out.

50,20 February 2010,politically_incorrect204,6, Disappointing Ending,"I hate to say this as much anyone else but for me this film had a horribly disappoint ending. First before I delve into that I'd like to say that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as far as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very disappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone's head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn't happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so cliché for an ending from the likes of Scorsese's genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can't give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less cliché or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do understand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don't think that saves the ending or does the film justice in it's entirety.",

58,20 February 2010,nazztrader,3," Just watch the original ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" instead.","Tedious and boring most of the time, interspersed with gore and irritating music. What was the point of this film, really? Was it meant to entertain mostly teenagers, because the presentation was so over the top that M. Night Shayamalan will probably blush when he sees it? It was a psychological drama without any psychological depth. Leo was again cast in a role that was not right for him. What was needed was someone to physically embody the emotional turmoil the character had endured. And the flashbacks only make the intelligent viewer ask the obvious question, which is, why should we care so much about this one person's troubles when all those people were killed by the Nazis (or survived with their horrible memories)? That was an idiotic thing to include in this film, totally undermining it. Scorsese tried to do way too much here. He could've tried to do a ""modern"" version of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" for example. Then ending also didn't make sense to me, and was almost an endorsement of suicide, though considering how this impressed me as ""career suicide,"" perhaps it makes some sort of ironic sense.",

61,2 September 2010,robert-temple-1,1, Playing footsie with the dark side,"Martin Scorsese should be ashamed of himself. He is such a brilliant filmmaker, and yet time after time throughout his career he has played footsie with the dark side, and supped with the devil. After all, there are all those gangster movies. What are they, if not glorifications of evil people and evil acts? Here we have Scorsese getting carried away with his own vanity and being 'ever so clever'. He has come up with an ingenious plot twist (although it is not new and has been used in various old movies), which I shall refrain from revealing because it concerns the end of the film, which one is prohibited from discussing on IMDb. But however clever Scorsese is, there is no disguising the fact that this film is dark, sinister, infinitely depressing, and a bad influence. When will vain geniuses like Scorsese exercise a little 'voluntary self-regulation', or indeed just the tiniest bit of self-control? Or are these spoilt brat genius film directors so thrilled by wallowing in their own vanity that they believe anything they do is wonderful and if we don't like it we are stupid? I say this film is bad not because it is badly made, but precisely because it is well made and thereby exerts its insidious influence all the more effectively. Somebody ought to tie Scorsese to an automatic spanking-machine which would wallop some sense back into him. But as long as he is subject to universal adulation, his vanity will swell to inhuman proportions until one day he bursts. And that day cannot be far off. Scorsese has made some wonderful films, such as KUNDUN (1997), MY VOYAGE TO ITALY (1999), and THE AVIATOR (2004). His love of music is very touching, and everyone appreciated his contribution to THE BLUES (2003). But when he tries the horror-thriller medium, as with CAPE FEAR (1991, a really terrible failure of a film, not worth reviewing) and this film, Scorsese descends to the depths of incompetence and uselessness. That is why Scorsese needs to be tied to a spanking-machine, because he is unruly and needs discipline. He needs to be kept away from these dark areas of the evil mind and restrained from manic indulgence, just as young boys used to have their hands tied up at night (see THE WHITE RIBBON) so as not to fiddle with themselves. Leonardo DiCaprio has worked with Scorsese before (superbly, in THE AVIATOR), and when offered this juicy part, where he is allowed to grit his teeth a great deal and show us how grown up he now is by leaping into action at the drop of a hat, squared-jawed and determined (the very essence, he imagines, of a cinema hero, in the hope that one day he might become Harrison Ford), he took it! No surprise! Actors and actresses accept parts! What else is new? Whether they are taking part in a wicked enterprise does not seem to occur to them, which must be why Jodie Foster agreed to do SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. So this dark film about an insane asylum on an island in Boston Harbour does not enhance the value of human existence, but rather adds to the forces of the dark side, and we gain nothing from it but a sterile titillation of the most vacuous kind. And not all the cleverness in the world can disguise the fact that this film is empty.",
62,20 February 2010,Smells_Like_Cheese,7, Marty needs a new editor,"Well, after months and months of waiting, Shutter Island was finally released this weekend. I've been dying to see this movie, I love Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio. These two together just equal gold and you are always sure to have a guaranteed good time at the movie theater. But maybe it's not always a guarantee; unfortunately, Shutter Island was a huge disappointment to me. The weird thing is, it's over something silly but important, the editing. We have fantastic actors, a great story, awesome direction and a spooky atmosphere. But the problem is, the movie does run a bit long, being at almost two and a half hours, it was exhausting to get through the movie. The beginning is so slow paced that it looses track of it's characters and by the time for it's exciting conclusion, I just felt a bit empty.",
63,6 March 2010,Coventry,7, Island of high expectations but slightly lobotomized results,"Perhaps I should better begin this user comment by underlining that I'm primarily a horror fanatic and, moreover, that I have a specific exaltation for genre movies taking place on (A) remote inescapable islands and largely set in (B) mental asylums. I've seen numerous cheap horror movies, ranging from astounding to abominable, featuring one or both of these keywords and I personally think they are fundamental components to help determine the creepiness impact of a certain horror movie. ""Shutter Island"" features both these key ingredients as well, so normally this should have been one of my most anticipated movies ever, but instead I was quite skeptical ever since I first saw the trailer. First and foremost I'm annoyed again that everybody seems to avoid labeling this as a horror movie. Like it's still common to think horror is in an inferior genre that acclaimed directors and actors don't even lay their hands on. If you look on the main page on this website, ""Shutter Island"" is categorized as drama, mystery and thriller. I assure you, given the subject matter and the scenery featuring here, this is a horror film. It has everything to do with atmosphere and nothing with bloodshed or ax-wielding maniacs. Secondly, I tend to be very tolerant and easygoing on those aforementioned cheap horror movies because they're often low-budgeted and struggling movies from aspiring and hard- working directors. However, in the case of ""Shutter Island"", where the budget is practically unlimited and all the involved people are highly respected and critically acclaimed names, I feel I'm entitled to be extra demanding. I expect everything to be impeccably perfect, including the plot, the atmosphere, the set pieces, the acting performances, the directing, the continuity and the tension level. ",
64,14 March 2010,markgorman,4, Someone is missing! Yeah. Scorsese.,I don't want to be cast asunder for words of heresy but is Martin Scorsese losing it? I only ask because Shutter Island is a load of old claptrap. The reviews I've read seem to be unable to make their minds up about it and IMDb seems to have lost its marbles a little by awarding it 8.1 and a place in the coveted all time Top 250.

""Shutter Island"" is extraordinary to look at. It has some bravura shots that will take your breath away. It's no uniquely Scorsesian like, ""Raging Bull"" ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"" It doesn't have the energy and passion of ""Taxi Driver"" or the commitment of ""Bringing Out The Dead"", ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" or ""Gangs of New York"", doesn't have the freshness of ""After Hours"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" Doesn't have the scope or ambition of neither ""The Aviator"" nor ""The Departed"" but I liked it very much.",

"" The year is 1954 and two U.S. Marshalls Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent from the mainland to an offshore island for the criminally insane. The reason is simple, a violent and dangerous inmate Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams) has somehow escaped the maximum prison and remains at large. The two Marshalles are introduced to Dr.Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) who seem very reluctant to divulge any pertinent information on any aspect of the place, patients or their protocol. With the warden (Ted Levine) watching their every move, it's difficult to proceed. However, with dogged skill, Daniels finally discovers much more than he's suppose too and finds himself the target of what he believes is a monstrous conspiracy involving Nazis, illegal experimental drugs and murder. The movie begins suspensively driven, shifts quickly into a dark mode and then flings the audience into the realm of the diabolical. All in all, the fast paced drama is another triumph for the team of De Caprio and Scoresese. Easilly recommended. ****",

I've loved everything(with the one aforementioned exception) that I've seen by Martin Scorsese, and this, while it might at first appear excessively mainstream, is another example. This is beautifully shot and edited, and the lighting is just astonishing. The look is amazing. This also has outstanding FX, though they are clearly not the focus, only a tool to tell the story, which is rather brilliantly put together. In general this is immensely well-written; the dialog is clever and there are numerous memorable lines, the script is smart and every character is credible, well-developed and psychologically accurate. The acting is flawless. Levine gets an unforgettable speech that he delivers impeccably, Lynch does his ""there's something funny about that guy..."" thing perfectly, and the entire principal cast are spot-on. The score is grand and really helps set the tone and the mood, if it is arguably over-dramatic in a place or two. This is quite creepy, terrifying and exciting.

But, if he wrote it in the way this film portrays the story, it had to be a difficult read to follow.

And according to the last scene this is the second time in a year that the whole facility has gone through this charade to try to ""wake"" this guy up.

It's clear in less than 2 minutes that Teddy Daniels (!) is an unreliable narrator; and Mark Ruffalo's character (who has precious little to do) is obviously only there to query Teddy and keep him talking, to relay his viewpoint as a narrative workaround; until the actual truth can be revealed at some arbitrary moment. I got news for you Marty; That is simply not interesting enough, and no amount of flashy technique will help. On top of that the story arc is indecipherable.

95,21 February 2010,zardoz-13,4, Utter Hokum!!!,"Oscar-winning film director Martin Scorsese's latest movie ""Shutter Island"" with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Mark Ruffalo, qualifies as his worst epic since ""Boxcar Bertha"" in 1972. Mind you, Scorsese received an Academy Award finally in 2007 for his absorbing Bostonian undercover crime thriller ""The Departed."" Previously, he missed bagging the bronze statuette for ""Raging Bull"" in 1981, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" in 1989, ""Goodfellas"" in 1991, ""The Age of Innocence"" in 1994, ""Gangs of New York"" in 2003, and ""The Aviator"" in 2005. Based on ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehane's 2003 bestselling psycho-thriller, ""Shutter Island"" constitutes a masterpiece of art direction, set design, cinematography, computer-generated special effects and top-notch acting. Nevertheless, you'll hate this gimmicky claptrap as soon as Scorsese and ""Alexander"" scenarist Laeta Kalogridis trot out their mind-boggling eleventh hour revelation! Talk about getting the rug yanked out from under your feet! Indeed, Scorsese seems to be channeling Alfred Hitchcock of ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"" during the first half of this portentous two-hour and eighteen minute melodrama before he shifts gears and imitates director M. Night Shyamalan of ""The Village"" in the last 20 minutes. Contrived and complicated from the start, this gloomy Gothic mystery thriller about a Houdini-like escape from a Federal maximum security asylum for the criminally insane, which resembles Alcatraz in Boston Harbor, is as delusional as a dog chasing its tail. Visually, ""Shutter Island"" could pass muster if it had stuck to its fairly predictable police procedural plot. Unfortunately, Scorsese weaves quite a tale that takes some strange turns before the bottom falls out. People that hate movies about elaborate mind games that lead them by the nose through a maze and then surprise them with a bad ending won't enjoy ""Shutter Island.""

104,10 April 2010,meeza,9, Shut up! Shutter Island rules!,"Welcome to my Punner Island where all your pun dreams can come true! Of course I am going to punhabit my review of Director Martin Scorsese's brilliant ""Shutter Island"" as I do to all of my reviews. ""Shutter Island"" is not associated with the documentary based on every time that Paris Hilton opens her mouth, that one is called ""Shut-her Island"". OK, I will focus on ""Shutter Island"" before you guys think I belong on ""Shut-him Island"". Leonardo Dicaprio, collaborating with Scorsese for the fourth time, stars as Teddy Daniels; a 1950's U.S. Marshall who travels to Shutter Island to investigate a case of a missing patient. The island is primarily comprised of a hospital for the criminally insane. Sounds crazy ha? OK, sorry. Moving right along Teddy's marshall partner is Chuck, played by the reliable Mark Ruffalo. Teddy was a soldier in World War II and played a big part in rescuing Holocaust victims in a Nazi concentration camp. He is a recent widower whose wife accidental death still haunts him as he keeps having hallucinations of her. In the hospital for the criminally insane, they are met by numerous peculiar characters who do not help Teddy & Chuck much with the investigation; and I am not primarily referring to the patients also. I really cannot indulge more in providing you plot lines of ""Shutter Island"" because that would have me institutionalized in the hospital for the spoilerly insane, they have that? It is not insane to state that Leonardo DiCaprio's masterful performance should garner him another Best Actor Oscar nomination. The supporting performances of the film were also sanely proficient. Besides Ruffalo's fine work, I was psyched with the stellar performances of legendary actors Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the hospital's primary psychiatrists, Kingsley playing the head mental honcho. The up-and-coming Emily Mortimer and the always stupendous Patricia Clarkson were scene-stealing in their brief performances as a couple of zany Rachel patients. Michelle Williams was not spectacular in her work as Teddy's deceased wife Dolores, but I would not say she was ""dead in the water"" also with her moderately commending performance. Kudos also goes out to veteran character actors John Carroll Lynch and Jackie Earle Haley for their powerful supporting work; Lynch playing a head guard and Haley playing a loony patient held at the hospital's ""critical psyche condition"" ward. The film's cinematography and art direction were vivid enough to also be called as Oscar nominees at next year's show. Laeta Kalogridis' twisting screenplay based on Dennis Lehane's novel made me ""twist & shout"" with literary pleasure. But who is crazy and daring enough to put all of this together- the one and only highbrow eyebrow maestro, Mr. Martin Scorsese. His daring direction of ""Shutter Island"" does not depart from the fact that Scorsese is still at the top of his game. So take that surreal cinematic voyage to the bizarre but worthwhile ""Shutter Island"". ***** Excellent",
105,18 September 2016,barryrd,8, A story that grips and fills the viewer with doubt,"Martin Scorsese has delivered a controversial piece of dark filmmaking with the movie Shutter Island, set in Boston Harbour during the 1950's. The film holds the viewers in its grip with Leonardio DiCaprio playing a federal marshall with his subordinate Mark Ruffalo, who are investigating the disappearance of a patient (prisoner) on the island, a horrible place of infamy contrasting with its beautiful green landscape. It becomes clear that the condescending and smooth doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow are conducting experiments in eugenics, something he has despised ever since his wartime experience with the Nazis. Or so it seems. Then a series of traumas and flashbacks into his personal life cast doubt on the whole plot. We witness a series of exploits, family related tragedies, a cliffhanging on Shutter Island and a visit with a mysterious woman in a cave. The trauma of a troubled man on a mission casts a heavy doubt on the entire plot and his own personal sanity. A movie well worth seeing.",

Joe Johnston's The Wolfman exhibited cheap, shallow attempts of frightening the audience, mostly consisting of lazy ""don't look around the corner"" moments that relied on loud noises and sudden movements to make you jump. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Martin Scorsese - as you would expect from such a virtuoso director - demonstrates an innate knack for producing goose bumps, combining atmospheric sound design and terrifyingly vivid images – most notably during Teddy's dream sequences – that get under your skin to brilliant effect. Shutter Island is not a horror flick mind you. It is more akin to Hitchcock's The Birds; eerie, chilling and deeply disturbing. You'll probably not jump out of your seat once but, like Scorsese understands and Johnston needs to learn, it is what stays in your head after the credits roll that is of greater significance.",

I was completely in sync with DiCaprio's increasingly disheveled detective and experienced all the same emotional beats that he did, ranging from fear and confusion to sadness and even denial. As such, I was captivated and totally on board no matter how outlandish or somewhat confusing certain aspects may have seemed. I've now seen it twice, however, and the second viewing was a very different experience as, while our perspective isn't entirely out of sync with that of the protagonist, the knowledge of what's to come provides a slightly different point of view which transforms even something as simple as a sideways glance into something altogether more monumental. While the second viewing inevitably isn't as impactful as the first (in fact, it exposes a number of issues such as some second act pacing problems), it holds up remarkably well under the scrutiny of examination afforded by the separation of audience and character that occurs once you know the flick's final hand.

Of course, it tends to be an inherent quality of publicly posted comments that people with strong opinions will be the ones who will bother to post, but still... I thought the film was a decent and well-made one. Predictable - yes. Over the top acting - come on, it's Marty! Too long - again, Marty. However, I must insist that the predictability of the ending was rather a strength of the film: If one were to follow the ""conspiracy/detective"" plot through 2 hours, it's logical that the ending will disappoint - but that's your problem, dear viewer! Not only is the insanity plot much more interesting, the film becomes much more interesting once you watch it from this premise. For example, the warden who drives Teddy back from the cliffs, who isn't buying into the doctors' tactics and gives him the ""you're dangerous and violent"" comments: great scene, but merely weird if you haven't suspected the context. Flaws: The score was horrible. Horrible. Destroyed many scenes, and I'm so glad Marty toned it down toward the end. The dead children scenes were redundant and extremely overused; then again, Marty always does that with his favorite ""symbols"": rubbing it in, again and again. Some of the dialogue could have been much better written, but it's a mainstream movie after all. One last note on the history of psychiatry: the struggle between psychosurgery and modern psychiatry devoted to the phenomenology of the patient's narrative - that is a true fact, and it did begin in the fifties. Furthermore, going along with a patient's delusion at crtain points of the therapeutic process: I'm appalled that many reviewers found this so absurd. I'm a psychiatrist and it's my line of work.

It misses the moments of levity that made Taxi Driver, Casino and Goodfellas so captivating in their dark themes, but the dark stuff is done so well that its hard to complain about anything in that sense. It doesn't feel at all like a Scorsese picture, but it certainly feels like a well-directed one. The film is probably Scorsese's most visually arresting film since Taxi Driver, and the atmosphere is terrifying thanks to fantastic lighting and sound design from the crew.

It's essentially a B movie, an insane asylum-based thriller adapted from a novel by Dennis Lehane. You'll probably guess the film's final twist within a matter of minutes, but it doesn't matter too much. It's a heck of a ride. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a Federal Marshall from Boston visiting an island asylum for the criminally insane after one of their patients mysteriously vanishes. He has an idea that there might be something more sinister going on on the island. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's partner, Ben Kingsley the head psychiatrist of the institution and Michelle Williams is DiCaprio's deceased wife (in frequent flashbacks, dreams and fantasy sequences). They round out the main cast. The supporting cast includes Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine and Jackie Earle Haley. Everyone in the film turns in an excellent, heated performance (Ruffalo is a tad more laid back than the rest). Some of the movie plays out like a first-rate horror story, especially DiCaprio's entrance into the dreaded Cell Block C, which contains the most violent criminals in the institution. As I stated above, it's pretty easy to guess at what this is all leading to, and, when it gets there, Scorsese spends far too long explicating everything. But the very last moment of the film is quite good. All in all, it's a worthy film in the Scorsese canon.",

Scorsese openly admitted that his film's highly influenced by the Val Lewton-produced horror films of the 1940s, where lighting, camera setup and atmosphere play key roles and the emphasis is on toying with the viewer's imagination, conjuring demons in the shadows instead of trolleying in the latest variant on Frankenstein's monster.",

The editing and directing in this movie is fantastic Scorsese keeps the suspense and tension he was able to achieve with The Departed and uses it even better here adding a lot of mystery leaving the viewer guessing to the very last second. This became apparent in the dream sequences as they could have come across as pretentious and melodramatic but they fit in perfectly.This is definitely a movie that's best experienced knowing as little as possible because this first and foremost is an investigation movie and you want to be able to experience that investigation with the characters. Leonardo DiCaprio returns for his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese and he is fantastic in this movie not only is he a character the audience can get behind he is also very complex and makes sure DiCaprio can give it everything. Mark Ruffalo was also very good in this movie he was likable and subtle. Ben Kingsley isn't in the movie much but he definitely makes the most of that screen time.

Try now to believe it. As the aim of the movie is to deny what you have just read. So what's the point? I can introduce Alice in wonderland like ""it is the story of a Chinese manufacturer who is hired by a mysterious underground tea dealer. Eventually she has to confront the mischievous queen of Tibet to defend a bunch of rabbits"". Shutter Island is a bad movie. Everything is built on a ""twist"" which is clear since the very beginning. In-depth explanation involving fire and water dichotomy (some review at IMDb's) must come from patient 64.

Much the same as ""Psycho"" in many respects then. Clearly Mr Scorsese has studied The Master's oeuvre and come up with a smart tribute hiding behind the schlock - horror label and the trappings of slasher - flickdom. It is 1954.Traumatised cop Mr L.de Caprio is called to what used to be known in less sensitive times as an Insane Asylum when a patient goes missing. He has his own agenda as he believes the arsonist who killed his family may be detained there. With his partner he starts making investigations that lead him to believe some kind of ""Reds under the beds"" conspiracy has taken place. The Superintendent,Mr.B.Kingsley,is less than helpful,adding credence to the cop's suspicions. A convoluted plot ensues whereby - aided by liberal use of flashback - Mr de Caprio is drawn more and more deeply into the mystery of the missing patient and its wider significance for him. Twist follows twist until the ultimate turn at the end which is open to various interpretations. After about 15 minutes a vague memory was nagging at me and eventually I recalled that I had read ""Shutter Island"" in novel form two or three years ago and it says much for Mr Scorcese's skill that I still found the ending brilliantly ambivalent. Mr de Caprio plays the deeply troubled detective quite brilliantly. He is a man who has seen things no person should have to see,both in wartime and peacetime.Just how much more can he take?",
146,10 November 2013,Horst_In_Translation,8, Mesmerizing piece of filmmaking from one of the greats,"Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" went a bit under the radar after the big hype ended as it was released right before Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio also. This adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel turned out very nicely, however. The screenplay was written by Laeta Kalogridis, who was also in charge of the script to the infamous ""Alexander"", but if her talent was somehow in question, it's all been made up by her work for Shutter Island. Some people say that Scorsese needs to move on to another recurring lead actor than Di Caprio, but I say, if Shutter Island has any kind of influence in that decision, he should actually be working with nobody else. ""Shutter Island"" runs considerably over two hours and DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels is pretty much in there from start to finish and commands the screen incessantly.",
147,22 February 2010,Willie-12,8, Well Done,"When it comes to directors who are of the caliber of Martin Scorsese, even when they're not producing their best stuff, it is still so much better than most everything else out there. That is the case with Scorsese's Shutter Island. This was not a perfect movie. Not by any means or stretch of the imagination. It was a bit long, and some of the material felt a little recycled. In fact, there's a sequence near the beginning of the film where it seems that Scorsese was borrowing a little too heavily from movies like The Shining or Psycho. However, this was still a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, and thoroughly entertained. And I have to say, Leonardo DiCaprio turned in one of his best performances to date. His reaction near the end of the movie when his character faces a reality that is absolutely horrifying, was both heartbreaking and genuinely moving. I have to admit, even I got a little choked up during that scene, and that is something that almost never happens. It's interesting. When Paramount pushed back Island's release date to February 2010, I got a little nervous. After all, this time of year is a notorious dumping ground for production companies' crap. However, the fact that it was Scorsese kept me interested. I don't know why Paramount pushed the release date back. And I really don't care. All I know, is I'm glad they did.

The last thriller I can recall with a dazzling colour palette was David Fincher's 'Se7en (1995).' Yet, compared to this film, 'Shutter Island (2010)' has an incredible gracefulness about it. Martin Scorsese has spoken many times of his love for Powell and Pressburger (particularly 'The Red Shoes (1948)'), and this film seems like a very deliberate, and worthy, attempt to mimic the lush visual style of Jack Cardiff's unforgettable Technicolor cinematography. There's a potential problem in painting a thriller film with such warm, inviting colours; the viewer is embraced, rather than repelled, by what he sees. This, however, is exactly what 'Shutter Island' aims for. The audience is thrust into the mind of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his perception of the world becomes our reality.",

Both have a myriad of clues planted throughout the narrative, leading to a highly entertaining twist ending. I'll confess that I was pretty much fooled up until the climax but I did have my suspicions that things couldn't be what they seemed. At first, it seems that 'Shutter Island' is going to be a tale about some evil psychiatrists (aided and abetted by a corrupt staff) who are conducting secret experiments on a hapless population of psychiatric patients. Dr. Cawley (perfectly played by Ben Kingsley) does everything he can to stymie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniel's investigation including his refusal to hand over staff personnel folders.

158,12 June 2010,tburke85,8, Shutter Island An Excellent Suspenseful Thriller,"Shutter Island is an excellent suspenseful thriller with some flaws which I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs that bad in this one. Director Martin Scorsese is admirable in making Shutter Island giving audiences nearly everything they could expect or want from one of these films. Leonard DiCaprio is great as always as Teddy Daniels a US Marshal on route to a remote island for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a murderess who somehow escaped from her locked hospital room. Or as Ben Kingsley's mysterious head Dr. Crawley explains; ""We don't know how she got out of her room. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls."" Leonardo DiCaprio brings an intensity to the role (like in Blood Diamond and The Deaprted to name a couple) and at times vulnerability. He continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor. This film is no different. Well done. The rest of the talented cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and Max von Sydow in a small role are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Particia Clarkson, Elias Kosteas, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Jackie Earl Haely are also very good in their brief extended appearances since most of the story's focus is on DiCaprio which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Shutter Island turned out to be much better than expected. It has an interesting story, suspense, an eerie mood, and atmosphere with strong performances from the cast. The movie also has some nice twists and surprises. One I sort of did suspect and others I found surprising to say the least. So it's better to avoid spoilers and watch this film without knowing too much about the plot for you to truly enjoy Shutter Island. I found this film to be much better than others who disguise themselves as suspense thrillers (The Grudge, The Happening, and Shutter to name a few). I enjoyed that Scorsese didn't heavily rely on CG except for some and instead used for the most part realistic locations and atmosphere to create the suspense. The location they chose for the island was a perfect setting for this story to take place and it added a lot to the movie. The flashback sequences of Teddy's time in World War 2 were an interesting touch that give us some insight into his traumatic past which continues to plague him while on the island. The pace of the movie was a little slow in the beginning before the suspense really started to kick into high gear but overall I can't think of all that much I didn't like about this film. Sure it might have some tiny flaws including a surprise I sort of saw coming but I thought Scorsese still did a good job with the execution of the twist none the less. In some ways Shutter Island reminded me a bit of the Shining because both films used actual locations, surreal images, and atmosphere to create suspense build up instead of relying on CGI. I was impressed with this movie and I plan to watch it again sometime because second viewings I think are needed to fully understand the story so it makes sense. Not that the story itself is very complicated but I believe Shutter Island's worth watching a second time even with a 138 minute running time because the film is that good despite it's few flaws. If you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller or you're a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with Shutter Island. It has an intricate story, suspense, twists, surprises, and solid performances by the cast (especially DiCaprio, Ruffalo, and Kingsley) who make this thriller worth the time to watch.",
159,11 April 2010,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Siperb kafkaian monstrous tale,"It is in many ways a great film. It questions the ""heritage"" of the Second World War and the horror the American soldiers discovered in the camps, in this case here Dachau. It is also more than clear on the passage of some of the researchers of Nazi Germany to the US to continue their research in peace, including if necessary with human experiments when dealing with medical research. It is unluckily well-known that prisons and orphanages were places of hellish torturing and violence in the name of research or reform. That's the first level of the film. The second level is: what can society do with the few human beings who are so bad that they can't be reformed? Various solutions are available: lobotomizing them to turn them into docile pets, pharmaceuticalizing their cases so that they become chemical zombies, or manipulating their minds to make them convinced of what they have done and of the necessary punishment called treatment they are receiving. The film goes even as far as imagining the production of human killing tools that could be used in wars. Surgery, drugs or mental manipulation, that's the choices envisaged here. The three of them are all just fully wrong. But the film is a lot more disquieting than that if we deal with the simple fact that the decision of a psychiatrist to classify you as anything psychic or psychological is absolutely irreversible and everything you may say or do to prove you are not will be turned into the evidence that you are and will be used against you. In other words the lady always protests too much. That's the Kafka aspect of the tale. But the film is even better than all that because Scorsese in his personal style builds a story in which we do not know at all at the end if the two cops were really what they pretended to be at the beginning and thus were kidnapped by the doctors to make sure nothing will seep out of their concentration camp, or if it is the doctors who are right at the end and that the two cops are what these doctors pretend, one is a killer and the other his doctor and that the whole tale was a medical procedure to reach treatment. At the end there is only one choice left: to live as a monster or to die in dignity. But what is dignity in such an environment? We are happily doubting everything at the end, which may create a feeling of frustration in the audience.",

I am utterly perplexed that this high-grade bit of noir-ish filmmaking has so impressed the masses; its current rating is far too generous for what's been delivered. Much like ""Avatar,"" Scorsese's latest is all about style and very little about substance. The ""twist"" to the story is so transparent that it becomes obvious long before the film is over, thus rendering the final reels an exercise in tedium. Hearkening back to the days of Hitchcockian psychological thrillers, replete with obvious dreamscape tropes like vertiginous cliffs, revelatory caverns, and hallucinatory warnings, ""Shutter Island"" mines its territory with no small degree of authority, but no lesser degree of familiarity and lack of tension and surprise. The professionalism of the work is admirable, but its creativity and heart are, sad to say, pedestrian and unremarkable. I have no doubt that the novel on which it was based is a better read than ""Shutter Island"" is a viewing.",

The script isn't quite as mysterious or complex as the makers assumed it was, it's not particularly difficult to figure things out. All other aspects of the movie are nothing short of brilliant though. DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both perfect for their roles, the scenes they share are the highlights of the movie.

Because if your big twist doesn't have as powerful an impact as you would hope your movie falls flat. Think M. Night Shyamalan films other than The Sixth Sense. Sadly Shutter Island falls into that trap. The ending doesn't satisfy and certainly doesn't redeem all that came before it. Because so much of what came before is rather mundane. But you hold out hope because you know the story is building towards some kind of big revelation. It has to, this is a movie which screams ""Twist!"" from its very beginning. This was never a story which was going to play out in a straightforward, conventional manner. So for whatever disappointment you may feel as the movie progresses the hope is still there that there will be a big ending to save the day. But alas that is not to be the case.

177,28 February 2010,wrbones,5, Strange Film For Someone Like Scorcese,"I'll start by saying that I did enjoy this film overall but there are a lot of really annoying aspects to it. First off is DiCaprio's stubble, which in 1954 would have made him a vagrant, not a US Marshall. Then there was the ridiculous music that accompanied an inconsequential scene of the marshals entering the asylum gates for the first time. It built up and built up, then nothing happened. That kind of thing is really annoying. The score overall veered from terrific to grating and inappropriate in places. I often found it quite distracting. There were many continuity problems throughout. If it was meant to add another dimension to the film, it failed. Instead it was distracting and gave the impression that they ran out of time/budget more than anything else. The plot is largely obvious from early on. If it takes you more than 15 minutes to work out what is going on, there is something wrong with you. OK, the full extent of the revelations at the end is harder to divine before it's revealed but the thrust of it is obvious. The film was, as you'd expect, beautifully shot and the cast was pretty good, although DiCaprio's Boston accent came and went at different times. The setting was also magnificent, which added to the overall effect. As a genre film, Shutter Island doesn't work nearly as well as others. Identity comes to mind as a far better attempt at the same kind of story. It's probable that it's strength is that it is not really a genre film and will, therefore, appeal to a broader audience. However, it is definitely not one of Scorcese's best. If I had to rank it, it would sit somewhere near Bringing Out the Dead.",
178,8 July 2010,Robert_duder,8, A solid thriller if not a little over rated. The twist isn't truly so twisty,"Everyone I ever spoke to that had seen Shutter Island raved about it. I don't disagree that the film was very entertaining and a solid thriller but I felt like maybe people saw more originality in it than I did. It was well worth seeing and impressed me so don't get me wrong but it wasn't a mind blowing Scorsese classic in my opinion. In fact I think this was one of Scorsese's more mainstream films, although I've never really seen him as the 'amazing' 'monster' director everyone else does. I usually find he tries too hard to be unique. Still Shutter Island's creepy setting, and isolated prison is very well done and keeps you enthralled. The entire film happens on Shutter Island but you won't soon be tired of the setting as it takes the lead character from the prison like rooms to the coast of the island and back. Add in the time period of the mid fifties, and then toss a Hurricane at the Island to boot and you have the perfect suspense thriller setting to keep things moving. But by the time you add some of these key features it might start to feel a little predictable which you don't really expect from the film or from Scorsese.

Shutter Island has a familiar feel to it. The idea of a mental asylum has been deeply ingrained into our collective cultural psyche and Scorsese uses that, presenting us an island that's both a cliché and something terrifyingly new. The colours are just a bit off, the characters sometimes step away from the roles that we have given them in our heads, the plot doesn't dance to the pipe that we all expect to hear.

192,16 June 2015,Maladjusted_1,6, A cartoonlike dystopian by a director of much better films.,"'Shutter Island' is a Martin Scorsese film about a federal officer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who visits a high-security hospital for the criminally insane, and this facility is located on a remote island. This setting immediately establishes a feeling of bleakness, isolation and dystopia, which amplifies greatly as 'Shutter Island' progresses. I think that Scorsese's maintenance of the grim atmosphere is one of the strongest qualities of the film, but this hard exterior belies the hollow psychology of 'Shutter Island'. The dark exploration of the mind doesn't hold a candle to 'Taxi Driver', nor do the twists live up to 'The Departed'. I felt as though the portrayal of insanity in 'Shutter Island' was a little too cartoonlike, seeming to resemble something you'd find in Gotham City. This discredits the film, in my opinion, and makes 'Shutter Island' feel very hollow and superficial at times. There are one or two satisfying twists throughout the film, but I don't think that they sufficiently compensate for the tedium of the first half. DiCaprio's objectives in the film seem ambiguous at times, and, combined with the barrage of flashbacks and hallucinations, 'Shutter Island' often feels like a video game played inattentively. The film isn't a disaster, though, as the editing is very enjoyable at times, and Scorsese's creation of the cold, dystopian landscape has to be commended. I just wish that this film was a little more 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Silence of the Lambs', and a little less 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'.",

I cannot really say anything more without spoiling it for you. This film needs to be experienced first-hand! ",

I watch it every few years, since it came out, and I still find things that make me sit on the edge of my seat and excitedly point at the TV. It is so incredibly thorough down to the smallest detail and it keeps you glued to the screen. The depth of feeling and emotion Leonardo DiCaprio played in this is so beautiful and intense. It's infuriating to think of all of the outstanding work he has performed over the years and only just recently won his first Oscar. I believe he was absolutely deserving of one from Shutter Island, let alone his other performances.",

Ashecliffe holds some of the most criminally insane patients and it is reluctance then that Teddy must had over his pistol before entering. Teddy holds little remorse for the inmates. He is haunted by the memories of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) who was killed by a firebug. When they reach the mainland, Teddy and Chuck are briefed by the ambiguous Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who describes how a murderer named Rachel Salon escaped from her cell and has now gone missing. Beyond this disappearance though, Teddy suspects that there is something far more sinister occurring on the island and seeks to find evidence of it. He also suspects that the other doctor on the island, Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), might be a former Nazi.",

DiCaprio phones it in a little which sucks especially compared to Mark Ruffalo's overacting. Ben Kingsley does a great job though. Same with Max Von Syndrow who played the German doctor. He was clearly inspired by Casper Gutman in the 1941 noir ""The Maltese Falcon"" starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston. Just listen to the way he talks. ""My sir, you have excellent defensive mechanisms"" compared to Gutman's ""My sir, you are a most headstrong individual."" As far as neo-noirs go, their are many better ones. However, I would probably recommend Shutter Island.",

The whole cast are first rate and this has to be one of DiCaprio's best performances. Max Von Sydow is superb as always.The atmosphere is wonderful, Gothic and distinctly unsettling and the setting just perfect. The photography is beautiful and never over fanciful and the plot keeps the viewer engrossed for the whole two and a quarter hours, which is the sign of a great film. It is a return to the old fashioned thriller style, with relatively little in the way of special effects, which is one of its great strengths in my view. The detail is exceptional and not a frame is wasted. I can't say I like all of Martin Scorsese's work, but this is top stuff.",

In Polanski's previous film or in the first series of Millennium there was a bridge to connect the island with the continent, here there is no bridge and a storm will soon cut any connection with solid ground and any way for the characters to get back to the safety of their routine existence.

I went to see this movie with expectations aplenty. An excellent cast and a tried and true director. The cinematography was good, the performances were good; therefore, I put all of the fault in the director. NOTHING HAPPENED. It was tedious and boring. I figured out the ending in the first five minutes which was ridiculously contrived and about as new and refreshing as the plot of a Friday the 13th movie. I expressed my feelings to my dad who told me that the book was exactly the same. Maybe Scorcese was true to the book which makes me wonder why they made it into a movie at all?! 40 minutes into the film I was trying to find enough light in the theatre to reflect in my watch so that I could see how long I had been sitting there- that's never a good sign.

206,20 February 2010,ctomvelu1,7, Air of mystery,"SHUTTER ISLAND is based on a novel by popular mystery writer Dennis Lehane, who likes to add a gimmick or twist to many of his novels. SHUTTER ISLAND is no exception, and in fact contains several twists. Leo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal in the 1950s looking into the disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane. The asylum is on an island near Boston. Once on the island, the marshal finds he can trust no one -- not the psychiatrists, played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow, and certainly not any of the staff. He also finds he cannot even trust his new partner (played by the affable Mark Ruffalo) who at one point warns him they could become permanent residents of the island if they don't watch out. To make matters worse, the marshal is subject to hallucinations. He sees his wife, who is dead. at every turn and has frequent flashbacks to his time in the military, liberating Dachau. Then a hurricane hits the island and the power goes out. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is a psychological thriller with horror movie overtones. While on the long side, it moves at a decent pace and the special effects are first-rate. Your tolerance for this surreal and ultimately downbeat movie will largely depend on your tolerance for DiCaprio, (he is fine here, although I would have preferred Brad Pitt in the role), and the almost comical shenanigans going on in the spooky old asylum. And be warned: The movie gets pretty nasty, which Scorsese movies tend to. For those confused or disappointed by the ending, read the book. The book's ending is cut-and-dried, leaving no question as to what transpired. The movie's ending is left open to interpretation, which is certainly the director's and/or screenwriter's right.",

But I expected too much and finally I rate this only five stars out ten. Why? The first half I wait and wait until something special happens. Then the plot is for me not hot enough to get adrenalin. Even the end let me cold and I could only shake my head. The story was even predictable that from the running time of two hours they could have cut at least 30 minutes. Director Martin Scorsese is the specialist to expand movies as he did already in The Aviator or Goodfellas and I definitely don't like extra long films. ,

I was also looking forward to seeing Dicaprio in this role, as recently his acting has improved so much that he is unrecognisable from some of his earlier films.

210,30 September 2019,Abhinav009,10, Flawless screenplay..,"This movie blew my mind.
The movie begins with the protagonist, Edward Teddy Daniels, on his way to shutter island aka mental asylum. With him is his newly assigned partner, Chuck. What starts as a missing patient mystery soon reveals Teddy's own intentions to hunt down his wife's murderer on that island. One event leads to another until Teddy is convinced of a conspiracy against him that is preventing him from uncovering the real truth. He believes unethical mental experiments are being done with the patients there.
He then meets the lost patient in a cave, who convinces him about everyone being evil on the island and that they would do anything to not let him go. He swims his way to the lighthouse and confronts Dr Cawley. THIS IS WHERE THE PLOT EXPLODES.
As Dr Cawley begins convincing him that Teddy himself is just another patient affected by OCD, we the audience feel the cunningness in his attempt to mislead Teddy. But line after line, Teddy and the audience, slowly begin to accept Dr Cawley's version of tge story. THIS IS WHERE THE BEAUTY OF THE MOVIE LIES.....as in throughout the movie, both Teddy and we were under an illusion, and Dr Cawley's suggestions brought both Teddy and us out of our delusion...... Masterful.
So what could have been a dull insight into an OCD patient's life turned into a full length suspense-thriller.... just because of the way the entire events were arranged. Brilliant!!!",

How this 70s B-movie script attracted Scorsese, DiCaprio, Ruffalo etc who know - perhaps it was just an excuse to camp it up for a while.

The previews really made things look exciting, but ten minutes into the movie and anyone could see where it was leading. DiCaprio looked twitchy and unreliable from the start, and Ruffalo's snide tone when addressing him was a dead giveaway. So once again, we have the deluded murderer who constructs another life because he can't live with what he's done--and a whole bunch of histrionics. Plus rats! And Nazis!

Despite the seemingly familiar use of police figures as protagonists, Scorsese instead contents himself from drawing instead from the realm of psychological horror thrillers rather than his usual milieu of police or gangster genres, without sacrificing his usual uncanny grasp on complex, nuanced characterisation or sophistication of narrative. As such, rather than a 'gimmicky' conscious departure from his realm of expertise, Scorsese's film instead feels like a fitting entry into his celebrated pantheon of work, only serving to further demonstrate his versatility as a director.",

He's a master of accompanying image with music. This is one of his very most effective endeavors in music placement.

229,18 March 2010,bifties,1," Oh my God, what a huge horrendous pile of poo!","I always fear that preconceptions and/or high expectations can cause a film to do worse than it deserves. For instance, walk in to a movie that you know nothing about, and more often than not it will surprise you. On the other hand, walk into a film directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, based on a novel written by Dennis Lehane (who wrote ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""Mystic River"") and a supporting cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Max Von Sydow, Sir Ben Kingsley and Emily Mortimer, you are almost certain to be disappointed. However, this may have been true with other films but when it comes to a Scorsese/DiCaprio collaboration (for example Gangs of New York, The Departed and The Aviator)I expect a little bit more, and I expect the film to deliver something. This film sadly does not deliver, it does not excite and it does not deserve to be in IMDb's top 250 (which at the time of writing it does). I can only conclude that the masses have decided not to bet against a previously assumed sure thing, and instead vote along with everyone else rather than question the latest Scorsese/DiCaprio collaboration. The film opens on a boat, and within minutes we see DiCaprio and Ruffalo standing on the deck talking. It was from this point onwards that I was disappointed and began to expect very little from the rest of the film. Blue screen? Green screen? Whatever they use, they used it here and it looked horrible. And if nothing else, I have always found that of the Scorsese films I didn't necessarily enjoy in the past I would at least walk out at the end saying how beautiful and authentic everything looked.

Leonardo Decaprio gives an outstanding performance as US Marshall Teddy Daniels set in 1954. Him and his partner Chuck Aule played excellently by Mark Ruffalo are on their way to Shutter Island, a closed off psychiatric prison for the criminally insane. Teddy and Chuck have been set to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner who has escaped though the guards or doctors don't know how she escaped from the room. Arriving at the prison Scorsese sets up the tone of a dark, disturbing and mysterious place using non-diegetic sound and a haunting music score (one of the scariest I have heard) to deliberately unsettle us and it dosen't help when Teddy and Chuck have to surrender their firearms at the main gate. As Teddy and Chuck investigate the prisoner's disappearance their investigation leads them to believe there may be a sixty seventh (being only sixty sixth) in the first place.

247,17 April 2010,jonnyfendi,8, Scorsese Scores Again! (Thiz Review Contains Spoiler),"""Shutter Island"" seems to be an appropriate vessel for Leonardo DiCaprio to explore his acting skill. It's quite good, but yet it's not the finest, but I still can say thiz performance might be one of his best works so far. DiCaprio collaborates the fourth time with the Director Martin Scorsese, the last three are ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), ""The Aviator"" (2004) and ""The Departed"" (2006). Scorsese himself is a very good drama Director. His previous memorable classics are ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990). It's about US Marshall named Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) comes to an island to investigate a mysterious case. The island is actually a prison facility for mental illness. Thiz movie is supported by heavy caliber Cast members such as Ben Kingsley, Mark Rufallo, Mark Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley and Michelle Williams. The script of thiz movie is very fine with several twist and turns. Scorsese with all his experiences successfully arranges every scene effectively. The exploration is classic, we even could see ""Hitchcock"" atmosphere here. The Score also helps a lot to build such an intensive tension. The great example when is on the opening scene, when Daniels and his partner just arrive on the island for the first time. When they observe the surrounding that is preserved with maximum securities, the gates is opened one by one. At a glance it's just an ordinary scene, but the Score multiplies it into ten times more thrill. The twist ending is meant to be shocking. But unfortunately (Spoiler Alert!), I already see the pattern where the story might goes even in the middle of the movie. When a conversation between Daniels and Rachel (Patricia Clarkson) that takes place in a cave, Daniels said angrily, ""I am an US Marshall. No one can stop me!"". That is the first time when I clearly know that he is actually one of the patients. In the end, if we have a movie that every scene is put in for a reason. That is the time when you got yourself an effective and flawless movie. Scorsese scores again! ",

251,5 February 2012,writers_reign,6, To Play With Mamets,"In scene III, Act II of Henry IV Part One, Hotspur, a fiery, plain-speaking and uncomplicated man tells his wife, Kate that 'this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips; we must have bloody noses and cracked crowns'. It would take, I would argue, someone like Hotspur to sever this Gordian knot which is as complex as anything David Mamet ever wrote. Usually where labyrinthine plots are involved most, if not all inconsistencies are explained in the last reel but unless I missed something that is not the case here. This is what I saw. An opening scene in which a Federal marshall, awaiting a ferry to transport him to Shutter Island, meets for the first time, his assistant. Both men are in civilian clothes and carrying both i.d. and guns. Having reached the island, which houses an asylum for the criminally insane - they are going there specifically to investigate the 'escape' of a female patient - they show their i.d. at the gate of the prison and surrender their weapons. The best part of two hours later the psychiatrist in charge tells the Federal marshall that he is, in fact, a patient and has been for the past two years, further, his 'assistant' identifies himself as the psychiatrist in charge of the Federal marshall's case. If this is in fact the case, why allow an insane man to leave the prison in civilian clothes - all inmates wear white uniforms - and furnish him with (presumably) fake i.d. and a gun? If this is ever explained to my satisfaction I'll return and re-review it.",
252,13 July 2010,brandon_lee420,8, Stays true to the book.,"While the film was in theatres, I took my chance to read the book that made this film come alive. The book was fantastic and puzzles and twists were very surprising. When the film reached my local video store, I took my chance to grab it off the shelf and view it. The film does a good job of having the same atmosphere and dialog as the book while also staying true to it, as well. The cast did an excellent job of portraying the characters in the book and their performances were over the top. If I hadn't read the book, I would've given this film a perfect ten but that could, sadly, not happen since I already knew what was going to happen and it made the film a bit more boring. The dialog in Shutter Island is mostly what you read in the book but the people who say those lines do a really good job. Two particular lines that were used in both the film and books were, ""Thorns as big as my d*ck."" and ""Pull yourself together, Teddy."" and I remember them a bit more than the others because one was funny and the other one was cool. So cool in fact is that I wake up every morning and splash water onto my face and stare at the mirror and exactly say that line. The acting was top notch in this motion picture with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, and Jackie Earle Haley taking the top four spots. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, did a superb job of portraying Teddy Daniels and my vision of Teddy was what Leonardo gave us. He plays a U.S. marshal who is investigating the disappearance of one of the patients from the Ashcliff Hospital for the criminally insane. Along the way he discovers puzzles and finds out that everybody is keeping a secret from him. He really gave a convincing act. Ben Kingsley does a well done job of Dr. John Cawley, who is the somewhat mysterious, and his accent is really cool. Mark Ruffalo plays the partner of Teddy, Chuck Aule, as they are sent to the hospital where a mystery plagues the entire hospital. Ruffalo impressed me a lot in this film and he does a good job of knowing nothing when he really does. The best and by the far most impressive actor has to be Jackie Earle Haley for his wonderful role as George Noyce, a mental nutcase who speaks in riddles. Haley knows how to act in a good, realistic way and that is what separated him from everyone else and made him the king of Shutter Island. A lot of people are saying that this isn't one of the Scorsese's best works but I have to disagree and say that this his second best film after, of course, ""The Departed"". I suggest that you stop listening to these remarks and just be immersed into this complex yet fascinating mystery/thriller/horror. The wardrobe for this film matches the year it was set in and it does give the film a 1954 feeling. The makeup is quite good as well from the hairstyles to the facial makeup.",

257,11 May 2015,anaconda-40658,9, Scorsese Island.,"Shutter Island (2010): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Leonardo DiCapro, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow: Psychological thriller about isolation. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a federal Marshall who arrives by fairy with his partner to Shutter Island where he is to investigate the disappearance of a dangerous inmate. Things are not as they seem as DiCaprio questions the methods of the institution as well as confront his own visions. Director Martin Scorsese's fourth collaboration with DiCaprio. Previously they were responsible for Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and The Departed. It is no surprise that Shutter Island carries on the trend. Great performance by DiCaprio who grows haunted and suspicious with every clue he discovers. Mark Ruffalo plays his partner who goes for reason when DiCaprio becomes frustrated and heated. Ben Kingsley steals scenes as the head doctor at the institution. DiCaprio doesn't trust the doctor due to lack of cooperation nor is the staff any help. Michelle Williams is seen in flashbacks as DiCaprio's deceased wife. We learn through DiCaprio that she died by an intentional fire where the guilty wasn't found. Her flashback scenes are bright with life while the rest of the film deals with dark shadows and lighting that enhance the corridors of the prison. Max von Sydow is featured briefly as a mysterious doctor who dominates his scenes. With the exception of its ending, this film presents the eerie side of the human animal as well as present the reality of gloom within a prison. It is enough to make you shutter. Score: 9 / 10",

The scenes were hacked together in such a poor fashion, and the clues to the ending were so blatant. I worked out the premise of the movie about 8-15 minutes in. Sure, I wasn't absolutely certain at that point, but once I reached my conclusion the 'clues' came thicker, faster, and so blatant they were right in my face. After 30 minutes I had no further doubts that I'd nailed it. It's not so much that I'm so awesome at guessing movie plots, but more about how badly put together this story happens to be.",

265,30 March 2010,Jackpollins,2, Too Much Going On For One Sitting,"Shutter Island is a Gothic thriller about Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), two police officers investigating a disappearance at an insane asylum run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). The film's first 15 minutes are fantastic, setting the mood just right, but it gets too weird from then on. This is directed by Martin Scorsese, a usually wonderful director. Scorsese's best films investigate the main character and peeling back his or hers layers. That's just where the problem starts with Shutter Island. The film has too much going on and never gets to fully peel back the layers of any of the characters. There are Teddy having nightmares about the war & his wife, the disappearance plot, and a bunch of twists & turns. It plays mind games with its audiences for 2 hours before making sense with its final 20 minute twist. That brings me to my next point, the film is too long. It's 2 hours & 20 minutes, which is far too long for such a weird & uneven film. I've always thought Mark Ruffalo was underrated & a good actor, but he's given nothing to do with his character. His character is extremely dull. Scorsese's use of sound is also torturing. Overall, Shutter Island spends too much time stalling and ends up being unsatisfactory in the end. I can't recommend it to anyone, because life is too short to spend 2 hours & 20 minutes watching this.",

First of all, a plot of the picture is so thrilled then you feel some fear from beginning to the end. Mystical hospital on the island has many puzzles and you begin to ask different questions yourselves. Then, play of the main character is so real and his searching for mystical truth excites all the time. I think that the main part of a good film for people is their interest in it. And you can't fall asleep after watching a Shatter Island. Illness or conviction? When I saw it once, I believed that we have a deal with an illness weirdo because strange lighthouse prove a simple one without any secrets, and awful experiments like he earlier imaged are not exist. However for the second watching, I understood that he is convinced. Secret pills, cigarettes, woman's note ""run out"" and a fascinating logic intellect can't belong to a crazy man. May be... Well, I was surprised after culmination. Who could imagine the end like this? I think none of us. We amazed by this plot, idea and then we begin to adore this film. This is an achievement of a director and fantasy which reflect interesting motions in Teddy's head. The secret of successful film- surprise, shock and our wish to see it one more time exactly with the same actors. People want to find some new, fresh and unusual belong boring and not good movies. And if you a person like this, you need watch Shutter Island. In conclusion, I'd want to say that we must watch films like one in order to being surprised and exited about opportunities of our mind.

Sometimes a movie can fool one once, but rarely can it do it twice and by the end of this movie, it's anybody's guess (though probably not). There's a number of technical, logical flaws that appear in this movie, yet by flipping it, it can also become a superb example of psychologically performed movie right to the end. It's also almost impossible to discuss this perhaps predictable, perhaps not predictable movie without offering spoilers as this movie really to be fairly experienced can't really be described in any detail. The movie must proceed on its own in a linear fashion. What will be of more finely nuanced interest is whether there is any real longer term, lasting cinematic brilliance on a second viewing. Regardless, this one time experience like its predecessors which will become evident by movies end seems to have raised the bar even further and become a tribute to this psychological thriller genre, one of the best to come along in years. Perhaps, the only real difficulties with this movie is the seemingly overt, perhaps over-use of special effects during the first third of the movie and the perhaps too finely imbalance in how the second third of the movie plays on the imagination of the viewer.",

Coincidentally my second favorite Leo movie, Inception, came out this same year. But he's not the only star; Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, and Max von Sydow were all incredible. As were smaller roles such as Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas, and Ted Levine with an exceptional little monologue.

306,5 February 2011,jboothmillard,5, Shutter Island,"This dark looking film was bigged up quite a lot at the time of release, and it was the fourth time director Martin Scorsese was teaming up with his star of Gangs of New York, I had to see what this film was about. Basically set in 1954, World War II veteran and current federal marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are heading to Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who was incarcerated for drowning her three children, but the staff are confrontational, lead psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley (Sir Ben Kingsley) refuses to turn over records, and Solando's doctor, Dr. Sheehan, left the island for vacation immediately after her disappearance. Daniels has constant migraine headaches and is haunted by both his experiences in the Dachau liberation reprisals, and the death of his wife Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams), killed in a fire started by local arsonist Andrew Laeddis, he also has a vision of his wife telling him that Solando is still on the island somewhere, the same applies with Laeddis, although everyone claims he was never there to begin with, Daniels tells Aule his ulterior motive for taking the case is to find Laeddis. Solando suddenly resurfaces, with no explanation of where she was or how she escaped, so Daniels breaks into the restricted Ward C, there he encounters patient George Noyce (A Nightmare on Elm Street remake's Jackie Earle Haley) in solitary confinement, he warns Daniels the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, the lighthouse has significance, and everyone, including Aule, is playing an elaborate game specifically designed for Daniels. Daniels is determined to investigate the lighthouse, while climbing the rocks he is separated from Aule, below he finds a cave, with a woman hiding, she claims to be the real Rachel Solando (Patricia Clarkson), a former psychiatrist at the hospital, who discovered the psychotropic medication experiments and trans-orbital lobotomies, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient before she could report her findings. Returning to the hospital, Daniels cannot find Aule, he is convinced he has been taken to the lighthouse, he breaks into it, only to discover Cawley calmly waiting there for him, he explains to Daniels he is in fact Andrew Laeddis, ""the most dangerous patient"", incarcerated for murdering his manic depressive wife after she drowned their children, Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are anagrams of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal. Cawley explains that the past several days have been designed to allow Laeddis to play out the role of Daniels and break his conspiracy- laden insanity, all hospital staff, including Dr. Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando, were part of the test, Laeddis faints as reality and realisation hit him. Laeddis awakes in the hospital, watched by Cawley and Shaheen, the doctors are satisfied with his progression when he tells the truth in a coherent manner, Cawley notes that he achieved this state nine months before, but quickly regressed, this test was Laeddis' last chance to redeem himself. In the end, Laeddis calls Dr. Sheehan by the name ""Chuck"" and says they need to leave the island, Shaheen shakes his head to gesture the experiment has not worked, but before Laeddis is taken away to have a lobotomy, he says """"Which would be worse? To live as a monster, or die as a good man?"", suggesting that he is in fact sane, it is presumed Laeddis cannot live with what he has done. Also starring Max Von Sydow as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring, Ted Levine as Warden, Elias Koteas as Laeddis and Volcano's John Carroll Lynch as Deputy Warden McPherson. DiCaprio gives a terrific performance as the investigator who gets more than he bargained for when he takes on a case, and there is good support from Ruffalo and Kingsley, the Gothic surroundings and operatic thrills work well, you can predict the big twist before the end, and it is the slightest bit too long, but if you want something creepy and gripping then it is not disappointing, a quite good mystery thriller.

Now if you read the novel this film just isn't going to be as good, so I heavely recommend anyone to see this movie without reading the novel cause it really does rely on the twist and turns although it's fairly predictable. Although the plot wasn't amazing or anything it was a decent movie, the acting was top notch and the cinematography and CGI was very well done. To some it up it's a pretty good noir thriller but nothing very special or anything, especially since the movie relies heavily on the twists and mystery but it just wasn't that great.

311,20 March 2010,Bunuel1976,8," SHUTTER ISLAND (Martin Scorsese, 2010) ***1/2","Martin Scorsese's fourth consecutive feature film to have Leonardo Di Caprio in the lead is one that I felt was slightly superior to their Oscar-winning predecessor, THE DEPARTED (2006); undoubtedly, it is a vast improvement over Scorsese's previous movie with definite horror overtones i.e. the unsatisfactory and unnecessary remake of CAPE FEAR all the way back from 1991! Having said that, the film is ostensibly a mystery thriller set inside a mental institution and, reportedly, Scorsese drew inspiration from several noirs directed by Jacques Tourneur and his earlier horror output for producer Val Lewton (whose own last effort in that genre, BEDLAM [1946], shared a similar setting to this one). Although Robbie Robertson's brooding assembled score tends to be over-emphatic, this has to be one of Scorsese's most intricately crafted works, replete with suffocatingly gloomy visuals (courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson and production designer Dante Ferretti). Leonardo Di Caprio's performance – as a Federal Agent investigating the 'impossible' disappearance of a female inmate – is arguably his most confident yet under Scorsese's mentoring; however, from the outset, his character clearly belongs to the ""nuttier than thou"" variety and the much-touted identity twist in the film's latter half did not inordinately surprise this viewer! Without wishing to reveal anything of the labyrinthine mazes in Dennis (MYSTIC RIVER) Lehane's source novel, suffice it to say that the film's plot turns from an imbroglio a' la THE WICKER MAN (1973), by way of elaborate charades akin to THE GAME (1997), into a personality crisis in the A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2003) mould. Aiding Di Caprio in bringing his character's inner turmoil to the surface – and, consequently, appearing to hinder his investigation at every turn – are an impressive array of actors all of whom rise impeccably to the occasion: Ben Kingsley (as Shutter Island's radical head honcho), Max von Sydow (splendidly sinister in the handful of scenes he is featured in), Mark Ruffalo (as Di Caprio's 'partner'), Michelle Williams (as Di Caprio's dead wife!), Emily Mortimer (as the missing patient), Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Elias Koteas. Apart from Di Caprio's harrowing flashbacks to his part in the liberation of the Dachau Concentration Camp (which, we are led to believe, were the reasons for his later alcoholism and disturbed state of mind), there are effective nightmare sequences aplenty (perhaps a mite more than required, actually) abounding with bloodied corpses or dissolving ghosts. Topping everything up, we have a deliciously enigmatic ending that, again, leaves the door open (ironically enough for a movie set on an island prison) for more than one clear interpretation: did Di Caprio fake a relapse and welcomed lobotomy to pay for his grave, alcohol-induced fault of not committing his mad wife at an earlier stage and thus sparing the lives of his three childrenor, was he the murderer of his entire family all along? Because, were it otherwise, why else would he have been institutionalized in this most forbidding of mental hospitals in the first place?!",

315,20 February 2010,JoeKarlosi,8, Shutter Island (2010) ***,"Engaging if overlong film from Martin Scorsese based on the novel. Leonardo DiCaprio is a U.S. Marshal in 1954 who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to a heavily guarded mental institution for the criminally insane, far off on a creepy island. He's there to investigate the recent escape of a female patient who drowned her three children, and to possibly uncover what he feels are some unorthodox brain treatments on some of the inmates. He may even have a chance to confront and get revenge on a convict who was responsible for killing his wife two years earlier. Scorsese really handles this material well, but the viewer needs to pay close attention because there are so many twists and turns during DiCaprio's journey that things may sometimes become confusing. However, everything manages to make sense in the end, which is always what's important in a maze of a movie such as this. Leonardo's character is complicated because he plays a cop who had to kill many men during the war, and as a result has to contend with flashbacks which affect his work and better judgment. The rest of the cast is splendid, among them Max von Sydow as the elderly head psychiatrist, and especially Ben Kingsley as the mysteriously evasive and multi-layered head doctor who DiCaprio must deal with during his investigations. The ending wasn't really anything I couldn't have figured out, which is partly why I haven't rated the movie higher (that along with its excessive length and some possible lingering plot holes). But on the plus side, this is a film that I think may reward with a second viewing, and could conceivably come out with a slightly higher score next time. *** out of ****",

It's a masterpiece, marred slightly by an imperfect edit, but still very fine indeed!","Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal agent sent to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate at a prison for insane criminals. Located off the east coast, the island is accessible only by ferry and is surrounded by icy waters and a rough, rocky coast. Going with him is ""green"" agent Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) who will be working on his first major case. When they meet the security officers on the island, Teddy and Chuck are dismayed to have to surrender their weapons but the facility's rules rule. The chief trick cyclist, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) explains that their goal is to rehabilitate these folks, for, although they committed assaults and murders, they can be reached by therapy and pharmacology. Whew. The person missing is Rachel (Emily Mortimer), who disappeared while orderlies were having a card game. But, where did she go? She left behind her shoes and the terrain of the island is difficult. There is no explanation, so far. Another doctor (Max Von Sydow), a German immigrant, upsets Teddy, for the agent was part of the American army that liberated Dachau. Unhappily, Teddy begins to have horrific flashbacks. Also troubling Teddy is recurring nightmares about the death of his young wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams) in a fire. As they begin to look for the missing person, they have to inspect all three buildings on the island, including ""C"", where the most dangerous inmates are housed. Will they find the lady? Will they lose their own lives doing so? This is a masterpiece, slightly flawed, but an major achievement in film nonetheless. A better edit would have made a difference, for the pace is slightly off kilter and a ""mixing and splicing of scenes"" would have resulted in more interesting sequences. Nevertheless, Scorcese should be commended for making a thriller that genuinely thrills, and a beautifully, artistically crafted one at that. For example, a scene that falls apart into ashes is out of this world! The setting itself is a reason to see this one, for it is one of a kind. All other production values, including costumes and camera-work, are of the finest. On that note, DiCaprio and Ruffalo look so good in fifties-style coats and hats! The cast, too, is superlative, with all of the principal players doing great work. Special mention should go to Leonardo, for he is terrific and demonstrates why he is one of the premier actors in America. In short, get thee quickly to this amazing film.

325,24 February 2010,cultfilmfan,10, Shutter Island,"Shutter Island is based upon the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The film takes place in the mid 1950's where a United States Marshal named Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are sent to an island where there is a maximum security prison for patients with mental health disorders and many of them have become violent and are there because they have killed others. Teddy's assignment is to locate a patient who went missing. The task seems almost possible, due to the fact that the island is in the middle of nowhere and because of all the security around and because the island is surrounded by tons of rocks and water and you would not be able to get off the island alive. While at the institution Teddy soon discovers that not everything is as it seems and he could be the next one in danger while visiting and investigating this case. Shutter Island is proof that there are still great horror films being made today that are not remakes of other films and ones that have original ideas and are made to perfection. The script grabbed me almost instantly and it is not particularly an action packed film, rather more of a character study and a psychological horror film that keeps giving you clues and building up the suspense until the final moments of the film. This is one classy horror film with tons of atmosphere to the music, direction and sets to a wonderfully captivating and twist turning and fascinating story. Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Teddy gives one of his all time best performances here and shows us a man who has his own demons that he is facing and why he comes off the way he does and why solving the mystery of the island and institution is so important to him. The supporting actors all do a great job as well and add to our curiosity of the film and exactly how it will play out. This film reminded me a lot of the classic horror films where it doesn't really rely on a lot of brutal violence, or things jumping out at you, or loud noises to get you scared. This film does it by building an atmosphere what with a creepy and brooding musical score, well developed and mysterious characters and by the script which keeps adding more and more for us to digest and piece together until we really want to see what happens at the end. The thrills come from watching these characters (Teddy in particular) in torment and wrestling with his personal problems and things that could easily make, or break this case for him and his strong determination to see it to the end and unravel what he thinks the mystery of the island is. Teddy's character alone is fascinating to watch all by itself because of DiCaprio's great performance and by how many layers there are to this character. Through the film we see things from Teddy's past that may seem insignificant at first, but in the end you will see that everything is in here for a reason and it all sort of makes sense at the end. It is one of those films that you will have to interpret in your own way and I appreciated that about the film as well. And as I was saying watching Teddy and his past traumas and the things that have brought him to be the man he is now, one with little patience and quite aggressive and how he slowly starts to get worse as the film goes on is absolutely fascinating to watch, again from DiCaprio's great performance and the wonderful material he was given to work with. I sat in utter awe of this film and what I was watching before me because I got so into the plot, the characters and wondering what would happen, that I could not take my view anywhere else other than on the screen. The audience I viewed the film with seemed to have the same fascination as I did because there have not been too many times when I have sat in a completely full theatre and to have complete silence from the audience the whole way through. Whether they all liked the film as much as I did, I do not know. However it did keep their interest and must have fascinated them in one way, or other and had some type of effect on them. Many will unfortunately, probably come into this film hoping for a violent and terrifying film like a lot of the films that come out today in the horror genre. This is one of the better ones that relies on an original and fascinating script, lots of atmosphere to build the mood and suspense of the film and great actors delivering great performances from top notch material. All the elements of a great horror film are here and they all play out beautifully. This is the first film I have seen of 2010 and I already know that it will be among my favourites of this year by the time it is over. A great film worth seeing for fans of horror, thrillers or just good psychological character studies. Heavily recommended.",

From the very first scene, there's a feeling of suspense, fear, foreboding and even dread. There's something about this island. We know that, of course, but for a movie to strike that tone from its very beginning is unusual to say the least. And that feel is never really abandoned. It stays with the viewer from beginning to end - and that's absolutely essential, because for about three quarters of the movie I was feeling a bit lost. The story wasn't making any sense; there seemed to be too many different things going on inside Daniels' head - from the liberation of Dachau to the death of his wife to some suspected connection with the Red Scare to trying to piece together the mystery of this woman who's gone missing from a facility for the criminally insane, even though there was no way for her to escape and nowhere for her to go if she did. That island setting was brilliantly used by Martin Scorsese, and the scenes filmed inside ""C"" Block are positively claustrophobic. For all the mystery involved with that, though, the movie suddenly comes into clear focus the moment at which Daniels encounters Dr. Cawley in the lighthouse. At that moment (even before the twist was formally revealed) I knew what was happening, and yet - a sense of uncertainty still remains. Is there going to be a double twist?

His decision to do this is comparable to his doing ""Age of Innocence"" or ""Cape Fear"" – it is a bit out of his comfort zone. But this is why Scorsese is a great director. As accomplished and critically acclaimed as he is, he is not afraid to push boundaries and attempt to tell a story in a different way, or even to work in an almost completely different genre, than he has before-and while perhaps ""The Age of Innocence"" is not his best work, it was not terrible, reminding us again how well-versed in films, and also how talented, he is.

Leo is very tense, actually a walking bundle of nerves, and gets to play convincingly his character, a really difficult task. A few absurd scenes are some of the movie's best, also due to Scorsese using subtle special effects to disorient the viewer. There's also a twist allowing to catch the breath breath and the overall story feels real, in addition to making sense.

I hoped for a well made film, sound, like Scorsese should be able to make, but it was one big disappointment. Yesterday i saw Crazy Love, the contrasts between these 2 movies couldn't be bigger. I hope next time: better time!",

And then comes the last 10 or so minutes of the movie, revealing basically everything was in our main character's head. Seriously, I kept hoping this was just a final ""maybe it isn't!"" twist and there would be another one, like in the Lazarus Project, but nope. It was disappointing. The conspiracy story was far, far more interesting than the real ending about a run-of-the-mill ""dead wife and kid"" past of the protagonist. Maybe I am spoiled with having thrillers with interesting twists, or because I prefer the strange to the mundane, but ending it all on Ben Kingsley shaking his head and saying the treatment was not a success was one of my biggest annoyances that year.",

It strings you along so many different paths that guessing how the film ends is nearly impossible. While watching the film, however, nothing really made sense until the last twenty minutes or so. Between Teddy's hallucinations and what's transpiring on the island, it's almost exhausting trying to grasp what's actually happening in the film and what's occurring in Teddy's head. The finale to The Departed, another Martin Scorsese/ Leonardo DiCaprio pairing, was (and still is) one of the most talked about endings when it comes to recent films. Shutter Island doesn't necessarily top The Departed, but is along the same lines. Its ending gives new meaning to at least one repeat viewing of the film. no denying that I've been a fan of Martin Scorsese's films for quite some time. Films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, and Gangs of New York are prime examples of some of the best films ever. I can't say the same about Leonardo DiCaprio. While I can't argue the fact that I enjoy quite a few films he's been in, he didn't really do anything for me as an actor. I didn't see this potential or charisma that everyone else seemed to.

My first impression with each new film since Goodfellas has been that its lesser Scorcese. He appears to have fallen from the lofty standards he set early in his career. The themes of the film do not have the gravitas one expects of a Scorcese film etc. On first viewing, I felt that way about both Gangs of New York and The Departed.

363,15 March 2010,jpschapira,8, A freakin' nightmare,"For all the movies we've seen this last decade about men with mental problems, delusions and so on, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is the first one that doesn't try to be too cool and modern. In fact, it inhabits its time so well, that if it weren't for some of the main character's recurrent dreams, we could easily think it's happening in this time and age. But the year is 1954, and there's still this little contradiction. Scorsese, a wise and experienced director, doesn't intend to make a period piece in which we should feel 'as if we were in 1954'. No. Because this is the adaptation of a novel, and because he knows cinema and genres like few out there, he gives U.S Marshals Teddy (Leo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) a couple of film-noir type classy hats when we first meet them and also charges the film with a musical feeling that, without being to invasive, takes us back to classic eras. However, the truth is that he is just plain interested in setting the premises for a freaking nightmare; and that's an idea that ultimately makes him and the movie more modern than anyone else.",

I was really invested in the story and its characters. The expectations remained high for the whole time, as I wanted to see how this tense story would conclude. I really do not want to spoil it, because this is a film that is worth discovering completely on your own, so you can have the best possible experience. Needless to say that the acting was excellent and this is for sure one of DiCaprio's best interpretations, and in my perspective this is the movie that should have granted him the Oscar years ago.

It turns out Daniels has an ulterior motive for visiting the island; he believes that the man responsible for killing his wife is incarcerated there but his name appears on none of the patient lists something he sees as further evidence of something wrong going on. The more he searches the more convinced he is and starts to believe that he won't be allowed to leave the island because of what he has discovered.

The storyline and plot were intriguing and it definitely plays with your mind. The beginning was very moving, the acting phenomenal, and the end left little room for loopholes as it brought full circle everything that happened throughout the movie. HOWEVER, the middle of the movie, the largest part, was a bit slow. The excessive use of dream sequences was particularly tedious. Perhaps I was disappointed because the movie was advertised as a horror film, when it really is more of a drama. I wouldn't even say it's a thriller, as most scenes are not really ""scary"" but more disturbing. Finally, what most likely will determine how you feel about this movie is whether you figure out the end about 20 minutes into the movie. I'm not one of those egotistical morons who go to movies so they can try and figure out the end before everybody else, but I had a pretty good notion of where this movie was going early on. So as a word of caution if you are used to reading stories from old horror masters like H.P Lovecraft or are an Alfred Hitchcock enthusiast this movie is going to be pretty obvious to you.

So, all the elements were there but they just didn't come together, the twist was easily figured early in the movie and then the rest was just boring filler while you waited for him to ""get it.""

I mean, what are his real accomplishments besides upping the violence quotient in every film he makes and telling us that Italians are murderers and Mafiosi with colourful speech patterns and creative ways of killing the people who show them disrespect and even the people they love?

466,29 February 2012,johnnyboyz,7, Odd little Cast Away-Invasion of the Body Snatchers mash up which works a lot better than it has any right to.,"Is Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island a police procedural thriller? A horror movie? Is it a film about someone offered the chance to this time uncover (and thus save) those being held against their will by an exterior force seemingly ungoverned by the rest of a broader representation of a community? Well, yes and no and then yes again and then no and then........well, to go on would be to reveal too much. Rest assured, the film is deceptively simplistic but at the same time non-cryptically complicated – or should that be deceptively complicated and non-cryptically simplistic? It is a film about a lead plunged into a situation that sees him with the capability to help a batch of helpless people trapped on the titular Shutter Island who're falling victim to all manner of sordidness, this at a time when recent demons of having stumbled across a Nazi concentration camp long after it was too late to do anything still resonate. At least, for the most part it is a film about this – irregardless of the bumpy, rickety road full of holes and lumps Scorsese takes us down, Shutter Island suffices as a piece of drama you're be hard pressed not to recommend.",

470,7 February 2019,SofiCastle,8, The horror,"Shutter Island made me look up the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. What a dive into insanity that was. In the film, it is supposed to explain Ted's PTSD. But in reality, it is there to remind us that insanity is in everyone. The SS that killed all those people and let them rot right next to them, living with decaying corpses and just waiting for the Americans.. And the soldiers who snapped and executed them. After reading about all that, I was so upset I couldn't go on watching the film.
So I got back to it on a different time. This was a good film. Contrary to what a lot of commentators seem to regret, this was not designed as a cheap thrills movie with a forced twist plot that was supposed to catch us unaware. Ten minutes in, we do begin to suspect Teddy is, in fact, a patient. So what. I mean, that was not the point, people. Ted (or Andrew) was a good man, a war hero, an all American golden boy who got traumatized so bad in the war that he lost it; he started drinking, neglected his wife and refused to see she needed help, thus exposing his kids to inevitable danger. I can totally see why a psychiatrist with progressive ideas would go to great lengths to try and help this kind of man. A good man fighting his self imposed delusions. Whether this whole charade could have helped, I have no idea - I am no psychiatrist. However, I find it incredible that so many commentators would actually prefer to see a film in which Ted's delusions would be true: the Nazi psychiatrist conducting experiments on criminally insane prisoners held in Bedlam-like conditions in a weird fortress on a cut-off island. Not to mention those who flaunt their knowledge of German expressionism by acting offended because The cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a silent film from 1920, also had this idea of a delusional young mental patient. That film is excellent, the twist plot is amazing if you think it was done a hundred years ago, but Shutter Island is simply not about that. This is a film on trauma.",

However, this film suffers from being too boring and predictable. I don't want to spoil anything, but I guessed the ending before I even saw the movie. I wasn't expecting such an underwhelming and utterly unsurprising ending with a Scorsese picture. Now, the visuals in this film are downright beautiful, with certain images that will stay in your head for quite some time.

An imaginative director, wonderful location and sets, actors that are never less than competent and sometimes a lot better (I was particularly struck by Ruffalo, an actor I've not previously taken notice of). There is a promising premise – an Alcatraz of Hannibal Lecters, the island asylum where they send everyone that nobody else wants or can cope with. And potentially great themes; the excesses of American psychiatry in the early fifties, the disputes between the advocates of surgery, the advocates of medication, and the advocates of therapy. And something even darker still, something touching on the character of evil (or what we call evil) itself. Can someone be driven mad simply by witnessing too much? But the film bungles it, horribly. And it's not too hard to work out why. The script just isn't good enough. Actually, not even the script; the plot is not good enough.

The trailers and all the hype concerning this movie, lead the public to believe that it would be worth seeing. With which, I firmly disagree. I could tell you all the reasons, but quite frankly I feel I have wasted enough time on this movie by even watching it. I will tell you that the movie was predictable, depressing, and in very bad taste. It reminded me of one of those old black & white foreign flicks that wreak of morbidity and extremely bad taste. If you like that sort of thing, then by all means go see it. However, if you do not enjoy wasting your time on rubbish flicks,then don't waste your time on this one. I have always personally liked Leonardo, but I think I must chalk this one down as one of his worst acting role ever. Sorry Leo, just giving it to you straight. Of course there will always be someone of notoriety who will swear that the flick is fantastic. Let's be honest. There will be a lot of people that will go along with that. Simply because they think it impresses people to agree with someone of importance. However, people that are easily led around by their noses, rarely make any impressions ...other than being moronic idiots that cannot think for themselves. Needless-to say, I have this extremely annoying habit of thinking for myself, and this movie was absolute rubbish, from start to finish, no matter how many expert reviews to the contrary. Of course, you can always go see it for yourself. If you have time to waste ...why not. Now, I must apologize for wasting your time, as well as my own, to write this ridiculously lengthy way to say the movie was rubbish. However, IMDb does not allow us to just write a 'few' words. If a review does not contain enough words, then you will be prohibited from submitting it.

""But, but, but the twist at the end"". Yeah, the twist. It's foreseeable for at least an hour. I never read the novel but would judge it's simply not movie material.

Very well produced in all areas, and the attention to period detail is exceptionally well done. But I have to agree with the critics on this one, although it is good, it is not up with most Scorsese films, it is distant emotionally and has one too many dream fantasy sequences for it's own good. The two hour and eighteen minute length is a bit excessive and unnecessary. Still, along the way there is much to entertain.",
490,27 February 2010,PWNYCNY,7, Better than mediocre but not great.,"It's hard to knock a movie with a good ending even if the bulk of the movie stinks, which is case for this over-hyped thriller. Much of the movie is exceedingly underwhelming and at times outright boring. The gloomy sets, the hackneyed acting, the dumb dialog all combine to make the first two-thirds of this movie quite bland, the stuff that makes the eyelids feel heavy as you are sinking into slumber-land. Yet something amazing happens. The movie actually turns itself around and becomes an engaging and exciting cinematic event, marked by strong acting by Leonardo Di Caprio as his confused character struggles to unravel the riddle of his very identity. How this movie manages to avoid creative oblivion is fascinating. Somewhere, some how, the director must have realized that he had to turn this movie around to avoid flop-ville. Two problems with the movie is that the sinister characters aren't really all that sinister and that the setting, a psychiatric hospital is, well, a psychiatric hospital. One must remember that when a story is based in a hospital, drama can be taken just so far because along with the doctors and nurses who interact with patients, there is also a virtual army of clerks, housekeepers, accountants and other support staff who actually keep the hospital running. So when watching Shutter Island, one should ask: who is paying the bills, mopping the floor, dealing with account payable and receivables and maintaining the phones? They have a story too but once again it goes untold.",

Having a patient who thought of himself as a state Marshall trying to find a woman who has a name much like his dead daughter. The twists and turns in this film made me think that the staff of shutter island were the patients portraying themselves as the staff. Gaurds, orderlies, nurses, even Ben Kingsley as the head director of the asylum. But what got me going was the fact that a few of DiCaprio's past memories kept clashing within himself giving away small clues which made re-think the story altogether. I loved how Martin used some very exquisite Avante Garde' memory flashbacks to the second world war or his home, being with his wife. But the fact that made me think he was the patient, was the good Doctor Rachel Solondez. When he found her in a cave who was portrayed by just a nurse. This was what done it, when she started to explain the procedures of psychotropic drugs being used on patients. And how using orbital lobotomies to sullen the insane people so they can be controlled better, how she explained this was too factual almost as if she was telling him too much in detail. And also the fact that the staff on the island tried to keep away from the caves because of the so called poison ivy or other plant life. This is pretty much a lame excuse for finding someone on a remote island.

501,16 September 2010,estebangonzalez10,8, Scorsese + Di Caprio = Must See,"¨Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man? ¨ Shutter Island has all the right ingredients for everyone to enjoy this movie. First of all, it is directed by Martin Scorsese, the guy who brought us such masterpieces as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors and he is always trying different genres, being original, standing out, but with his classic trademark direction in every film. This time he brings us this dark suspense thriller that traps us from the very beginning and hooks our attention up to the very end. Shutter Island is based on Dennis Lehanes's novel of the same name. His previous two novels, Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone have also been made into feature films, and are among my favorite movies, especially the first one. If those two names alone are not enough for you to want to go see this film, then perhaps this might convince you: Leonardo Di Caprio, Mark Ruffalo, and Ben Kingsley star in this thriller and give great performances. I did not have to see the trailer to know that I wanted to watch this film because I really admire each of the people involved in making Shutter Island. The weakest link perhaps is the screenplay writer Laeta Kalogridis who wrote Alexander and Pathfinder, two movies that bombed in the box office. The script does have its flaws, but the performances and the direction are what stand out in this dark thriller. The atmosphere and the mystery that Scorsese masterfully creates are worth the ticket price plus some really good performances from the lead characters make this a very enjoyable movie experience. This is not one of Scorsese's best films, but that does not mean it is a bad movie either. Scorsese knows how to make movies and he does not fail with Shutter Island although he did take a huge risk with this film.",

Leonardo Dicaprio gives one of best performances in this film, along with good performances from Ben Kingsley, Michelle Willams, Jackie Earle Haley and Mark Ruffalo. The script is complicated, well written, and after a second viewing, makes you realize that clues were left behind all along. But the best thing about this film is its atmosphere. The island is designed in an absolute perfect way. With telling Cinematography and symbolism sprinkled across its entirety. The films editing and sound are very commendable as well. The film contains a lot of symbolism. The fire and water complex, and the multiple subtle hints of dialogue and action throughout. The film's score is brillant. I didn't even know that ""On The Nature Of Daylight"", was originally from this film. This film creates a grand illusion to the protagonist and the viewer. For most of the film, you are left believing in a fake character created by a real person. The viewer is just like Andrew in the fact that the world around them (the film) is set up, staged, and an elaborate attempt to get them to accept their doing and regain sanity. I'll have to watch this film more times to get every context clue. Spoiler Alert: Andrew killed his wife after she killed his kids. He was sent there, and created a fake U.S. Marshal named Teddy Daniels, and created the disappearance of Rachel to have something to investigate. He is also looking for Andrew Laeddis. The man he says killed his wife, when it was actual him. In ""reality"", he was doing this to take the blame and guilt from himself, and not face reality. The doctors played along, and set up the entire story. He begins to believe that he was set it up by the Doctors, and that this place was a Nazi brain experimental camp, and begins to hallucinate. He eventually finds out about the scheme, and this is the second time its happend. In fact all of the dreams and nightmares he have, feature a girl saying save me, who we first belive to a jew prisoner, but is actually his daughter. He wakes up and appears to have accepted reality, but later, it is revealed that he hasnt, or has he. He walks off, presumably getting a lobotomy, so his memory and feeling will be evaporated. This is the way I interpret this.He has accepted what he has done, but cant live with it, so he pretends to still be Teddy, in order to get his brain washed. Basically, his self dies without having killed anymore people. Terrific film, haunting, disturbing, thrilling, perplexing and a reality mind bender. ""we have the ability to deny reality even when it staring right back at it us, we always want to hold to what we want to be true."" The denial of reality, the creation of blame on someone else, the guilt and the trauma from killing or doing something or someone you cant get rid of that feeling.

And Michelle Williams is good too, you can hardly tell she's even acting, it all just seems so natural. Ben Kingsley plays his role very well. The script is well written and it keeps you very invested the entire way through. The visuals in the film also contribute to the eerie/creepy feeling the whole movie gives the audience. This feeling is what makes you want to keep watching, this is NOT a film that anyone will be checking the time during. The movie is kind of long but you never feel like it's slow or dragging, they make every minute count. When you put the awesome visuals, impeccable dialogue, and great masterful acting all together, it makes for a great film, course when has Martin Scorsese ever disappointed? His directing is very precise and very careful. If you like scary movies, I think you'll enjoy this one, as long as you like scary movies that give you a bit of a challenge, ones that are more then just cheap slashers. On the other hand, if you just want a piece of escapist entertainment, something simple like a Friday the 13th, then try something else. I 100% suggest this film!

511,13 November 2010,ptb-8,8," yes, it was a dark and stormy night...","SHUTTER ISLAND is visually one of the most fascinating and compelling films I have ever seen. The eerie Gothic visuals and sodden hospital prison discomfort, lashing rain, wet rocks, cruel sea etc are ingredients that have the viewer really descending into the movie with great interest. Scene after scene is just visually great. However, I have come away with a very dissatisfied feeling about the story denouement and the graphic violence and distressing scenes involving children. With such a rich palette of visuals to celebrate, again Scorscese overdoes the mass murder. For me it was revolting, it yanked me from my enjoyment of the story and the film so greatly that it was actually irritating. One mass murder scene in a concentration camp is just a spandau ballet death gimmick and is really disgusting Tarantino level visual atrocity. The graphic deaths of some children are so meticulously displayed at great length that it is so upsetting that I really mostly felt anger towards the film maker instead of being more immersed in the storyline. Overall it is a fascinating topic and the subplots of WW2 liberation and the trauma from the frontline of day one liberation are excellent plot lines with disturbing results. SHUTTER ISLAND might be a better watch the second and third time around and I hope I can plunge more into it's Gothic hospital cyclone of fear and hallucination more. I want so to really embrace this film. I am just so sick of Scorcese's irritating desire to whack us with atrocity visuals when it need not be so explicit. Anyone who loves THE WICKER MAN (1973 version) and LA CONFIDENTIAL and THE INNOCENTS and THE SIXTH SENSE will get a terrific charge from the art direction and set design and Val Lewton style RKO noir imagery. Again Leonardo displays his remarkable talent for really being the character. He is absolutely perfect. SHUTTER ISLAND like CASINO before is flawed by the Scorcese atrocity excess but redeemed by the fantastic tech qualities and acting.",

515,27 February 2010,Monotreme02,8, Much more than just an atmospheric psychological thriller,"Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors to have ever emerged in the history of film, and it is a joyous miracle that such a legend is still working today. Not only that, but these last few years Scorsese has really reached the peak of his career: he finally won an Oscar and his last few movies have been the most financially successful of his entire career. As a direct result of his legendary status and lengthy career, Scorsese has definitely earned the right to make whatever movies he wants to – If he shot excrement for an hour-and-a-half I would probably watch it. Luckily for us, though, his advanced years and many films, some of which are masterpieces of modern cinema, have not hampered or decreased the quality of his film-making in any way – in fact, his last few films were made with uncharacteristic energy and vitality for a director nearing his 70th birthday. His latest film, Shutter Island – his first narrative feature since his Oscar win for The Departed four years ago – is perhaps a bit of a departure from his usual fare and style. But it is still undeniably a Scorsese picture, as it transcends its genre and features many of the characteristics that identify his previous films. It's just a little harder to find them this time.",
516,27 November 2019,truemythmedia,10, The Dark Side of Scorsese,"Shutter Island may not be Scorsese's magnum opus but it is certainly a refreshing change of pace for the director, showing us that he is capable of just about anything behind the camera, giving the audience an unrestrained, thrilling crime story, with just enough horror elements to leave goosebumps during the dark scenes. The social commentary on mental illness isn't just important, it's essential and still has a lot to say a decade later, and blends together perfectly with the crime story being played out. While it's not exactly scary, Shutter Island can be deeply disturbing with its subject matter, with scenes and imagery that will haunt viewers long after the end credits. The performances are top notch as we come to expect from Scorsese, DiCaprio once again transforming into his character, becoming nearly unrecognizable, just watch his facial movements when Kingsley's character reveals the big twist in the lighthouse, it's real and raw acting, solidifying Leo as one of the greats of this generation.

The performances are uniformly excellent, too. What I want to address are the critics - some respected and erudite - who seem to feel that any shifting of a necessarily complex tale at the end is a 'cheat'. Trust me - SI brings it all home and almost exactly right. So too do these same critics love to have fun with Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow playing, it seems, any roles at all. Reviews have had much fun with Kingsley's mysterious persona, and Von Sydow's austere presence. This is garbage. Both men never overplay, certainly not here, and deliver top work.

I know Scorcese left it open for a reason which makes all the more brilliant but I suspect the book would lean more toward one direction than the other instead of remaining neutral like the film.

If you write down 5 guesses as to what the twist is, chances are you'll get it right. It looks good, and Scorsese's talent does allow for some more memorable artistic moments, such as the dream sequences, but this could have been made for television.

569,30 July 2012,thewillt08,8, Scorsese blows my mind,"Shutter Island was a mind blowing experience to say the least. Twists and turns in the story kept me guessing and this film had a lot of strengths like the story, directing, acting, character development, plot twists, and music. Yes, music. Music is the most underrated part of a movie. Music can make a movie and in Shutter Island the music was scary and it fit perfectly. It was suspenseful and appropriate. Leo DiCaprio did his usual fantastic job acting but his character was one a member of the audience could love and rout for. I felt sorry for his character and thought his experience was tragic. His acting was commendable starting as a skeptic marshal. His witty comments towards patients and psychology fit his character. Eventually he became obsessed and crazier as the film went on. Leo played a crazy man perfectly with the shaking and paranoia. Scorsese did an awesome job keeping the audience guessing and a little puzzled as to what was going on. That is a positive and a negative. Confused viewers are never good and could turn them away from the movie but it made me more curious to see what was going to happen. After seeing the movie twice you notice hints and clues to the ending result and that is brilliant. Little Easter eggs that make you feel foolish for not noticing the first time. The 1st dream is probably the most important scene in the film. It gives everything away but portrays it so you think what the director wants you to think and it works perfectly. That was the best part of the movie. You thought you knew what was going on and you thought you figured it out then it turned around and you are back at the beginning. The ending to the movie is very open-ended and I usually hate open ended movies but this worked very well. I like for a director to pick an ending and stick to it but this move allows the audience to kind of choose their own ending. Is Teddy Daniels real? Is Dr. Cowley right and he is really Andrew Laeddis and criminally insane? These are questions the viewer can answer themselves. Anyone can think of an ending and be happy. Me personally, I think he did kill his wife and she did drown her children. Andrew Laeddis is real and he was on Shutter Island for two years as a patient. Did Teddy Daniels believe he was Teddy Daniels at the end? I don't think so. I think he didn't want to live with the fact that he killed his wife and live as a ""monster"" so he decided to die as Teddy Daniels, or a ""good man."" Rachel Solando was not a patient but I do believe the lady in the cave did exist and she was a doctor and everything she said was true. That's my opinion and I love the fact that I can put my own spin on the movie. Shutter Island was also realistic. This movie didn't literally happen but the ideas are true. Your mind can really shut out negative thoughts and drive u mentally insane. It is possible to think you are not in prison and are at home with your children. That is what made the story believable. Lobotomies actually happened and ""ghosts"" actually existed. The idea of medicine for the time period, new methods, and the power of the mind, all made this movie even better. Scorsese clearly did his homework for this movie nailing every detail. To fully understand this movie I had to watch it two or three times and fully pay attention. This is not a movie you casually watch, you have to commit to it to enjoy it and that hurts the movie. Overall I lived it and could watch it again and again and still be surprised what I find. I give this movie 8 out of 10.",

The latter just wanders around the island trying to reveal the conspiracy and meeting strange characters whose talk is puzzling and fractured. What's even worse, less than half way through it becomes apparent that the film can only resolve in one way enabling its used-to-death twist to enliven and assure viewers that the film makes no sense whatsoever.

Truth be told, this movie, if honestly rated by persons to whom neither Sorcese of Di Caprico names meant nothing, would have got a far lower rating.

624,2 May 2010,druid333-2,10," We Have Met The Enemy, And It's......","Let us all raise our glasses & toast Martin Scorsese. For well over fifty years now,he has made a mark for himself as a gifted film maker, film historian & a name in film preservation. Since his early student short films,leading to his first feature film, 'Who's That Knocking At My Door?' (which gave some fame to a then,unknown Harvey Keitel),to his work for Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock,as an assistant camera operator,as well as other projects. Now,he brings us his homage to Alfred Hitchcock in 'Shutter Island'. Shutter Island is about two federal Marshall's,investigating the disappearance of an inmate at a facility for the criminally insane,where the worst mental patients go, just off the coast of Massachusetts. Teddy Daniels,a crackerjack federal marshal,who is just gung ho about his job,has some serious issues of his own (he is a world war 2 veteran,with one too many skeletons in his closet for his own good),tries to crack the case,when he discovers something seriously wrong about the hospital/prison,where he is assigned,when he starts to poke around & makes some discoveries he probably should not have. Martin Scorsese directs from a screenplay written by Laeta Kalogrides (who also acts as one of the executive producers,among others),adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane. The film's atmospheric cinematography (which goes for a nice touch of expressionism)is by Robert Richardson,with some ""right on the money"" editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio,as Teddy Daniels,Mark Ruffalo as his partner,Chuck Aude,Ben Kingsley channels some genuine creepiness as Dr. Cawley,with Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer,Patrica Clarkson,Jackie Eare Haley (currently seen on screen as Freddy Krueger in the recent remake of 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'),and if that wasn't enough...the great Max Von Sydow (known for his work for Ingmar Bergman,among others),as Dr. Naehring. Despite the bad trailer for this film,which makes it look like your basic garden variety horror film,this is a shining example of a suspenseful thriller that one can sink their teeth into (and something Alfred Hitchcock would have approved of).

In one scene, a firing squad kills a crowd if Nazi officers and in another the corpse of a little girl is reanimated in a hallucination. The music is amazing and different themes are represented remarkably well by different recurring motifs in the soundtrack. It is extremely well written and the insanity faced by the protagonist is pulled off so well. I love the repetition of his wife's distinctive yellow dress. The end is marked by a twist that is both relieving and depressing. The setting is creative as well. This film can be a bit predictable and cliché, but in my opinion, not in a bad way. It's gratifying to have a plot point you guessed to actually come true. In conclusion, this film is a perfect mix of confusion and explanation which makes for a must watch.",

660,25 February 2010,perduesure,5, Predictable,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS The movie all in all wasn't terrible. For the first 15 minutes I thought that the twist ending might end up being that everyone on the island, including Leo, were already dead and ghosts. As bad as that ending sounds, it would have been 100 times better than the actual plot. 30 minutes into the movie i leaned over to my girlfriend and said Leo is insane and is a patient. She replied with yeah his wife probably killed his kids and then he killed her. My girlfriend never watches movies. She was spot on. The foreshadowing in this movie is way way way overdone and makes the entire plot, or lack thereof, pointless. Anyone with a 5th grade education knows whats going to happen at least by the 1 hour mark. The movie looks great, the sets are a little overdone but they do look the part. This movie would have been more compelling if it was actually about Nazi mind control experiments or even about an island full of ghosts. When the end of the movie finally comes around, after what seems like an eternity of glaringly obvious ""hints"" that Leo is insane, you figure out that he has overcome his delusions and is accepting his fate of having a lobotomy so that he can forget what he has done. The final line he delivers leaves no doubt that this is the outcome not that he is still insane. Worth a watch but by no means great.",

If you want something easy go and watch the latest Car Chase movie, you won't be disappointed. What do you get when a mad policeman is asked to investigate himself ? This was simply brilliant.

663,6 May 2019,PCT1970,9, Close The Shutters,"Scorsese helms a virtuous psychological thriller based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, special effects, score, editing and acting. The score and settings are as chilling as the characters and storyline. The entire cast delivers superlative performances. DiCaprio and Ruffalo command the screen. Their portrayals of two U.S. marshalls, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule compliment each other perfectly. The plot is flawless as the two marshalls attempt to solve the mystery of an escaped patient, Rachel Solando who is considered to be extremely dangerous, from an asylum for the criminally insane. The asylum is located on an island and after brief questioning the detectives seem satisfied to return to the mainland. However an impending storm forces the two to stay on the island longer than anticipated which leads to more investigating and the uncovering of a miscount in the number of patients at the asylum. There should be 67 patients. Now the genuine mystery begins. The detectives are assisted in their search for the patient with the help on Dr. Cawley, the Assistant Warden and the staff. As their investigation continues events begin to unfold that trigger Teddy's subconscious forcing him to face the reality of his past which involves a horrific incident involving his wife Dolores Chanal. The investigation takes the detectives to the darkest depths of the asylum and the island where Teddy encounters Andrew Laeddis. Teddy's focus is turned to a lighthouse just off shore after he locates Rachel. He believes sinister acts are occurring there. When he eventually reaches the lighthouse the real truth about patient 67 is revealed by Dr. Cawley. Teddy learns that Chuck isn't he who appears to be, and through the law of 4 that Rachael and Andrew are also not as they appear. The shocking truth behind Teddy's investigation is a psychological mind bender. The plot is thrilling, creepy, intense, inventive, sublime, violent, dark, ingenious and has a cathartic ending. There are many memorable scenes filled with symbolism. There are also many profound quotes in the film none better than in the last scene when Teddy asks, 'Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?'. That scene confused many film goers due to it's ambiguity. This viewer's opinion is the investigation is starting all over again and the revelations at the lighthouse proved to be ineffective. It may have helped that I read the novel. In fact I've read all of Lehane's novels many of which have been adapted to film. Scorsese has proven he is one of the best directors in all genre of film. To date this is his masterpiece for this genre.",

Some of the side characters were too fake for my taste. Leonardo DiCaprio was pretty good. I bet it was hard for him to play an older guy though since he always looks 18. Ben Kingsley was a joy. His character seemed so nice, but more in a creepy way and he really pulled it off. Mark Ruffalo was a good sidekick to DiCaprio. Michelle Williams seemed a little off though. Now when you get to the halfway point of the movie you will either figure out the twisted story or be confused out of your mind. I can see a lot of people getting frustrated with how this movie was written. I know it was made to be that way, but it really took some of the fun suspense out of the film.

DiCaprio's acting is uneven, like his Boston accent, and Ben Kingsley seems to be going through the motions only to collect a check and get back to real drama. Like much American cinema, you could experience this movie with your eyes closed. There is nearly constant dialog, explaining everything we ought to be able to figure out on our own. The shifts in point of view, from exclusively DiCaprio's for most of the film, to omniscient near the end, only emphasize that the producers didn't trust the audience's ability to understand what was happening, even though it's neither complicated nor original. To avoid any confusion, the flashbacks and delusions are clearly labeled. A few nights before viewing this film I watched ""A Prophet"" (""Un Prophète""), a French film about confinement and crime. It too used delusions, but relied upon the viewer to recognize what they were, rather than simply identifying them.

And Leonardo DiCaprio was a bad choice for this role. Nothing to do with his style or quality, but this role demands a different type of actor.",

686,27 August 2010,PippinInOz,10, Thought provoking: Foucault!,I have just watched the film last night on Foxtel and so pleased that I did! Only very disappointed that did not get my act together and see this on the big screen and would not pass up this opportunity if any of our Luna cinemas decide to show it again. Hint hint!,
687,4 October 2020,ayushparasar,7, Perhaps the most confusing film,"Well... I don't understand what I just saw... unable to put it in words...
I haven't watched a more confusing movie than this ever , in terms of plot twists.
Nonetheless the movie itself is shadowy, and the ominous music makes it a bit scary at times. Leonardo as usual is just brilliant, Mark Ruffalo is pretty good too and Ben Kingsley has done tremendous work!!
Recommended this movie if you're into thrillers and mystery !",
688,28 March 2010,kos-27,9, even better than the book,"Shutter island is a very good movie. It is visually striking, it is well casted and the story is told in a fascinating way, taking care of the the dynamic of the development as well as the message. You can watch it as pure entertainment and yet take something home with you to think about. The visuals are striking and the colors are exceptionally beautiful. The visions/hallucinations are intentionally treated by adding more color so they are more lively and intense than reality itself what actually is one of the important issues in the movie. I felt that the movie was well paced and I didn't think that there were made any mistakes in editing. Scorsese did everything aware of its purpose and certainly not as a result of accidental errors or sloppy work. The whole movie is shown from the perspective of the main protagonist and his point of view (or state of mind) bearing in mind that it isn't necessarily the truth. There was also a controversial debate on the musical score which I find fascinating and also absolutely well applied. This movie shouldn't be reduced to its plot twists or to compete who'll guess it first because it's so much more than that. The quality of this movie is that it can be interpreted in a lot of ways and people shouldn't fight about who's right. That's what makes a good movie – a lot of talk, a lot of ways to look at it and a lot of genres it can be put in. I personally will watch it again.",
689,18 December 2010,gudpaljoey-677-715384,9, Ingenious Portrayal of a Rare Psychiatric Disorder,"I am not a psychiatrist, but I think the Mr. Scorcese and Mr. DeCaprio have put on the screen a remarkable story of personality change resulting from denial. Today's shrinks might scoff at what the doctors were trying to accomplish, but remember that Shutter Island is fiction and set in the early 1950s, a time of much less sophistication in mental disorders and treatment. The way this film moves from reality to the unreal as the DeCaprio role requires is a magical bit of film making. There apparently is a lot of ambiguity for some, but after the viewing and the surprising and dramatic conclusion, I found that the picture didn't miss a beat in confirming that the patient, DeCaprio was brought from prison two years ago to the mental hospital for an experiment in treatment of one who had lost connection with reality because of the trauma and consequences of past violence on his wife and perhaps others within the walls of his prison. The experiment ends in failure as he's led from the hospital, to he boat and back to internment in prison, still a prisoner of his mental state. Congratulations to the director and Leonardo DeCaprio for a fine and thought provoking movie.",

I must admit, my problem with the movie is based solely on the actual story line, since I am able to recognize that the cinematography and Scorsese's ""Hitchcockian"" approach to the film are definitely its highlights. If you and I have anything in common, initially, you base whether or not you like a film on the script, the actual story being told, with the director's vision, their angle for telling the story, following close behind. Long story short, while I was able to see the positives while watching Shutter Island (the acting and the film's direction will not disappoint), I found the film to be predictable and just simply, nothing special at all.",

But, if you know anything about cinema, you already knew that. This film isn't a masterpiece, or a storyline we haven't seen before (think along the lines of Identity [2003]), what this film is, is a beautifully crafted thriller. If you enjoy thrillers, you will enjoy this movie, period. I'm not just referring to the twists and turns in the plot either. When you deal with Scorsese, you get quality, and this film is no different. The acting was phenomenal; DiCaprio, Rufallo, and Kinsley delivered, big time. This flick reads like a great novel, and yet, it refuses to take on that distinctive and predictable Hollywood style (that we have all too often been gratuitously subjected to.) In addition, this film has such a realistic quality to it, that never once did I feel as though I had been cheated out of my money. If anything, the previews for the film don't do it justice, they have promoted it as a ""scary movie"", and that couldn't be further from the truth. I can assure you that Mr. Scorsese isn't looking for the cheap ""Boo! I got you!"" moment. It's just simply not one of those kinds of movies. He realizes he is dealing with an intelligent audience, and thus, he provide us (the audience) with a clever intellectually stimulating film..",

From the ultra psychedelic dream visions to the blustery heart of the island itself, he uses eerier device possible to enrapture the audience in this camp Gothic hell. DiCaprio is on very good form, more vulnerable than in Revolutionary Road, more blistering than in The Departed - and he is ably supported by a stellar ensemble - featuring some great names...Kinglsey.

The ""twist"" is not only sitting in broad daylight, it's completely anti-logical. That leaves the audience with two-plus hours of Leo Dicaprio's secular character du jour - the grieving husband. We know that ugly separations have powered the actor's ascendency to box office king, but with a plot as broad as ""Shutter Island"", one would hope some of the heavy lifting could be done by an actual actress instead of just another sullen, scowling, sweaty Leo. Like ""Inception"", the movie is a fetish piece about men who recently discovered emotional responsibility. These are films that exist wholly in the mind of the scorned, whereby every other character is an obstacle for the hero. It makes for a thrilling screenplay and an utterly flat finished product. What's truly on display here is Thelma Schoonmaker's ability to make even the weakest of conceits a viable product. Too bad the only visible female influence here is behind the camera.",

I just couldn't keep my eyes off Dicaprio every time he was put with another character, how he reacted around them, what things he would say.

It tells the story about a mental institution where a patient has escaped and 2 US Marshalls have come to investigate. They find themselves not finding more answers but questions as they figure out how she escaped and who may have been involved. Early on you find out that Leo Dicaprio mainly took on this case as the man who set the fire who killed his wife is on the island and wants to confront him. In his mind you see him thinking about his wife and she gives him clues as to what he needs to do to find this missing person. The movie takes a crazy turn in the last bit as to what is real and what isn't. The twist in the end was awesome and made the whole film great.

746,24 May 2020,adeckofcards,8, Constant confusion,"Martin Scorsese ventured to tell an unusual story in his filmography with 'Shutter Island'.
The film tells how a man (played by Leonardo Dicaprio), who is a police officer, must investigate a patient's escape from a mentally ill asylum on a remote island. With this premise, Scorsese transports the viewer to a story that constantly changes between reality and dream, creating a dreamlike and disturbing atmosphere. Through this atmosphere and added to his usual mastery of directing, moments of absolute suspense are created and presents total confusion for the protagonist, which surpasses the screen when the same audience falls into confusion and uncertainty. So the entire film could be considered as an exercise by the director to generate such confusion.

748,15 April 2020,drmuhammedsamiduru,9, this movie should be watched to understand patient psychology.,A movie that connects and drags the viewer to the screen. The in-game play in the movie has been used successfully in telling the audience what healthy people look like through the eyes of sick people and added a mystery to the movie. This arouses curiosity in the audience and makes the audience more concentrated on the film. I liked the film in terms of psychological functionality by watching it through the eyes of a doctor.,
749,14 June 2010,rammstiengirl,2, Disappointment follows predictability,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I have to admit I was excited, I thought that Hollywood might have gone back to the good old psychological thrillers that I have grown to love. The trailer gave the impression of a sense of dread and suspense that looked set to follow through the entire movie. The trailer also set the scene for a film with twist and turns and frights round every corner. The only fight I got from this film as just how terrible it really was, the film tells the tale of two Federal Marshals that go to the mysterious Shutter Island in search of an escaped mental patient. So far so good right? That's what I thought. As the film progresses that main character Teddy Daniels , played by Titanic star Leonardo DiCapiro, dives deeper into the dark history that surrounds the Island and goes in search of the truth and uncovers a dark and sinister plot. Now I don't know about you but as soon as they stepped foot onto a Insane Asylum I started to have my doubts about this film and had pretty much guessed the ending. But I thought that I would give Mr Scorsese a chance to, as more mysteries are reviled to us it becomes clearer that the film is going to end just how I thought. This isn't helped by the fact that we get repeated flash back of his gory past in the army and the fact that he keeps seeing his dead wife, does exactly strike you as a sane man. With the mention of the lighthouse that is the apparent venue for grizzly and nasty experiments was the final ail in the coffin for me with this film. ",

Di Caprio's acting is as good as usual and the rest of the cast do pretty well ( Michelle Williams being the almost sad exception).The production values are high , still the film is not as convincing as it should/could have been. The element of surprise is somehow weakened by some elements that ""warn"" the experienced viewer of what will eventually folllow. The obvious of some observations or conclusions prevents you from really identify with the main character in his emotions and approach. In some scenes the characters appear pretentious or simplistic . The film is also ridden with many thriller/horror clichés. And is it just me or is it the case that some plot holes or loose ends are not covered/ answered sufficiently in the end?

A mystery isn't very mysterious when you know the outcome. I was interested and entertained, but not enthralled. Unfortunately, except for Ben Kingsley's perfect performance (as usual), over-acting ran rampant. That coupled with the heavy, melodramatic music punctuating the brooding backdrop of a mental asylum on a rocky island with a hurricane lashing its shores, it was more typical of a movie for audiences of the 1950's than 2010. Perhaps Scorcese wanted it that way since it was set in 1954. I found it a little over the top. If it had been toned down just a notch, I think I'd have given it at least an 8. The story was complex and compelling in its own right and handled pretty well; however, I wonder if the atmosphere got in the way a bit.",
760,21 February 2010,michael11391,10, One of Scorsese's best work & the best film of the year so far.,"Just saw it 30 minutes ago or so and I absolutely loved it. Martin Scorsese is one of the best and most intelligent directors of all-time and proved it once again in this, his new movie ""Shutter Island"". The movie is interesting, crazy-minded & creepy from beginning to end. Leo Dicaprio gives another Oscar-worthy performance here and it's one of his best performances of his career. The score is also Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is superb. Now, a lot of people thought coming in this was going to be a scary, horror film based on the previews. It is not, it is a psychological thriller that messes with your mind and keeps you guessing a lot. Shutter Island is an amazing achievement from Martin Scorsese who redefined the genre that Alfred Hitchcock created. Despite it's confusing, seemed forced ""twist"" ending that didn't work, Shutter Island is an instant thriller classic in my books. The movie should get nominated for Best Lead Actor Performance by Dicaprio, Cinematography & Score. Can Shutter Island not be forgotten by votersof Oscar chances for a year?",

This movie is full of incredible visuals, and is also full of shocking moments that kept me engrossed. The best part of this movie was Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. He gives such a layered performance as someone slowly losing his sanity(or gaining it back). Overall, a very well made movie from Scorsese.",

Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was phenomenal, and he truly brought his character, US Marshal Teddy Daniels, to life. I found myself completely immersed in the story, following Daniels' journey as he delved deeper into the mysteries of the island and its inhabitants. The setting of Shutter Island was both beautiful and haunting, and the way the cinematography captured the island's eerie atmosphere was truly impressive. The soundtrack was equally chilling, adding an extra layer of suspense to the film. YES Shutter Island is a must-see for anyone who loves a good psychological thriller.

766,25 February 2010,barron_oussoff,9, Fear and Loathing on Shutter Island,"As with many other Scorsese films, you must watch this film accurately and actively from the beginning to the end, preferably in the movie theater, by yourself, alone. Then, you will start to feel the intended magic of this film. I can sit here and talk about great acting in the movie, great cinematography, great direction, but I will leave it to other reviewers. The greatest part of the film is that each piece of the movie is constructed in a way to bend and manipulate your mind, and at the end, after all twists and turns, your mind is completely confused, unwilling to interpret further, and its only objective becomes to question the sanity of its beholder. When you drive home, and you feel that you just got released from the asylum and you actively questioning your state of mental health while observing fellow car drivers for the signs of deception, lunacy, and yet again deception, you kind of know that the movie succeeded and provided a great cinematic experience. As for other reviewers, who question the stability of this movie by asking why, if being this good, it wasn't released in December for 2009 Oscars, I have a simple explanation, why release it in December and be nominated and go home empty handed, after the magician Mr. Cameron rightly takes all the awards, if you can release the film in February, go for 2010 Oscars, and have a greater probability at winning a few awards. As always, very clever move from Mr. Scorsese. Don't miss this one, it Will make you ""insane"" for at least 2 1/2 hours....guaranteed.",

It turned out that everything was a kind of cooperation, a kind of illusion and a kind of lie. But what puzzled me was what happened to the ""real"" Rachel solando I met in the cave? That lighthouse seems to be doing brain surgery, and that's all true. However, Leonardo DiCaprio's last sentence is thought-provoking: ""which would be worth?

The idea of Shutter Island is the same as Alcatraz, and it makes for a very interesting concept. Even if the inmates escape from their cell, they are still in prison. You can only leave Shutter Island if the guards allow it. The setting of the prison itself is what makes this film worthwhile. With this in mind I believe Shutter Island would have been better if Scorsese had focused more on the history of the island instead of on the mind of the main character.",

Various scenes jump the protagonist from one location to another with any real motivation and poor, unrealistic transition. To lay the jumble of feelings and memories presented by the characters as simply mental illness is also inconsistent with realism. Finally, no real satisfaction comes from the story ending, not that it had to be happy, but at least worthy of the buildup generated by the story line. A better treatment of this material would contain more background of the protagonist as the story winds down to its conclusion.

784,4 November 2010,Jona1988,7, In the end a good story but still flawed film.,"With names like Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio in the credits I felt like this could and should be a great film. And the beginning of Shutter Island immediately put my hopes up even higher. It set the tone of a crime thriller set some time ago. But after a while I began feeling somewhat uncertain about it. The film continues slow and doesn't really take off. The tone given by the atmosphere and music manage well the sense of mystery but still I don't sit at the edge as one would have thought. Suspense is something that is totally lacking in this film. A lot of dialogue and the story moves forward so things are happening but it still doesn't really capture my attention in the way one had hoped and thought it would. The acting is good but I somehow feel Leonardo DiCaprio isn't perfect in the lead, nothing wrong with his performance but he doesn't fit the character. The actors who really steal the show are Sir Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, they are simply brilliant in all their scenes. However I feel the characters in this film are a bit wooden and hard to relate with. That the viewer doesn't feel much for the characters is a big weakness for a film. But the acting and directing is good so maybe the script is to blame. This brings me to the dialogue which at some parts feel pretty poor and some things that the characters say seem really awkward. The film gets better towards the end when some more interesting things start to happen. There are some strange twists and gets somewhat hard to keep up. The ending resolves some of the things that were set up but also asks some new questions which are left to the viewer to figure out how hold together. But this isn't a bad thing absolutely not, I felt the movie lifts at the end to become alright entertainment. Some surprising twist takes the plot away from any thriller type movie.",

Most people had difficulties in life; furthermore, some of them couldn't handle the stress after a while. Teddy is the protagonist of this movie and he couldn't get over his children at the break point. From my point of view, the movie reveals many facts about schizophrenia.
First of all, repression is emphasized during movie. He tried to clean his bad memories but he couldn't be successful.
Secondly, Teddy denies every fact especially his real name, Andrew Laeddis. Indeed, his surname, ""Denials"" is the name of a prophet who interprets dreams. The movie is full wit denials. ""Shutter"" also refers to a closed mind to realities.
Thirdly, Teddy reflects his real identity to another character, Andrew Laeddis. He needed projection of his crimes to a new person.
Fourth, Teddy also needed displacement about his life at the island. He always assumed that he was there in order to investigate.
Fifth, Teddy couldn't handle his loss and his crime so he was in regression which resulted as schizophrenia.
Sixth, Teddy acts as if he was a marshal who was sent in order to investigate an escape from the hospital. Indeed, his duty is an sublimation which is acceptable by any resident of island.

807,8 July 2010,TreyLovesMovies,8, The chilling journey to Shutter Island is one worth taking.,"Martin Scorsese is one of the last living legends of film-making. His latest offering Shutter Island once again stars his current muse Leonardo DiCaprio and continues their tradition of creating quality cinema together. Though the film doesn't reach high tier Scorsese, this effective mystery story proves that the director is still very much a master of his craft.",

809,21 February 2010,legadillo,4, A little help,"It wasn't a fair movie. Teddy's reality was absolutely unambiguous until the very end. We saw him hallucinating even when he didn't: when the ""doctor"" wakes him up in the cave. That's cheating. If you're going to twist the end completely around, there has to be some clue. You can bury it and hope the viewers miss it, but there should be a clue that the narrator is unreliable. Like in the 6th Sense. You go back through the 6th Sense and notice that it's never inconsistent; no one but the boy ever speaks to the lead character; there's no overlap. If you're clever enough, you can guess the end. Shutter Island offers no clues and it's not consistent, so that the end comes out of left field, and that's not fair.",

What makes this film special compared to his earlier work is that he connects with audience psychologically (arguably) better than any of them. Nowadays, we can always tell what going to happen in horror movies easily based on the typical movie clichés like the cheesy music and the helpless character in a scary background where the kill can be predicted. Scorsese takes it up a notch and creates the right kind of chill we should feel in such situations.",

It gradually builds over the first 90% of the movie, culminating in the single great revelation of our protagonist's identity. It's a twist but not an annoying late-in-movie transformation of the plot. It feels more like when you're stumbling over a riddle and someone just tells you the answer. It is both satisfying and shocking.",
813,28 February 2010,gregyolen,8," SHUTTER ISLAND: a smart, sneaky meditation on the causes & effects of violence...","Scorsese is far from home off the Massachusetts coast, but he's not gone far thematically, and SHUTTER ISLAND is actually a refreshing return to self-reflection, following the amoral romp THE DEPARTED, a film full of highly-entertaining kills, with a minimum of meditation on them. In this asylum for the criminally insane, however, Marty's found himself an ideal setting for a study of the brutality that's defined his career. Is violence the ultimate logic – a gift from God himself – as one character puts it? Or is violence simply madness – and are all those who commit it, if they're not mad already, driven irreversibly mad by it? It's a potent question, and one the director addresses here with care, if not subtlety...",

823,13 March 2010,mannin11,6," great director, great actors but....","Did anyone see the movie Hide and Seek, in which Robert de Niro is the main suspect in a bloody murder and in the end he actually turns out to be the murderer? Or Secret Window in which Johnny Depp is terrorized by a prowler at his cabin in the woods and in the end there isn't one and it turns out to be Johnny Depp himself? Well, welcome to Shutter Island. No matter how hard one tries to suspend one's disbelief with this movie, there inevitably comes a point when it's just all too convoluted for words and the story falls apart. If this viewer had been watching it at home he would have put his foot through the screen at the ending. No question Scorsese is a master of cinema, no question there is enormous talent at work in the acting department and no question a ton of money was poured into this project. But the story begins to slide midway, everything clicks into place and all one can do is hope one's suspicions are wrong. Unfortunately, for all the red herrings, it isn't hard to work out. When the twist to the story is finally revealed all one can think is, ""Yeah, right. As if."" Quality film-making at work here and Scorsese manipulates like the master he is, but if only the damn story wasn't so unbelievable when it comes down to it.",

Someone else said it ripped off Dr Caligari, maybe. Di Caprio proves once again what a superb actor he is, this coming from a guy who hated him in Titanic for being just another pretty face. I actually liked the ending, it does leave you thinking about some different possibilities. I saw this when tired, and semi-dozed off in a couple of places, but even if not tired I would have felt this was overlong, maybe it was me, because i knew what was going on, but I think 20 minutes of flashbacks and chasing and what not could have been edited out to make it much more snappy !!!

829,16 September 2020,AnAverageNerd,9, A truly gripping story,I will start this review off by saying that i had the main twist of this film spoilt for me prior to watching. Yet I have rated this a 9/10 which says a lot. This film is so much more than its main twist and a second watch reveals so many missed details and easter eggs that it is hard not to appreciate the film's brilliance. Di Caprio is sensational as per and i also feel that Ben Kingsley's performance is pitched very well to keep the watcher guessing throughout the film. If you love a mystery/thriller then this is perfect for you and is a stand out film for me in the last few years.,

831,19 January 2011,vogonify,5, Definitely Ambiguous,"Martin Scorsese again borrows material and creates a dark document of the workings of a disturbed mind. While doing so he also plays with yours and by the end of Shutter Island, you come with a solid coin back: heads, it ended this way, tails, it ended that way. Keeping the coin aside for a minute, it feels impossible for Scorsese to have given you the result of that toss himself. He walks on a fine, fine edge and more or less leaves the film there in a cloud of ambiguity.",

I think its must be some sort of a fashion or status-quo in America to praise and talk +vely about such films that have no ending or have a very confusing plot or one that does have (supposedly) a hidden meaning etc: while I fail to see how can so many Americans actually understand such complex plots and also like them, when mostly they are considered quite 'dumb,' and perhaps rightly so.",

836,19 September 2016,Tarx309,7, Neither Scorese's worst nor his best,"Shutter Island is a movie that I had fairly large expectations of. Based off the rating I've given it, it's needless to say they weren't entirely fulfilled. Let's start with the positives. The opening is intriguing and effectively introduces the audience to the characters and the general plot line. It's a suspenseful opening, and gives the audience a good basic idea of the characters. The principle four characters are played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and John Carroll Lynch. DiCaprio is reliable as always, and gives what it obviously the best performance of the entire movie. He effectively mixes torment, determination and grief all into one high quality performance. Ruffalo and Kingsley both give good work as well, even if they are slightly overshadowed by both DiCpario's performance and character. John Carroll Lynch was also as good as always, although his character is not developed enough to justify his large portion of screen time. The characters are, for the most part, good and well written. However as the movie unravels, and they unravel with it as we learn more about them and who they truly, the characters become much less appetising. The simple way to put it is plot development at the expense of the characters. As the plot thickens, the characters become far less appealing.",
837,18 January 2023,tejassawant13,7, Simple story but good execution works here. Worth watching for at least once.,A simple yet well-executed suspense thriller that deserves applause.

Its always better to see a movie with as less information about it as possible, see it with an open mind . All i got to say is this ; shutter island is a decent if not good movie. with all the schlock coming out nowadays this one definitely belongs in the higher echelons. Its better than gangs of new york, but not quite the departed of aviator. of course there are a number of things wrong with it, but Scorsese is a masterful director, one of the best , and it shows.Great cinematography with creepy music makes good tense scenes. Add sme top notch acting and you get Shutter Island. Overall a strong piece with a few flaws. Not one of Scorsese's best ( it be in his top 10 , not top 5) , but definitely one of DiCaprio's.",

842,25 April 2010,Chris_BS1212,7, A genre film that doesn't work quite as well as Cape Fear,Martin Scorsese obviously had a great time making this film an adaptation of the novel by Dennis Lehane. The film has a haunting and suspenseful tone throughout which fits perfectly with its psychological thriller/film noir tone. Set in the 1950s Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are investigating the disappearance of a prisoner from Shutter Island. It is a classic mystery set up with the prisoner having escaped from a locked room within this institution for the criminally insane and disappeared. Of course not all is as it seems and there are many twists and turns throughout the film.,

847,7 October 2012,richy1024,9, A weary but gratifying experiment.,"Shutter Island exemplifies Martin Scorsese's wonderful intelligence and illuminations of motion picture art as an performer and now director. The mystery behind the fogginess suggests a bleak elude eeriness with this film, revealing an unexpected yet incredible finale. The camera also adopts feelings of apprehension, giving it a frantic feel and a true crime investigatory mind set. In addition, we see how DiCaprio's acting capabilities have become more convincing and have improved through age since his heroics in Titanic. This is potentially one of Scorsese's most experimental pieces of film making. His delicate perception of how sound and camera movement blend quite beautifully to create significant meanings and tempers, covering the picture with a blanket of vagueness and trepidation.",
848,12 January 2022,peterafflek,8, I expected more from the director,"Brilliant idea with interesting story but got some issues
It's all about Scorsese some of the scenes was suffering from poor CGI and bad investment of the music especially in the first half
But
By the second half all of that disappeared and there was a great care of the details you will feel it by the second watch it's too valuable",
849,31 May 2020,ferni-tierni,10, Which would be worse: to live as a monster or to die as a good man?,Few movies represent the dynamism and nature of mental health as detailed and accurate as Shutter Island. From the beginning we get immersed in the stern and passionate perspective of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo Dicaprio). The exaggerated dramatization of the movie might throw you off. It might even seem absurd and very strange; at that point we are completely unaware of the cold revelation that was going to be presented to us. The immersion is simply incredible. Navigating with Teddy the course of the recognition of his situation and perceiving vividly the multiple traumas he experienced brings some necessary context to understand the afflictions that were hunting him.,

The movie kept me in suspense the whole time, it made me feel if we were the crazy ones (the viewers). I even had a little bit of headache trying to figure out what was going on, who was right and who was wrong.

I thought I got the story after just 40 odd minutes but then theses a twist and then again there is another twist and it never stops amazing you. Martin Scorsese has done it again, hitting the bull's eye with his favorite, Leo. The acting is above the limit and screenplay scores a perfect 10. The background music enhances the charismatic effect to a new dimension. Shutter Island scores a perfect 10 in all the areas and by far is one of the biggest recommend on my list.",

The movie has it's moments in particular with the setting and portraying across to the viewer the feeling of being trapped with the island and the dark stormy weather which does good things for the film.

859,20 June 2019,christophermoverton,9, Beautifully labyrinthine film,I'll just offer another analysis relative to some others I've seen. Teddy Daniel is Laeddis? Gaslighted and conveniently made to disappear? Or truly as suggested Laeddis and really allowed to role play a federal Marshal while being one of the more dangerously insane patients of Ward C? My interpretation is that there are too many ambiguities remaining ultimately to resolve Teddy as Laeddis. The film's setting is well done. Highly recommended film!,

I thought he should have won Best Actor for ""The Aviator"" - then saw him in ""Revolutionary Road"" last year and was blown away once again by his performance opposite Kate Winslett - and now this. He is head & shoulders above any other actor of his generation at this moment and it is only a matter of time before he will be well and truly recognised as such. Just a pity SI was released too late for this year's Oscar - as by the time 2011 comes around this film will have been forgotten (at least as far as Oscar nominees are concerned).",

864,6 December 2019,balroglord,10, I understand the book at last,"So I read the book, and have to say the film is 100% faithful to it, absolutely perfect. But, after finishing the book I had lots of doubts about what exactly happened, I didn't really understand the ending. Now, after watching the movie it became crystal clear.
Teddy was really Andrew Laeddis, and in the scene almost at the end (2:04:00) where he wakes up from the fainting, he really accepts that he is Laeddis and Dr. Cawley wants to help him, but he has no thoughts yet about the lobotomy. However, a few days later in the next scene he is still his real self as Laeddis, but he is already afraid that he will regress again as he always did before. Therefore when talking to Dr. Sheenan and he already decides that he wants to get healed for good and also accepts possible death (""What should be worse? To live as a monster, or die as a good man?""), therefore he pretends to have regressed so that they perform the lobotomy on him - Dr. Sheenan buys this, calls him Teddy after he signals to Dr. Cawley that the lobotomy already is inevitable.",

I love almost everything they do. This movie however was disappointing and predictable. I knew where it was going and I spent the rest of the movie hoping for a change of direction that never came. What a letdown. This is the first review I have ever written for a movie and hopefully that shows all of you how important it was for me to say--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. All of the praise I have read for this movie absolutely shocks me. The previews were actually better than the movie. It was not worth the price of admission. I hope this actor and director collaborate again and make a movie that can live up to the expectations that we have come to expect from movies such as The Departed.,

This psychological thriller leaves the viewer guessing from start to finish. Two Federal US Marshals investigate the disappearance of an inmate at a prison for the mentally insane. The ending is the best part, one of the marshals is told he is actually an inmate at the prison and it was all an intense roll play to try and cure him. So we never know if the ""marshal"" is actually a federal agent or an inmate. The ending is suspenseful and a typical cliff hanger, but it the viewer is satisfied at the same time. There is enough evidence to support both theories and I personally enjoy movies that offer a debate after it ends. So was he a prisoner, or a marshal?",

870,22 February 2010,Stevendcravens,9, An instant Classic!,"First of all I'm a huge Martin Scorsese fan. In my opinion he is in the top 3 best directors working today with David Fincher and Steven Spielberg. So when I found out he would be directing the film adaptation of Dennis Lehane's excellent novel SHUTTER ISLAND, I was thrilled. 1. Because he would be tackling a story and genre that he rarely gets around to, but one that he admires and respects and 2. Because the novel was a throwback to those great mystery/thriller films that Hitchcock made. Needless to say, Scorsese delivered. The film has many twist and turns and keeps you riveted all 138 minutes of the film and the soundtrack is amazing. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is also, quite possibly, the most atmospheric I've ever seen. I truly felt I was watching a film that was made in the 1950s and I really felt I was on that horrible island with Teddy and Chuck. And of course the performances. I've always thought DiCaprio was a great actor, but he nails the character of Teddy Daniels right out of the park. He truly gets better and better with each performance he gives and I believe this is his finest performance he has given yet. Michelle Williams was also great in her flashbacks as Teddy's wife Dolores with how much she is able to convey with few lines of dialogue and her facial expressions. There are just too many great things to say about this film. Don't ask anyone about the plot if you are unaware of it, just go. The less you know, the better the ride will be. Just sit back and enjoy being in the hands of a master.",

876,21 February 2010,josh-langston,9, Scorcese does it again!,"First and foremost I will start by saying that this film will most likely be the most complete film of 2010 and it is more complete than any film of 2009. What I mean by this is that it is fantastic in every aspect; from the musical scores and costume designs to the acting, screenplay and cinematography, this film is top notch. The movie starts straight to the point about two U.S. Marshalls who are coming to a remote island titled 'Shutter Island', in search of a patient who has escaped. Everything about it is eerie and you can immediately sense that nothing is what it seems which helps to build the suspense right off the bat. The main musical score is fantastic at helping aid the suspense(such as it did in this scene) much in the same way as the theme for the 'Halloween' films and 'The Exorcist'. The island resembles more of a fortress then an asylum. It is made of brick with large walls that are topped with barbwire and the whole island is surrounded by a fog. DiCaprio is brilliant in his portrayal as Teddy Daniels, a man with a very haunting and troubled past. Daniels knows something is wrong immediately and has instant feelings that there is something much bigger going on then just an escaped patient. His partner Chuck (played extremely well by Ruffalo) has the same feelings as Daniels. Both are very intelligent and very attentative to their surroundings. When searching the missing patients room, Daniels discovers a piece of paper under a loose board that says ""Law of 4. Who is 67?"". The story really kicks off here as the two Marshalls being to investigate more thoroughly into it as they begin to suspect that there may be a dark secret about the asylum, one that its employees and patients know about but will not discuss. At many different moments of the film Daniels has flashbacks of his wife as well as vivid experiences of his during WWII that depict Nazi Workcamps. These moments occur in flashbacks and dreams that he has. All of this really helped with the character build up of the two Marshalls ,as Daniels discusses these instances with his partner which creates a bond between the too. As the film progresses, the suspense continues to build until finally we are dealt multiple twists to this jigsaw puzzle of a film that adds everything together in what concludes to be a very shocking ending that will take all by surprise. Keep your eyes open and pay attention because every little detail of this film counts!",

The concept, the plot, the story, the twist; everything was perfect down to the last detail. At first I was a little skeptical about this movie because during the storm I thought that there was some kind of super natural force. But it was just breathtaking. And the one of my favorite parts was the very last scene when they played the creepy music and showed the lighthouse. It just makes you wonder which story is the truth. Was he really Teddy Daniels who was set up and is now a patient at shutter island? Or is he actually Andrew Leitus who has been a patient at the hospital for two years? And you don't know which one it is. And that's the beauty of it. Because no matter how much you think about it and weigh out all the options and details there really isn't one answer. And I don't think there should be one and it should stay that way. This movie will mess your head up. I kept thinking about this for hours.

But as a sixty year old it is hard to take Leo...and Matt Damon, etc etc as anyone other than young children playing adult roles. I know that's unfair...but I grew up watching older guys like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. And I looked up to them. What has that got to do with my Subject title? Nothing. It's a twist. But after 80-90 years of American talking movies, it seems Hollywood is in a fugue state. It was way easier for Hitchcock and his contemporaries to be original because the medium itself was. In todays world of moviemaking, to find a fresh idea (or even a new approach to an old idea) is like trying to find ONE grain of rice in a SILO full of corn. And like I said, to me, Leo's looks like a little kid PLAYING a deranged agent in this film. Not his fault however. I own brain is in a fugue state at this point.",

900,24 February 2010,thelastcritic,9, Sanity Is Subjective,"There is a feeling that permeates every frame of ""Shutter Island"", a feeling of discomfort and uneasiness - a feeling that suggests, at any moment, we are going to slip comfortably into insanity. That is a feeling that Martin Scorsese effortlessly wields, crafting a world that is not unlike our own and yet is so thoroughly cinematic, it can only be described as masterfully haunting. Clocking in at over two hours, this splendid film draws us into a world and story that are so compelling and fascinating, it is often easy to forget where the theater stops and the asylum begins. It would not be a stretch to say that the current state of mainstream horror is rather unfortunate; it feels as though we have not seen an original story or, at the very least, a truly innovative approach to an old story in ages. It is not surprising, then, that Martin Scorsese would be the one to remind us that horror, when done right, is not the type of genre that must be automatically forbidden to the back of the closet with PG-13 ghost stories and dull remakes. While most other horror films are thoroughly innocuous and inexplicably safe, ""Shutter Island"" is reminiscent of more old-fashioned fare, the type of film that is unafraid to be divisive and risky. After all, in cinema, without risk, there is nothing at all.",

Take for instance the crappy 'Madhouse' - Movie with Joshua Jackson, or any other movie in this vein. Shutter Island is the luxury-packed, atmospherically gloomy version of these movies with good actors. Just because it says Scorsese/DiCaprio doesn't make a B-Horror-Flick something special.

909,17 July 2010,theHAMster999,8, A Good Film (but not his best),"I loved this film. It starts out as a old, classic mystery but ends with a twist. The acting by DiCaprio and Ruffalo is right on target. They take you through a gripping story and you never lose focus. The direction of course is great I mean it is Martin Scorsese has he ever made a bad film. You are gripped from beginning to end even though it slows down in the middle, you still want to see what happens. My only problem with the movie is that I saw the twist coming. I called the end of the film. Most of my friends had no idea what was coming but I knew. I actually thought it was obvious. It is still a great ending and has great underlying themes within it that Scorsese is trying to get through to us but I knew it was coming. The film kind of reminds me of Memento. I think I like this film more but Memento I had no idea how the ending was going to turn out. With this I did. It is a great film you should watch it, you should buy it when it gets cheap. That is when I will purchase it when it is a year old and ten dollars at blockbuster. It is not better then The Departed but it holds its own ground. I enjoyed it and would watch it over again.

IMO Decaprio has become a great actor. Was skeptical of him 12 or so years ago, but he is in many excellent movie since then. In SI you are observing point-of-view from within insanity. What you have to figure out in this movie is which person(s) are insane. While I checked the ""spoiler"" box, the outcome will NOT be spoiled here. Altered mental states make for difficult understanding especially when that POV is expertly directed. This is a favorite technique of David Lynch (Mulholland Drive prime example) but IMO, Scorsese has done it so masterfully in Shutter Island that even at the end when all the ""evidence"" is in, you will still find it difficult to believe. Depcaprio and Ruffalo are superb in this film. Methinks Scorsese and Decaprio deserve Oscars. This is a VERY excellent film.",

932,19 February 2010,moviemanknowsall,9, Scorsese does it again,"From the opening shot of Shutter Island, you can tell it's going to be a very special film. A genre that was once extremely popular, noire style mysteries have made their way out of the spot light. It's the exact kind of well executed period film I've come to expect from director Martin Scorsese. I have seen this film four times over the last nine years, and as is the case with many ""twist"" movies, you catch something new on every single watch-through. This illustrates one of my favorite features of this film, the fact that you're distracted from what you believe will be the twist. I experienced it my first time through--you're so busy looking for what's happening that you miss what isn't. I remember thinking how laughable Mark Ruffalo's performance as a 1950's US Marshall was. ""I can't believe they picked this guy."" I remember saying to my father as we watched in the theater. Every word out of his mouth was overacted and lacked real conviction. Over the course of the movie he eased in to it a bit and became less ridiculous, but I was still annoyed by that detail--until the end of the movie. I mean, what a perfect direction choice. Ruffalo's character Dr. Sheehan isn't a Marshall, and he's certainly not an actor. He's just doing the best he can based on what was on TV and in movies at the time. I love this detail, and feel it's often overlooked. Many cinematography choices and small details they chose to include perfectly add to the unhinged dreamlike reality of Teddy's that we are being told this story through. Regarding the ending, there is a lot to unpack. When it first came out we all debated his ending sanity. Maybe he as still crazy, or maybe he just didn't want to ""live as a monster."" Over the years it's become more and more apparent that there is no room for debate; he walks to his lobotomy fully sane and aware of his past actions. His memory is a curse, and he would rather it be gone completely and lose himself all together than have to live with the violent and sordid fate of his family. This is an expertly crafted movie that I feel like is sometimes harshly judged because people fail to see that the twist they ""saw coming"" isn't really the purpose of the movie, there's something much deeper here.",

944,22 April 2011,alex-babansky,4, A masterpiece that will be missed,"About 7 hours ago now, a friend coaxed me into cracking open some canned bread in order to fill our appetites. The lukewarm cylinder slid out of the container, innuendoly ribbed, and this was my first sign that this would be an evening that I would not forget soon, or so I thought. This is still a Shutter Island review by the way; I just haven't gotten to why this was relevant. I finish two servings about of the loaf before I cannot stomach anymore. It has a muffin-raison bran hybrid flavor that takes the least flattering elements of both ingredients and leaves a pungent aftertaste in your mouth. I already feel sad for making it this far, but my ""pal"" brought out the peanut butter and I just had to try more. The brown bread still had an overwhelming flavor but it was smothered by the peanut butter I slathered on top and I made it through another serving with this crutch before I had to tap out. About an hour after this endeavor, the stomach pains arrived. And they became stronger and stronger as time elapsed, and my forehead grew hotter and I broke out in a mild sweat. Pal, I said, I need to get out of here. So I left and I managed to keep it down, but I was in pretty bad pain so I took an ibuprofen and some pepto bismal and that quieted her down a little bit - enough to put on the movie that this review is still currently reviewing. And at the other end, I am not sure if the bread-induced fever dream heightened the experience or what, but I really loved it. I love this movie enough to display the parallels here in my canned bread story. I played Leonardo DiCaprio here. You could say the bread was the crime committed. And you could say that my friend was Mark Ruffalo. The story I told you here already was equivalent to how the movie started out. Leo appears in his right mind as he approaches the island and begins to investigate more and finds the bread suspicious. I'm not exactly sure how it got to be here and why it is laying prostrate on the plate in front of me, slightly warm and slightly squishy, but, might I add, keeps its original form at all costs. I figure my friend is on my side here because why wouldn't he be? I consume the food, and that's when this fabricated story supposedly falls apart. In my fever dream, did I imagine this all took place so that I couldn't blame myself for seeking out this masochistic pleasure? Was my friend really even there in the first place, or did I imagine him so I could shirk responsibility off on him? I don't think I'm going insane, but who would trust the insane person to right themselves a rightful bill of health? But then again, everyone that isn't me is an observer of solely my behavior and none of my thoughts. Did society push this on me to make themselves feel more normal, make themselves feel safer about my self-harm or me being a potential threat to others? Sure I can act weird and irrational, but it was a logical conclusion to me, and I'm not sure it even happened in the first place! Did you all connect dots that were unknown to me and deduce I was abnormal? Do I continue living knowing I'm a monster? Or do I go out knowing I was the good guy? Supposedly this bread has been around since the Civil War, so maybe it was really me in that movie - that timing makes sense. Idk, all I can say for certain is that my stomach does not hurt anymore, but I have a large migraine.",

This is not a film for immature teenagers or twenty-somethings looking for visual excitement, it's a film that requires thought and attention. That aside, the formula is the same one as used in other movies like 'The Others' and 'A Beautiful Mind' - things are not the way they first appear. Given the fine cast it is no surprise that the performances are all very good, and I was especially impressed by the superb Ben Kingsley. Unfortunately the storyline is really rather thin to sustain a two-and-a-half-hour film, so the focus tends to be more on studying the personality of the character played by Di Caprio than running through an interesting plot; this is the fundamental weakness of the film. The wartime experiences of the leading character could have opened up some fascinating twists and turns but that was not exploited; also, as some reviewers have said, the ending was all too predictable once you realised that the leading character was not what he first appeared as.

I won't say anything about the plot as it's basically your typical psych ward thriller type film in this regard. Scorsese does do a very good job at keeping us off our guard here and despite the fact that there isn't anything ground breaking here the sense of paranoia and uncertainty is extremely well conveyed. There is also some fine acting from the likes of DiCaprio and Ben Kingsly of course, especially from Kingsly. But I kept waiting for the film to turn into something more than a basic horror/thriller and sadly it never really delivers here. It certainly is better than just about 95% of any of the other psych horror/thrillers, and this is certainly because of Scorsese's hand, but it ultimately fails to step outside this rather clichéd and over trodden territory. There was potential here for something much better but it's never really utilized fully. Still if you like psychological thrillers I'd still recommend seeing it.

Some are written in such a canned style with perfect 10 scores designed to boost the average overall score. I do agree the acting in this film is fantastic but the plot was utterly disturbing to say the least. Anyone attempting to graphically portray such a ghastly subject matter about children seriously needs to look carefully at themselves. I can only imagine how the make-up artists felt when they went through some of the more graphic scenes depicting the children towards the end. Quite frankly, it's disappointing if there's false reviews posted by PR agencies employed to rate this film much higher than it deserves. Overall, the criticism here lies with the deplorable plot and subject matter. The acting is first rate and obviously it's shot well. But who could possibly excuse some of the graphic scenes especially towards the end.? I'm not against difficult subject matter. I loved films like Capote, Goodfellas & Leon the Professional but this was just weird. When I left the cinema I got the feeling everyone else who'd watched the film felt this one missed the mark.

On my opinion the only think that is scary here is the story. Leonardo is on top of the game, and supporting roles are just perfectly selected as Ben Kingsley(keep an eye on him) performed very well.

This was supposed to be Scorsese's experiment in B-movie thrills, but no mere B-movie director would go on for two hours and 20 minutes.

The actors of this movie did a perfect job, Leo is just exceptional he deserve awards recognition for his performance, Mark Ruffalo as his fan he didn't disappoint me, Ben Kingsley delivered what you should expect from him and Michelle Williams also done a impressing job its the first time I saw her and I am very impressed.",

Jeff Bridges and Morgan Freeman were great in their films, but their performances didn't have the intensity that DiCaprio does in this film. I won't give anything away, but the last half hour of the film alone is Leo's best performance since The Aviator. It is enough to win him an award.",
1002,20 February 2010,dpowers2,10, This Would've Been DiCaprio's Year,"I'm at a loss here. Let it suffice to say that this is an excellent piece of movie-making and stellar performances. Thing is, I always knew Leonardo DiCaprio was good. I saw him for the first time in a Western-European venture called 'Total Eclipse'(Please don't mix us with the former Soviet slave countries. They haven't changed much since the fall of communism)where he played the French poet Arthur Rimbaud. He was quite young then but it was obvious that the man had a great talent. I don't believe a word of those who say that he tried to stop its distribution in any way. His co-star David Thewlis(Verlaine)would never have agreed to that. Such cases tend to be counter-productive. Anyway I saw it televised and it was immense in all it's raw intensity and humanity. Something not often seen on television. I was wise enough to tape it, but that's another story. But back to Leonardo DiCaprio. He just does not seem to put a foot wrong. He excels in all his endeavors. On the table beside me I have:'The Aviator','The Departed', 'Blood Diamond', Body of Lies and 'Shutter Island'. In none of these cases does he falter. He marvels at what he does best; acting. I seriously doubt that any contemporary actor has shown such skill in his chosen profession. To cut it short I like the guy tremendously. There is actually nothing about him that irritates me, which is rare with me. Shutter Island is a great movie. Wheather your preference be DVD or Blu-ray doesn't matter. I guarantee you're gonna love this one. Or the beer's on me. A second viewing is even more rewarding, if you get my drift. In any case enjoy, and take a look at Mr. DiCapripo's other work. So let's all love him and have fun with him. He enjoys what he's doing and does so exceedingly well. Greetings from the North-Pole amigos. 'Vinir' in Old Norse. Remember the less you like my review the better the film is. I have that reputation, you see.",
1003,16 August 2010,gossamer-6,10, Case in point,"After about a year later from first seeing the trailer this movie finally released, and came out with a bang! Shutter Island may not seem as your typical Scorsese picture - aside from the fact that it starred Leonardo DiCaprio - but definitely delivered a creepy, suspenseful, thriller of a 1950s insane asylum. Every single performance is amazing, especially DiCaprio's, who delivers an Oscar-worthy performance (as usual). Even though I read the book and knew what was going to happen this movie still kept me on the edge of my seat thinking what's going to happen next. I wouldn't consider this movie a horror which I liked because most horror movies nowadays are rushed and forgotten about a week after its release. It gave the audience the right dosage of blood, and kept them interested until the bittersweet end.",
1004,4 March 2010,anthonyadamo,8, Scorsese's Insane Flick,"I was not expecting this movie to be so good, but I am thoroughly impressed. The entire story is ominous from beginning to end, but the way the story unfolds absolutely blew my mind. The first half is pretty simple to follow, there is an investigation where the two main detectives are searching for an escaped prisoner from a mental institution located on ""Shutter Island."" Leonardo DiCaprio's character (Detective Teddy Daniels,) is suspicious of the island as soon as he arrives, and as it turns out, he is constantly battling PTSD from his time served in World War 2, where he liberated Jews from concentration camps. He is also battling visions of his deceased wife, who he believes died in an apartment fire, ignited by a disturbed individual named Andrew Laeddis. Without going into specific spoilers, this is the main plot of the movie, and if it peaked your interest then I suggest you watch it. Be prepared to have your mind blown, and don't think for a second that you have this story figured out, this movie is a roller coaster and you're just along for the ride.",

The film is categorized as a horror film but falls more appropriately under the rubric, psychological thriller. Despite an all-star cast and a variety of technically adept cinematic features, the film falls short for a Scorsese work and even shorter for a horror film. ",

1014,3 September 2018,heiko-stauber,10, Dicaprio at his best!!!,"The 2009 made but 2010 released Scorsese film Shutter Island was a very entertaining thriller in similar genre to his remake of Care Fear. This film is set up as a crime thriller with two marshalls (Leonardo DiCaprio & Mark Ruffalo) sent to an island that housing around 66 of the most dangerous criminally insane psychiatric patients. Their job is to investigate 1 missing female patient with the assistance (or not) of the hospital staff led by Ben Kingsley & Max Von Sydow. Suffice to say, things get much more complex with Leos character suffering from increasing migraines & some PTSD symptoms relating to the loss of his recently deceased wife (beautifully played by Michelle Williams) & his experience as a US soldier closing down a Nazi concentration camp. This is an absorbing complex film that is technically excellent as one would expect from Scorsese. The performances are really good although it is initially difficult to take Leo seriously. He looks like a little boy clothed form the dress up box. The plot twists are interesting & the music creates a foreboding sense of doom form the opening scene. There are some plot holes or areas left unexplained at the films end. It is lengthy at almost 2hrs 20 minutes but it is well paced. I had read many negative reviews prior to the screening & found Shutter Island an enjoyable if not completely satisfying experience.",

It makes you question your own judgments of the portrayed events, think back on what you might have missed or misunderstood, all while a dark, scary scene plays out keeping you on the edge of your seat.

1034,3 June 2010,napoleon339,9, As the cover of the blu-ray says: A masterpiece!,"When I initially watched this film last night I wanted to say ""this is an awful film, something is missing from it."" There comes a time when it is best to take a step back from the movie, and think it over, over night. The more I think about this film the more I actually like it. This movie has all of the ingredients to make a wonderful and memorable film. The direction, look, acting, story, the look of the dream sequences alone was very well done. There were parts of this film that reminded me of The Shining and other parts reminded me of a classic masterpiece. There were definitely several slow movement parts of the film which makes me wonder. With todays age, does the new technology with over blown special effects, fast pace cuts, movies that feel like a video game instead of an actual genuine story do these make us forget about what great story telling truly is? Do we forget how to sit and truly watch what's going on instead of having everything seen within the first 3 minutes? I thought this was a seamless and perfect film from beginning to end. The special effects weren't over done just to compete with who can do what. The effects worked well with the film. There were a few parts where it did get slightly redundant but then again, it was all in the mind of the paranoia. Everything actually made sense. So when you first see this movie, think about it don't instantly go to rate it a 5/10 or under etc... Think it over and you will see that the film did work together. The twist was fantastic and it wasn't like an M.Night Twist, it did not remind me of the ""Village"" or anything like that. This twist worked well on it's own and I thought it was beautiful how things could just start over like a clock. The trailer makes you think you are seeing a thriller/horror story but in the end... it is so much more than that. So feel free to see the movie, rent it, buy the bluray! Enjoy the film don't bash this one.",

I really enjoyed the mind bending suspense and thrill which can be experienced from the first scene clear through to the last scene.
