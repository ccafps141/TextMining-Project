It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.",/
1,16 September 2007,jaredmobarak,9," TIFF07, review 3: Facing the blind deaf stone aloneInto the Wild","Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.",r

3,24 October 2007,shark-43,10, Sneaks Up On You,"INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker with each movie he makes.",v
4,6 November 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""Is anybody here?""","I come away from this movie somewhat conflicted, not about the picture itself but of it's principal character, Christopher McCandless. I say that with some reservation as well, because when I was his age and fresh out of college, I spent a lot of time steeped in existentialist thought trying to figure out the meaning of life and how to conduct my own. In McCandless's case, there was also the family dysfunction at work, something that I never had to contend with growing up.",i
5,1 May 2008,mstomaso,8, 2008's Version of On the Road?,"Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out? ",e
6,10 July 2019,gbill-74877,9, Touching,"Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) ""Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,"" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.",w
7,8 October 2007,trigger_jam,10, Justice done.,"The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great.",/
8,22 September 2007,Chris Knipp,9, One hell of a young man,"Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild' is a passionate and faithful evocation of Jon Krakauer's book about Chris McCandless. It's the troubling and complex story of a young idealist and seeker who was also a rebellious child and beloved brother who gave away his $24,000 savings to Oxfam after college, went off in an old Datsun and left his family behind, and disappeared for two years wandering the country, only to be found by hunters dead of poisoning and starvation in an abandoned bus in the wilds of Alaska.",r
9,6 February 2020,planktonrules,7, A most unique...but not entirely pleasant viewing experience.,"There is a certain irony to the story from ""Into the Wild"", as Hollywood, the land of excess, does a film about a man who got rid of all his possessions in order to live simply off the land. It would be like me (at 250 pounds) writing a diet book! Now I am not attacking Sean Penn or the film or any of the ones who made the film...but in general I just cannot associate Hollywood with the life of Christopher McCandless!",w

12,13 June 2009,rmax304823,7, In search of time not found.,"I've never seen a movie quite like this one, not an American movie at any rate. The one that comes closest, maybe, is ""Easy Rider,"" but that one was full of plot points and ambition, raggedy though they turned out. ""Into the Wild"" is more like an assemblage of episodes from a self-made movie, put together with the help of some family friends who happen to be professional actors.",8
13,21 May 2021,grantss,7, Good but not great,"Good, but as great as it is made out to be. Great scenery and cinematography, like a National Geographic documentary. Great soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. The central plot is very interesting and thought-provoking, but it gets done to death. From a point the movie just drifts. A shorter, more focussed film would have been much more watchable.",4
14,3 November 2009,TheAnimalMother,9, *The Hearts Search For True Heart*,"I agree with many others who have said that the main character makes some bad decisions (And you haven't?), and I agree that the film's story is far from the greatest story that has ever been made into a film. However, the story here is an important one that has a lot to say about being human. The story itself is certainly not at all an easy one to tell through the cinematic medium. Nonetheless, I really do think Sean Penn has captured this story nearly as well as it possibly could have been told on film, and that in itself is a stunning accomplishment. This story is so real, so human, that it reaches out and has obviously grabbed a ton of peoples hearts, including mine. The scenes themselves give off a very authentic feeling, even where some parts are somewhat rushed through for the betterment of the whole story, it ends up working well in full scope. Many of the scenes are extremely intimate, including the scene where Hirsch looks directly into the camera to increase this very aspect I feel. I know a lot of people have criticized this part, and I agree in most films it would have no place whatsoever, but here it is a very daring and effective decision by Penn in my opinion. Much of the film displays a vast amount of scenic beauty, and the scenes at slab city are nothing short of 'classic'.",8
15,23 October 2007,wyattej2000,1, Good movie about an idiot.,"This is a really good movie, unfortunately I could not remove myself from the fact that the main character was a complete moron. First of all contrary to what people feel, ""dropping out of society"" is a lazy, b.s. way of rebelling against corporate society, and never achieves anything but a self fulfilled prophecy. Here is what native Alaskans felt about this fool in general. ""Krakauer's book made McCandless a heroic figure to many.Unlike Krakauer and many readers of his book, who have a largely sympathetic view of McCandless, some Alaskans have negative views of both McCandless and those who romanticize his fate. McCandless was unaware that a hand-operated tram crossed the river a quarter mile from the Stampede Trail, while a nearby shelter was stocked with emergency supplies, as described in Krakauer's book. However, the three nearby cabins were broken in and vandalized extensively at some point after mid-April, thus destroying food and first-aid supplies, as noted by Jon Krakauer. Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote: ""I am exposed continually to what I will call the 'McCandless Phenomenon.' People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent ... When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament ... Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide."" Judith Kleinfeld wrote in the Anchorage Daily News that ""many Alaskans react with rage to his stupidity. You'd have to be a complete idiot, they say, to die of starvation in summer 20 miles off the Park's Highway.""[12] Thank you very much, but making a martyr out of a moron is just too much.",0
16,12 January 2008,h-talbot,8, Oscar material,"I watched this movie on the aeroplane after searching through the movie list and not finding anything else interesting to watch. I didn't even know what the film was called until the ending credits. However, what I saw was amazing - the acting and scenery was excellent and the plot was thought provoking. More people should watch this to appreciate the message to us all. I was also surprised to see it was was actually a true story which made it even more interesting (I love films that are based on true stories). It is one of the best movies i've seen that portrays the contrast between a materialistic world vs the natural world that is at the core of the universe. This is a film that can easily be overlooked but not forgotten.",9
17,8 May 2021,filipemanuelneto,9, An excellent film that tells the life story of a controversial adventurer of our time.,"I went to see this film without reading much about it, driven by curiosity. It is an excellent film, although it is difficult to see, and the main character has ideas, attitudes and motivations that can be discussed. Very well directed by Sean Penn, the film tells the life (brief, since he died very young) of Christopher McCandless, a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp. As the film shows, he was from a wealthy family and had a good education, but he carried with him the revolt against his abusive father and his passive mother. Then, he acquired a lot of disdain for capitalist, materialistic, consumerist society in which he never saw himself: burning and giving his money, abandoning everything that was not essential, he left his old life behind and started to wandering, as a vagabond, in the middle of the wild, before moving on to his great goal: Alaska.",/

19,20 May 2008,MaxBorg89,10, Exceptional in every possible way,"Sean Penn's Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as ""if you only see one film this year"" and goes beyond the very notion of ""Oscar-worthy"". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.",r

22,6 January 2008,L. Lion,6," overlong, and without epiphany","Sean Penn's sometimes engrossing and often beautiful film Into The Wild is, in the end analysis, about a character who was basically selfish and self-centered. Like Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors, whom I found to be a self-centered ass, eventually I felt I was on a journey that had little or no revelation, with a person who was primarily selfish, and which leads to (spoiler follows) starvation in the Alaskan wilderness, an ending in which the only meaning I could find was that if you are going to camp next to a river and live off the land, bring a damn fishing pole.",_
23,21 July 2009,billyfish,3," Idealistic ""self-sufficient"" character who is in fact a naive and hypocritical parasite","The main character, Chris, started to annoy me almost immediately and the feeling grew as the movie progressed. Who would be so self-centered and selfish that they would burn their money? At least leave it under a rock for some poor traveler to enjoy! He travels by bumming rides (and food) from others -- how hypocritical can the ""self-sufficient"" man become? He's happy he found a straw hat in a field -- are we supposed to respect him for that? Perhaps if he had had the skill to make the hat himself, he might have earned some grudging respect. Then he hikes ""into the wild"" in Alaska (after having bummed yet another ride) and settles in an abandoned bus. He's nothing but a gigantic parasite, going on interminably about how evil money is, while at the same time enjoying the fruits of other people's labor (and money), even if some of the items have been discarded. I wish he had never found the bus, but had had to live under a tree. How long would he have lasted then? To top off his irresponsible behavior and total selfishness, he simply disappears without informing his family, causing them no end of emotional stress. I'm sorry, this character was just an asshole. I'm only halfway into the movie right now, but having read other spoilers, I know he eventually dies, apparently in a senseless fashion. I perversely find myself looking forward to this event, as horrible as that sounds. I cannot believe that this movie was nominated for an Oscar. It's a silly movie about a completely unlikeable and annoyingly naive fool who in the end gets what he deserves.",=
24,5 June 2010,diac228,8," Like life itself, Into the Wild is a wild and beautiful flower with some nasty thorns attached","The best stories are those that even the greatest novelists couldn't make up. Real life, the real world creates some incredible adventures led by incredible characters. In this film, we follow one of the most amazing true stories ever captured on film. Into the Wild is a very deep and engaging one-man trip through the unknown portions of the United States. Based off the best-seller written by John Krakauer, Into the Wild is about a man that gives up all his material possessions and life altogether in search of purpose, in search of happiness, and in search of a direction to head towards in his life. Written and directed by Sean Penn with a lot of love and detail, this movie is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and even though the third act drags quite a bit, you'll remain hooked on Christopher McCandless' travels up until the bitter end.

32,24 November 2010,paul2001sw-1,6, Long and simplified,"In 1992, 24-year old Chris McCadless set off into the wilds of Alaksa where he died of starvation. Some press coverage presented him as a foolish young adventurer; but in his thoughtful book, 'Into the Wild', author John Krakauer showed how McCandless mostly knew what he was doing, and was perhaps unlucky to perish. Moreover, interpolating from McCandless's life and his own feelings as a young man, Krakauer inferred that Chris was engaged in a serious quest to find a meaningful way of living, a quest not completely invalidated by the fact that it ended in a particularly nasty death. Sean Penn's film of the book captures some of this, but it's a long movie (given that most viewers probably know the ending before it starts), and Penn makes choices that don't exactly betray the spirit of the book but which do simplify it, emphasising McCandless's family problems, making his experiences seem almost ecstatic, and replacing Krakauer's narration with a sister to whom he gives an almost gnomic sense of wisdom. I would also have been tempted to cast a less attractive actor in the leading role, and in other roles too: the weight of the story is undermined slightly by the prevalence of Hollywood looks. It's still an interesting as well as a tragic story; but I think the book told it better.",

Even without reading the article on Wiki, I guessed that this guy was either schizo or bipolar. For a guy who supposedly majored in History and Anthropology, Chris McCandless was hugely sentimental and romantic, and ultimately just foolish. So he reads Tolstoy and Thoreau, and trudges off into the wild ?? Perhaps he ought to have read some Kafka and Dostoevsky too : he would have realized that for man there is simply no escaping himself and the world. So yes, society is indeed based on mutual deception and empty conventions, but rejecting everyone and everything isn't the solution. Far from it. Its much more challenging to be a part of society and yet try to lead an authentic life. How many such radicals and ""total solutions"" have we already seen in the past ?? They always fail.",

41,8 September 2020,rahulgirdhar-65925,1, Disastrous and crap,I know my opinion varies from millions of people who have given this movie such a high rating. But this is my personal opinion that this movie is disastrous on every ground. A man leaves the society to live in the wild because in society everyone is mean and selfish to each other. And then this man in the wild kills every single living being that comes across him for his own survival. So that's not mean and selifish ? Ever heard of Gautam Buddha who survived an extremely long life in the jungles without hurting a single living being. And this man in this movie hates society and the ways in which this society works. But then he uses the tools invented by this society in the wild to help himself survive. That's not being truly into the wild when you are using a rifle to kill animals and using a mattress and bus for a comfortable living. I wish I could give this movie a negative rating. And what's most disappointing is that this is a real life story of someone. Some people are so lost in their life that they go out of the way to find themselves without realising that they are on the wrong path.,

47,28 November 2010,jackbenimble,1, Unbelievable and shallow as all hell!!,"This was a very unsatisfying movie. It starts out with promise and spectacularly fails to deliver . Where to start? The basic premise of a chap going off to live alone in the wild with adventures all along the way is a good one. But nothing really interesting or compelling ever happens in this. The best thing about travelling and wandering about the world is all the interesting and unusual characters you meet along the way. But I can't describe the tedious, one dimensional humourless dullards our 'hero' meets. The long drawn out 'deep' interactions they have about nothing except how sad and unhappy their lives are. All so full of pain.Deep people aren't full of pain. Deep people are people with something to say. The scenery was nice though and there was some camera work going on but that can't make up for flat characters, a dead script, lack of a cohesive storyline that develops (this was just a collage of fragments of happenings strung together going everywhere but nowhere) bad acting and most of all any real philosophical idea behind it. After all, people take off into the wild alone for deep reasons regarding their relationship to modern society not just because they had a tiff with their parents and like eating squirrels. There was a point where some tensions develop in the killing of a big bull thing and you expected that our boy was becoming a man with all the challenges. But then it took a serious dive when he goes back to the hippies and meets a very pretty but incredibly shallow girl and quickly reverts back to being a child again. From then on it never picks up and draws out slowly and interminably to a sad ending. I've said enough. The fact that so many think this worth and 8 rating just shows how shallow and dumb most people are. Perhaps I should go find myself a nice shack in the woods of Montana .....................",
48,20 May 2009,nvillesanti,1," A terrible, depressing movie about self destruction","I can't believe that this movie is among the top 250 list of IMDb. With so many true stories that are really worthy for a movie, they come with this garbage of a man who just wants to be a bum and how great it is. This movie just embraced the idea of being homeless. Into The Wild, tells the story of Chris McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch), a kid who just graduated from college and decides to go on a trip throughout the wilderness, with no money, no phone, and clearly no responsibilities. On his journey he meets with hippies, criminals and all kinds of trash, which obviously, didn't help Chris develop any sense of responsibility. The writers try to present Chris McCandless as a brilliant college student, who is always reading books about philosophy and nature. In the end he ends up alone, insane, and dead. Sean Penn tries to justify the character actions by portraying a supposedly dysfunctional family. In reality, the character of McCandless is just a spoil brat that just doesn't want to face the realities of life and decides to run away from it. The director tries to enchant the audience by showing visuals of mountains and wilderness but that doesn't hide the fact that this movie is a terrible one. The film massage is clear from the beginning, ""love humans, but love nature more."" What type of nonsense is that? It's amazing what some people will do for nature, but won't even move a muscle to help their peers. ",

Penn should stick to his day job. He employs every cinematic cliché known to man in an attempt to romanticize the story and portray the McCandless as a hero. Apparently McCandless was so charming that he instantly bonded with everyone he met on his journey, and everyone he met was a hippie. However, based on the evidence presented here, the guy was nothing more than a pretentious, self-absorbed, and irresponsible jerk who put his family through hell. Slow motion is utilized in every other scene, effectively doubling the length of the film.",

His dream is to go to ""freezing Alaska"", to see if he can tame that barren wilderness, while searching for the truth. He cant---he freezes to death. This is a --flashback movie--and thats O.K. The use of music here is very annoying. A song is sung (with lyrics that suit the scene the audience is watching) ...just in case the viewers are dumb. Our hero Alex, goes through many adventures and meets amazingly ""nice hippy type people"". The only violence in the movie is when Alex gets kicked around after a railway hard nut chucks him off a freight train. In the end Alex finds the ""Truth"". Happiness only really happens...when it is shared. (How original .!!) This is a heavily sanitized version of ""The Truth"", and simply not satisfactory.",

56,1 January 2012,blue141,2, A very sad romanticized movie of a bad decision maker,"As far as I can see, this movie was and is pandering to people with their heads in the clouds, who will think movie is great, and that Christopher McCandless is some sort of idealized, wilderness casualty. Christopher was a bad planner, a bad organizer, a bad hunter, and a really bad navigator. I almost believe he had a suicide mission, (which later I believe he changed his mind about, but it simply was too late, and he knew this fact with desperation), doing this trip without any of the things he needed. Christopher was educated, smart, so there is no excuse for his actions concerning this venture of his into the wilderness. Delirious starvation, led to not finding a river crossing. Bad circumstances made food in cabins nearby not edible. One of his last entries in his diary made it clear he was afraid to die, to die alone, and that he was desperate to live, but hopeless at the same time. He should have had a compass in his travels, but he did not have one at the time of his death in his possession, which does puzzle me. People will always go where angels fear to tread. One can only hope other people won't make bad decisions to go on trips unprepared, but some people always will, so one can only hope the best for those people, and hope no one follows their footsteps to their death also.",

I think of Patton or Laurence of Arabia or many others. I am sure as movie fans that you can fill in the blanks. Now Sean Penn offers us Christopher McCandless. Who? Was his life a subject for cinema? Let's see. He lived a boring uneventful life tooling around in the wild for a while (should be some dramatic music here) usually by mooching off others or off the technology and civilization he abhorred. He created nothing. He changed nothing. He shaped nothing. He selfishly and thoughtlessly abandoned his family including a sister who loved him and never did him a bit of harm. He managed to walk away from everyone who ever cared about him or wanted to befriend him or help him. He had that always charming arrogance of those who believe they have all the answers to life that us lesser people just can't see. We insist on having a shower in the morning and not having lice in our hair or stinking. More the fools us. Apparently smelling back and hopping freight trains is some king of revelation of truth. If only we would abandon all this modern science and technology and just pee on a tree or look at a mountain. There has always been a cult that believed the secret was to run away. Somehow wasting your life doing nothing is better than spending it trying to actually contribute something. Just be. Just breathe. That's the ticket. Well that is the difference between us and animals. We try to do something, to learn something and make something and we fail and we try again. We do not run away. Why would anyone want to spend over two hours watching this pathetic loser destroy himself. It is like watching grizzly man. One is just waiting and let's be honest, hoping for a bear to get hungry and the real truth to be revealed. Like the grizzly, the wild is not your friend. It is beautiful to look at but you do not belong there. It will kill you for just that reason. Good bye Christopher. Let's hope there is no sequel.",

The following is a list that expresses this hatred toward the glorification of Chris Mccandless, a mentally unstable kid who runs away from home. Spoilers. 1. Chris teaches us that when you have problems at home, just run away. 2. Apparently he and his sister are the only kids to ever have to deal with fighting parents. 3. How could he just leave his sister? He obviously loved her and took care of her. But no, he leaves her there with his psycho parents. Never writes her or anything. 4. He was too scared to stand up to his father. He just ran and hid when his dad hit his mother. 5. He turned down a brand new car from his parents to keep a piece of crap. 6. ""I don't need money."" Umm lets see he needed money for a kayak. He worked for Vince Vaughn and Burger King for money so he could make it to Alaska. Just a little hypocritical there. 7. Apparently being a free-spirit makes you an expert kayaker. 8. Everyone he meets is the absolutely nicest person you could ever meet. 9. The male hippie's lines are laughably bad. 10. Male hippie tells Chris that he and female hippie are not doing good. Chris talks to male hippie for about 20 seconds and then goes swimming with female hippie. Male and female hippie go back to being completely in love. 11. The amount of times the word ""Alaska"" is uttered is just annoying. 12. Without the abandoned school bus he would have made it about a week. 13. Living in an abandoned school bus is not exactly living off the land, forgetting society. He slept on a friggin cot, had a place for a fire, and had sufficient shelter. 14. Man. Sitting there by yourself in an abandoned bus in the freezing cold. That's living man. Wow. 15. He thought he could make it in the Alaskan wilderness with no map. 16. His story is basically now a tale of what not to do with your life. 17. The only real thing he learned from his adventure is that ""Happiness is only real when shared."" Umm ya think? There's probably other ridiculous stuff from this movie that I forgot about. This movie makes this kid into some kind of hero when the only thing he accomplished was committing suicide.",

After you see this film (if you can call it that) you have an insight into the spoiled kid mentality. Written by a privileged male who obviously yearned for a challenge, an adventure, something other than their actual drab, guided existence. The problem, though, is that this story is told as if it was a campfire tale. Complete with embellishments and drama to the point of being unbelievable and humorous.

""Into the Wild"" got 2 Oscar nominations, including an acting nod for Hal Holbrook, and a couple more SAG nominations. I can't say Keener's was deserving, not sure about lead actor Hirsch.

It really is more of a tragedy that happened because a young man severely struggled with his life and his parents' broken marriage. I think many audiences mistake this walk for something desirable. Of course, there are positive aspects to it and maybe, if you are in a different situation than the protagonist here, it can be something that helps you with your life, something recreational, but it is not in this movie. Or do you want to die in some bus weighing only 30kg because you ate some poisonous plant?",

108,18 October 2007,the-movie-guy,10, An emotionally wrenching story of the unforgiving lesson of nature,"(My Synopsis) Based on the true story of 22 year-old Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp, gives his entire savings to charity after he graduates with honors from Emory, and begins his journey and great adventure into the wild. Chris believes that he can life off the land and that he doesn't need any money to do that. He had a goal of testing himself to the fullest by heading into the wilds of Alaska and surviving alone. It took Chris about two years to finally make it to Alaska, and along the way he meets a series of colorful people that he had never before encountered through his privileged life. His quest to learn more about the American culture took him from the wheat harvest in South Dakota to a kayak trip down the Colorado River into Mexico, and Slab City, California, before he finally makes it to Alaska. Once in Alaska, Chris must battle for his life against the harsh reality of nature in an abandoned bus.",

110,9 May 2009,RocketB52,3, Angry Young Man Goes to Alaska,"Maybe the older I get, the less patience I have with people who do  willfully, stupid things.  Having said that, I can't fault the acting or direction of this film.  The cast is very good, Penn obviously knows how to direct his actors,  the vistas are magnificent.  The problem for me is, the central character is someone who is smart  enough to know better, but goes ahead and does the stupid thing anyway.  I try to chalk it up to youth, but the scope of the lead character's  stupidity is so great, I find myself unable to do it. OK, I think.  Maybe when I was 21, I would have done something like that, given his  family life. But the answer always comes back, ""Hell, no. I wasn't even  that stupid at twelve.""   Christopher McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch ) has a mommy and daddy  (played by Marcia Gay Hardon & William Hurt) who fought a lot while he  was growing up. That's unfortunate. He graduates college and decides  most people lead empty lives. Hey, what a concept. And because he must  have a tremendous amount of rage towards mom and dad, he decides to  hell with it all, tears up his credit card and money or gives it away (  OK, that's kind of cool ) , and thinks, screw it! He's going on the  road! A free spirit! What is his ultimate goal? Alaska! Why? Who knows?  Maybe it's because that's as far away as he can get from mom and dad,  who despite the fact they fought like cats and dogs, are totally  anguished over the disappearance of their son. Who never, never tells  them where he went, or communicates with them once. He never even tells  his sister, the person he supposedly loves, what he intends to do. So  he's not just stupid, he's unforgiving. Yay.  So this over privileged, clueless 21 year old with a liking for Thoreau  & Byron (who probably wouldn't have been caught dead in Alaska, at  least, not THAT unprepared) sets off on his trek for a very cold place,  and on the way, behold, he encounters a bunch of colorful eccentrics,  whose lives he touches, briefly and magically, and then he flits away,  because he is, after all . .a free spirit. Evidently, someone has  neglected to tell Chris the 1960s are over, because he even gives  himself a wifty, 1960s name: Super Tramp.   Eventually, Chris gets to Alaska, and the guy who drops him off as far  into the wilderness as he'll dare to go says to him, ""I'll see you in  the spring, if you're still alive."" Does that faze Chris? No, because  someone kind of, SORT of told him how to smoke moose meat. The wonders  of nature await! Besides, all he has to do is cross that little creek.  Of course, during the spring melt, the thing becomes a raging river,  trapping him on the what turns out to be the wrong side of where he  should be. Oops.  He finds an abandoned bus to live in, and botches smoking his moose  meat, because maggots take over VERY quickly. Not to worry! He's got  his little ""Local Flora and Fauna"" book, so he can live off fruits and  roots and plants that aren't poisonous. Except he really sucks at using  the book and he DOES end up eating a highly toxic plant, and in his  starved condition, he doesn't last too much longer after that. He is so  sick at the end even a grizzly bear turns his nose up at him.  I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy? He was just as self indulgent  and selfish as the world he choose to reject, and being clueless,  nature culled him from the herd. End of story.",

Everything pretty much just stayed the same. Emile Hirsch ran around looking for food and shelter and such. That was pretty much all of the excitement of the movie.

113,20 January 2013,seanhiddleston,1, Never has a piece of footage inspired more rage in me.,"I am generally easy to please when it comes to films. Prior to this, the worst thing I could say about a film was that it was a bit dull. Into the Wild changed all of that. I can only imagine what the real Christopher was like, but if this is supposed to portray him in a positive light, I doubt he had many redeeming features. Every single thing he did made me hate him more. To begin with, he had a fantastic life. As the summary on this website says, he was a 'top student and athlete'. He had a decent sum of money for a student, and a family who cared for him. So what does he do? He throws all of it away on a whim. He gives his money away, destroys everything he owns and completely abandons civilisation, all without telling his family a thing. This is one of the most reckless, selfish, idiotic, inconsiderate things I have ever heard of. I understand wanting to reconnect with nature, I understand that people feel that society is too materialistic. If you want to indulge those feelings, go camping. Go on safari. Volunteer for a charity. What you do not do is throw away your entire life. And if you do decide to destroy everything you have ever achieved, you could at least have the common courtesy to tell your parents where you are. He could easily have kept in touch with his family while on his insane quest. All he accomplished by keeping quiet was making his parents fear for his life. Fear which was perfectly justified, considering the ending. On his journey into the depths of stupidity, he met several people who were inexplicably sympathetic to his situation. They offered him every opportunity to live his life with them. He had every chance to abandon his aimless wandering, but he turned them all down. Why? Because he was convinced that he knew better than everybody else. He ends up dying due to his own bottomless stupidity when he eats poisonous berries, despite the fact that he had a guidebook which told him which berries were safe to eat. Any reasonable person would consult the book BEFORE eating the mystery fruits. I hated everything about him, throughout the film my fists were usually clenched. When he died at the end of the film, I imagine the audience was supposed to cry. I laughed out loud for five minutes. I know that makes me sound like a monster, but it's the truth. If a team of psychologists and writers studied me for years on end and created a character whose sole purpose was to make me angry, they would not even come close to the blinding fury that I experienced watching this film. As terrible as this sounds, I am glad Christopher McCandless is dead.",

Directed by Sean Penn and based on Jon Krakauer's book about Chris' life, Into the Wild is a celebration of youth with its idealism, desire for adventure, and also its arrogance and short-sightedness.

120,21 January 2019,tabuno,6, Strong Movie With Major Flaws,"10 November 2007. Until the overly, emotionally wrought-movie's ending, INTO THE WILD held little in the way of redeeming value. Though gorgeous and visually stunning, Sean Penn is pretentious and overly excessive in his use of photographic and cinematic techniques. He unnecessarily tries to impress the audience with his apparent ability and knowledge of all the variety of camera work available to him. Unfortunately, the diversity and various uses of his art become a distraction in themselves and sometimes become story instead of the background. This jarring distraction becomes particularly apparent during the scene where Christopher McCandless visits a love tourist stop. In this scene Penn uses an almost documentary-style visual approach to the scene that is completely different from other styles he used in the other portions of the movie. It's use appears to more for showing off than really contributing to the story of the movie. The frequent scattering and non-linear, flashbacks, flashforwards isn't always a pleasant trip, making the audience having to twist and turn in ways that really detract from the main themes of the movie. Instead of allowing the audience just to immerse themselves into the story, they are forced into a roller-coaster ride of almost dream-like snatches of experience that never truly gel into a satisfying experience. Never is the audience allowed to truly grasp the depth of the McCandless' parent's transformation, from their beginning to their ending. Vince Vaughn, probably, has the most authentic, and delightful role in the movie, where his acting is on full display that eschews any of Vaughn's typical character stereotype. The fascinating threads that Sean does present are interesting with their continual focus on relationships throughout the movie that McCandless is exposed to. But unfortunately, these threads never truly succeed in revealing McCandless' depth of relational experience. For example, there are lukewarm inferences of emotional tragedy or regard with respect to McCandless but in another scene from another movie demonstrates how much is lacking in Penn's presentation of McCandless as a character's own emotional trial and self-absorption. In Dr. Zhivago (a book that McCandless actually reads in the movie) the audience is allowed to linger in a haunting scene of Dr. Zhivago's love leaving his life forever in a sleigh that becomes smaller and smaller until it's just a dot on the horizon before fading completely away as Dr. Zhivago desperately tries to climb up into the house's top window and look out at the last glimmer of his love life. The jet airplumes in INTO THE WILD, are much more effectively used in 24 Days After, a movie where a biological contaminated Britain is wiped out and it is only the airplumes overhead that suggest (not as in INTO THE WILD of civilization to runaway from) but civilization that saves. There is the moose killing that is so disrespectful of nature and the land. There is the reckless disregard for taking responsibility of freedom, taking advantage to not conform to the rules of society. Most of the movie appears to be an over-glorification of the wild, rugged, individual man seeking his own identity and freedom, yet, it avoids the more harsh realities that McCandless also likely experienced along the way, except for the very ending.

156,3 April 2009,yris2002,10, A rare pearl: when the word fails to translate emotion,"It's difficult and limiting to review such an emotionally engaging movie: it's a movie that can only be lived and lived again, the viewer just has to let it penetrate into his soul, mind and body. It's a movie that empties you in order to let you be reborn to a new life, at least to a new perception of what life and happiness are, and what has nothing to do with them. The depth and intensity of the experiences lived by Chris, as much extreme as the lands he visits (which provide an ideal and spectacular scenario for them), give evidence of such anxiety of life and truth, which go beyond the mistakes made by the young boy. Chris is, of course, a victim of an age which makes you believe the necessity to pursue the ideal, in an absolute way, never considering the opposite necessity to come to terms with real life, often hostile, misleading, which provides false values of materialistic happiness, but from which escaping is not always the most constructive attitude. However, his escape will prove to be almost therapeutic to him, since only at the very end of his physical, but also spiritual, and very painful, journey, will the young boy be able to understand the preciousness of true human relations, those which make you long for a human being you can share happiness with, as well as any other human feeling. The emotionally powerful soundtrack by Eddie Vedder helps to let the movie enter, gently but inexorably, into the very inner core of your soul, stirring such strong emotion inside, that the viewer finds it difficult to translate it into words. The word, however powerful and deep, fails when trying to rationalize the strong emotional engagement: you just have to allow yourself to be overcome by it and leave words aside, as too limited and limiting. It's one of those movies which really gets under your skin and cannot but alter your vision of life, forever. A pure and rare pearl within the cinematography of this century, and, I would say, of all times.",

The beauty of Into the Wild for me is that what Christopher McCandless is running from is never as important as what he is running to. Sean Penn has directed this film with magnificent precision and imaginative grace. Every scene, every image used in this film tells it's own story and the countless people Chris meets along the way are as magical and integral to his journey as his survival in the wilderness.

It is sad that this film is based on a true story given the outcome and the lack of communication with his family, but ultimately it is not a particularly good film and I wouldn't say the acting was anything particularly commendable.

Once he has ""disappeared"" by abandoning his car, burning his money, and erasing his identity, the young man wanders the American west in search of himself. The ensuing road movie details the various encounters that he has over the months and years of his journey of discovery. Although Christopher has lost faith in human relationships, he meets and seemingly bonds with a number of people, all of whom take to the engaging, often charming, young man and try to help him. However, he unsentimentally severs his bonds with each, although they apparently have developed feelings and care for him.

Do we need to teach our children that this is the way they should thing and approach life? Definitely no.

The music was so loud that every time it came on you had to put your fingers in your ears to keep from being blown away. The people that the young man met were adorable but he was insufferable. Sean Penn tried to justify his behavior by describing a bad childhood but that is no excuse for his stupid behavior. If he really needed love, it was offered to him time and again but he thrust it away. To go into the wilderness of Alaska with no wilderness training or equipment was unforgivable as he found out.

Excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, editing, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast delivers realistic and formidable performances. Hirsch and Holbrook in particular are superb. Malone's narrative is sensationally emotional and poetic throughout the film. The plot revolves around a young man Christopher McCandless, a recent top graduate from Emory University. Instead of pursuing a prestigious career being forced upon him by his overbearing parents, he chooses a different path. Christopher donates his entire life savings to charity, rids himself of all possessions and hits the road on a journey of self discovery with the ultimate goal of reaching the Alaskan wilderness. Along his journey he encounters several characters who give him insight and sage. The plot is thought provoking, captivating, selfish, psychological, insightful, heartwrenching, sublime and so much more.

He depicts what 1968ers and hippies have become thirty years later, today, and what their idealism and ideals may produce today. Christopher, an allusion to a certain Christopher Columbus, decides to abandon everything, to give away his 24,000 dollars of savings, to burn his money and disappear in the vast territory known as the USA. He is looking for real life, for real nature, for real humanity, a life, a nature, a reality that are no longer simulacra of the truth, the truth that existed before man and humanity perverted it. So, along the road, he explores several possibilities that are all fake and he will end in Alaska. Sean Penn accumulates the elements showing there is no escape from society and civilization. No escape for the hippie couple Christopher becomes friendly to and who move freely thanks to their caravan, making an income along the way by selling second hand books they recuperate left and right. No escape from social norms in sex when Christopher refuses the approach and gift from a girl on the only basis that she is 16. Woodstock is really gone and forgotten. No escape in the friendship he develops with a farmer of some type who is finally caught up by the FBI for some illegal activity. No escape in the friendship he develops with an older retired GI who proposes to adopt him to provide him with some kind of a family, to provide himself with some kind of a substitute for his accidentally killed son. But no escape either in Alaska where he is trapped in a way three times, at least. Trapped in a bus that is grounded in the middle of the wilderness. Too easy to survive in this absolutely human environment whose engine is dead and has no fuel. Trapped by his forgetting that to survive in nature you have to know nature's cycle and he did not know the migration cycles of animals and found himself one day foodless, and he did not know the cycles of the rivers and found himself locked up by the water of the river and crossed on foot before. Trapped finally by his lack of knowledge about nature and by his lack of preparation that makes him mix up two wild plants, one edible and one inedible. And he dies slowly poisoned by wild sweet peas. And finally, but too late, he understands that happiness is only real when it is shared. But it is too late and he can only compensate his death with the beauty of the sky his dying eyes capture as he breathes out his very last breath of life. Complete, absolute, irreversible evolution of humanity from barbaric animality to necessarily social and shared civilization. To refuse that historical construct is to refuse to live and to condemn oneself to death, in other words to commit suicide.",

194,19 June 2008,princesss_buttercup3,5," He's not a martyr, he just has a sad story.","Here's the thing about this film, and I suppose the book, had I read it. Let me say firstly that I have a lot of respect for both Sean Penn and Jon Krakauer, and the performance of Emile Hirsch was outstanding. That being said, this film was beyond disappointing. The ""moral"" lends itself to great misunderstanding, and I think the movie runs the danger of creating a martyr out of a man who, while eccentric and interesting, is anything but a hero. I might have liked it if I was not already well acquainted with another well-known true story of man against the elements and the profound search for meaning in human existence. I found myself contrasting Christopher McCandless' journey to that of Nando Parrado, one of the sixteen survivors of the Uruguayan rugby team plane crash in the Andes in 1972. Parrado (who also happens to be a friend) chronicled his experiences in a 2006 memoir called ""Miracle in the Andes,"" and I can't help but wonder how McCandless' road might have taken a different turn had he heard Parrado's story first. Of course, there were several differences between the two men's stories, but the most profound are these: while McCandless' isolation and solitude (including from his family and friends) was intentional, Parrado found himself in his circumstances because of dumb luck. What makes this ironic is that while both men ultimately discovered that the only antidote to death is love, McCandless' suffering (as well as the suffering he inflicted on his family) was completely pointless. The second major difference between the stories is that while McCandless succumbed to ""fate"" when, as it turns out, he could very likely have survived, Parrado- whose death was a virtual certainty- refused to give in. Parrado even wrote in his book that although he was sure he was dead when he began his trek over the Andes (which lasted 11 days and took him over 17k foot peaks in nothing but street clothes and after starving on the mountain for 60 days), he *chose* to keep breathing in and out, so that when he did finally drop, he would die ""one step closer to his father."" McCandless, on the other hand, ran from his father only to find out (too late) that his great adventure was simply an illusion. This didn't sit well with me. I sympathize with McCandless' need to let go of his dependency on the comforts and conveniences of life and to remove himself from the familiar in order to force a deep look within. But with all due respect to his family, I don't find any nobleness in McCandless' story. It is simply a tragedy. And a needless one at that. I hope it is that lesson-- and not some beautiful and tragic glory that Krakauer and Penn try (and in my opinion, fail) to wrestle from this story-- that people ultimately remember.",

Moreover, since he communicated directly with no one, not even his beloved sister (Jena Malone), his story has to be conjectural and its reconstruction on the screen is unconvincing. Frankly, I couldn't bring myself to care much about him or his reasons for ditching his parents or their pain. I kept wondering, however, why he never bothered to communicate with his sister, whom he supposedly loved. That he undertook an adventure for which he was essentially unprepared and eventually died because he could not cross back over the fast-flowing river he had originally forded during the winter when it was reduced to a trickle did not move me and his slow starvation was not heart-breaking because I was impatient for the movie to end.",

I'm Supertramp and you are super apple.'' I wanted to start with a nice line from the movie. The movie was very impressive but it is not a common subject and it is tragedical story. Movie shows conflicts about life and the difference between city life and wildlife. When the movie finished i couldnt think about what should i do now. You just start to think and ask about life, the world and some stuff. We see a man who tries to escape from a corrupt society and decides to live into the wild as you can predict. He has some trouble with his parents and when he completed his university he is leaving from home with his backpack. His destination is reaching Alaska and we see her travel to there. He is meeting a couple of people during his journey and almost everyone who met with this guy they love him and having great time each other as a consequence of this in the journey we watch lots of farewell scene however we now that he has to stick with his target 'to Alaska'. Especially the last old man held on to him so much. They are doing some staff together in old man's house. Lastly old man takes him somewhere and this is time to leave for them. This scene was very dramatic and make you sad. Old man say to him 'I want to adopt you if you want too' because his child was dead as i can remember and our little boy say that 'Let's talk about this when i came back' but how do you know that. I feel angry about this situation he left him as a crying man. Also why he didn't say anything about his plan after the university to his sister. We can understand his situation with his parents but he should have talked with his sister. Anyway, in the end I was shocked because i didn't know it based on a real story. When they showed to us real picture of him that he had taken before he has died, I felt really bad. We can't change the end because of that it based on a real story however in a scene near to end the main character decides to turn back and realized that the river has raised and he cant reaches to another side of river. In this scene i was thinking why he didnt try again to find another way he just go to the river and saw some problems then he like okay there is no way to get out from here lets go back to the bus and wait for my end. I didn't like that.",

The movie by sean penn glamorizes his useless death in he Hollywood way. I guess I should not put all the blame on penn though, he did not write the book. The book which had many inaccuracies, one of which is that Chris was poisoned by seeds. No toxins were found in the food in Chris's bus. He simply starved to death because he was did not know how to survive in the wild. He was only a days hike away from one of the busies roads in Alaska. Since the movie has come out many, many people have made this hike with no problems. Chris was simply a kid with some mental health issues that were not treated. The movie glamorizes an idea that Hollywood types like penn like in theory. Down with commercialization, the money spun world of greed, money money money. You know its all bad mentality. Of course I don't see penn giving away all his money to charity like Chris did. WOnder why??",

He starts of by giving away all ""his"" college money, which would be impressive if it were actually his money (that he worked for) and not money his parents gave him. He then goes out West and hangs out with people and spouts off about society and how he's going to Alaska where he's going to live on his own, away from society. During this time his family is worried to death about him, and he doesn't bother to contact his sister (who he was apparently was close to), yet manages to write a letter to someone he just met after that someone goes to jail for selling pirated cable. He meets some burnout hippies and more self-important nonsense...until he gets to Alaska.

The character development did not help me to sympathize with the main character, he came off as a brash, uninformed idealist with no real intelligence. The interspersing of random trippy imagery and psychedelic image collages flashing occasionally throughout the movie just confused and irritated me. The manner in which the main character makes his ""adventure"" is both naive and offensive. I like to think I know quite a bit about wilderness survival, it is clear that this guy didn't. He starved to death in the middle of Alaska in springtime. GIVE ME A BREAK. This is what happens when you know nothing and try to do something anyways. You don't just go eating berries willy nilly because you are hungry, you carefully conduct taste tests to make sure it won't KILL YOU. I just cannot say enough against this movie.

Regardless of what this guy was like in real life, Sean Penn did a great job of glorifying a character that was pretty much just a huge douche. He was selfish, uncaring and overall stupid.

Getting to the young man's motivation for taking off on his adventure, the story he learned about his parents is barely enough to trigger anything more than underachieving in school. The fact that he's a high achiever with knowledge of his parents' hypocrisy is not credible. Yes, the acting is excellent and so is the cinematography. But the script is a shambles. In his adult period, I believe, he kills a moose, and because he doesn't dress it fast enough maggots appear, ruining it. And so he gives up on shooting game. This is the same person who shot the rapids in a kayak without permission and a deathly fear of water?

Firstly I was overwhelmed by the praise this movie got on release. I went into it knowing little about Mc Candless and when the movie had finished I wasn't sure why I should know or want to know who he was. I cant understand how this man is an inspiration for anyone, he was clearly a selfish person who cared for nothing other than his way. There was nothing really to like about him he started off coming across as a spoilt teenager and continued to be that way throughout the duration of the film. We get some very good acting from all involved its just a shame that its all wasted telling the story of a person who really made no contribution to anyone or anything. That said the cinematography was amazing and the music was pretty good at times although I expected a little more from Vedder if im honest. Sean Penn is a pretty good director but I think maybe i just couldn't connect with the subject matter.

226,23 March 2008,meeza,10, Wild Thing! You pull my heartstrings!,"""Into The Wild"" is not based on the astonishing true story of wild choral-child Britney Spears nocturnal escapades in The Bipolar Express. ""Into The Wild"" is not even based on the ""asstonishing"" true story of wild Governor-manchild Eliot Spitzer's nocturnal escapades in The Emperor's Club. ""Into The Wild"" is really based on the astonishing true story of wild child Christopher McCandless who abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings to charity, and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Just like Britney and Spitzer, his ""assets"" get frozen because of his desire to roam free. Director Sean Penn's compelling film pulls into the heartstrings on the quest of ultimate solitary freedom. ""Into The Wild"" is more into the journey that McCandless took within the friendships he experienced on his hitchhiking route to Alaska. That roster included an affectionate middle-age hippy couple, a fast-talking farmer, and a lonesome geriatric widower. McCandless does reach the apex of solitaire euphoria when he encounters an isolated wrecked bus in Alaska which in turn he calls The Magic Bus. Chris becomes The Who of the Magic Bus by living in it until the song stops playing in his life. It is no secret on what happens to Chris so I am not playing spoiler when I say The Magic Bus becomes The Tragic Bus because he dies in it because of a poisonous fruit he ingested. Chris was eventually going to die anyway from lack of nourishment, so I guess Chris picked his poison. His fragile body was so emaciated that a slight ""McCandless in The Wind"" would have tipped him over. Emile Hirsch's courageous performance as McCandless was enthralling enough to be into the best male leading acting efforts of the year. Hirsch lost an enormous amount of weight for the role; I guess he must have eaten many ""Hirschy Bars"" to gain the weight back. Hirsch's roadie entourage were also into the acting: Hal Holbrook broke our hearts by effectively portraying the emotional senior Ron Franz, Vince Vaughn's ""vaughnisms"" talked the talk and walked the walk as farmer Wayne, and Catherine Keener & Brian Dierker's performances as the hippy Rainey & Jan were hip hip hooray! William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden as the desperate McCandless parents and Jena Malone as the philosophical McCandless also were into their supporting acting. Eric Gautier's gorgeous scenic cinematography was as cold as ice at times but warm at heart at others. Eddie Vedder of Peal Jam jammed it in with a high score by contributing a nicely-tuned thematic musical score for what ""Into The Wild"" entails. However, it was the Pennmanship of Writer-Director Sean Penn that revitalized Christopher McCandless incredible journey into cinematic reality! I hope I got you into the mood to go ""Into The Wild"". ***** Excellent",

I was hesitant to see this film, but felt if anyone could do this remarkable story justice, it would be Sean Penn. I was not disappointed. This is a heartbreaking story that does not wallow in pathos. It is a tribute to those among us who march to a different drum. Maybe some viewers will find Christopher McCandless' story pointlessI've heard the hubris arguments alreadybut for those of us who have felt the lure of absolute freedom, the love of unspoiled nature, and the need to find our souls, ""Into The Wild"" is awe- inspiring. Penn's screenplay is succinct and smart, his direction is flawless. The performances Hal Holbrook, Catherine Keener, and Marcia Gay Harden chief among themare superb and Oscar-worthy. But it is doe-eyed Emile Hirsch who is the heart and soul of this film. With so many grand performances swirling around him, he's easy to overlook. But don't.

This shows the impact this decision has on his parents and sister, as well as the journey. It doesn't tell you if he made the right choice or not, rather it leaves that up to the individual. This is based on a true story as well as a novel, and I can draw no comparisons to either(although I understand that the book has essentially the same events, if the tone is rather different). Along the way, this kid(a compelling Hirsch) meets a lot of interesting people, and albeit he tends not to spend very long around them(he's not looking for others, he's trying to get away from society), every character is memorable, credible, genuine and comes across as a complete person. The acting is all great. Standouts are Keener, Holbrook, Vaughn(no, really), Hurt and, this one might surprise you, Pre-Twilight Stewart(yes, these last years, we've forgotten that she used to exhibit talent. This is one of her best performances). He meets hippies, the lonely, the hopefuls and a few who have no sympathy for his situation. We see both sides of nature, the stunning beauty and the terrifying danger. It is gorgeously photographed all the way. The pace is good, and I wouldn't really call this excessive in length, in spite of the nearly two hour, 30 minute running time. It captures the mood of every scene and really keeps your attention. The humanity, the sheer emotion, comes so easily to this. No manipulation or melodrama. There is a bit of disturbing content, and a little bloody, gory violence(not gratuitous), nudity(full frontal of both genders) and moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of those involved in creating it. 8/10",

235,23 December 2007,bandw,10, Why this is worth seeing,"I read Krakauer's book several years ago and was taken by Chris McCandless' story and by trying to understand him. This movie helped with the latter - images can sharpen the imagination. It needs to be kept in mind that both Krakauer and Penn are presenting us with attempts at biography that are necessarily filtered through their life experiences. By his own admission Krakauer, being an outdoors-man and mountaineer, could see elements of himself in McCandless and I think the film reflects a deep feeling for the young man on Penn's part. The opinions I have about McCandless are thus third-hand and filtered through the lens of my own experience.",
236,23 July 2022,I_Ailurophile,9," Fantastic, & so much more than I ever expected","The story of Chris McCandless is one of contradictions. There's something deeply admirable about immersing oneself in nature, breaking away from the demands, expectations, and oppression of society, materialism, and capitalism; even those who beat their chests and most loudly proclaim their independence, self-identifying survivalists, are ill-prepared to truly engage with the world on such a level. Then again, just look at how such naturalists equip themselves with modern tools and instruments that they lack the knowledge or capability to replicate on their own, and for all his determination, McCandless was even less prepared. Nonetheless, it's courageous and daring to undertake such a free-spirited venture, shuffled loose of attachments - yet also reckless, and more than a little pompous and self-serving. Exemplifying the latter point, it's easy to deride, as ""Supertramp"" does, the notion of a lengthy waiting list or an exorbitant fee to enjoy a river; it's less easy to endure the boundaries we and our predecessors have trapped ourselves in to try and change and remedy these absurdities, for the benefit of all. If in fewer words, 'Into the wild' manages to embody all these facets of the journey being depicted, and it does so without any particular slant or judgment.

245,23 May 2008,Quinoa1984,7," overlong and precious, also marvelous cinematography and solid turn by Emile Hirsch","Christopher McCandless, in a manner of existential terms, had it all really. He graduated from college, had $24 grand in tuition, and a possible future law career. He could do anything he wanted with his life. So, he followed his passions, mixed perhaps with some escapist connotation involving a wounded family history, and left on a solo trek across the 'wild' of America, eventually on a quest to Alaska. At that point, he used what little knowledge he had to live off the land, hunt for game, and be one with nature while camping out of an abandoned 'Magic Bus' vehicle. It's here that we see the story, told in a somewhat typical non-linear form, take shape around the intellectual scope of a quintessential Thoreau wannabe.",
246,19 March 2008,EijnarAmadeus,9," Thought-provoking, unforgettable, beautiful and unmissable.","This movie tells the story of Christopher McCandless, a brilliant student who burned his driver's license and credit cards, gave away all of his savings to charity and set off to find himself, traveling through the US under the nickname 'Alexander Supertramp'. Sean Penn's directional outings have earlier been relatively dark stories unfolded, but he has never been near so connected to the story as he's here - Penn gets under Chris' skin with a beautifully shot movie, keeping a thoughtful pace through its 2 hours and 25 minutes. The journey is fantastic, cutting himself from his estranged parents, Chris lets his wanderlust take him anywhere, he puts millions of miles under his heels as he encounters people and nature with charisma and adventurous belief - Emilie Hirsch executes the character perfectly, his deepened thoughts of Byron and Thoreau are poetically bent and his motivations seems unclear, so Penn relates to the grasping of Chris' roots to find the dark wake of the young man's sudden disappearance. And Penn uses Chris' narrating sister, Carine (Jena Malone) to reveal why he suddenly broke free from his parents and relatives - and as the months go by even his understanding sister starts questioning Chris and his motives, but she always reminds herself that this had to happen sometime, one way or the other Christopher McCandless was a restless soul who found solace in himself. But the history feels tragic when Chris realizes that he was wrong; he is in need for human connection all the way, but especially with the moving sequences of widower Ron Franz, Hal Holbrook's great portray is introduced as Chris' achievement of wisdom. Because Chris never tried reaching out for something so spiritually or heartfelt or deepened that he would sacrifice himself for the beauty of the wilderness and freedom of no nothing; at the very end he wrote an SOS in which he was in serious injury, and needed help. Christopher McCandless had a unique courage, and you can't help feeling affected as the movie's whispers will come back to you days after watching it. Rarely we see an American film so refreshed with love for the US yet somehow digging for something even stronger, darker and thoughtful with Chris' rapid soul in the crucial revelation - and the soundtrack of Eddie Vedder's remarkable songs gives Chris' another voice than his own, haunted and strong, dark and bright. 'Into the Wild' celebrates Christopher McCandless, for everything he stood for and everything he did.",

I do find it a shame that this wonderfully told story is the most unmoving story I can remember in recent history. I love the notion of following one's dream no matter what the cost but I can't help but feel that this kid just needed to be loved and in not feeling so ran from his pain. That is not following a dream, that is running from disappointment that he was not strong enough to deal with after a childhood of being spoiled.

I took some time off from College, bought a one way ticket to Alaska and lived out of a backpack for months before working on fishing boats so I suppose that I'm pretty qualified to make this statement: the kid was just plain stupid. Those that think so highly of this movie live their lives in Hollywood fantasyland, devoid of any idea of life out of a backpack. Penn romanticizes this kid and his choices, the perfect person to push fantasy over reality. Too bad this kid didn't find a healthier way to find his way in life.

257,30 May 2009,wl323,7, understand but not agree,"I was disappointed that most critiques of Into the Wild have romanticized the story way too much. The highlighted ideas, ranging from going back to nature/the innocence, being true, to abandoning materialism, plus the beautiful scenery gave me all the reasons to watch this movie, which is based on the true story of Chris McCandless. With these expectations in my mind, I could not have anticipated to see a young man, despite his curiosity for the meaning of life, waste himself by indulging in anger and extremes. Yes, the story tells us what led to the anger and we understand his pain. I also acknowledge the positive influence McCandless brought for the people he met on his journey. I am even impressed by his uncommonly high moral standard and his open mind to people living on the edge. But, his stubbornness and insistence to stay in the wild was due to his hatred and the urge to revenge his parents. His ultimate goal of finding the truth was a disguised, if not self-deceit, mission to prove his parents' wrongdoings. The hypocrites or even the society he talked about are not anybody but his parents. The ways he chose to find, to reveal, to use the truth all show that he just wanted to hurt his parents and make them guilty. Connecting to nature is one thing, but subjecting oneself to the wilderness without backup or a well thought plan is another. It is reckless and ignorant no matter how much courage or stamina is involved. It is a disheartening story, and definitely not romantic or poetic, with nothing worth glorification except the beauty of nature. I have a lot of empathy for the protagonist and his family, but find the so-called adventure pointless. In contrast, the subplots manage to be geared to the evolving of mutual growth for the characters, including Chris McCandless himself. It is a pity that the built-up of these growths did not sublime soon enough for him to make a rational choice. I sincerely believe that with his intelligence and sense of justice, Chris McCandless could have led a very meaningful life for himself and for the disadvantageous. I was feeling unusually upset when I saw him so blinded from other alternatives. It felt so sad when I looked at his dad break down. The greatest performance was found towards the end of the movie where William Hurt, who looked calm, stepping out of the house, inside which Mom was setting the table for Thanksgiving (or Christmas?) dinner. First a wide shot showed him looking up the sky. Then a close-up showed his face grimacing in pain with his bloodshot eyes. His whole body was drastically trembling. He was actually trying to stop his tears running down his face when he looked up in the previous wide shot. He tried so hard to repress his sadness but it turned out to be a break down. He fell onto the ground in the yard, sitting there with his tightly clinched fists twitching, and crying in total distress. What a heartbreaking scene The bright side on the whole is that, Chris McCandless eventually forgave his parents and felt love for them – upon his death.",

I believe he's an excellent actor and I can see his career going from strength to strength. I then began to learn about the true story of Christopher McCandless and his life. I have read articles from those that knew him and from what I have read Sean Penn has portrayed this young mans life down to a tee. The acting, filming, scenery and Eddie Vedders fantastic soundtrack are all amazing but the story itself is what does it. A mans strict refusal to be lured in by the evil in society leads to an epic journey of Self Development, proving that real strength lies within. This film will not only entertain, it will inspire.

Good acting.,"Didn't really know how to rate this.And it is hard to write an opinion for everybody here to read it without spoilers.The film is based on a true story.It certainly is an unusual story but I hated the way it was presented.We have a college graduate, Christopher McCandless who is very smart(because he read many books)and runs away from his family to make an adventurous journey to Alaska.In order to do this he takes a shortcut trough Mexico.He rejects civilization and things like money.So before starting the journey he burns the few bucks he has. Short after that he suddenly realizes that you actually need money to buy things and starts working at a farm to earn some of the greenbacks he so much hates.Later he works at Burger King who seem to hire illegal workers since he has no ID whatsoever(he destroyed his ID, driving license and credit cards in the beginning of the movie cos those things are part of civilization).In the movie McCandless is presented as a heroic 23 year old full of philosophy and wisdom adventurer, who cares only about nature and doesn't give a damn about things like money, family, love, society and similar human crap.He hates his family cos his dad got his mom pregnant while he was still married to another woman.He doesn't hate his sister but still doesn't bother to give her a call after being away for over two years.So after this time he finally reaches Alaska and starts living in a junk bus.After some deeper reading of Tolstoi he realizes that coming to Alaska was not a good idea and heads back to the humans. But his way back is cut by a river.So he has to stay in Alaska and starve to death.This movie worships stupidity, irresponsibility and ignorance!In the end of the movie McCandless was so pathetic that even the grizzly bear didn't bother to eat him.",

265,27 February 2008,valadas,7, Happiness only real when shared,"That's what the movie hero writes in his diary in the end. This movie tells the story of a young man who after graduating in university with very high marks decides to abandon home, family and everything and go to live into the wild in Alaska like if it was his promised land. He is pushed into that not only but what they call the lies of modern civilized life and social hypocrisy but also because, thinking like that, he is particularly hurt by his parents lies about their past private lives. While the movie progresses we hear his sister's voice off stressing the most important moments and aspects of his life. In my opinion the message the movie wants to pass is that there is a mistake to show revolt against society by running away to live with Nature and alone. In his course to Alaska our hero (who walks and hitch-hikes all the time) stops sometimes here and there to get occasional works that can give him a little money to enable him to support himself on his course. In those moments he creates bonds of friendship and love with lots of people but always rejects any possibilities of staying with them in his stubborn march to Alaska where he wants to spend at least a great part of his life in contact only with Mother Nature. He leaves lots of people who have become very fond of him, very unhappy with his absence. Mother nature is not always paradisiacal and may also be very cruel sometimes and even violent. And for instance the wild food it provides can be poisonous. Adding to the movie's credit are the beautiful landscape images and the splendid background music and songs of the country type.",

He has managed to craft himself a finer than fine film about a young man (played by Emille Hirsch)who is dissatisfied with the material world & strives to find a more pure existence in life. He gives away most of his belongings (including a sizable cash inheritance),takes up a backpack & takes to the open road to find himself. Along the way,he meets up with a variety of people (some good,others not so good,and some really bad). Does he find his proverbial nirvana? Well,you'll just have to see it to find out for yourself.

268,21 September 2007,king_ymk,4, Profoundly Boring and Pretentious,"""Into the Wild,"" has the ingredients that should lead to a good film; a talented cast, an Oscar-winning actor at the helm, and what should be the compelling story of a young man who left everything behind to find himself in the wilderness. Unfortunately, the movie is marred by several problems. One of them is the two hour and twenty minute running time. The film would greatly benefit if it were trimmed by thirty minutes. There are constant shots of Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless, standing on top of a mountain, bus, anything he can stand on and spreading his arms towards the sky. The film is also weighed down by an overly dramatic, pretentious voice over that reminds the viewer they're watching a movie every time they hear it. Sean Penn's direction is at times heavy-handed and self-conscious, which is surprising coming from an actor as gifted as Penn. Emile Hirsch is appealing but his performance has a self-awareness in certain key scenes that are meant to illuminate what drives Christopher. This is especially apparent in the scene with his parents, played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden, the first encounter with Catherine Keener's character, and the bar scene with Vince Vaughn. I have not read the book on which the movie is based, but probably the biggest flaw with the film is that Christopher McCandless comes off as a spoiled, self-righteous, whiner. The people Christopher meets along his journey, however briefly, are infinitely more interesting and engaging than he is. The best part of the movie, and the most meaningful, is the section with Hal Holbrook, who does a beautiful job. It's a shame the rest of the movie is not as seamless and unaffected. I know there are people who will find this film to be profound, and they are correct. It is profoundly boring and in love with itself.",

This film should touch a nerve in everyone, especially those of us who escaped dis-functional family homes. Really who could blame Christopher? Bravo to the real Chris and bravo x 10 to his on screen actor- Emile Hirsch. The soundtrack was also perfectly tied to the film.

271,18 November 2007,come2whereimfrom,7, A rubber road movie of self discovery,"As with Terrence Malick's 2005 film 'The New World' parts of Into the Wild come across like a poem on the screen, snowy landscapes, wild animals, flowing streams and breathtaking skies. I'm also a sucker for a voice-over and slow motion if used properly and here director Sean Penn does both to great effect which just adds to the poetic nature of the overall piece. Emile Hirsch should get an Oscar nomination for his role as Christopher McCandless the college graduate who gives away everything he has, college funds to Oxfam, cuts up his I.D. cards, burns his leftover dollars and embarks on the journey that will take him across America and eventually land him in Alaska. After graduating Christopher decides he want to leave society, find the true human spirit, and leave behind his privileged but stifling lifestyle and especially his overbearing and bickering parents. So without telling anyone he sets off destined to find himself. Told in chapters the film follows Christopher from the start where he re-names himself Alexander Supertramp to the final days in Alaska where he lives in the magic bus. Along the way he meets various characters that in some way help to shape him as he travels and as he grows from boy to man. As well as the stunning cinematography, great acting and fascinating story there is the soundtrack which is at times incredibly powerful, with original material from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder it hard to imagine some of the scenes without it as it is so integral to the plot. Cursed by intelligence and maybe slight madness Alex is documenting his time and when he's not writing he's reading Tolstoy and Kafka amongst others and it's not just his mind he needs to expand as he learns the skills he needs to fend for himself, collecting berries and hunting animals he soon discovers it's not as easy as it seems. But a firm sense of determination pushes him forward and sees him adapt to almost anything. The structure of the film is fragmented and jumps to different time periods which is what keeps you guessing right up until the parting shot which to me was unexpected and left me a little stunned. At two and half hours it is quite a long film but it never feels it and the best way to enjoy it is to let yourself go and immerse yourself fully in the experience. Into the Wild should stay with you long after you've seen it, who hasn't dreamt at some point of disappearing and living free from the shackles of modern life?

Based on the true story, twenty-two year old Christoper 'Chris' McCandless (Lords of Dogtown's Emile Hirsch) has just graduated from Emory University as a top student and athlete, but he abandons his normal lifestyle. He leaves behind his family, mother Billie (Pollock's Marcia Gay Harden), father Walt (William Hurt) and sister Carine (Donnie Darko's Jena Malone), all his possessions, and gave his entire $24,000 savings to charity. His life in twenty months becomes a series of endless walking and hitchhikes, like a drifter, under the new name ""Alexander Supertramp"", to reach his destination, the wilderness of Alaska. The story flashes forward occasional to where the place he has found to find self-discovery, appreciate the world around him and reflect on the ""unreal"" existence with his family. This location is situated in the middle of the Alaskan woods, inside an abandoned camper van, or ""bus"", and while we see him find new ways to hunt down animals for food and make it through the winter, it flashes back to see his life on the road. Along the way he meets various characters who shape his life ins their own individual ways, whether it be offering him a lift, passing on the road or river, or meeting him while stopping somewhere. These people include hippie couple Jan Burres (Being John Malkovich's Catherine Keener) and Rainey (Brian H. Dierker), harvest company owner Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn), teenager Tracy Tatro (Panic Room's Kristen Stewart), and possibly most significant, lonely retired leather worker Ron Franz (Oscar nominated Hal Holbrook). Despite surviving the winter, he finds the river he crossed is raging and he seems trapped, so with no way to get to animals he is forced to eat berries and fauna. He is devastated to discover from his book that what he has eaten is poisonous, and it causes not only nausea but starvation and exhaustion, and eventually he died isolated inside the bus, the text says he was found by hunters. Also starring the real Jim Gallien, the last person to see McCandless alive and The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis as Kevin. Hirsch gives a boyish but intuitive performance, Harden and Hurt do pretty well in their brief roles, the landscapes throughout make for great viewing, and the sense of wonder and sympathy for the lead character really resonate, a moving and certainly must see biographical adventure drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Editing, it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Guaranteed"", and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Michael Brook, Kaki King and Eddie Vedder.

274,3 May 2014,pavelb-968-44685,6, Appeal to youth but not age,"This over-long film has its moments (the cameo by Ben being enjoyable) but breaks down to yet another privileged kid abandoning all his blessings in a self-indulgent quest for finding his true self. Hirsch plays the part very well, no unnecessary facial expressions or gestures. His character even shows maturity with the people he meets – in particular the young girl singer. That maturity does not extend to himself, although there are ample opportunities for him to wake up. As with many run-aways, he decides who's to blame but somehow ends up lumping his sibling in the same pot. Of course, the misery and abandonment he cavalierly leaves behind takes a back seat to his quest for enlightenment. Hal Holbrook steals the show but is just another pawn to be sacrificed along the way. In fact, with the exception of a single experience, ""Super-tramp"" receives nothing but kindness and understanding from everyone he meets, but still he perseveres. The film is too long by about 20 minutes and should have had the entire river canyon sequence and associated scenes as cuttings on the editorial floor. I had the impression there were some religious-reference scenes that were edited out – if so, thank you Mr. Penn. In the end, McCandless's life can be seen as a futile waste, having little or no relevance to anyone – not even himself. Should this film have been made? I think yes, it is a warning.",

Featuring Sean Penn in the directorial seat, this is the true story of Christopher McCandless who took the name Alexander Supertramp as he hitchhiked across the country to Alaska in the early nineties. The film is over two hours long and a bit lengthy to watch when stuck in the middle but rewardingly good when finished. It is like The Motorcycle Diaries in a sense only without the political stance and the motorcycle and company. Emile Hirsch is a stunning discovery in this brilliant career move. Although opinions on the main character's views vary especially considering the conclusion to his journey, the important thing about this film is that it makes you think about your own humanity and precepts and whether or not life has become more than a game of survival for you.

Krakauer makes sure his reader is aware that, despite his meticulous research, we are dealing with educated guesswork. The plot synopsis on IMDb states: ""Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life."" This is simply wrong. The fact is these people were shaped by Chris, but failed to influence him in any fundamental way that would divert him from his ill-fated course.

However, the longer this film went on, the more apparent it became that the central character was essentially a ''man child"" who takes the literature he reads too literally. Throughout the film, he makes countless of irresponsible and reckless decisions that go against what the film portrays him to believe making it more difficult to relate or sympathize with him. His actions mirrored that of a teenager and its worrying that the majority of the public see him as an inspiration. And the irony to how this film ends!

The rest of the cast is first rate and Oscar winners include William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden. If you like Kristin Stewart, she does a very good job here as well. The cast is first rate and the writing is as well. The film's structure has a lot of flashbacks to the past of Christopher Candleless's life at home in West Virginia; his journey in America; and his time in Alaska. The actor, Emilie Hirsch, did an excellent job in playing the main character who seeks meaning in life without connection to society. In the film, we see what caused him to become the man he was and why he yearned a sense of freedom from money, family, and people in general. I haven't read the book but it's based on a true story about this remarkable young man who donated his life savings to charity and took off to see the country.

283,18 February 2017,hewilson2-72-796868,4, Fabulous Story Ruined by Hollywood,"This film is the portrayal of the life of a troubled young man, haunted by the thoughts and words of authors past and how their thoughts create within him, an inability to form meaningful relationships. Based on a fascinating true story, Penn nevertheless finds a way to destroy it. The real life subject, Chistopher McCandless, a recent college grad, sets out to ""find himself"" but in doing so, thoroughly and completely - and I do mean completely - destroys every prior relationship in his life. In the film he is portrayed as a Christ-like healer, saving the emotional and spiritual lives of everyone with whom he comes in contact despite the fact he remains aloof from them all and refuses to share his past with any of them. The closest he comes to any thing resembling a meaningful relationship is his implied sexual dalliance with his Oedipal Hippy Mom via which he totally destroys her relationship with her Hippy dude. Despite this, the film continuously portrays him in some sort of Messianic glow along with his Hippy benefactors who despite having no visible means of support, manage to own, maintain and fuel an RV as well as feed him for weeks at a time. And in typical liberal Hollywood fashion, Mc Candless' parents are economically successful upper middle class white college grads and therefore evil. They are featured as the exclusive source of all the young man's troubles with no consideration given to the possibility that he might have his own psychopathology. The film is well acted. The story is incredible. But the direction is plodding, slow and predictable. Full on, full steam Hollywood liberalism all the way: Bad parents. Christ-like abused kid sets out to find himself and saves everyone he meets along the way. Meh.",

He lives off the land and gets a little help from others by hitchhiking. He travels everywhere and gets a job driving a tractor to make a little money for his quest to Alaska. He also meets two hippies a couple of times who help him. He breaks this old guy's heart by leaving since he was his only friend. Chris also takes a journey in a kayak all the way to Mexico.

Nature should never be underestimated or minimized in any way in road trips of this kind. The hippie message of the film is quite clear, and brought back fond memories of my youth. It also brought back recollections of mistakes that were made during that era as well by us who dropped out and tuned in.
Being a tramp is not a great adventure. Ask any of the thousands of families who lost loved ones during the Great Depression (see Grapes of Wrath). Usually, being a tramp is a gradual decline into oblivion. Nature is not free. There is a price to be paid for everything in life. Burning money is not symbolic; it is just plain stupid. There are millions on the earth who would love to have that money so they could eat a good meal. This young man's life was tragic, but there was a lesson to be learned from it. People born of parents who are not privileged would never attempt anything like this. But his final words were too late to save him; happiness is only worthwhile if it is shared.",

295,17 August 2008,Roman-Nies,8, The end of an idealist,"Glorious or inglorious, that is here the question. Alex Supertramp is a down-shifter par excellence, who still needs at first the non-down-shifters for his gradual self-realization. He is an adventurer and freedom-seeker and he is not satisfied with little. He resigns materialism, the urges and lies of the American society and tries to break out into the wild nature, to experience ""real"" life. To late it dawns upon him that nature is no garden Eden and that some attainments, not so much of the civilization, rather of the socialization are reasonable. It is a surprising end that Krakauer describes with the help of the diary of the unfortunate. The movie is here not so much stringent. The end of Alex is cruel and shows that it is vain to romanticize nature. Unfortunate could be the wrong word. If Alex would not have renounced such reasonable artifacts like a map, which he intentionally left back, or at least if he had informed about the locality, he could have made it easily to survive. That he wanted it is shown clearly by his desperate struggle against death. Experienced adventurers always calculate with emergency cases when they plan their special tours. Idealism needs carbohydrates! Alex was sheepish, overambitious maybe simply silly. Yes, exaggerated idealism is sometimes nothing else than density. But it would be wrong to judge this young man. He made a decision and he paid for it. Did he find self-determination? No, no man can exist for himself, the freedom some are searching is nothing but an abstract and nature is not nice at all! She is like she is. Without man she is nothing at all. Nature is there for man, but she does not know it. But man has to know it. The sojourn in nature is a good opportunity for self-reflection. Krakauer implies that Alex could have reached the goal to live his idealism until the very bitter end. He is not different to mountaineers who notwithstanding the risks want to have their extreme experience. There is nothing left than the hope, that instead of the romantic transfiguration of a life in the wilderness or the intended union with nature  a thing that cannot exist  in the face of death the simple recognition prevailed that life, that loves and can be loved is the most sensible and praiseworthy. A lot of knowledge for a young man in our times. A recommendable film and book. Krakauer did not draw conclusions. He did not want to interpret too much into it. Perhaps because he is guilty himself of extreme adventures.",

On the positive side, I found Catherine Keener's performance as Jan Burres completely convincing. I enjoyed the Vedder soundtrack, and I thought certain cinematic elements were beautiful (though not always serving to the storyline) such as the night shots in L.A. However, there was a lot a didn't care for. The voice over narration by Carine McCandless (Jena Malone) didn't work for me because the story was not hers to tell, and the narration together with the rapid cutting within scenes and the frequent temporal shifts left me unable to identify with either Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) or the viewpoints of the characters that Chris met along his way as I was able to do with, for example, the supporting characters in Agnès Varda's Vagabond (1985). Being unable to identify with any of the characters, I was left in the position of an outside observer and here Penn failed to make much of this position either. For example, Penn did not use the camera to show us anything that Chris failed to figure out. Krakauer's book makes clearer that the magic bus was not as isolated as Chris believed it to be, and that the seasonal river that cut off Chris's planned departure route could have been crossed upstream. Penn could have unobtrusively shared this information with the viewer, but chose to withhold it for the purpose, I suspect, of romanticizing Chris's adventure.",

308,26 February 2010,ptb-8,7, The Little Punce,"Sean Penn's film about Christopher McCandless who shed his college and suburban life for a fatal nomadic journey is a really disturbing and absorbing film. It is extraordinarily well made and acted by Emile Hirsch. However what struck and disturbed me more than anything was how cruel and self absorbed and selfish our hero behaved. He caused pain beyond belief to his well meaning parents and sister, he burned his money instead of giving it to a poor family who needed it, he squatted in self absorbed diary bliss, he rejected all advances of friendship that did not benefit his mood at the time, ... in fact a good moment to demonstrate how unconscious he was of anyone else's feelings is late in the film when he cajoles an old man to climb up and across a really rocky and difficult mountain blissfully unaware that the hike is physically beyond the old man. He simply has no clue to another person's feelings. So our hero does really silly and dangerous things in his Kerouac style adventure down rapids and on freight trains and hitching lifts and staying as he chooses... and causing heartbreaking grief for his family. I was appalled to find this was a true story and it is to Penn's skill as a film maker that the astonishing selfishness of McCandless' self absorbed pilgrimage is spelled out as clearly as it is. Our hero might have had some teen issues with his family, but the rejection and ignorance of their feelings is utterly vile. Only a rich white teenager could behave in such a rotten way believing in this self righteous bubble that his selfish quest is some misguided noble back-to-basics adventure. In a film of many great scenes the standout was his tortured despairing father collapsing on the road in the suburb where they still lived. The hurt this boy caused! the terrible agony of not knowing where he was, and this brat thought all that was OK because HE was on a selfish quest. Penn's film is a great one and an expose of the sort of ruthless inconsiderate cruelty one generation worries about for the younger.",

As it is, it's a compelling narrative with exceedingly colorful photography and some excellent stop-motion interspersed. Characters of the film seem plausible, simple, and down-to-earth. The lead character ""Alex SuperTramp"" is stubbornly determined. Also Dialog was succinct, sometimes poignant....and actual narration expository. However It's becoming more and more disappointing to declare movies problematic due to music. Not all the music in Into the Wild was gratingly irritating, but many of the interlude cuts were totally subtractive. The last thing I wanna hear is MTV-type framed folksy stylized singing littering over a film like bad garbage. At least half a dozen interludes were interlaced with it - enough of a problem that the fast-forward was button got used. Why cant directors, stick to real dialog? Or employ music as an enhancement rather than a forced interpretation. Melodies during motion pictures are fouled by lyrics - these aren't commercials!!

Sean Penn has delivered a masterpiece with his incredible direction. Honestly, this is one of the most uplifting, visually aesthetic and profoundly touching films I have ever seen. Standout performance by Emile Hirsch and pretty much the entire cast. The soundtrack by Eddie Vedder is top-notch. Cinematography at It's peak, once again. So I sincerely urge everyone to give this a go, if you haven't. This is a sublime experience which one can't exactly put to words but deeply relate to, anytime.

341,4 March 2008,dead47548,10, Jaw-dropping.,Immensely inspiring. It's a beautiful film filled with lush cinematography and superb performances. The driving force has got to be in the story. Christopher McCandless' theory of life is one that I couldn't relate to more and seeing how his life played out was extremely compelling. Emile Hirsch was...sensational. A performance that held so many emotions on it's shoulders and combined them flawlessly. In one brief smile I felt all the happiness that he gathered from the wild in my heart. This sheer joy and inspiration was contrasted painfully with the heartache of his final days on Earth which Hirsch again captured expertly in nothing more than his eyes. The shot near the beginning of his eyes tearing up as he sees the beauty of a herd of animals roaming in the snow is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. I can't describe how much I loved Hirsch in this. It's a poetic and wonderfully uplifting tale that had me in awe the entire duration. I should also mention that Eddie Vedder's songs were breathtaking.,
342,21 September 2007,beckwith10,8," Lovely Film, but Have to Ask: Has Penn Absorbed the Lessons of Herzog?","Sean Penn has made a lovely film, probably the finest of his directing career. The casting is superb, with some especially fine work from Catherine Keener and an astonishingly moving performance from veteran performer Hal Holbrook, who doesn't leave a dry eye in the house and (no hype here) is a likely bet for bagging the Oscar in the supporting category. But the film belongs to the charming, charismatic Emile Hirsch who does a fine job embodying the film's free form, wandering - and ultimately reckless - spirit. On that note, I'll mention the uncanny parallels between ""Into the Wild"" and Herzog's ""Grizzly Man,"" both films, based on true events, concerned with real life idealistic loner-nomads who find their untimely demise in the wilds of Alaska. McCandless' and Treadwell's stories deal with many of the same themes. Herzog, who has dealt with the themes of trial by will in the face of zealous individual idealism in prior films, knows this ground well, and viewed Treadwell with a dry, discerning eye, both bemoaning his tragedy while indulging little sentiment for Treadwell's quixotic, absurdly romantic delusion about his relationship to nature. Penn is too smart not to recognize these lessons, yet, a cautionary romanticism does creep into ""Into the Wild"" and the film can be seductive - beautifully seductive at moments. Though moved by this film, I am unclear how to come to terms with my ambivalence concerning McCandless' idealism. Granted, unlike Herzog, Penn is functioning as a narrative filmmaker, not a documentarian, hence has an obligation to render McCandless story with a compelling, fully dimensional depiction; any good film maker would recognize this task. But what is Penn's allegiance to McCandless idealism? It is not difficult to recognize the appeal McCandless' story might hold for someone like Penn, something of an idealist (if not activist) himself and clearly, this film is close to Penn's own heart. But I am unclear how Penn, as a maturing film maker, has come to terms with his own ambivalence on the limits of idealism and the seductions of its inherent fatalism. Perhaps future films by Penn will give greater clarity to this.",

344,30 October 2007,richard_sleboe,8, A lot more than he needed,"By graduating from college, Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) pays his dues to society and, more specifically, to his by-the-book family. But since all social promises are false and all families are psychotic, he sees no other choice but to leave his old life behind, Bobby McGee style. Interludes at the hippie front and a stint at small-town happiness as a junior craftsman remain nothing but stopovers on a journey all his own. Not a lot of scripts could get away with lines like ""When you forgive, you love, and when you love, God's light shines on you"" or ""Happiness only real when shared"". Sean Penn's screenplay does. Think ""The Go-Getter"" meets ""Grizzly Man"", with overtones of Philippe Lioret's ""I'm fine"". Fine performances all around.

Christopher McCandless, the main character, leaves everything behind but what he can carry and embarks on a journey across America that takes him to the wilds of Alaska.

I was pondering my own children and whether my feelings to hope to see them succeed and become everything I think they can be would ever push them too hard and they would just walk away like Christopher did. Well I sure hope not, but like all these things they can happen to the most well intentioned people. Though honestly their lives did sound pretty mixed up, you can understand how a someone with a delicate soul simply couldn't survive in it. You are really hooked in to Christopher and his life, like those of his parents. Everyone is portrayed in such a sensitive and real way that you really feel everyone's perspective.

355,18 March 2008,ymghali,9, elevates the soul,"This is a straight ace film, never boring and very clean. It truly elevates the soul. The great scenery is well captured. There was a scene where people were singing country songs, you could almost ""smell"" the aroma of the open air gathering. Running away from family and conventional society in search of one's identity and aim in life is by no means a new theme, but the authenticity of the story and the director's deep understanding of his work never makes you board. The didactic element is spelled out clearly because ""Chris"" came to the conclusion that ""happines is real only when shared"". While people may have virtual names and characters in today's cyber space; while we may sometimes shrink inside ourselves or run away from our surrounding conditions; this film comes to say: live your own life, no disguise no running away, be surrounded by people because this is what life is all about, sharing happiness. The performance was amazing. But the most important thing is that ,since it's a true story, it's a tribute to the young man whose adventures made him realize that life is simpler than it seems to be. Just ask yourself if you can burn the little cash you have and go out on the road, think if you can resist physical temptations when the opportunity arises. can you abandon everything and go out and look for the meaning of life? Shooting the moose without being able to feed on it was the biggest tragedy of Cris's life. How guilty does that make us feel. We only realize the importance of food towards the end of the film. Thanks for all involved in the making of this wonderful work of art.

Emile Hirsch abandons his wealthy upbringing and treks to Alaska without money. Structure chronicles the people he encounters and the affect he renders but he finds shelter in an abandon bus. Director Sean Penn creates realism, and like one of his previous films The Pledge, he sends the hero down a downward spiral of despair. Hirsch is excellent as someone feeling pressured within his upbringing and seeks escape. It is an experience in survival and consequence as he quickly adapts to a new lifestyle. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden play his verbally abusive parents who pushed too hard and face a future of regret and grief. Jena Malone plays his sister who understood him. She receives letters from him but she refuses to inform her parents of his whereabouts. There are numerous notable cameos of actors portraying those Hirsch encounters and impacts with his story. Perhaps the biggest standout is Hal Holbrook whose bond with Hirsch is so strong that he views him like a son. The conclusion is hopeless making one wonder why anyone would give up the privileges of his former life to go into the wild of freedom, beauty, survival, despair, and ultimately death.

Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) ""Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,"" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.",

This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land.

Of parent's expectations and society's reliance on definition by what we do. He graduates college, donates all his savings to charity, erases all record of his existence and runs away from home to be in the wild. The justifications for Christopher's journey into the beyond are slowly revealed through flashbacks and memories of his family, through interactions and friendships with a range of colourful characters along the way. He is ultimately selfish, passionate, angry, and frustrated. But he is smart, reflective and free. It appears that he wants to anger those around him to prove himself to them, to prove himself to the natural elements. In this way he is brave and arrogant but he fancies himself a thinker. His actions and adventures end up causing harm to himself and minor setbacks in his journey. Each episode he makes is such that of life  a grand plan carried away into detours where the wind blows. For all this time in the wild he never communicates with family but forms new relationships with complete strangers, who take to Christopher's infectious and vivacious attitude to life.

382,4 September 2007,edorapietrafesa,5, not bad but not great either,"i read this book about 4 years ago. i randomly found it at a coffee shop/bookstore in Greenville NC where you could read books for free while sipping a cappuccino and eating a scone for $10. ha-ha. the book was engrossing and as my older sister went to Emory university as well, i was fascinated by this character/real guy who was brilliant and graduated from that rigorous university with honors and then decided to scrap a career for living as a nomad. the book is extremely well written and although i like Emile Hirsch, he was poor casting. he can act, but i felt he's too young to even play Chris who from the book seemed a TALL, ahead of his time, cocky college graduate. Hirsch is too cocky, too full of himself and sort of knee jerk about everything. the Chris in the book is much more thoughtful, calculating, and mature than he's portrayed. also, the character development is bad. you never get inside Chris at all. this book is hard to adapt. because you don't want to pass up the godliness of that landscape that Chris traversed and Penn does encapsulate it in his filming. however, the movie is more an adventure story than a true biography (which it should have been) of a unique young brash man who was in over his head. i didn't even like the casting of hurt or harden either. i again pictured his parents to be more like perhaps Donald Sutherland/Mary Tyler Moore (i'm serious). it's a watchable movie and entertaining. but if you had read the book, it's simply a huge disappointment because it doesn't even skim the surface of the rite of passage this guy tries to take and fails at as nature overwhelmed and defeated him. the oldest story ever told.",

While the narrative is strong, it works in glorious harmony with Penn's free-form visual generosity. The first 20 minutes or so are filled with beautiful images of nature and there's sparse exposition and dialogue, with shots that feel plucked from the cutting-room floor of Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven.

This makes it more difficult to absorb because in some moments you gain a sense of empathy and identity and then it moves into another direction.

400,19 January 2012,drqshadow-reviews,9," Truthful or Not, Penn's Version Grasps at Concepts Bigger Than McCandless Himself","Sean Penn's adaptation of the adventures of Christopher McCandless, who left society behind to aimlessly roam the western United States, find himself and try his hand at a life off the land in the remote Alaskan wilderness. At first preachy and morose, there's a tipping point early in the picture where I couldn't help but feel something for McCandless and his naive quest to subsist wholly on morals, philosophy and the kindness of strangers in place of tangible food and water. Presented as a sort of messiah figure, the errant youth touches the lives of a broad range of individuals over the course of his travels, preaches the gospel of live-and-let-live and uncovers the difficulties associated with the tramp's lifestyle in a society so concerned with protecting its citizenry from themselves. There's a lot to be learned from Christopher's path, both positive and negative, and Penn shies away from neither in this careful, convincing pseudo-documentary. It can be so enveloping at times that the sudden appearance of a recognizable actor or two along the way feels awkward and strange. A very solid effort with something to say, I only wonder if it may have been better served by a full cast of unknowns. Eddie Vedder's perfectly matched original soundtrack deserves a special mention.",

404,19 May 2020,Elcid_Asaei,9, You'll find yourself in this film...,"Re-Watched 'Into the Wild' today. I last saw it upon its release back in 2007 when I was finishing my masters and stuck in a job I pretended to like, and a persona I pretended to be. I saw it with an old friend, whom due to my fault, I lost contact with many years ago. But to get back to this film, the gravity of this personal story and its truthful nature to the person it was based on goes to the very essence of humanity and how powerful our need is to find ourselves within each other, even when we do our best to escape one-another. Particularly at this moment in time, when we are asked to be apart from one-another, the truth is we can dive in to the deepest voids or climb up to the highest peaks, but at the end of every sunset and beginning of ever sunrise, true happiness is our ability to share our experiences with one another in person. Whilst social media provides us with an instant means to share our experiences and virtually connect with each other, for many of us it is a convenient illusion of choice, which the character in this film ironically did not face in 1992, when he made his fateful journey into the wild. Like the character in 'The Alchemist', he ventures to find his personal treasure, and on the way he learns truths that compliment and challenge his ideals. A story I have come across so often in fiction and reality that this film captures so well in a person who dared to live it.

410,17 February 2008,timothyhogg,3, Another failed attempt at McCandless,"Finally, after months of resistance, I have decided to watch Into The Wild. Please see my previous comments about my thoughts on the film before proceeding with this review of the film itself. Now, let me start by saying that already, just 20 or so minutes into this film, I have already come to the conclusion that the character of McCandless was not cast very closely to the person I see as McCandless when I think of this film. Emilie Hirsh is too young and too well groomed to be playing that part of McCandless, who most certainly had an air of hippiness to him in the book. Hirsch is not able to carry that as well because he doesn't look like he has been living the life of the vagabond at all. Penn does a good job or casting his parents and sister, who certainly have covered the wealthy parent's part quite exceptionally. These are the types of parents that almost anyone I know would certainly cause resistance. This perfect casting of the parents only makes Hirsch's character seem more off base. The film yearns to make a bigger deal out of the ever so tragic upbringing of McCandless than the book. According to the film, the love story of his parents was all a lie and his father was actually married to another woman when he and Chris' mother met. There was even another son following the birth of Chris by his former wife, all which leads to inevitable conclusion that this is what led this guy into this journey into the Alaskan bush. I suppose that is the central issue that I have always had with this story. In the book, Kraukuer used the McCandless story to chronicle his own personal story of man vs nature (of course he survives). The film makes the same mistake in attempting to insert a sub-narrative of the film, which is McCandless vs himself and his upbringing. We don't need to have this possibility spoon fed to us, but the film goes out of its way to explain that McCandless was a silver spoon with problems and these problems are what drives him on this pathway to discovery. This simply does not work for me. From my experience, man v nature occurs not so much because of our past, but more so because we resist what we might become if we do not take a moment of our lives and attempt to answer the questions of our own existence. I find now that I am older and past that confusing point in my life that it is essential to get off the grid for awhile and see what life is about other than what is programmed for us to do. In order to begin to understand consumption, you have to starve first. Too many people I know today have never really taken this journey. Instead, they look to sport of celebrity to fulfill that need we all have to be individuals or within a group. The story that Penn has crafted is a good one, if it weren't supposed to be based on someone else's life. The sad part of the movie is that this was someone's life and I think he would be morbidly offended at how he was presented in this film. At times this film is so simple it almost works, but then there are other moments where it so Hollywood that its reminiscent of a Calvin Klein commercial. Another thing that demands to be mentioned is McCandless' lack of communication to his family, specifically his sister, who seemed to not deserve this intentional disappearance. This coupled with the fact that he died about three miles from the main road, leads me to think about my original thoughts on the book: What makes this story worthy of such massive consumption? What is the moral of this story? McCandless always come off the same way, as a kid who was always given everything, which he rejected. Then, as he falls off the grid, he ends up dying from his own mistakes. Perhaps that is why this story is so consumable, because the person that lived it is not there to tell the story from his perspective. However, Penn's issues with telling the story are multiple. The flashbacks to a better time take away from the loneliness that McCandless must have felt from a couple of simple mistakes takes away from the moment that we should have to truly get close to the character. Factual errors when telling the life story of someone is simply unacceptable. Penn does this several times in order to keep consistency with the film. The last fifteen minutes of the film are boarder line farcical in their interpretation of the end. The way that Penn sets up the story, using flashbacks instead of real time, doesn't allow the viewer as close to the character as we should be with such an emotional plight. It would make more sense to tell the story in a chronological order, without all of the kitsch and more of the change as it happens in McCandless. It seems that the audience is supposed to automatically have feeling for this character, which I have a difficult time doing. . The repeated guitar riff from the introduction gets to be overbearing by the end of the film",
411,30 August 2014,Seraphion,8," Modern era prodigal son, with a different ending","This movie depicts the dream of most of us, despite the wrong reasons its being done for. I enjoy all the great sets and locations all across the USA I this movie. What's even greater is that the movie interacts more with the location, not just like any other movies which only take the location as a background picture. I really like how the movie uses the length of its duration to really emphasize the story into building up the details such as the characters and background story. The movie is indeed a great experience in watching. It's quite rare for me to give a score rating of 8 and above, but for this one, I was certain after watching just about a quarter of it. Emille Hirsch did a nice job in staying the fit and total for this movie. Jena Malone did just enough of a presence and help the flashbacks get a better sense to them, Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt acted the completing set for the story nicely enough.

The look of the film is absolutely beautiful. Think Hal Ashby directing a Jack London novel. Eddie Vedders voice echoes through the entire score which adds an emotional flair.

413,13 January 2008,rugg-1,9, missing the point by a mile?,"I saw ""Into the Wild"" last night and have to regard it as one of the best American films I have seen, part of a tradition that reaches all the way back through American cinema with its early use of the Western landscape, but even further back into American literature, not only Thoreau but also Hawthorne and Emerson and Twain. Some viewers seemed to focus primarily on what they take to be the ""stupid idealism"" of the main character, who would have survived if he had only had a map or should have written to his parents. This is fiction, people, though based on a real story. Such comments remind me of readers of Huckleberry Finn who note that if Huck and Jim had navigated the raft reasonably, Jim would have been home free by page 76. Penn makes rather a large point of the pain inflicted by McCandless' actions, by the way. He also makes a point of showing how McCandless is young and at times, clueless. The film does not make a god of the protagonist. It does point up rather vividly how our culture, in its breathless and mindless pursuit of more building, more possessions, more detritus, and less confrontation with the real (the wild, both within and without) drove one young man (well, several, if you count Thoreau and Huck and countless literary others) out of society and into the open.",

Based on the true story of a talented, intellectual idealist who pushes back against the conventions & false rewards of modern life. For a debut project for director and screenwriter Sean Penn this is one impressive film. Waiting ten years to bring it to fruition in order to get McCandless family's approval clearly paid off and I'm sure gave Penn the confidence to tell Chris' story authentically and with all the brutal honesty it needed. For while this is often a achingly beautiful story illustrating humanity at it's best it also is cautionary in many ways. Chris McCandless was a special, unique, highly intelligent young man and what he could have done and given the world with his gifts was endless. The fault was not his own, as so often happens he was born into a family who life view was so juxtaposed & painfully contrasting to his own that he saw no other way to way to 'live' his truth than to literally and metaphorically disappear into the wild of Alaska.",

418,2 July 2015,raulfaust,7, Beautiful like diamonds in the forest,"People have always told me good about this picture, and due to its presumably intelligent subject, I decided watching it last night. Chris is an apparently regular American guy, whose life was once designed to repeat the ordinary lifestyle. However, Chris doesn't agree with the American dream, and starts living his life in the nature. Obviously, he goes through some bad moments, which is usual to happen when submitting someone to a complete new environment. In fact, this guy never gives up on his dreams, and that's one of the qualities he has. The photography directing is amazing, developing plenty of beautiful and relaxing moments. Overall directing, on the other hand, isn't that careful. For instance, it feels extremely implausible to see Hirsch's character changing his clothes all the time-- especially because the clothes are very fancy. Sometimes it just seemed he carried a closet in his packs. As far as I know, people on trips tend to carry just a few things, otherwise, the bag would be too heavy to carry on their backs. However, this poor detail doesn't spoil the film's qualities, so I can surely recommend it to those who enjoy adventure movies, especially involving nature. Congratulations to the team!",

That's what I thought of ""Into the wild"" the first time I saw it: I found it beautifully shot, owner of breathtaking images that tried to dissimulate its dramatic and ideological imperfections. I also thought of it as a film where ideology and drama where the same thing. Now, on a second viewing I've found a lot more, primarily because I was able to separate the dramatic part from the ideology. Ideologically, I still think it's pretty basic, but it's so dramatically powerful that it buries the ideals, or something like it. We worry about the fate of a character whose life choice (which involves living by himself in Alaska with the sole company of nature and nothing else as a final destination) has been defined by an ideal –a philosophy- and yet I find the places he goes to, the things he witnesses and the characters he encounters, more interesting than the words he speaks and the quotes he cites from a dozen books.

Sean Penn's meticulous direction and eloquent screenplay take us on a cinematic journey quite unlike anything we've seen before. This is not an easy watch...there are several moments in this film depicting what Chris has to do to survive in the wilderness that completely redefine the phrase ""roughing it"" and definitely make this a film not for all tastes. but if you can stomach it, the journey is worth it and will leave a lump in the throat. Emile Hirsch is impressive in the physically and emotionally demanding role of Chris, probably the strongest performance of his career. Oscar winners William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden appear as Chris' parents and Vince Vaughn, Catherine Keener, and in a performance that earned him his first Oscar nomination, Hal Holbrook, also score in brief supporting roles.

""More than love, money, faith, fame, beauty, give me the truth. Truth makes us free and leaves people free!"" This phrase said in the film can be used to personify the moral of the film, all that human is dispensable for Christopher, because this holds him within a system making it impossible to connect with himself and with nature, this is exposed several times in the film Christopher, in a completely involuntary and unpretentious way, enters and changes the lives of all who interact with him, even if only for a few moments, for all can see the true ""I"" in Christopher, And when he says that ""Happiness is only true when shared"" it does not refer to social relations, for happiness is not there, and sharing comes with the world. Technically ""In the Wild"" is epic, if using dozens of visual techniques in its two and a half hours the film seems to be much bigger than it is, but not because of the negative aspect, because the film is not tiring, but because of the amount of Past reflection, with a cold but beautiful photograph, a good mix of sound, an assembly that counterposes a slow pace with accelerated not leaving the viewer to fall into monotony, and of course, its soundtrack, that besides being beautiful, rhythm and fit Perfectly the film, is not yet for free, because all the songs reflect moments of the film and his letters talk to Christopher and the viewer. The actor Emile Hirsch, in addition to being very similar to the real Christopher McCandless, does well in the film, the same looks at the beginning that he will not be able to handle the dramatic charge that the film asks, but it is only in the impression, with his irreverent way and His delusions, Emile sends well and holds the stride, nothing more, save a highlight for the supporting actors who are all wonderful.

462,8 January 2021,OneAnjel,10, Poignant story told with love of the adventure,"Every few years, I find myself watching this film again. It always moves me. Penn has a real ability to build Chris' journey as a cinematic poem to help us understand the draw of the wild -- which is nothing new, thus great books about it far into the past. It's where we are all from, after all; that beautiful bond with the oneness of God's wilderness where we can reconnect to the truth of who we are. Chris was not alone in feeling that connection even more strongly than someone with a happy, trouble-free life. The call of the wild is eons old and sometimes ends in tragedy, though not always. Despite not being allowed to sit next to a stranger in a restaurant in 2020, we are still allowed to climb El Capitan in Yosemite by the thousands each year, or sky dive off Half Dome, kayak into rapids of Big Drops... I mean, just driving a car is one of the most deadly things we do every day but no one tells us that we are romanticizing death by participating. So to see anyone outline this film as making Chris some hero tells me they didn't really understand the film. We need not know the family dynamics to simply learn about this lifestyle, often embarked upon by young men. Krakauer, the author of the book that captured Penn's imagination, has lamented that he was the catalyst for hundreds of people to injure themselves, lose their lives, and desecrate the iconic bus that sheltered Chris. But in my estimation, what he did was honor Chris' memory and try to tell his story. In many ways, it is the story of how those of higher intelligence don't -- can't -- necessarily perceive life in the limited way that the mediocre majority do. Anyone who sees this film as being about a selfish arrogant young man is actually the one being selfish, trying to force Chris to be something they expect him to be. Oh, the irony. Oh, the utter lack of compassion they claim was his but which they own themselves. I can't say enough about how this film moved me and I would like to believe that those responsible for telling the story feel honored, all in all.",

This movie is about a middle class suburban college student who actually did it. He eventually painfully starves to death alone in a bus inexplicably abandoned in the remote Alaskan wilderness so it is a bit of bummer. However, the two and half hours that lead up to his final stand are a fascinating study of someone who has either the courage or craziness to attempt what 100% of people fantasize about doing but 99.9% would not.

What made the book so interesting was the author's investigation and guesswork about where McCandless was at given points of time and what he must have been thinking of therein (Chris' notes were nowhere near a diary let alone a narrative of his story). Such might make a good documentary but might not be much in the way of drama. Still, this film inherits Jon K's best intentions toward our young hero. In this sense, both the book and the movie share the celebration of reckless, idealistic but well intentioned youth - along with all its folly, stubbornness, narcissism, etc. Kudos for not going overboard on anti-cultural, ecological themes. Might have been a four star affair if it had left out the ""bad-parents-made-me-do-it"" motif.",

It attempted to make the two of them sympathetic characters but it didn't work. It just sounded like a spoiled kid making excuses and trying to claim they had this horrible childhood when they didn't. Any casting of Kristen Stewart is a mistake. She has no acting ability. She's always monotone and expressionless. The soundtrack also attempted to make the movie meaningful but made it overdone and sappy. The best part was the main character getting beat up by the self appointed border patrol guy. I may keep in mind the weight loss tips as evidenced by the many scenes of his belt tightening or making new holes in the leather - walk a lot and live on water and plants. I also feel that McCandless's death was suicide by starvation in an attempt to martyr himself.",

We all can relate to the true story lead character Chris McCandless(he changed his name to Alexander Supertramp for his sojourns), innocent, naive and youthfully stupid as we all were at that age, expecting the whole world and it's peoples to be our friend and nurturer and helpfully allow us to create a personal Utopia. Sadly, when we finally grow up, we see life doesn't turn out that way. It's filled with a lot of hard work and compromises, which we start to see realistically somewhere in our mid-20's or so. Alex didn't get old enough to see that truth, as he and Grizzly Man met the same fate due to poor judgement coming from just being young and dumb, and not seeing that their youthful utopian world view must be adjusted, compromised and modified greatly in order to live successfully later on in this world. Even most 60's hippies(the smart ones) who did the same vagabond thing saw that eventually.

Christopher clearly was born too late- he epitomizes what we were like in the 60's and 70's- a time of innocence with a quest for simplicity.

There are good performances all around, from Emile Hirsch, who does a great job as the care free McCandless, to the side characters, some of whom we only see for a couple scenes but all leave an impression. It's a fairly long film but that runtime feels deserved and without it this would be a lesser movie, it takes it's time and every minute feels deserved. The cinematography is good, really showing the sweeping majesty of the American country side and I enjoyed the flashbacks and narration that revealed why McCandless did what he did.

This guy was not an idiot. He grew up in a family that had many problems and when Chris was old enough he decided he wanted to do something in his life that was different than most. He was going out to have a ""spiritual revolution"" as stated in the movie. He wanted to live off the land in Alaska, with no modern provisions. And, I am sure it was not an attempt to have a movie made about him. To me this guy is a hero. He is someone that most of us strive to be and will never be. He was a man that adventured out on his own, had a hell of a time and made a mistake that cost him his life. And it could happen to any of us if we were to try what he did. But, I have more respect for him than anyone and would have loved to known him as a friend.

486,26 May 2015,HenRex,9, Unapologetic Performance,"This movie is so well acted and -crafted that it does not deserve ten stars of excellence. It may seem contradictory at first but allow me to elaborate: The acting of Ronald Franz, the old man in this motion picture, who had no family of his own and who, lonesome and vulnerable, wished to adopt Chris McCandless; it was the most unapologetically true and striking performance I have yet to experience. His tears were my tears, his grief so. The left-back and never-to-see-again feeling all mine, too. So the quality of the acting turned out to be on the whole lineup. Steady and contrastive, but seamless. The craftsmanship was so well done that one forgets what these actors really are - that is - actors. The unapologetic performance and the true feeling turned only truer with their acting entirely. They acted so well that I came to judge them not on the performance criterion - as do I usually when rating movies from a range of criteria and then averaging to my final vote - no all criteria were at their maximum. They acted so well that I came to judge these actors not on their performance, but on whom they portrayed. And the parents with all their misdemeanours, and Chris McCandless - leaving behind his sister and Rob, and those homely and welcoming camping people with the woman who herself had not seen her child for years. It was heartbreaking. And it felt soulless and empty. Simply put: While this movie cannot be said to salvage what Chris McCandless did - but it may - and while it does nothing to defy this view, I cannot but assert that the people and the sort of true, erratic behaviour that led to this motion picture altogether, do not deserve the unapologetic and true ten of ten stars of excellence. That's how good this movie was. The honest truth of the narrative that led Chris McCandless to live an inane life was grieving and dull and I feel it nought to celebrate. Therefore only nine stars. Be it as it may, there need be many more of this sort of motion picture in the future.",

I will not digress on that subject because it is for each person to understand in there own way. Chris chose to live his life almost completely free of relying on objects that in theory are useless to finding happiness and being content with life. This does not mean those who do not live this life are wrong, but instead just shows that the human spirit, body, and mind are the true source of fulfillment in life.

Chris' journey INTO THE WILD was so, physically and emotionally and he stretched his limits past all typical boundaries and then some. I applaud his commitment and will.

The characters are were the movie shines and Alex's realisation that being alone is a lot worse than being able to share moments with other people. This makes the ending that much more saddening.

504,2 December 2007,cbrhank,3, A lot of waste here,"It's pitiful to see a wasted life, one that meets opportunity at several junctures but fails to make (and keep) the best choices. Such is the case of Christopher McCandless - a latter day hippie, explorer, and self-exile born perhaps 25 years too late into a modern style failed marriage. Whereas the source material for this film derives from that family's input, one can only imagine the glossing-over their history is seeing here. I have to expect an extensive cache of psychiatric fodder embodied within the whole lot of them. The R-rating is provoked as bait value by some gratuitous nudity and animal-butchery hardly important to this story. There are some filming locations that might have been exploited more extensively for scenic slendor but the director seemed to miss those chances. He was somewhat superficial in this regard while concentrating more on the current style of macro photography. There is little feel-goodness to this movie as the main character does nothing to instruct us about building success in life from where we come. In his case he could have done so much more with his natural tools and schooling. I guess there are plenty of examples of such depressing experiences around and this is but one choice to film. The acting is good, overall, and some of the characters quite interesting in their own right though, except in the case of Hal Holbrook, placed too briefly to be fully appreciated.",

506,19 April 2011,Lomedin,6," Talk about freedom, add a nice landscape and country music - instant success","I'm starting to see a pattern here. I was recommended this movie by a friend of mine who thought it was great. I have a lot of free time at work (ha!) so I decided to watch it. It didn't move me much. People seems to see here the realization of their own secret desires and dreams. I only see a young fellow who decides to escape his problems and, simply, be selfish. There's a trend: a ""normal"" person watches a film about a ""free spirit"" doing what he wants to do and the viewer believes that the story is great, regardless how easy it is to actually do what you want, to be who you want to be. The only problem is that it's even easier to follow society's rules and simply being frustrated and emotionally castrated. Sorry about the Freudian analysis. However, it's impossible to properly review this tile (any title?) without understanding why anybody would find it attractive. This is the story of a scared boy who chooses to run away from his social responsibilities. As simply as that. If people find this brilliant because they cannot do it themselves, fair enough. I won't base a criticism on my personal failures though. There's no real morality here, no big teaching, only common sense. That might be already too much for most of the people I guess, alright. Anyway, that's how it is. Beautiful photography nevertheless. Alas, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters in this film and, honestly, couldn't care less if it's based on a true story. I can understand why this movie is so loved. And also why it's overrated. It's somehow easy to please the masses and ""alternative"" people unable to jump the gap between what they want to be and really are.",

After spending more than an hour over the reviews i couldn't fail to notice that most of them were either dithyrambic or thought of the movie as totally overrated. Moreover, i have to accept the fact that everyone is right, in its own sense and aspect. But, the truly interesting in the above, is that this (great or garbage?)movie can't pass unnoticed and for me that's its greatness. It might appeal to the senses and the heart, to our University year dreams, to the lonely reading afternoons, it comes like a hammer to smash the image of what we have become and all the wasted potential which lied upon us. Reversely, seeing this movie through the prism of cold heart and common sense, through the eyes of a father rather than the ones of a son, it's just a movie of another wasted young life, no more than a ""narcotic journey"".....

The plot is slow, but gripping; if the male lead wasn't so compelling, who knows? Speaking of him, Emile Hirsch makes the film what it is. His versatility, complexity, and flexibility in this role makes it all natural. With his smirk-laden smile, he treks across the country, with excitement. I really wish he would have got nominated for an Oscar. Another actor worthy of prestige is Vince Vaughn. Yes, the Vince Vaughn from Wedding Crashers. He is incredible.

I recognize in Penn a director who continues to mature, grown and learn his craft. I don't want to focus on the beauty of the wilderness or deserts or ocean fronts. That is a distraction for me. What haunts me and what others have commented on is whether the risks that Chris takes is worth the journey. Clearly he is torn inside and has internalized much of his family angst. He is the unexpected black sheep and at the most unusual moment, just after graduating High School he bolts from his family without ever contacting them again. Period. As others have pointed out, if he had it in mind to punish his parents because he rejected the lies that they lived life by then how to explain his (ignoring) his dear sister who loved, adored and clung to him for strength and support? Clearly Chris was above average in intelligence but it seems to me that he was unwilling to leave his adolescent and somewhat romantic boyhood behind and enter manhood with a full and vigorous grappling. Instead he runs away to find something in himself. Why is he drawn to Alaska of all places? What is, after all, Alaska: the most remote continental State, farthest he can remove himself from his parents, the most totally wild and untamed place and what he discovers only at the end, also one that can be the most dangerous place to ""go it alone"" in.",

It starts with a young man, Christopher McCandless, heading off into the Alaskan wilderness in the depths of winter, with all his kit in a back-pack. He crosses a small stream and comes across an ex-Fairbanks city bus parked in the middle of nowhere. It is never explained how the bus got there, but it has previously been inhabited. He makes it his base. The film then flashes back to tell the story of how he got here. Despite an unhappy childhood - his parents were more interested in squabbling than child raising, he does extremely well at college and is about to go off to Harvard Law School. However, he gives all his saving to Oxfam, and vanishes becoming a hippie. He travels around most of America, and meets lots of people, most of whom are nice to him, though he usually walks out on them. He develops an idea of going to Alaska, and eventually gets there. On the way, free-riding on a freight train, he is caught and beaten up by a guard for ""jeopardising the company's liability insurance""! Meanwhile, his parents and sister are frantically worried about what has become of him. Back in the wilds, he lives off game, and the few supplies he brought with him. However, the game runs out, and after a killing a moose which goes rotten before he can preserve it, he tries to live off edible plants. This doesn't work out, so he plans to return to civilisation. However, it is now spring, the stream is a fast flowing river which he cannot cross, so he starves to death. His body is found a couple of weeks later. Whilst sympathetic to him and his desire to get away from materialism and hollow relationships, the film pulls no punches over the man's general stupidity in risking his neck in a way which is going to cause trouble for other people.",

That said, the story of a greatly selfish, silly, immature, arrogant spoiled brat is hardly something that his sister should be proud of. So Chris didn't have great parents, who does? So he doesn't want a new car, so what, don't have one. Don't want to work for big corporations, then don't. There are a million ways he could have chosen to live a life detached from materialism, but no, he chose a stupid one - one that put his parents through hell. I found it humorous that he burned all of his money, but then didn't have any trouble asking for a bed at a shelter in LA. Hypocrite. He was the sole cause of his own demise.

549,21 November 2010,sickofenjoyingmyself,8, The wild heart of man,"Into the wild follows the true story of Christopher McCandless - an incredibly gifted young man who abandons the material world and burdensome social conformities to embark on a journey of truth and self-discovery. As you follow him across country and a range of stunning backdrops, watching his everyday highs and lows allows the viewer a real intimacy with his character. This intimacy is definitely strengthened by the fact that the movie is based on a true story. It is hard not to experience a whole range of emotions as you watch his journey, and as his push to reach Alaska gathers pace, part of me was left in awe of his sheer will and conviction, while another part of me pleaded with him to come back to the 'real world' and realise his potential. When you watch this movie expect to see a truly unique story, first class acting and stunning visuals, but also expect to be provoked into discomforting assessments of yourself and the world you live in. Do you have the guts to abandon our modern world of material and social constructions in search of truth and self? Probably not; and neither do I. This is what makes Christopher's story so inspiring and exhilarating. ",
550,22 October 2007,jefftjones-1,9, Truly excellent film.,"Rarely upon viewing motion pictures based on trues stories/books, etc. do I come into the process with high anticipation. More often than not I've found myself leaving the cinema morose and let down by yet another Hollywood director who has chosen to glamorize the story for his own ego ignoring the facts and the truth that needs no help on its own. This film, however, is different. Seasoned, veteran actors, such as John Hurt and Hal Holbrook, who might not normally lend their talents to a movie released on a smaller scale such as this, remarkably excel in their roles. Marcia Gay Harden relishes her role as McCandless's mother and it shows. The numerous backdrops where Chris ""resided"" on his journey are breathtaking, and the screenplay by the great Sean Penn left me with a lump in my throat more than a few times throughout the film. You owe it to yourself to see this picture. Moreover, read the book first for the exact insight into Chris's adventure, by Jon Krakauer, and then see the movie. I dare you to leave without swallowing a few lumps.",

How Emile Hirsch has portrayed this fine young man has astounded me and made me eager to see some of his new work. But Emile isn't the extent of the greatness of this film, no, far from it every actor Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, Jena Malone and especially the triumphant return of Hal Holbrook all are at the top of their game and were very believable. I never thought of Sean Penn as a great director especially after seeing in my opinion the lukewarm ""The Pledge"" but he truly is for this picture. Many people including my father have criticized this film because they believe that Chris was stupid and self centered. But what they don't understand is that Chris simply didn't want to lead a normal, average life he wanted to adventure and enjoy life's beauty. Of course he felt sorrow in the end for dying alone in the wild, but the ending is pitch perfect and made me well up in tears. Anyway this movie has inspired me in many ways, I bought the book a few days after seeing the film in theaters and just today bought the DVD and look forward to seeing it again. 10/10 people this is a must see!",

562,26 January 2011,MarcusJ13,8, Poignant,"Into the Wild is a film based on a true story that sees a young graduate named Chris ditch the conventional and materialist life in favour of a life outside the grid alone in the wild away from his parents and his previous way of life hoping to make it to Alaska, his own promised land. In spite of this being a true story I was wary of the run time of around 2 hours 15 minutes and thought it may struggle in the pacing department. I have seen films with plots far less convoluted struggle to fill a shorter run time so with perhaps a form of prejudice going in beforehand I sat down and it was brilliant. The film does not waste any time as we see Chris living this life out in the wild right from the outset. Of course there is some exposition about his past life and again knowing that this is a true story it in my mind warranted a decent delivery. Was it a decent delivery? Well it was and it wasn't, early stages indicated promise from the storyline but it wasn't the main strength, the first act then shows promise but in my mind gets a little stale. ",

It's like asking why the squares got irritated with the gatherings of gentle people at Monterey Pop during that ""Summer of Love"" in 1967 Frisco : in essence, people like Christopher McCandless remind them of their own ""lives of quiet desperation"" of what 60s freaks called, ""the death culture"".",

The most shocking part of this movie is off course the end. It takes me back to couple of years ago. After coming back from three months traveling and sharing all my great experiences with my family and friends, I read a message that a travel-buddy of mine died while on a hiking-trip. I had only known her for a few days, but it hit me hard. This was because I knew that she had died during one of the greatest experiences of her life and wasn't able to finish it or share her experiences with friends & family back home. The movie 'Into the wild' brings me back to the good memories of traveling; the astonishing beauty of nature, the incredible connections you have with random people and the amazing feeling of freedom, but also brings back the bad memory of a friend losing her life while having all these experiences. Although the sadness the movie brings, I am very glad this movie was made and shows how hard reality can be sometimes.

Sean Penn found a way to make the story compelling by using different voices to narrate the story. My major question is ""Why was this not nominated for Best Picture?"". I would say it is a better film than Michael Clayton or No Country. I wonder if it was hurt by the way it challenges contemporary social and cultural values?

The stages in journey show different aspects of human beings, they all have different personalities, some have a story and some don't. The movie however could have been shorter by 10 minutes by shortening some of the adventure scenes sprinkled throughout the movie. The film has been shot beautifully, the cinematography is break from the regular movies and the background music also goes well with every shot. I really loved the way the fruit of the movie was put into one sentence towards the end 'Happiness is for real when it is shared', which is a great lesson to be learned from this guy's story that the theory that going far from everybody will bring happiness doesn't hold water.

594,8 April 2013,lvthomas-592-51628,3, Homeless Wanderer,"Recently my daughter and I watched this movie about homeless wanderer who gave up everything. He turned his back on his family and just went into the wild with no money, no credit card, nothing - not thinking of anyone but himself. I commented how cruel this was to his family, while my daughter saw him as some kind of hero. The movie was called ""Into the Wild"" and was directed by Sean Penn.The truth is, this boy was an true narcissist. He withdrew all affection, love and respect for the people who gave him everything, and he found this somehow justifiable. His highly destructive behavior hurt people, but he did not care that this was a form of undeserved emotional abuse. He used this form of manipulation against his family as simply as cheating in a game of monopoly, with no consequence. He psychologically 'murdered' his family for his own ""so-called"" search for happiness.Too many kids today think it is just okay to hurt, abuse and step on the people who have cared about them their entire lives. These kids are part of the ""why"" generation. Why must I follow the rules? Why do I know so much more than you, and why don't you appreciate my intelligence and worldly being? They make rash judgments and then post it to the world like they are a true martyr. But the question is, how far will these kids go until they realize they've eaten poison or drank the kool-aide, and ruined what could have been a love-filled life? Will they take it to the point when they realize their ""romantic"" notions are not realistic at all? And when they realize this, will it be too late? Will it be after another life has been viciously destroyed by abuse and hate? And will they be able to live with the destruction they have caused?",

598,23 May 2008,Marijndegroot,9, This is a truly great and moving picture about freedom,"I watched this movie at the cinema this week and I was completely sucked into this great story. The director has done a great job for two main reasons. The first is that he tells the story in such a way that the main character as well as his parents and sister are displayed in a just and appropriate manner. I believe it is often attractive, and easy, to make some of the characters to be more rightious. I think Sean Penn has been very brave on this point not to include judgments, either subtle or hard, into this movie. Any judgment is left to the viewer. The second great thing is that Penn moves away from the standard Hollywood way of filming. He does so by portraying things from the viewpoint of an observer that has a very wide scope. Especially at the end of the movie this is displayed in a very beautiful and moving way when the protagonist dies. At that very special point the two qualities that distinguish this movie merge and make the ending of it into an equally transcendent and immanent apotheosis that is neither good nor bad, but indescribably beautiful and completely transparant. True freedom knows no definitions nor boundaries!",
599,22 August 2008,McRackin,1, Good scenes but a way too religiously subjective plot.,"I thought the plot was empty. The main character feels he needs to travel the world and leave his home because he is a 'bastard' child along with his sister who has parents who he finds out are not married and always fight. His whole life is based off his parents not being married and fighting with not much other motivation for what he does in the movie. He comes across to me as a weak character, and the plot fails to bring him out of this description for me. There were hundreds of symbols to God throughout the movie; sun beaming down on him in key moments, the 'mountain of salvation' scene, the end of the movie where he dies appearing to look like Jesus himself because he is starved, suffering, grows a beard, sun beaming down on him yet again... to name a few out of the many dozens. The abnormal amount of religious and Christian references was too much to handle for a plot. The movie succeeded and will probably appeal to Christians because the movie can be considered teetering on the edge of 'bad' because they say ""fuck"" throughout the movie and there is nudity that an average religious person can giggle at. There are cool scenes too where he brutally chops up a large moose to eat but it ends up being swarmed by flys who lay maggots on it (why he didn't prepare for such a kill is beyond me). Kayaking scene and lots of wildlife scenes are cool too. At 2.5 hours long I can only recommend this for religious types.",

Which I presume is partly the reason why Mr. Sean Penn made Mr. Krakauer's book into a movie. In Chris McCandless' world the notions of material excess and gratification comes second or even last. This also allowed him to adopt a philosophy that money does not bring the sole meaning in life as his dad tried to masquerade his own wrong doings with materialistic possessions. Though the journey that Chris McCandless undertakes throughout the country in order to find some meaning to his life, it also gives him some answers, that were staring at him in the face all along. By this, I mean that all of the connections that Chris severed with his real family, he also sort of had to make on the road with his new surrogate family. Ironically the fact that he never once called home to tell his family, where he was it is both (his natural & surrogate) families that feel his loss. There is no doubt that along with the message, music, panorama vistas, Emile Hirsch, Hal Holbrook's performance that this movie will win an award. By the time the real Chris McCandless death I too was coming to an end of my own journey which lasted 8 years (and began at 17 years old), into the wilderness to some of the harshest climates and even I always followed the rules to this day. Which is why the end of this movie shocks me to this day. According to the locals Chris refused the following 1) a local map and 2) winter gear. In addition there was a bridge a few miles he could have traversed during flashflood season and 10 miles away there was a shelter with resupplies. After learning, all of this, Iam still not sure how to take this movie. Though it made me shed a tear at the end, the message I got from it, is when it comes to nature and family humility may be your greatest salvation.",

It really ran the gamut of emotions that you don't usually expect from movies. Being of college age, it really struck a chord in me to explore. Great cinematography of amazing places which I terribly want to visit. It was a long movie but I enjoyed the tempo. Good acting from all of the actors and a great casting job.

I also took a trip to Asia of 7 months to lose myself backpacking there. I also met so many backpackers who took a different direction and chose to take risks and get lost in the perils of Asia. I loved this guy's idealism and love for freedom. We are not free at all. Living in a society with so many restrictions and rules just makes us forget who we really are and what our purpose on earth really is. I admire his guts, courage and idealism. However it is sad that he took his freedom to the ultimate level and die alone in the wild. That is so sad and very immature of him. Maybe he was actually looking for the end, the ultimate freedom and peace. Many people believe he was mentally ill, but I do not believe that. I think he was striving for ultimate freedom and in today's world it is impossible to achieve. Maybe he was just too smart fro us to understand. I hope wherever he is now, he found ultimate freedom and happiness that he was looking for.",

He was 82 while filming Into The Wild, and became the oldest male performer ever nominated for an Academy Award for his very touching role in the movie. Whilst the movie seems so much about Christopher McCandless who is in almost every scene, I sense this movie is as much about the other people we encounter along the way. Sean Penn does a fine job of showing that these people are also on their journeys, as indeed we the viewers are too. I have to give a ten as I believe it achieves everything it could have done.

608,15 May 2009,mastermidnight036,5, its aight,"Into the Wild is an inspiring film that really makes you question society and alternative ways of living. The story's main character, Chris McCandless, is a college graduate who after reading the work of some of his favorite authors such as Jack London; he decides all he wants is to escape from society. Chris McCandless' goal is to go to Alaska and live off the land, self sufficiently, and get away from the conformities and complexities of society. Without a word to his family McCandless leaves his previous life behind and journeys across America, hitch hiking where ever he may feel to go. He even throws away his parent given name Chris for his own pseudonym Alex, which he is known by to his new acquaintances. Along the way McCandless experiences his new hermit style of life and write downs everything in his journal. Meeting new people and learning new things, McCandless spreads his philosophical idea to everyone he meets on his journey to Alaska where hisdestiny is fulfilled. The part that I enjoy most about this movie is the new ideas and concepts it brings up, making you question the faults of our society. I also like the mystery of the adventure, never knowing what's going to happen to the young traveler next. A disappointment to me was the foolishness of the main character. He threw away his college education and left disregarding his family and past life. His act of leaving was ultimately a selfish one; he thought only of himself and not of anybody he once knew or met along the way. To give it a rating out of 10, I would give this film a 5. It was very entertaining for a true story that stuck mostly to the facts without adding excitement.",

I think it takes courage to see a movie like this. Be warned, this is not your typical Hollywood big budget formulaic movie. I will be thinking about this movie for a long time.

It looked beautiful, capturing very well the concept of what it is to be 'free' and to appreciate the natural world by comparison to our comfortable urban/suburban lifestyles. The photography at times was breathtaking and gave a real sense of how epic North America is and the contrast of landscapes within it's borders.

This story is about what most people have forgotten. True life, without anger and pain and the blind-boring every days. Without work and stress...I think everybody would need something like this. Yes, it's not normal, especially not the tragic ending but I still understand why Chris made this. The movie shows almost everything about those 2 years. Travelling around Mexico and Canada, and the wilderness of Alaska. Emotions, feelings, love, pain, fear and danger. Sean Penn did the directing very well! The actors are good too, but the most touching thing is to me the music by Eddie Vedder. The song ""Hard Sun"" is unforgettable! Movies like this are the unique from Hollywood!",

As for the movie, I think we first ought to take in consideration the ""extraordinary"" life chris led.. I for one, do not relate with him on most grounds. Although I can say that I do have a wanderlust and would like to travel as much as chris did, but my holidays wont be executed in a similar way as chris. I can never understand why chris left his family(essentially his sister)? or why he found it appropriate to form a bond with hippies instead of corresponding with his family even once. I do not have sympathy for a person who goes all alone into Alaska unprepared.I do not have sympathy for a person who longs to live in the wild, but lacks common sense, hunting and cooking skills. Most importantly, we all face problems in life, but I consider it cowardly to run away from them like this. As for Direction and all, I think the movie lost it with the Emile hirsch-staring-into-the-camera tactic.. It was way too long(at least half an hour should have been chopped off) and the sequence shown with Hal holbrook or katherine keener for that matter were not all that impressive. The finest part was the last ten minutes, where Chris realizes his mistake, where all the ppl he had met are shown in a dream sequence, in fact its the ending that forced me to give it a 5 rating.",

640,3 August 2008,matthewpr06,9, My Opinion on Into The Wild,"Into the Wild is a film about the last few years of Christopher McCandless's life; which was spent wandering aimlessly around the North American wilderness meeting all kinds of free thinking and free loving, tax dodging vagrants. Christopher, or Alex, as he is better known in the film, was from a privileged background. He ignobly decided to reject materialism and fall off the grid. Alex is an unsympathetic character, and throughout the film I struggled to muster not only sympathy, but also a semblance of comprehension as to why Alex took the path that he did, in such a brutally selfish manner. In a lesser film, this fact alone could ruin what follows entirely, but Emile Hirsch gives and incredibly tuned in and dedicated performance as Chris/Alex. The high level of this central performance helps to turn a dislikeable real life person into a complicated and interesting character whose stunning journey exceeds the limitations of his rather naïve, dubious, hurtful and silly motivations.",
641,3 June 2013,wbellido,2, An 8 are you kidding!?! I give it a 2.,"Last night I finally gave up watching ""Into the Wild"". Sean Penn's take on an individual's search for his own identity seemed to me to be too much of a movie seeking to lay blame on his parents for him running off to do what he wanted to do and pretty much getting by with that for several years. He ultimately died alone, but from what I could glean from it, that's what he wanted to do. I feel like this movie which has an 8 rating on several scales is a cheat, sort of the way ""Dead Poet's Society"" was a cheat. It blames people. I don't care for the blame game. The movie would have been better if it celebrated this young man's choice in leaving society and being happier for the last years of his life. I've read some reviews that say he's a spoiled rich kid, and there is that. He could have chosen to be more altruistic; however you have to love yourself before you can love others. He was looking for that, but chose to die in the wild rather than go back and be altruistic. I didn't see evidence that he ever saw love in our culture. That indicates to me that he didn't love himself either. I've read this is a true tale. He chose to die alone.

My first question is: Do you know any kid at 22, 23, 24 who ISN'T selfish and arrogant to some extent? It's called growing up.

How was Atonement nominated for best picture and not Into The Wild!? Atonement fizzled at the halfway point and became boring and cliché'esquire. Into The wild was better than all except No Country! This film was nearly perfect. The casting was dead-on. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden were great in their roles, they portray cold and distant characters very well. Hal Holbrook was his role, not simply portraying it. Emile was great, how and why did he get overlooked for best actor!? That was simply ridiculous. The script was excellent, very memorable. The cinematography was brilliant, beautiful and memorable! The choices for Oscars these days is political rather than based on merit! Has been and always will be. Into The Wild will remain a classic!",

I have been on a few ""trips"" earlier and nothing on the wild side, yet the emotions when it comes to him meeting so many people and making those connections, which end up being connections for life, really resonated with me. In the end he writes ""Happiness is only real when shared"". I thought that was absolutely a fitting end.

If you are a parent, young parent, future parent it is definitely a picture for you who you should not be. It is one of the movies I could not think of anything else for days after I have seen it. The main plot is for me actually the second one. All the time during watching the movie I had been rather thinking of the parents role and what had to happen in their live to be as they were in the movie. Is it really a doom and destiny of many people not to be happy after years of being together or you always have a choice? I think the movie forces to re-think you life, hopefully beforehand. .. and the Edi's soundtrack.. breathless.. A must see (!) for me.",
663,5 March 2008,mdechene,5, Very Different!!,"This film was well directed. The scenery was unbelievable. I did not know until the end credits that the film was based on fact. You think about the portrayal of the main character and wonder whether or not someone could really do what the film portrayed. Then, you find out that it really happened! In some ways, it seems like a life that one would like to live. On the other hand, you look at it and say that there is no way that you could live the life of the main character portrayed in the movie. It is REALLY food for thought. The main character was well portrayed. No great acting ability, just well done. The rest of the characters had small parts that one could judge as to whether or not they were bits of good acting or just a way to earn some money.",
664,25 March 2008,lainababes86,9, Absolutely loved it,"To start off i'm a huge fan of Sean Penn's films. Indian Runner and Crossing Guard affected me like no other film ever has. They had me in tears for reasons i still don't understand. I remember crying for an hour after all the credits had finished from Indian Runner. Both films will have a place in my heart and mind forever. When i heard about Into the Wild i was very excited. I'm not always crazy about true stories however, even if there well made they usually don't impress me as much as original fiction. Therefore, I had high expectations going into this movie but low at the same time. I wasn't sure how Penn would handle nonfiction and really didn't want to be disappointed. Well i wasn't at all, in fact i was delighted and impressed. I thought that it was a beautiful movie, well acted, well directed, well shot, just really well put together. I loved the fact that even know many of the characters weren't in the movie for more than twenty minutes or so they were still so memorable and likable. Catherine Keener is never a disappointment for me and continued to give a great performance. I also kept hearing before i saw it that Hal Holbrook was nominated for an academy award and that he gave such a great performance and as i was watching the movie i almost thought it was a mistake because i was more than an hour and a half into it and still hadn't even seen him. When he did finally show up, he blew me away. He was a great character, immediately had that loving grandfather effect, and all i wanted to do during that last scene when hes dropping Emile Hirsch off is give him a big hug and tell him that i'd be the happiest girl in the world if he adopted me. This goes to show that although he was only on screen for about twenty minutes he was wonderful. Like Indian Runner and Crossing Guard, Into the WIld left me in deep thought and an overflow of tears. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone looking for a good flick.",

666,17 May 2008,chrishogg2000,8, Great character study.,Contains spoilers: After watching this many people will comment upon the gorgeous scenery or the impressive soundtrack used throughout the movie. However i think the best thing about this film is that it is one of the most trueful and insightful character studies i have ever watched.

669,20 October 2008,avianblue,9, Wonderful - but ultimately the story of a misguided fool,As a film it's hard to fault Into the Wild. It's a fantastic piece of film-making - brilliantly directed and with a stand-out performance by Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless. With a superb narrative drive and accompanied by the wonderfully melancholic acoustic music of Eddie Vedder it's at times both moving and incredibly uplifting.,

Your decisions, what you strive for. And Chris does it. He lives for adventure. Not cautions, not society, not materials. For adventure. If you have the chance, see this movie in theaters.

673,8 April 2010,dogankurban,6, good as a film but very hypocritic,"I think this is a good film, I mean with nice takes, very good natural spectacles and good acting, however, I found the scenario hypocritic . I mean, this guy burns all his money and then works to earn some, he madly critisizes the consuming society, and still works in a burger king store, uses equipment which are all products of the industry that he hates and which destroys the wildlife he adores so much. He makes fun of laws, crosses borders and goes down the river forbidden, doesn't even have an ID, but he doesn't make love with the girl he likes just because she is not over 18. If he lives by nature's laws, then what is the point in that? I think this movie looks like trying to be a film about the guy who runs away from home and haves lots of fun, but in the end, gives the lesson ""hey boyz, don't run away from home, just listen to your parents or you will end up like him""",

675,20 August 2012,sheppard-2,5, The ending makes the whole story pointless,"So yeah, good acting, good camera work, somewhat solid screenplay. But the ending of this movie makes everything that happened on the way pointless. I give one extra star for it being based on the real life story, otherwise it would have scored 4. But if the authors had courage to change the ending and ""edit the reality"", they could have gotten at least eight stars from me. So I'll try to not spoil here: the ending of a movie of this kind should have given meaning to everything that happened on the way. Instead, it takes away any meaning. Superweak move! Now you will probably like this one if you have or had problems with your parents or have been a tramp or just a sad person. Neither of these applies to me, so I just give this movie the score it deserves for its quality.",

For all things we are afraid of experiencing and for situations and people we didn't even give the chance to know.

The perfect combination of an incredible story and a unbelievably well chosen soundtrack made from 2 different compositors (Michael Brooks & Eddie Vedder), really made the movie special. The camera angles were very well chosen and really amazed me about the beauty of the nature were the movie took place. All this made the movie a once in a lifetime experience. The story of Christopher McCandles aka Alexander Supertramp is a perfect mix of action, melancholy, and gives the viewer a new point of view of the human psychology. I really like the idea of giving up everything and just leave the daily routine. Most people have thought of doing this more than once, and the protagonist let us dream of ""what would be if"". This movie is for everyone who loves traveling, who loves to be moved by a film. I think everybody should see this movie at least once.",

686,14 December 2008,shannon-weiss,10, A Rare Beauty and Must-See!!,"Into the Wild is a beautiful film that takes the time to relish in the simple pleasures that most people neglect to even consider. The grandeur of nature, the deep meaning behind a simple act of kindness, and the innate desire of man to commune with a force greater than himself. The slow, natural pace of the film illustrates the timelessness of life in the wild and one's ability to savor every waking second. Into The Wild also conveys the importance of human relationships, illustrating that time spent alone can reaffirm a person's life but is not a fulfilling life in and of itself. Told through secondhand accounts in a style that reads as a documentary film, Krakauer's book version of Chris McCandless' life lacks the degree of emotional relevance that is present in the film. The film stays with McCandless through all of his experiences, therefore providing the poignancy that one might expect from the written biography. While the book impelled many readers to believe that McCandless was a wandering suicidal idealist with no desire for human contact, the film is able to drive home that point that McCandless was frustrated with the capitalistic scheme that engulfed him and that he was simply looking for himself in the wild. It is evident that the human experiences McCandless had while traveling to Alaska affected him greatly and that he intended to maintain contact with each of his newfound friends. McCandless did in fact work along the way in order to support his new lifestyle but simply denounced a life of excess. The landscape is breathtaking, the relationships touching and the story of a young man in search of a meaningful existence is admirable and tragic. It is hoped that those interested in seeing the film will not be dissuaded by those who say it is too long, too slow and too boring as such opinions counter the essence of McCandless' mission. The film is well crafted, well acted, and penetratingly beautiful.",

689,28 November 2015,rzervou,10, To the limits and far beyond,"Just saw the video yesterday night. I preferred that from a Friday night stroll and was right. It is surely a movie that one can hardly forget. Reading other reviews, it's also highly controversial. It's a story that brings human nature to its extremes, human nature face to Nature. This is what I think it is mostly about. The human challenges the Nature in so many ways. Usually he challenges it by abusing and destroying. Chris challenges it by trying to impose his presence in an environment where Nature, not humans prevail. No matter how good are the purposes of one, he should not exceed his limits. Many commented that on Chris being a brat having a senseless, useless end. Many people on this planet have really senseless deaths. Children dying from bombardments or famine have definitely a senseless death. This death was not senseless. It was the pay for one's struggle to the limits and far beyond. This story also challenges the American society. This is why Americans love it so much or despise it. It describes its dead-ends, its predominant materialism. At the time of illustrating a sick society, it is a formidable testimony of what a GORGEOUS place the territory called United States is. I really fell now the need to visit it more than ever. I had seen Hachi one month ago and now this and I can tell 'reality is far more magic than imagination'",
690,9 August 2018,janicebowman,7, Sean Penn directs a great man vs nature film that will linger with you,"Into the Wild is a tragic movie based on the tragic real life story of Christopher Mccandless. Chris was different and surely his foolhardy ways were directly responsible for his death, and yet you somehow feel for the guy. A part of you wishes he made out alive from the Alaskan tundra, from that yellow bus. The book on which this film is based, Jon Krakeur, is also a must read in my opinion. The lead Emile Hirsh is more than adequate and the director Sean Penn must be commended for not just deftly directing the film but realizing the need to tell this young lad's story. This is a great nature vs man feature film all the more hard hitting because it is true.",

700,9 March 2008,maurin,9, A note about its directing,"The story does not need a summary beyond its title and tag line. Casting and performances are superb and moving. Another precious standout is the director here - rarely has a non-chronological storytelling felt more natural and flowing than here. Often, when directors resort to playing Chronos, the end result is a disjunctive narrative. Not in this case. The going back and forth between the final destination and the journey that led to it lets the story unfold without making it feel tired or restrictive. One could argue we do the same, when in the final destination of the present, constantly go back to revise different points of our past. The movie is presented in a similar organic super apple way.",

The impressively authentic performances coupled with the breathtaking cinematography captured me to a degree where the outside world seemed unreal for a second. Then you see people hurrying on minding their own business and you quickly remember what's real. I challenge anyone with a bit of a dreamer in their stomach not to want to pack up their stuff and take on the world after seeing this movie.

I could not understand, if his parents had been such bad parents & his leaving them in limbo, for so long, not knowing if he was dead or alive, why his bitterness did not show in the film. He was a likable, well adjusted young lad, who did not portray the usual hang-ups resulting from an unhappy childhood. But he still disowned his parents. He obviously kept this bitterness part of his personality well hidden from those he met on his travels. So, in that respect the film just does not add up. Hal Holbrook nominated for an Oscar!??

Apparently, I was stranded in Alaska during the final days of Christopher's life in Alaska. We were in the same State, but different locations. When I watched this movie, it brought back a lot of memories when I had lived in Alaska. I lived in Alaska from 1992 to 1995, and can ""visualize"" the life of Christopher, though I never met him. Since I had lived in Anchorage, many scenes in the movie were places that I've been to, a long time ago. My early life in Alaska wasn't nice to talk about, because I lived in a couple of shelters, and I remembered the McCandless news on KIMO TV 13.

Although the movie has some conflicts with what happened in reality and Christopher McCandles simply had not taken a map of Alaska with him that could save his life(which made some Alaskans angry over his ignorance), but I think the point of the movie is the evolution of a human mind which is depicted believable and convincing, and it is not important if Christopher was real or not. However the crew did their best to make everything as how it had happened. by the way it avoids from advising the audience and just narrates Christopher's experiences. I recommend the movie to all especially the young.",

Maybe you've fantasised about being shipwrecked on a desert island or possibly you like the idea about living in the woods or some empty valley, relying on nothing but your wits and instinct and surviving on whatever you can catch or forage. Perhaps few have; at the end of the day there is an overwhelming part of all of us that fears being lonely or isolated. I feel that too but I have also had a long term fantasy about living in the wild that I don't think I'll ever shake. And I suppose that is why I enjoyed this film so much.",

717,2 November 2007,jay-collier,8, Asks important questions,"Can happiness be found only through the solitary pursuit of pure knowledge and truth? Or can it be discovered in the simple life of shared experience with others? In Sean Penn's Into the Wild, this appears to be an either/or question. By the time Christopher McCandless discovers he's taken the high solitary road all the way to a dead-end, it's too late; he's killed himself by eating poisonous berries in the Alaska bush. Was his journey a noble one or the indulgence of extended American adolescence? Was he an heroic figure or a romantic naif? In the film, moments of insight are delivered in stark, unmistakable contrast: McCandless' painful family secret is shown as core motivation; his effortless, yet detached wisdom on the road is appreciated by his companions but deemed by him to be less worthy than his high ideals; and the death of his final prey ends up being pointless, its carcass scavenged by a bald eagle. The film brings us right to the threshold of considering these questions with depth. Then it ends.",
718,27 December 2008,lpt1021,8, Very touching and sad story,"What a wonderful film. And what a sad story. I understand Christopher's eagerness to experience a different kind of lifestyle and somehow try to get away of all the problems he had back at home. But that would've been good if it had been for a while, in order to find himself. What I found amazing is all the different people he met along his journey and how he touched and left a part of him in each one of them. However, the only thing that bothers me is that he was a little selfish, because, as much as he wanted to reach his destination and make his dream come true, all the people that were left behind suffered from his absence and thinking what was it like for him being out there, with nothing but will, courage and a dream. It's sad how a situation like this makes a person react. Christopher's parents knew they had done something wrong and it was to late to make it right. Emile Hirsch's performance is extraordinary. The rest of the cast is very good. I was very surprised to see a grown-up Kristen Stewart, performing a song with a very nice voice. Sean Penn did it again, now from the director's chair. The landscapes are breathtaking, shown with a very pleasant soundtrack.",

Rid that unstoppable wave abnormal, despicable and evil, omnipresent face of consumerism only destroy (it). Allow your body, your mind, the heart of a pure cathartic as satisfying emotion. Get carried by the sinuous and seductive charm of nature. Emile Hirsch aka Christopher McCandless, twenty-two of South Dakota and fresh out of college with a promising career before him that, in the early 90s, decided to donate all his savings to charity and leave for the north, in the wilderness, cutting all links with his family. The strength and explosive magic of this fourth film directed by Sean Penn is in its simple yet admirable portrayal of the imaginary nature. For Sean Penn nature is synonymous with grandeur, purity and untouchability. Not deceive them. Filming on the endless open spaces, lying on the snow-capped peaks, the wild animals, serve to further strengthen the concept: nature as a ""liberating goal"". In the journey of Christopher is glimpsed an escape from oppressive family prosaic and frustration, and a grueling research on the true meaning of life: ""Into The Wild"" is a poignant road movie, sincere and passionate and rebellious, full of unconventional seasoned by a bursting strong spiritual reminiscences of a secular spirituality. The entire film is permeated by a deep and touching humanity that characterizes all the characters with whom Christopher comes into contact. E 'on the basis of this fundamental aspect that focuses the attention of the director: the need for a dialogs between human beings. But not only. In ""Into The Wild"" is also reflected in a significant indictment of all 'American establishment, as ostentatious symbol of capitalism. Significant effects of the contrasting images of the virgin wilderness that efficiently Sean Penn amalgam with the irrepressible flow of a contemporary human megalopolis. Here is the disorientation of the protagonist in the face of this glaring dissonance becomes paroxysmal levels resulting from that famous and ominous message to the nation when Bush Senior announced, with calm, unperturbed, the entry of America in what was the first Gulf War. Followed by a rousing soundtrack and a beautiful picture, ""Into The Wild"" runs smoothly, raises questions, prompts consideration: the support of a close-knit cast over the amazing choral excel Emile Hirsch sees a beautiful Kristen Stewart , a nice and tender Catherine Keenaar, and above all, an outstanding Hal Holbrook in one of the most intense and moving roles that cinema has ever given us in recent years. And on the wings of wonderful aphorisms existential Christopher will face the adversities of fate, noting that the man, just as insignificant opposite the incommensurable, has its limitations in addressing a challenge so hard and rough. ""Happiness is only real if shared"": and that last look lifeless to the sky, perfectly framed by an extraordinary revival in the subject and the subsequent declaration of love of one who, aware of the danger, chose to love nature more than himself.

From the beginning I was trying to discover how his character grows. The way he thinks is conflicting with social norms and values. Life is full of hurdles.

The first tantrum he threw in the restaurant after his parents wanted to buy him a car made me dislike him and from that point on my mind was made, he was a brat. No matter how hard the actor or the script tried nothing could make me like him and nothing could make me symphathise with him. Poor little rich kid. He shuns society to become supertramp but every step of his journey is marked by society's influence. He pays for a book to help him find stuff to eat. The Magic Bus offers warmth and a bed. When he goes back into town he asks a mission for a place to stay. The list goes on, he couldn't have enjoyed his lifestyle choice without society and it's influence.

First of all the dialogue is well put together and the acting by Emile Hirsch is superb. Sean Penn did a masterful job in both directing and partially writing this film. I love how Chris is willing to take life outside the box and truly be whom he wants to be. This young man had it all so to speak, a university degree, driven parents and athleticism. However, deep inside his sole this was not his destiny. This film is a groundbreaking piece and is very inspiring and engaging. It makes us truly ponder about what really makes us content as human beings. The film teaches us to follow our own hearts and not to be pushed by what we think is right by outside influences. My advice is take this film for what it is, not for what you want it to be and you will enjoy it immensely, that I assure you.",

This Master piece is not for everyone. Yes, some may not like long screenplay movies , but if they just watch it with some nature sense and trying to accept the fact that they desperately need a new meaning for the life, they will love this EPIC movie. You need a lot patience to watch this movie. Make sure you're not disturbed. I love this movie very much ,because I always wanted to live a life like that. It just projecting the things that I wanted to try . Screw the people, screw the Rules, Screw the civilization . I will do what I dreamt to do. Awesome Message. There are so many wonderful quotes in the movie, that will slap you right in the face and will make u think that, what we are missing from the essence of real life and what we are running from or running towards. Best 160 Mins of my life by watching this adventure experience. Making new friends, exploring the Natures , surviving with natures, seeing things in your own & different way – that would just be awesome. Whenever an adventure begins , the new people we meet will always leave their mark in our heart. Those people are rare to see, but yet they are unforgettable one's. As it's based on true story I don't want to see the logic things here. The last 15 mins are so touchy. Emile Hirsch last 5 mins acting were unbelievable. Shown the variation in body as per the story line. CLIMAX justifies that civilized world is better than the adventures life. I Accept that. But yet Adventures life is better. The unexpected moment was , this piece of work was produced ,written and directed by Sean Penn (The man who stunned me by his acting in I AM SAM , Mystic River,21 Grams etc., ). My Friend recommended this movie 2 years ago, now only I watched it. Now I know why my friend recommended this in the first place. Worth watching.

1. Nudity in 3-4 scenes is obvious. Acting, direction is good.
2. Some raw hunting scenes aren't for all. Attitude issue of the main character without the basic morale isn't justified. Ex - he wants to hunt for living but don't want to compromise with life situation or parents.
3. Most importantly after travelling all this while, leaving everyone who comes your way, what you got; nothing, this can be the story of the main character but that doesn't come out that loud, it shows in a glorified way of some stupidity done by a teenager.
4. Movie is very slow and could have been 90 min documentary.

Chris was different and surely his foolhardy ways were directly responsible for his death, and yet you somehow feel for the guy. A part of you wishes he made out alive from the Alaskan tundra, from that yellow bus. The book on which this film is based, Jon Krakeur, is also a must read in my opinion. The lead Emile Hirsh is more than adequate and the director Sean Penn must be commended for not just deftly directing the film but realizing the need to tell this young lad's story.

At the beginning I was totally blown away by his rejection of materialism which is so uncommon in today's world. Even though the movie is pretty long it never gets boring, due to the outstanding soundtrack from Eddie Vedder which fits to the movie perfectly. For the whole day I am under great impression of this movie and this is also the reason why I decided to write my first review. I am still asking myself why I was so touched by this movie that left me speechless at the end. I am also seeking for answers what made this movie so great but I think that this cannot be explained and you just have to accept that fact.

The characters that our protagonist meets do nothing but enrich him and share with him the happiness, precisely that he will mark in his cloister in Alaska, which would be the allegory of all the sufferings and lies suffered by this young man. I very much appreciated the STREDHEN, Chris's tendency to infinity which, managing to overcome the natural sublime and thus to be free. Closing this little purely romantic parenthesis, the direction of Sean Penn is nothing short of excellent if not almost masterful, from the editing to the landscapes that makes us enjoy with all the calm of the world.

However this film, and the book by Jon Krakauer, takes you on his journey and shows you that he was not completely unprepared in that he sought out the knowledge on subjects of hunting and taking care of freshly killed game. Unfortunately it was this knowledge that he got from a hunter from the Midwest that was what leads to his accidental ingestion of poison because he did not think game preservation was going to be different in Alaska.

And after watching it my second time I loved it even more, I am looking forward to see it a third time. The movie has it all, great acting, extremely good soundtrack, great pictures, a lot of unforgettable monologues and dialogues and of course a great story that is based on true events. This movie is the first to change my life. It is also the first movie that made me watch the whole end credits, not because of the great music but because I was frozen, totally stunned by this amazing movie.

This story explores thoughts that I think we all have once in a while: What would it be like to just leave and get out of here? Do we really need all these ""things"" that surrounds us? Emile Hirsch, the supporting actors (especially the father because of his character's development in the movie) and Eddie Vedder's music are just wonderful elements in a film that has a more natural and interesting flow than most Hollywood productions and really touches on something important! This is a glimpse into freedom and a great reminder. Makes you wonder if you are really doing what you want to do with your life. ITW has moved me in a way that I cannot remember being moved by a movie before. I know that I will be watching this again soon. I suggest you do the same.",
765,21 March 2008,cfloyd2643,8," Beautiful, yet so tragic","This disillusioned young man had so many offers of acceptance along his travels of the US and Mexico, yet he was so damn obsessed with ""going to Alaska"" that he simply turned them down and moved on. He thought that he could simply ""live off the land"" during the summer months in Alaska, and then simply move on to another adventure of his life. He enjoyed many beautiful scenes of nature that many of us will never experience, yet he was doomed to perish sooner or later in these new locations. If his Waterloo was not Alaska, it would be some other remote location. This basic difference in people was best shown in Christopher's scene with the old man in the desert: the old man hid in the desert in his tidy home for most of his adult life to deal with the bad hand his life had dealt him, yet Christopher rejected his offer of adoption and moved on aimlessly.

I think that Chris was a very sensitive person, and perhaps, too sensitive for our tough society....I guess escaping to the wild will be the best solution for those who constantly suffers the unfairness of being. So I would personally prefer the movie without all that popular psychology and put some more emphasis on his unique and special personality, that is an extraordinary sensitiveness combined with a beautiful and idealistic mind.",

As you're taken on the wild journey of Chris's life, you get a feel of what's truly important in yours. This film really feels, and almost anyone can relate to the problems in this film. Family troubles, love, lost, crime, and everything in between. Although the ending is tragic, you don't get that feel. You come to understand that this amazing kid did what he wanted to in life, and didn't need money, or any other material items to do what he wanted. He came across people that he changed, and changed him. The 2 hippies he meets, in my opinion, are like the parents that he wished he had. They taught him what's really important in life, and that's happiness. The old man, was another person who made a change in his life. He loved him like a son, a grandson, and a friend. He taught the old man to live. And the old man taught him to forgive.",

I believe you did justice to the book and were honest to the story. The acting was superb. Hirsch, Keener, Holbrook make this movie sing. One person who I don't hear a lot of mention for is Brian Dierker(Rainey). For only being his first acting role, he was very good. Vedder's music and singing were perfect for this film. The cinematography was stunning. I've seen ""No Country""... and in my opinion does not even touch ""Wild"" I have not seen ""There will be blood"", only trailers. But it seems to win the Oscar for acting you have to be over the top or over act in my opinion like Daniel Day-Lewis's role, almost like a cartoon character. The actors in ""wild"" did not over-act, but brought real feelings thru about real people. It is truly a shame that ""Wild"" did not get more nominations, as it definitely got snubbed.",

A part of you wishes he made out alive from the Alaskan tundra, from that yellow bus. The book on which this film is based, Jon Krakeur, is also a must read in my opinion.

The music is also brilliantly made by Eddie Vedder and suits the movie in all ways.

Chris wanders through a landscape of stereotypes whose only purpose is to provide a foil for Chris to react to, typically with something intended to be profound. None of these characters convey any sense of depth except perhaps the one played by Catherine Keener.

But in this movie he did what many people internally strive to do, but never can; because of the responsibilities and the leashes holding us tight, keeping us inside a very narrow circle that does not represent anything of what life really is.
He did not abandon responsibilities, no, he took the more difficult, yet more moral path into life. life is not about money and materialistic perspective, it is not and will never be. the only thing wrong with what he did is leaving his family, and he figured it out on his own, the difficult way of course.

They made a hero out of someone who actually was selfish and delusional. I can probably find a lot of people who ran away from home, turned homeless and ended up dying in a similar way (not Alaska but probably from freezing on the streets or drowning in some river or something).

819,19 July 2008,pjennings-2,4, Penn and Pearl Jam on Tour,"Sold to many on the score alone, a film musically endorsed by the Pearl Jam legend that is Eddie Vedder, fails to live up to expectations. The profound protagonist, Christopher McCandless, embarks on a 'meaning of life' expedition literally in to wild to do battle with the demons within born from a material world and a loveless upbringing. At two hours and twenty eight minuets there are endless life affirming statements that ultimately add up to a rather pretentious take on a self-discovery voyage. I simply wanted to shake the chap by the arms and tell him to stop being so down right silly. The film spends too much time covering the same ground to be truly compelling. However, when it does finally arrive at its climatic end it is undeniably emotional and a pouring of sympathy is well deserving. I personally only realised that this was a true story at the very end of the film. This of course makes the circumstances that McCandeless finds himself in all the more difficult to bear. A good performance from Emile Hirsch and top draw direction for Sean Penn certainly makes it worth a look in, but it for one hour and nineteen minuets it does not match up to its own hype.",

I also am very tickled at the demographic female/male breakdown on the vote score..nearly all the ladies rated at or above a 9. Personally, let me lay down the downers first. It just seemed to drag on around the second hour mark so much so that I wanted to go use the bathroom but I didn't and I will expand on that in a bit. It was also a bit clichéd and painted the main character as a ""savior"" of sorts which may or may have not been the case. The positives though are abundant. The scenes are well laid out and the scenery can be spectacular hence why I chose to punish the bladder. I am a sucker for any refresher on the coming of age/Catcher in the Rye/On the Road theme and thus wanderlust is certainly welcome. I also thought that as a paradigm of how to step back from the frenetic touch of the modern world it did wonderfully and we could all walk away learning a lesson or two though probably not going to that extreme.

The actors did a good job and looked like they were really into making this movie and they had fun learning about Chris also they made it believable that they were actually the people in the movie. The dialogue was amazing the way they talked and what they talked about was phenomenal. One of my favorite parts was when the older man Ronald walked up the mountain to sit with Chris mccandleless. All together this was a very good movie and I would recommend it to my friends like I said I didn't get to see all of it but the parts I saw I really liked. There were a couple of things I didn't like, like the way they Chris look when he was getting sick he looked just awful and I know he was supposed to but maybe not as bad as they made him look. I think people that desire adventure and freedom would really like watching this and learning from it. The quotes and the store were very down to earth and heartwarming to watch and hear. Even the clothes and settings were very nicely set and the clothes were right down to the time period. I won't say this was an amazing movie but it was very good and I liked how it was put together and I love how it was made from a real event.

853,16 March 2008,m-garafalo,7, Different Levels,"So let's start with my original thought. That here is this kid..who has money growing up..never wants for anything. Yet he abandons it, to live independently and free of materialism. OK..admirable..yes..but like some other comments I have read on here, What were the parents real sins? They were flawed? They had a bad marriage...They did not disclose everything to their kids? Hmm..sounds about like 95pct of the world's parents. I am still a relatively young man and it irks me the idea that generations are entitled to have chips on their shoulder about the way they were raised. Like it is some kind of war they fought and now they want the medal. I am sure there is kid in some project tenement building who is living under the same conditions that this kid volunteered for. Perhaps suffering abuse every day, verbal and physical. Maybe one day this kid gets a break..goes to college and becomes something. Hey..now that is a story for me. ""Into Reality"" I will call it. I could not generate any sympathy for this kid..no matter how I tried. Now..i Rated this a 7 cause there were some very wonderful moments in this movie. First and foremost, In a movie about individualism and being a free spirit, the most powerful parts of the movie involved the characters he met along the way. From Keener to Vaughn to especially they young singer he befriended. They all came across so convincing as people who were genuinely touched by this young man and were all the worse off when he left them. Hal Holbrook in a small role with mostly body language and facial expressions had me remembering people in my life..who want to hold on to you even though they know they can't. Overall..in this day and age, to see a kid who could go off and do whatever he wants but chooses this..to me..that is a story worth telling. The kid was obviously different and different is refreshing. Great soundtrack, great acting by all involved, a bit long and William Hurt was underused but believe me, at times you will be asking...why is making his parents suffer so much. I am a parent..and for the parents out there..not knowing where your child is..whether he is 8 or 18...is not something to shrug off as a subplot...Penn had the right idea here..and he did well, but it was a bit one sided and made it appear like the kid was petulant and self indulgent instead of just Thoreauesque.",
854,22 October 2007,jimcasey1768,10, Brilliant,"A quiet, contemplative movie with heartbreaking performances by Emile Hirsch and Hal Holbrook. No movie in the last 5 years can match this film's emotional impact. The camera work is beautiful and as innovative as any I have seen in a long time. Penn's direction has taken a quantum leap from ""The Pledge"" to ""Into the Wild"". The music, contributed by Eddie Vedder is astonishingly good and fits perfectly within the scenes. Arguably the finest example of American film in recent memory. Unquestionably the best work of Penn's career, in front or behind the camera. Catherine Keener and William Hurt are excellent, as one can usually expect, Jena Malone lends layers to the film with superb narrative work.

I was afraid that parts of Chris's life would be altered from the story or over all skipped. Yet when I saw the movie when it came out I was shocked in more way than one. Nothing seemed to be left out about Chris or the people he touched. The acting was amazing and I felt like the story was being told only to me. Also Eddie Vedders music was perfect. I heard the music he wrote for the movie and I instantly rushed to buy the CD afterward. Normally when I buy a DVD it will rot on the shelf for months before I watch it again. Yet Into The Wild is one that I take off the shelf often and watch. My copy of the book has gone on trips with me where ever I go.

I don't think the director could of chosen a better cast roll for the film, I genuinely felt that every actor/actress was perfect for their role.

This movie is a true gem. A young man had the vision and the guts to seek for freedom, for truth, for purity, for beauty. A very bright young man who wanted to undo himself from the lies around him. Wanting to be a balanced, independant person, selfless, not chained to a job or money. Happy with nothing. As he says himself: to kill the false being within. This extraordinary young man lived a great adventure, since he left home. Sean Penn has made a fantastic movie / almost a documentury and Emile Hirsh probably played the greatest part in his life (I hope he will play bigger and better, but people remember him now, 10 years later, as the guy from into the Wild). This is a must see movie. It opened my eyes. It shows where the real friendship and beauty lie.
I read a lot of people's reviews, especially the negative ones. Many wrote he was irresponsable, running away from home without a word. Selfish, because he only followed his dreams. I think you people are missing the point. Whose dreams should he follow then? His parents lied to him and his sister for a very long time. He was shocked, maybe devastated and wanted to pursui his own happines. Who can blame him? It was HIS life, don't forget that. This is the exact point, his life, no one owed him. He died, yes, maybe he was naive, stupid or over confident. I think he was just going for it and maybe, just maybe he made his piece dying out there. Accept that, respect that. He chose his adventure because it was his decission. His. Not ours, not from a society that constantly presses other people what to like, what to wear, what to watch and what to condemn.
Again: to kill the false being within. This is all just my opinion. I feel we are all entitled to have our own opinion.",

Everything about this film was exceptional. No, it is not your run-of-the-mill, commercial, explosion-filled McMovie. It is an actual film. It is meaningful art. If you found it pretentious, that probably has to do with your own ego and that the film's message clashes with your worldview, which is probably the dominant American ideology of consumerism (buy more and you'll be happy, we promise! buying stuff is the meaning of life! buy buy buy!). I almost teared up early on in this move, and even as a full-grown man, who is not ""supposed"" to cry, I eventually did cry a little.

896,9 October 2007,cafranci,5, Could have been great,"I'll preface my review by saying that the film definitely has great moments and redeeming aspects, but I feel that Sean Penn focused too much of the story on the physical journey of Christopher McCandless and not enough on the relationships he has throughout the film. Having read the book I feel that the most important aspect of the story is how his parents' relationship affected him and how that in turn affected his relationships with all others. Especially because of the ending and the message it sends the viewer, I think the narrative structure could have benefited greatly from expanding on the relationships he developed along the way (and why they always ended with him running away from commitment and long term acceptance) and condensing the actual physical travel. I realize that the physical journey is a big part of Chris' story, but I feel that all the time dedicated to showing him travel could have been better spent developing who Chris really was. Sean Penn created an accurate portrayal of Chris' story, but at the end of the film we are still left wandering who Chris really was. The film also tends to repeat itself unnecessarily, showing Chris go through many similar traveling and reflecting situations as well as showing several short relationships that consist of not much other than Chris telling them that he's ""going to Alaska"".",

It's just looks so natural, even the actors in this movie. It's a really interesting movie. And i keep guessing what is gonna happen next. Every scene of this movie, is all about his flash back story. He lived in a rich family, but he left it all, he burnt his money, and he gave it to charity, he went to Alaska, to lived there.

901,12 January 2009,forafewEurosmore,8, Long walk into the wilderness,"Hands up if you watched this film and identified yourself with high-flying college graduate Chris McCandless (brilliantly played by Emile Hirsch). Come on, be honest, surely you've day- dreamed about having enough of a free-spirited nature to see you give up all things materialistic and head for the great outdoors where you would survive all things thrown up at you - well, haven't you? Couldn't you see yourself doing what Chris McCandless does - forsake what promised to be a glittering future career in law, give away 24,000 dollars to charity, give up the pressures of modern day Western life and hit the highway heading for his Alaskan dream. Well I for one didn't identify myself with Chris. No. I identified with his dad. played magnificently by William Hurt (he's even better here than his role in Mr Brooks, if that's possible); a dad whose inability to show his son how much he loved him ( how many dads of his generation are guilty of this?) was one of the prime reasons that Chris hit the road in the first place. The scene where William Hurt goes out into the street, looks to the heavens and offers a tearful, silent prayer for the safety of his long- gone son is heart-wrenching; would that if he had his time again he would have shown his son how much he did indeed love him. On his travels Chris does find affection among the many like-minded free spirits who offer him shelter and, in some cases work, as he makes his way to his Alaskan dream. Chris finally makes it to the snow and ice-bound wilderness where his fight with nature is stunningly directed by Penn. The truly saddening aspect of this film as it draws to an end is that it shows a man who lives his dream but comes to realise that the best things in life may be free but they are nothing if they are not shared - a lesson learnt too late by his distraught father.

Emile Hirsch seems so innocent throughout the whole film even though he's hurting so many people. Sean Penn wanted to do this film for 10 years before he finally got the rights, so essentially he wasn't going to ruin the opportunity. Adventure films, to me, are the most ""complete"" films because they capture every aspect of a person's journey, life. Hal Holbrook's character toward the end of the film sums up the entire underlying theme of the film, can happiness be achieved alone? That question is answered at the end by Christopher Mccandless in a very direct way. I'm surprised Sean Penn wasn't featured as the father, but you can't argue with the casting of William Hurt.",

The breathtaking beauty of the film is coupled with the sensational soundtrack delivered by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. The concept of living off the land and escaping society is one that I can understand. The Transcendentalist views borrowed from Emerson and Thoreau fit nicely into my wheelhouse of thought, that's probably why I found the movie so captivating that it moved me to tears. I was worried about watching the movie a second time however, I thought that the feelings that it evoked in me wouldn't be as raw and moving the second time around. I worried that it wouldn't feel like the same movie, boy was I wrong. After learning more about Chris and buying the book that inspired Sean Penn to create the film, I can say that watching it a second time made me appreciate the film even more. It is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time and I believe that it's a movie everyone should watch at least once. 10/10",

Maybe that's all part of the point. I will give away the scenery as work something, and he did have some interesting experiences, meet some interesting people.

In the story there is many subordinate character, who is very different from character to character, so it can be confusing. It was a very long movie and at the end it was tiring to watch. The movie has some threads to the poem ""Composed During a Storm"", as a man who has tumult in his soul, and he tries to find himself in the system. The movie might need some more action to make it more exciting, it is very prolonged, and often the same storyline. Our main protagonist is played by Emile Hirsch, who play the role perfect, with both happiness and sadness and his good reactions.

The movie inspired me to think about what's important in life. Especially when I got to see how he developed and realized what he really wanted in life. The movie kind of reminds of the poem ""Composed During a Storm"", because of the simile in the wild nature and the protagonist fleeing from whatever environment he is in. However there is a contrast, because the protagonist in the poem tries to escape the wild nature, but Christopher in the movie escapes to nature, because he wants freedom, but he finds out that happiness only appears when shared. I really recommend the poem if you like the movie.",

As an example, when Ron and Chris have climbed up the desert rock, they sit there and talk about god. Then the sun starts shining on the pale faces, and they start to laugh. This is where the sublime effect hits Chris and Ron and symbolises that god has his eye upon them. Even though the movie is very symbolism heavy, it has some funny moments. I.e. when we meet the Danes, sitting on the rocks grilling sausages and hotdogs(Not all Danes are like that). Due to the fact that they are in their own peace and harmony in nature, they are another example of what Chris is searching for - inner harmony with himself. That is what he finds just as he dies where he is looking at the sun. The way he finds the sun just as all seems dark, is a lot like in the poem ""Composed during a storm"" where the protagonist finds the blue sky in the middle of the darkness in the storm.",

Based on the book of the same title by Jon Krakauer, Sean Penn creates magic by bringing to screen the true story of Christopher Johnson McCandless, a footloose American itinerant who hiked to Alaska on a spiritual journey to find himself. Narrated in a non linear fashion, beginning with Chris in Alaska, the movie sways back and forth between his past and present recounting his life's story and adventures. Chris McCandless, an intelligent young man with rock strong ideals craves for true freedom, trying to break away from the bonds of the materialistic society. He gets a college degree, donates his money to charity and burns some of it later on, abandons all of his possessions, and embarks on an odyssey to Alaska to find happiness.

He's not destitute, he chose to live like such as a decision. A freedom. Nobody deserves the right to down talk Chris. He did more to fulfill his dreams and passions than most couch critics.

What a well done job. The scene when the Alex met the girl in sixteen was wonderful and made me cry little it touched my heart The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great.",

What I learned from him is that I thought a convenient society makes us happy but it was the other way around. Also, I noticed that we need to live a life away from things in a materialistic society. In addition to there was something to learn from his regret. He said ""Happiness is only real when shared."" and remembered his family in the last scene. I thought that we can't get true happiness in life alone, so I have to build a human relationship with family, friends and other people.

Let satirists then laugh their fill at human affairs, let theologians rail, and let misanthropes praise to their utmost the life of untutored rusticity, let them heap contempt on men and praises on beasts; when all is said, they will find that men can provide for their wants much more easily by mutual help, and that only by uniting their forces can they escape from the dangers that on every side beset them: not to say how much more excellent and worthy of our knowledge it is, to study the actions of men than the actions of beasts.""",

It is a tale of a young man that chooses a simple, spiritually driven life over the materialistic life he witnessed growing up (in a dysfunctional household with an abusive father). It is aesthetically pleasing (including one of the best soundtracks ever, written and performed by Eddie Vedder) and very well acted. In a similar spirit to ""On the Road,"" it awakens the seeker that exists within many of us. It's narrated by his younger sister, with whom he shares a strong bond. It's beautifully sad. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend that you do.",

I was particularly fond of the way Penn found ways to incorporate small details from the book, things I thought that would have to be taken out however, Penn made everything fit perfectly and I was truly impressed.

Second of all, what a great-told story!
As a person who loves adventure and has dealt a lot with solitude, I could really relate to the character.
Loneliness can be good and it's important to remember that - but it's just equally important to realize the value of human connection. I understand this can get way more complicated than that, so I must say this is based on my personal opinion & experience.",

1006,2 August 2013,Manuelemoreira,9, Brilliant Movie... Worth your time.,"If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, something that defies the monotony of today's world then this is the movie for you. The movie centers around the spiritual ordeal of a man who is on a journey to find himself. Chris McCandless isolates himself from society, traveling into the wilderness of Alaska with nothing but minimal food supplies, books, and a backpack with several survival tools. Throughout his journey Chris meets several characters who each add substance and relevance to the story and further epitomizes the meaning of true happiness. The pace of the movie is slow, but the mesmerizing story compensates this lesser flaw. The movie will have you hooked from start to finish. Overall, the movie was brilliant, lessons are taught and you begin to wonder about the true purpose of our existence. It is definitely worth your time.",

The feelings, actions and decisions that Emile Hirsch's character makes really make you think about your own situation as well as his. I felt all the way through the film that I on some level could relate to the character and I think a lot of people can as well! It's a great cast of people within it. The actors chosen for the parts do an excellent job. Emile Hirsch really captures the soul of an adventurer. Vince Vaughn makes an excellent performer as a farmer as well, where he seemingly gets to take some of his own characteristics with. ",

1015,25 March 2016,PhaseKamel,8, Very Interesting,"Into the Wild establishes human's obsession for a better life through contrasting the protagonist's view of the dream and the infatuation of materialistic things of the people around him. This idea was prevalent in the 1990's as a lot of America has already achieved the American Dream demonstrated in Of Mice and Men. The film explores through Christopher McCandless that this preoccupation with physical things disconnects people from true human experiences. This is displayed through the repetition of ""things, things, things, things"" which emphasizes how people now only think about material possessions. This is further expressed when he quotes Thoreau ""rather than love, than money, than faith, than fame, than fairness, give me truth."" This accumulation of human ideals signifies Christopher's straight view of happiness, excluding major parts of his life to search for a contentment. Penn not only criticizes materialism but also delves into the American Dream and how it dictates everybody's approach to happiness. This is illustrated when Christopher says ""If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, then all possibility of life is destroyed."" Through Christopher, Penn expresses the issues with people's preoccupation with physical ideals and society's compulsion to impose everyone's happiness.",
