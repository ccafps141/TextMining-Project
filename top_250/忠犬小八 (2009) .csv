0,4 January 2010,Davor_Blazevic_1959,9, Unprecedented loyalty in a story of age-old friendship,"Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.",/

2,4 December 2009,elish-enuma-1,10, Couldn't stop crying,"I'm not at all an emotional person,but this movie really touched me,i couldn't even stop crying after 15 minutes from the final.I just sat on my armchair,and started to cry. This movie,teaches us first of all about love,there is no power bigger than love,nothing compares to this strong feeling. I'm really objective when it comes about movies,and honestly no one till now,have cut me as deep. It's surprising...but true,that everything in this world,is ruled by love,and if you thought that only humans are aware of this,you did wrong. I liked the performance,i loved the music(it was so so calm)",e
3,2 February 2010,surfer-lancealot,10, Extremely Emotional,Well what can i say. I'm a guy i don't cry about movies i know its fake but i gotta say this one caught me by surprise even tho id watched the trailer and read a few reviews already. by the end of the movie i was in tears absolutely broken down crying my eyes out. and saying that i probably haven't shed a tear in about 8 years for anything but i love dogs and this is the most amazing story I've ever seen this is probably the best movie I've seen in about 10 years and i have seen almost everything.,v
4,29 November 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""You want to wait for him, don't you?""","Oh my, hold everything. You want to be prepared to watch this movie with plenty of Kleenex on hand. It really does resonate for viewers who have a special bond with their pets, but I think it probably moves a few hearts of those who don't share hearth and home with a favorite canine. It's a bit ironic actually, to think about the picture's impact on a person, when a dog's reaction to it's missing owner invites more sympathy than one feels for the owner himself, who died of a heart attack.",i

(not exaggerating),"I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry, However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 -15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died, my heart died a little each time.",6

I have been a reader of user reviews on IMDb for a few years and this is the first time I felt I had to write something about a film. I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.",f
22,22 August 2014,planktonrules,7, It's hard to hate a cute doggy film...,"""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is a remake of a Japanese film, ""Hachi-Ko"" (1987). Oddly, however, this American version keeps SOME of the original Japanese story (such as the breed of dog, the dog's name and SOME of the events in the dog's life) and completely changes so much--especially since ""Hachi-Ko"" is based on a real life Japanese occurrence, not in America.

That's in our nature, We humans have the tendency to forget. This story is great portrayal of a Dog who's whole revolves around one man, Parker. Its a simple story told in a simple manner, yet it nearly brought tears to my eyes.

You set yourself and steel yourself against it. There will be no tears, you insist to yourself. It's just a movie - even if it is based on a true story in Japan almost 80 years ago. But it's still just a movie. No tears. But in the end you have to succumb. This is literally an emotional roller coaster, with ups and downs from beginning to end.

An adorable young boy gets up in front of his classroom and starts to talk about his hero. The kids all laugh when he mentions that it is his grandfather's dog. But from the moment you see this cute little puppy being boxed up and sent overseas to the United States and found by Richard Gere when he breaks his way out of the box, you are hooked. This is no ordinary little puppy. He ain't ""Marley"", ""Lassie"", ""Hooch"", or ""Beethoven"". He doesn't easily learn how to fetch and he destroys one of Gere's wife's (Joan Allen) art pieces as well. But he doesn't slobber, pee, poop or chase the cat.

I love it because of the cute dog, optimistic yet realistic tone, the true bonds between the characters and the sheer loyalty involved. Yes, I did cry near the end. I hate it because of the blatant Hollywood emotional manipulation and the lack of any substantial plot. I simultaneously want to celebrate this as an 8/10 genuine heartwarmer (how I *feel*) and as a 3/10 artificial maudlin schlock fest (how I *think*).

Let's face it, they're as vulnerable as children! I spent sixty minutes wondering where this was going, at one point I thought it was a dog training film. Then followed a brief moment when I had to recover my posture having fallen off my chair and, while the remainder of the film did have me under some emotional turmoil, it wasn't until the final few stills that I could put into context the contrivance I'd absorbed. The saddest part is that if you replaced the dog with a child with learning difficulties this film would be long gone and forgotten.",
40,14 March 2010,gradyharp,10," Love, Loyalty, Commitment, Devotion","There are some films that deserve a five star review for reasons other that artistic success on every level; HACHI; A DOG'S TALE is one of those, for despite some minor technical problems with the film (the sound editing seems absent as the music - a fine score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental rather than intentional, etc), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers. Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both Kaneto Shindô and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallström. ",

43,30 March 2010,wbafanclub12,8, Superbly made,"I find myself giving this film a lower vote than it probably deserves and perhaps through no fault of the film itself. Let me explain. I am lucky enough that in my job I get to take people who I work with to the cinema. After planning on seeing a gangster flick, we ended up going into the wrong screen and ended up watching Hachi: A dogs story. We did not move to the right screen as by my watch the film had started 10 minutes before. The point is, from the start of the film when the 'U' classification came up (Suitable for 4 years +) I was a bit disappointed. Now as an actor I like Richard Gere but for the first few minutes I found his character a bit 'wooden'. At first I put this down to him having a bad film, but the more I think about it I think it was somehow done to emphasise his relationship with Hachi. Anyway, half an hour into the film disillusionment had gone and I was really enjoying the film. What was excellent for me, was that because I had never heard of the film, I had no idea what was to come. The film does an excellent job of surrounding itself around Hachi the dog. The only fancy gimmick is the occasional sight through Hachi's eyes which is done in black and white but this is only occasional. There are no doggy voices or doggy thoughts, but you still get involved with Hachi's emotions and how he is feeling. Towards the end of the film I was that into Hachi's character that I found myself bursting into tears, something that had not happened to me since I was 8years old watching ET. Luckily, we were the only ones in the cinema.",

45,3 March 2016,Quinoa1984,8," kind of an impossible film to truly hate, though I don't quite love it","Hachi: A Dog's Tale may be 'syrupy' to some, that word that is a euphemism for 'sappy', 'sentimental', 'feel-good'. It's all that, but I think that what sets apart this film from what this could have been (maybe Marley & Me comes to mind) is that it sticks to being as simple as possible - it's a no-frills kind of light-hearted drama, if that makes sense. As soon as Richard Gere sees this dog at the station - basically as cute a puppy as one will see in a movie that's meant to be taken seriously - that's how the movie will go. It doesn't pump up much artificial drama at all, and the only real conflict is a major one that comes about halfway or maybe 2/3rd a way into the movie, and it's one that is meant to bring on the water-works for the rest of the audience in the remaining run-time.",

52,30 November 2020,samhill5215,1, A testament to inhumanity,"Despite it's designation as a children's film it's anything but and should be avoided at all costs. The story begins well enough but careens into utter heartlessness once the professor dies and the dog is left to fend for itself, dependent on the charity of strangers. There's nothing to celebrate here. Yes, Hachi was a loyal companion who faithfully waited for his master to return. But once he died why didn't his widow or daughter adopt him? How could they have been so insensitive? I repeat, there's nothing to celebrate here. The story does nothing but testify to his family's insensitivity. At the very least they could have provided for him with a doghouse, regular care and food instead of letting him sleep in a train yard, exposed year round to the elements for ten years. TEN YEARS! And then the widow runs into him after all those years and all she could do was hug him as if that makes up for her disgraceful behavior. How anyone could find this story inspiring is beyond me. Be forewarned! Like me you might end up crying but not out of admiration for Hachi's perseverance. Instead it might be because you can't believe people can be so cruel. Don't be fooled by the high scores or the uplifting score, or the brilliant cinematography, or the performances. Whether you share your life with animals and perhaps especially if you do you'll come to rue your investment in this story.",

But the truth is that I feel every day how uncomfortable dogs can be, if they fall into the hands of careless owners, or those who do not teach them properly: they howl when alone, they make a lot of noise when other animals pass by, they run to sniff and lick other people without their owners paying attention if they want to have contact with their animals and, worse, they defecate anywhere without their owners taking care to collect the droppings. Yes, the education of dog owners in Portugal is non-existent in most cases. The fault, of course, lies entirely with the imbecile human owners, but it helped me not to harbor sympathy for these animals. The fair, in these things, always pays for the sinner.",

Hachi ( means the lucky number 8 in Japanese language) was an abandoned dog who ultimately is adopted by Professor Parker Wilson in Bedridge Town Railway Station. Parker , following his wife's constant complaining to keep the dog, tries to give it to someone else but destiny plays different role and no matter how much he tries to shove Hachi away , it keeps on coming back to him with nobody willing to take the lost puppy. Eventually , a deep bond builds in between the two and Parker finally decides to take him home. Hachi becomes so close to his master that everyday he waits for him to return home at 5 PM in the nearby railway station and this becomes his regular habit. Now , a dog's story has always moved me right from Marley& Me to Red Dog and this film goes a one step ahead with such a delightful and touching story of a canine who becomes a legend in the small town after he waits for his master at the gateway of Bedridge railway station for nine years following his master's death. Lasse Hallstorm ( Chocolate , Whats Eating Gilbert Grape) has chosen a very heart-felt story which will make you laugh , cry , love and feel for dogs who I believe are the most faithful animals in the world. The direction is simply superb and script is tight that will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. The cinematography is eye-catching , the art direction is wonderful with an awesome background score. The performances are stupendous. Richard Gere excels in the role of Professor who feel compassionate for the animal. The dog essaying the role of Hachi was gorgeous and full of expressions. Other starcast did a fine job as well.",
67,16 April 2010,jonnyfendi,8, Learned Humanity from A Dog Story,"""Hachiko"" is based on the real story that actually happened in 1925 at Shibuya, Tokyo. There's a dog named Hachiko, devotedly waiting the return of his master every day at the train station. Unfortunately, one day his master died and never showed up again. But afterward Hachiko kept waiting on the same spot every single day. The story is widely spread and very well-known in Japan. The Director of thiz movie is Lasse Hallström. Hallström made many modest and effective dramas. His famous works are ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" (1993), ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999) and ""Chocolat"" (2000). The movie tries to capture how the event occurs, while the setting and characters are adjusted to United States background. Richard Gere played as Prof. Wilson. Joan Allen and Sarah Roemer played as his wife and daughter. Gere performs his character properly. He looks so compassionate and lovable. The storyline is also filled with simplicity. The plots try to build the sympathy from the beginning and mount up in the end of the movie. The movie simply tells you the story about what happens after his master death. I think thiz movie will easily affect on you, especially if you are a dog lover or a person who ever raise a dog. Thiz is totally just a powerful story behind the real event. The movie is luckily enough to have some good materials to make you cry.",

Instead of the dog dying on the owner, the owner dies on the dog. This is actually based on a true story except it happened in the 1940s instead of in the present day. Richard Gere, well, it's Richard Gere, what more can be said? Richard Gere doesn't need to do too much to light up the screen. But the real star is (are) the dog(s) that portray(s) Hichiko. You don't expect so much emotion and facial expression to come from a canine and that is why the last twenty minutes or so of this movie is so gut wrenching. We feel for the dog as if it is human, perhaps feel even stronger for it because it is not human and doesn't know that its master isn't going to someday reappear. This is a very fun, lighthearted movie that at the last moment turns into a true tear jerker. It becomes so sad that it is quite disturbing.

74,29 May 2010,robert-temple-1,10," The ultimate dog film weepie, impossible not to cry no matter who you are","This one really will make you cry, even those who think they can't. Hachi, full name Hachiko, is an Akito dog from Japan. In this film he is sent to America, where his story unfolds. But there was a real Hachi, who lived in Japan, and this story is true, although it really all took place in Japan. So famous is the real dog Hachi that a life-size bronze statue of him was erected in his home town in his memory! By transferring the story of Hachi to America, it meant that Richard Gere could be 'Hachi's mother', the university professor who finds Hachi lost on a railway platform and with whom the little puppy bonds for life, with fanatical devotion. I was going to say with superhuman devotion, but I guess supercanine devotion is a better way to put it. I noticed that this film was distributed by a subsidiary of Sony, so perhaps that is how a Japanese tale ended up being transposed to Rhode Island, where Gere is presumably meant to be teaching at Brown University. (His educational and professional life is only roughly sketched.) The one false note in this film is Joan Allen, who plays Gere's wife. Although she was brilliant in OFF THE MAP (see my review), she gets the tone wrong here, which may be the fault of the otherwise brilliant Lasse Hallström, who has directed this film otherwise nearly to perfection. Allen falls into the trap in the early part of the story of acting the part of the censorious, sour and unsympathetic wife, who has become just as much a stock character in modern American movies as the embittered and vicious ex-wife or the 'angry young woman' who takes her revenge on men. Although Allen softens up as things go on, she is never convincingly warm either towards her husband or his dog, whom she initially fanatically opposes (for reasons which are entirely unclear other than the presumption that Gere's wife, not any potential girl dog whom Hachi might ever meet, is a bitch). I found that aspect of the film disappointing, disturbing, and incomprehensible. Hachi starts out as a puppy, becomes an adult, and then becomes an old dog, so there must have been at least three Hachis acting in the film. Hallström is known as a dog lover, and he aptly subtitles this film: 'A Dog's Love Story', as the attention is all on Hachi. Richard Gere is absolutely superb as the man who learns to love his dog more than anyone or anything. He and Hachi become inseparable, and every day at 5 PM, Hachi trots over to the railway station to meet his master's train and accompany him on the walk home. But Richard Gere has a heart attack and dies whilst teaching, and when Hachi goes to meet the train that day, his master does not appear as normal at the station door. Various events ensue, but Hachi cannot settle with any other member of the family, as they have all left the original house near the station, so Hachi returns to his post every day and waits for his master. He does this every day for ten years. (The real Hachi in Japan did it for nine years.) He faithfully waits and scans the station door every day at 5 PM, never giving up hope or losing his loyalty to the man he adores. He does this come rain or shine, he sits in the snow, he lives on scraps, but nothing can deter him or shake his loyalty. There are some really good performances by minor characters associated with the station, a hot-dog seller (sensitively portrayed by the Indian actor Erick Avari), some station employees, and other locals such as a friendly butcher and his wife, and even a real Japanese professor (excellently played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who had been a friend of Gere, who comes and speaks to Hachi in Japanese, which Hachi from his facial expression clearly recognises. Hachi's point-of-view shots are all shot in black and white, from ground level, presumably on the theory that dogs do not see in colour. They are very effective indeed, which is not an easy thing to pull off. I don't know why poor Hachi was left outside at night in a doghouse. Any half sensible person would have wanted Hachi in the house at night, rather than in the cold during the winter, however thick his fur might be. But then people are weird, and only dogs are sensible and loving, as this film proves. If ever a dog could teach us all something it is Hachi. He can instruct us in the true meaning of the word 'loyalty', both the dictionary meaning of which and the daily application of which have become so unfashionable in our current narcissistic society, where no even looks at another person anymore, as everyone's eyes are now out of focus, staring into space vacantly while listening to someone talk nonsense on a cellphone, oblivious of all surroundings. This film is so sad and such a desperate weepie that even the most hardened narcissist might turn his Blackberry off for a few moments of reflection, that is, if he has sufficient attention span to watch two or three continuous minutes of anything other than a combat computer game. I had great fun watching this DVD with Dutch subtitles. I now know that 'Good Boy!' in Dutch is 'Brave Hond!', 'Really?' is 'Echt waar?', and if I ever want to call anyone 'Sweetie' when I am next in the Netherlands, all I have to do is say 'lieverd' and smile. So you see how much else Hachi has taught me? I really recommend turning on the foreign subtitles when you watch movies, as you can learn a foreign language at the same time as seeing the film. Such fun!",

78,15 December 2012,ragingbull_2005,9," Prepare to be laugh,cry and be devastated by this extraordinary drama","Well, to begin with a confession. I have been crying for nearly the last half hour. These have not been tears of frustration on watching yet another jaded entertainer or difficult to fathom artsy flick. These are tears of gratitude towards the director of the movie for what is easily the most sensitive and touching portrayal of the bond between a man and a dog. Richard Gere is the music professor at a college who finds an abandoned dog at the train station. He takes it to his home. His wife (Joan Allen) is initially against keeping the dog with them because of a reason. But slowly she understands that her husband had become totally crazy for it and he ends up becoming a part of their family which also includes a daughter. Gere finds out that its name is Hachiko. The film tracks the relation between Gere and Hachiko over their life time. The incidents are funny and poignant and you would be laughing as well as suppressing sniffles. Gere is in the acting form of his life and you can clearly see that he loves Hachiko. Their chemistry burns up the screen and lifts this from a very good movie to a truly extraordinary one. Allen is better than average as his wife. There are a bunch of characters that fall in love with Hachiko and they are sketched very vividly. But the film belongs to the titular Hachiko. The director uses black and white to show his point of view. Watching many scenes I thought I could understand that the director was trying to show that we may be thinking that our pet is really fine and cozy in its place but what it actually wants at that time is to be with us, in our arms. Hachiko wins your heart and bowls you over and devastates you by the end of the run time. I have never owned an animal in my life time. I guess it is time to set this right. As one of my friend wrote and it has stayed with me ever since, when you go and select a dog perhaps that may be the only occasion you get to select your relative.

82,6 February 2015,buckikris,10, Hachi: A Touching Film About True Love And Devotion,"This is one of the best dog films ever, surpassing Marley and Me.I had know idea this film came out in 2009, it is one of those sleeper hits. I lost my dog in July 2014, and was debating on renting this movie. I saw it on Redbox, and thought why not. The movie is about an Akita pup who makes it's way from Japan to the United States. It arrives at a train station,it gets loose from it's cage. Parker Wilson(Richard Gere) comes along and finds him. He figures the dog belongs to somebody and tells Carl( Jason Alexander), the train station manager. He asks Carl if he could keep him until the owner comes. When Carl says I can come in, in the morning; and drop him off at the pound. Parker has second thoughts, and decides to take him home. He finds a box to put him in, until he can find the owner. Parker has him in the den, and decides he his safe until morning. The dog wants to be with Parker, he gets loose climbs up the stairs to Parker's and Cate's room. The dog licks Cate's feet, and scares her. She tells Parker about their agreement, no more dogs. Parker get's up, and put's the dog out in the shed for the night. everyone in the house wants the dog to stay except Cate. A bond begins to form with Parker, and Hachi. Cate sees this with Parker, Andy( their daughter); and decides to give in. The Parker's have a new family member. As Hachi begins to grow the bond becomes stronger. Every work day, Hachi would go to the train station with Parke,r and meet him when he returns. Hachi is a very loyal dog, who is a one master dog literally. When Parker doesn't come home from work one day, Hachi sits there until the family picks him up. Parker had a heart attack teaching class, and died. Hachi seems lost after this, but he would do the same routine every work day like Parker was going to return. Hachi is a regular at the station, and is beloved by all there. They would feed him, look after him, and let him stay there. He was sent to live with Andy, and her husband, but he didn't want to live anywhere so lived close by under a train on the tracks . I guess he did this to be close to the station; he just wanted his master to return. As the years go by, you still see the strong devotion of this dog. He doesn't give up, the same routine every day, you feel for the dog. In a way he seems lost; but he is strong willed. This movie is very heartwarming, it has it's sad moments; but the humor it has will put a smile on your face. At the end of the film it shows a picture of the real Hachi. It also has the factual information with it, which is very interesting. In Japan there is a huge statue of Hachi at the train station, where Hachi would wait. This is a great film the whole family will enjoy. Even though it is sad the ending is touching. It is a tear jerker so have those tissues nearby. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",

And yes, if you don't feel like crying, then give this a hard pass! It is based on a true story probably familiar to dog lovers, but be forewarned that almost all the details (except for the dog's name and behavior) have been drastically reworked for American audiences. The dog's co-stars are Richard Gere and Joan Allen, who are both fine, but neither really has much to do other than lean into their usual on-screen personas (him: sexy, charismatic but a little bland; her: smart, sexy & prickly).

90,11 March 2012,achraj,10," A moving story of faith, love and devotion","Lasse Hallström's latest is based on a true story – transplanted from 1930s Japan to contemporary New England – about a faithful Akita dog called Hachi. Hallström's unfussy, effective film uses several visual techniques – dog's eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames – to tell the often moving tale of Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), a music professor and family man who surrenders to the charms of dog ownership. When Parker dies and his family sells up and moves away, Hachi legs it back to the railway station where his owner used to arrive home from work and keeps vigil there for almost a decade. Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of death as about a mutt's loyalty and devotion. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat throughout.

Low-keyed American remake of a 1987 Japanese film, ""The Tale of Hachiko"", itself based upon a true story, has sweet and lovely passages, though overall content is lacking. Family-friendly movies about the bond between humans and animals nearly always work if the casting is right; here, the canine who portrays the older Hachi is a gorgeous, expressive creature--so how could the filmmakers miss? Co-produced by its star, Richard Gere, and directed by Lasse Hallström, the film touches on universal emotions when it comes to our beloved pets, but the human interaction (disconcertingly subdued throughout) is under-nourished. Playing Gere's wife, Joan Allen is unable to find a character in the writing; and when the dog is moved around in the film's latter stages, Allen's actions (and her subsequent disappearance) are puzzling. Gere doesn't really have a character to portray either, but he's appealing and unhurried in his scenes with the dog, projecting a warmly lackadaisical presence. Hallström, minus his barbed sense of human dynamics, must have helmed this project as a lark. He indeed guides the narrative with an assured, steady hand, but ""Hachi"" is far too subdued overall to make a big impact. **1/2 from ****",

If not for anything else, Hachi displays the genuine loyalty and bond that a dog can have with a human. Those scenes alone were enough to get me emotionally in pieces, and then came the final 15 minutes when the film comes to a close and I found out that it was based on a true story. Admittedly, the film doesn't surround itself with better than average human characters, besides the owner of course, but Hachi is enough to give the 90 minute runtime just the boost it needs.

Presumably there are at least three dogs involved playing the puppy, the mature Hachi, and old Hachi. They are all fantastic. What strikes me every time, though, is Richard Gere's performance. I've not been a big fan of Gere's over the years, since seeing American Gigolo when it was first released. But he is so natural in this film and so clearly having real fun with Hachi, that it is a totally winning performance. Two small points in the Plot Summary: Carl did not teach Hachi to fetch. Rather, as Ken said, Hachi would fetch when it meant something, so the only time he fetched the ball was when he was trying to keep Parker from going to work, mysteriously knowing what was going to happen. Secondly, describing Joan Allen as a bossy, jealous wife kind of misses the point. Many couples decide against having a dog because one of them objects, and in fact she is won over when she sees how happy Hachi makes her husband.",

120,22 April 2010,alvispotter-1,10, Couldn't stop crying but i loved it,"Hachiko wasn't a film i was expecting to see, due to the fact that here in Mexico the translation to Spanish sucked and the marketing did as well. But my brother had to see it for school, and i wasn't going to deny going to a dog's film. I love dogs, and i loved Marley and me with its drama, so i was expecting something like that. What did i get?? besides my unstoppable sobbing throughout the film and the fact that my red eyes hurt a lot later, i loved this film. This is the definition of an EMOTIONAL film. Richard Gere does it great here (better than in pretty woman, in my OP) with bonding Hachi, who was beautiful as a puppy, as the regular hachi, and even as the old one. He was extremely beautiful and i love beautiful and tender dogs. So even in the happy parts i started to shed a happy tear, but from the moment... (well, you know what moment) i couldn't stop crying throughout the film. I actually consider myself a sensitive guy, but i never cry OUT LOUD in the cinema. I tried to hold it, but just couldn't. This has to be one of the two films in which i have cried the most in my whole life, and that's a good thing. I actually love the emotional moments in every film. The story is greatly portrayed, and the relationship couldn't be better. God, when hachi dreams of him i just couldn't stop sobbing. Poor hachi, really. And of course what got me is the friendship and loyalty scent that this movie doesn't lack at all. I definitely will buy it, cause i love dogs and i love emotional films.

First minutes are reasonably predictable, since we all know that, in the end, the family would adopt the little dog anyways. It is nice the way Gere's character became friends with the little animal, and it was beautiful to see their activities together-- specially when Mr. Wilson tries to teach him how to catch a ball or any object. In a moment I couldn't imagine how the movie could become sad if the dog didn't die, but some scenes after I found it could be worse than that-- I'm not spoiling on that. Photography direction is beautiful, and so are acting and story.

Another strength is that Gere is supported by many great supporting actors and actress, Jason Alexander of Seinfeld being one of them, who all together played their roles great and making this tale a masterful film. Hachi the dog is one overly cute Akita, portrayed by 3 different dogs (different time lines of the film) all trained well. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is truly the best representation of loyalty, love and happiness. No matter how sad you feel, a dog like Hachi will make you feel more happy than a billionaire.

Morover, this is a remake of the Japan movie ""HACHIKO MONOGATARI"" (1987): another Holloywood version of a beautiful foreign movie. It's better to see the original. This will be forgotten in a few years.",

Being Japanese American I had heard about the original story from my Mom. I thought the movie was very well done, not going for cheap sentimentality but showing very well the bond between Hachi and the Professor. I have read some other posts where the readers took the family to task for seemingly ""abandoning"" Hachi after the professor died. For one, it's a MOVIE. Also, we don't know where the professor's wife was going, maybe dogs weren't allowed. Also, the daughter had more of a bond, so that is why Hachi went with her. I also don't think she ""abandoned"" him either. She was wise enough to know that she and her family would never replace the professor in Hachi's heart and would be miserable if he stayed.",

183,2 January 2014,Sandcooler,7," Dull characters, but the dog is darn cute","The true story of Hachiko might be very touching, but how can you translate it to the screen? It's a dog waiting for his dead owner to come back while sitting in the same spot for years, how do you make that visually interesting? Director Lasse Halstrom partially solves this problem by having Richard Gere die very late into this movie, a bit too late perhaps. The whole family is just so bland, what do we get to know about these people throughout the movie? They're happy. That's pretty much the character development. There are only so many scenes about Richard Gere playing with a dog you can stomach without wondering when something's going to happen. The last half hour of this movie manages to save a lot though. Seeing Hachi interact with all of his owner's old friends who can't convince him he will never be back, watching him badly age while everyone around him knows he's wasting his time, it's all very strong because the build-up does work to some extent. It's kinda boring, but we do feel like we get to know Hachi well and that makes it all the more sad when we see him suffer. Everything that concerned Hachi I loved, the rest I can sorta do without.",

His wife (Allen) clearly is not to fond of dogs and tells her husband that there is no way that they will be keeping the dog. Of course no one claims the dog and the wife realizes how much the husband and the daughter (Roemer) love the dog so she caves and lets them keep it. You clearly see the bond between Hachi and Parker with all the time they spend together and Hachi actually starts walking Parker to the train station and waiting for him when he gets back.

So many movies attempt to be so much more than they can possibly manage in 90 minutes, this movie does not do that. Its purpose is stated entirely in the title, a dogs tale. This is a simple movie about a dog. Unlike Marley and Me, the movie is not about the OWNERS of the dog. The owners are obviously in Hachi - but the movie is about the dog, its life and its devotion. Given that the movie is also based somewhat closely on a true story, it makes it that much more powerful. It is too bad that this movie was not released theatrically or more well known.

221,11 December 2013,Jerghal,6, Manipulative,"It's not because you care about animals and find dogs cute that any movie about a cute dog and his sad fate makes it automatically a good movie. Because that is why this film is scoring so high on IMDb. Director Lasse Hallström was probably eager take make a film where he could jerk the tears out of people. I just couldn't help feeling constantly manipulated and pushed around by the slimy piano music and the forced script and acting. I was thinking before I saw this film: how can they make people care so much for a dog it would make them cry and there really is only one way, the easy way which they took here (No spoilers but futurama episode 1 has a 1 min dog-sequence which this film ripped off which works so much better then Hachi). I have to say the dog is cute -although I'm more a cat person- and he does look sooo very sad at times in this film you can't help but feel sorry for the poor animal, but this is the manipulative effect this film has on people and Lasse knows and uses it so well. The dog trainers did a good job, kudos there but you do sometimes notice the dog is looking at something (the dog trainer) out of frame who is directing the dog to do certain things. The cinematographer also scores some bad points: this film was filmed digitally on a Genesis camera, but the picture has a very video/TV-like look which reinforces the feeling this is simply a low budget TV movie and not the cinematic masterpiece a lot of people seem to think it is. I know people who loved this movie won't understand and think me unempathetic for saying all this, but I love films and sometimes you need to dare point out the bad as well. It's like when a bad actor dies. Nobody dare say he sucked coz emotions have the upper hand but he was a bad actor all the same.",

Tragically his master died at work and never came back, but Hachiko waited 10 years for him to come home and died at the train station still waiting. Hachi, A Dogs Tale was a beautiful movie about the real Hachiko and the loyalty and love he had for his master. Richard Gere is a great actor and his character is believable and likable, and Hachi (a Japanese style Akita) is absolutely adorable! I seriously wanted to hug him throughout the movie. The setting was a little different (Rhode Island instead of Japan) but it didn't really matter. The story is heartbreaking and lovely as you watch Hachi wait for his master until they are finally reunited. As a warning though: Bring tissues, this movie is super sad!!!",
223,15 May 2011,nowwinaditya,10, It's God's way of telling us what Loving someone truly is.,"If i am writing review no 132 for a movie,then it clearly suggests i would not have much to say.But still,despite the repeated calls,my heart disobeys my mind and here i am scribbling something about a movie which is beyond the realms of any accolade or criticism.That's what this movie embodies.It is the call of the heart over the mind.It's an eternal classic which goes on in your mind forever.The greatness of the movie lies not just in the fact that it struck a hitherto concealed chord in your heart but in the fact that it will continue to do so even if you watch this movie again and again.It's as pristine as the first ray of sunshine after a long thunderstorm,as melancholic as ""The Autumn of the Middle Ages"" by Huizinga.It grows on you like a vintage single malt.It's prose lies not in the words but in the expression.It's as beautiful as Dante's Divine Comedy,and as long and enthralling like ""The Mahabharata"".I would just like to say that if human emotions were a artist then Hachiko would be the oeuvre of that artist.",
224,28 August 2019,RobLuvsTheMountains,7, tear jerker,"This is an entertaining movie and a real tear jerker. The problem is the writing. The writing suffers trying to make a 1930's Japanese true story into an American modern story. Most people probably wouldn't make the kinds of choices the people make in this movie. As a result there are some things in the plot that just don't work and it's no coincidence that it's the same plot lines that didn't actually happen. For instance, how is it that the Joan Allen character does not know that Hachi is no longer living with her daughter, that he is living under a train and being fed by local business owners, and that every day he waits at his special spot for Daddy to come back? This scene, where she finds out that Hachi is doing this, is supposed to be very touching but it was ruined b/c I couldn't believe that the daughter has not told her any of this. After all, 10 years has passed and the daughter lives nearby. Why the mother had to move away is not explained and seems odd. In spite of the movies flaws I would still say it is worth a watch. Unlike other viewers, I don't think there are ""lessons"" in this movie, however, I did shed a tear at the end. I was touched in spite of the bad writing.",

It's a beautiful depiction of perspective of humans and those of animals for each-other.

For others, who really don't much believe in such things, watch this movie, It'd make you do ! The soul-stirring loyalty offered by the pet will make you cry along.

231,27 May 2012,manendra-lodhi,5, A little bit in everything but not enough!!,The films main focus is on the dog so you are bound to be interested in watching the film. But I must say they focused too much on the actual story and should have inserted some interesting elements deliberately because it all looked like a boring story in the end. The actual story should have been told verbally by people coz the interesting part is only in the beginning and somewhat in the middle. I got bored in the end and was hoping to get something interesting in the end. A disappointing experience I must say. Well the part that I appreciate is that there were not too many characters inserted just to increase the length of the film. Than at sometimes I could not understand some of the things that the dog was doing. May be I was not able to understand. In all the humans as well as the dog performed very well but the story seemed to be a little bit uninteresting.,
232,15 December 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,2," It's stupidity, not loyalty.","This film is pathetic, I know it's based on true story which was pathetic to begin with. There are so many problems why it sucks. Firstly, it's pretty boring. Secondly, the dog is just plain stupid. So he never fetched a ball and supposedly, as it was said, he waited for a special moment to fetch. He, of course, chose the moment before his master's death, which means he clearly knew his master was going to die that day. That means that he waited for him later on even though he knew he was never coming back. If it was about loyalty, the dog would have waited for him if he did not knew his master was dead, so he would have waited for him, no matter what, hoping he would come one day, because he has no reason to doubt his master - that is loyalty. Here, he knows his master is dead, yet he keeps going there waiting for him which is just plain stupidity. It's like running into the wall and then being surprised that the wall was in your path... Anyway the movie ends with hallucination or imagination of his master finally coming, which is truly predictable, lame and forced. This film is one of the worst and most unreal tearjerkers I've ever seen, even the cheap sad piano music feels very forced and bad taste. This movie teaches terrible morals, there's nothing inspiring or admirable about the dog.",
233,29 March 2013,manchez@sbcglobal.net,10, Loyal dog waits for owner.,"This movie found me. While looking for a theme to highlight mom's life on her 80th BD, I took her to the movies without knowing what was playing and chose this over the 6 other gore feasts. Family loyalty and fidelity are highlighted in a clear and succinct manner by Hachi's behavior, while contrasting the denial of any bond by the grieving?? wife(she came back first to see her lasting Theater legacy before other family remembrances). I agree the modern day setting makes the story implausible, but we will forgive the national narcissism. Gere is splendid in matching the dog's facial expression. The camera work surrenders to the view by Hachi only partially. Great cure for eye dryness!!!",

248,18 May 2017,jboothmillard,6, Hachi: A Dog's Tale,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film in the cinema, I remember the leading actor and the dog, I didn't remember it was a fact-based film, so I was looking forward to trying it, directed by Lasse Hallström (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Cider House Rules, Dear John). Basically schoolboy Ronnie (Kevin DeCoste) has to give an oral presentation about a personal hero, his subject is his grandfather's dog, Hachikō, his classmates laugh at first when he begins, but he continues and tells the story. The story flashbacks to several years earlier, in Bedridge, in suburban New York City, Ronnie's grandfather was college music/performing arts Professor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), he catches the train to and from work every day. One day, an Akita puppy sent from Japan has escaped its cage and is lost at the train station, on a routine day Parker finds the puppy, he takes him home intending to return it to the station and find its owner the following day. Parker learns the next day that the puppy was being shipped to an unknown location, the shipping tag was lost, but he is wearing a collar with a symbol, his Japanese professor friend Ken (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) translates the symbol as saying Hachikō, which means good fortune. They do not find the owner, and Parker's wife Cate (Joan Allen) does not think they should keep the puppy, now given the name Hachi, but they do keep him, and a year later the dog and Parker have become very close. Hachi refuses to do dog-like activities, like catch and fetch, one day Hachi follows Parker to the train station for work, he refuses to leave until Parker walks him home, so the dog waits patiently for Parker to return, Parker is surprised to see him there, but this becomes a daily routine. One day, Hachi waits patiently for Parker as the train arrives, he is unaware that Parker has died of a cerebral haemorrhage during a lecture in class, Hachi continues to wait in the snow for hours, until Parker's son-in-law Michael (Robbie Collier Sublett) comes to get him. Although everyone tries to tell Hachi that Parker has died, Hachi doesn't understand, so he returns to the train station, there he waits every day, hoping for the return of Parker. As time passes, Cate sells the house and Hachi is taken to live with her daughter Andy (Sarah Roemer), Michael and their baby Ronnie, however Hachi escapes and finds his way back to the station, to sit in his usual spot. Andy takes Hachi back home, but sees how depressed the dog is, she lets him out to return to the station, there he waits every day, and sleeps in the rail yard every night, he is fed daily by the train station workers that knew Parker. Hachi becomes notable for waiting outside the station everyday, a journalist makes a newspaper article, Ken visits Hachi after reading the newspaper. Cate returns to town to visit Parker's grave on the tenth anniversary of his death, she meets Ken, she is stunned to find a now elderly Hachi still waiting outside the train station, overcome with grief she sits by Hachi's side, she returns home and tells now ten-year-old Ronnie all about Hachi. Meanwhile Hachi the dog continues to wait at the station, through all seasons, until his body can wait no longer, he is last seen lying in the snow, alone and still, his last vision is of Parker finally appearing and picking him up, leading him into the afterlife. Ronnie concludes on why Hachi is his hero, his class is moved by the story, with many who laughed at first holding back tears, after school he is met by his father and his own puppy, also named Hachi, Ronnie and Hachi walk down the same route where Parker and Hachi spent much of their time together. Also starring Seinfeld's Jason Alexander as Carl, The Mummy's Erick Avari as Jasjeet, Davenia McFadden as Mary Anne and Tora Hallström (Lasse's daughter) as Heather. Gere is perhaps unusual casting, but is actually perfect with his time on screen as the dog's owner, Allen does well also, the other supporting stars are fine being nice people as well, but you cannot deny it is the adorable Akita dog that is the star of the show, the real dog had a statue that stands outside a train station. When you know that the story is true, about a loving relationship between a man and his dog, and then the dog showing great dedication for his owner, even after death, it makes this story so sweet, it is not too sentimental or slushy, it is tragic, but it is a wonderfully touching and heartwarming family drama based on a true story. Good!",

But all in all it was worth it, as it makes you believe in love and loyalty to the end, definitely worth seeing. The dog, an Akita, was so amazing. It made me want to look into the breed a bit, but I think the idea is that any dog could be this loving and loyal to their owner. The actors/actresses did a great job, and just knowing it was based on a true story made it even more profound in my opinion. I am glad I did not see this in the theater and at home as I am afraid of how much I would have cried with the big screen, bad enough on my TV at home.",

264,22 August 2018,The_Film_Auditor,6, Was this written by a 50-year-old hack?,"I was surprised at how poorly written Hachi: A Dog's tale was. This film felt like a made-for-TV Hallmark movie that was written by a 50-year-old. The dialog and many of the scenes were very cliche and stale (ex: the skunk scene), making it hard not to roll your eyes while watching. The writing was also very emotionally manipulative, using a puppy's cuteness and other overly dramatic elements to play the audience. Another one of the major issues I have with this film is the pacing. There were many story elements that I felt should have been cut, and others seemed to happen too quickly. It also did not help that the film was missing a climax. The one moment that could have been the climax of the film took place a little over halfway through and felt abrupt, which I thought was an odd choice. Really, this film should have been much shorter; maybe like a 30 minute short. That would have helped with the pacing and left more of an emotional impact.",

267,22 August 2012,lemonsaresweet1,10, A lesson about the meaning of love,"After watching this film I was left touched and remained thinking about it for hours. I realised that this film is not about a dog and a man, but about love and loyalty. Dogs, unlike humans, do not misconstrue love for the need for gifts, flowers and chocolates but recognise it as what it truly is; complete appreciation between two people, or of course any two animals. As the story is real it shows the unbreakable bond that love is. When Cate saw Hachi still waiting I exploded into uncontrollable tears, which continued until well after the movie ended. It demonstrated that although Hachi waited every day that Cate was also devoted as she still also felt that longing for her lost husband and made me empathise with the fact that, although Cate had moved on in her life, it was merely because of the different depth of understanding and responsibility between herself and the dog. Nevertheless, this is very much about the bond between Hachi and Parker, and the undying hope of a dog for him to return. Heartbreaking. 10 stars",

278,18 March 2013,romanamuskinja,10, Simply beautiful..,"I just finish watching Hachi with friends, when the movie finished we just couldn't breath from crying. It's based on a true story from Japan, story about loyal dog named Hachiko. Hachiko is more than statue or a tale, he was a real dog whose story is known throughout Japan and entire world. The word Hachiko has come to be synonymous with loyalty, and for good reason. Such loyalty, devotion, love, just stuns me. The real story set's foot in 1923, when real Hachi was born.

It's a film driven entirely by the relationship between the two. For the first two acts its led by Gere and then for obvious reasons the dog takes over. No one will remember it as such but for the most part it's a light hearted amusing movie. Almost every scene has the same intention-to show Hachi's devotion and bond to his master. This does leave it a bit repetitive and going in circles but Lasse Hallstrom handles it with enough charm and style to allow the film to progress. This same fault starts to apear again once Hachi begins his wait, but at least this time the film has the other task of building the emotion of it.

The ending of the move is foreshadowed in the first 10 minutes so you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to kind of figure out approximately where we are headed. There are a lot of formulaic scenes strung together to show the relationship growing closer between Richard Gere's character and Hachi. I don't know why Richard Gere has lost his appeal but he's not a believable lead here. Joan Allen is fine as always.

316,13 May 2023,AJ_McAninch,5, Rescue Them Instead.,"The story of Hachi is one that books and the earlier Japanese version have told through the years. In this version the dogs are the best characters and actors; and the rest is infuriating. Far more emphasis and time are placed on Richard Gere's character. And though it is clear the actor had a good relationship with all the dogs playing Hachi, he is over-emphasized. And the performances by the actresses playing wife and daughter are bland and boring-to say nothing of the way their characters treat Hachi who is relegated to waiting and living outside even in the snow and cold. Eventually, he is abandoned to his waiting spot year in and year out with only the station workers giving a rip about the dog. In the real story, Hachi had a home after his master died. At any rate, this movie missed the true story by a long mile. It's about HACHI and his love for his master. Joan Allen's character is terrible to him from day one and years later acts surprised to see Hachi still waiting. Because she didn't even try to help him. The daughter feigns caring about him, but lets him go. The writer blew the whole story with poor characters and huge plot holes plus irrelevant threads having nothing to do with Hachi. And the true story is actually disturbing because someone should have kept that dog home and loved him enough. Don't make movies and put up statues about heroic waiting dogs: rescue them instead and change their lives.",
317,8 November 2020,lyubitelfilmov,10, An immortal example of loyalty or One of the most tear-squeezing films in the history of cinema,"Drama. American ""rethinking"" of the Japanese painting ""The Story of Hachiko"" of 1987, which in turn is based on real events. And again, the Russian distributors decided to turn on unnecessary fantasy, and called the picture ""Hachiko: The Most Loyal Friend"", although the original name is translated as ""Hati: The Story of a Dog"", but oh well. The first time I saw this picture in the thirteenth year, when I was at university, gnawed at the granite of science, so to speak, and came to work (I studied in absentia), but there was no one there, it was on Sunday, there was nothing to do, and I decided to see this film - and cried out a bucket of tears, and I could not forget it. Even then, I gave this picture the highest mark. Oh yes, I did not see the original Japanese painting, so I will judge it as an independent work. After the first viewing, I avoided reviewing this picture for a long time, because I knew that it would not do without emotions, and only recently decided to review it - and again my handkerchief was wet, and again a bucket of tears. And here's my brief opinion - one of the most tear-squeezing films in the history of cinema. This time I tried to look at the picture carefully, trying not to miss a single detail, but to my regret, I did not find any flaws in this picture, but the dignity still creeps out, and I turn to them immediately.
So, here they are:
1.Dramatic and touching story - the picture tells the story of Hachiko (whom everyone calls Hachi in the picture), an Akita Inu dog who got lost at the train station until he was picked up by an American professor, which became the reason for an incredible and strong friendship between them. Every day, Hachiko accompanied his master to the station and met him. This was until the owner died, but Hachiko continued to go to the station for many years and meet his master. The most famous example of selfless loyalty, they even erected a monument to him in Japan, and lovers make dates near him. The script is measured, simple and straightforward. Although I am a cat lover, dogs have one thing that makes them very different from my purring favorites - loyalty. The ending of the picture turned out to be very powerful, on the one hand, the most terrible and most breaking heart was not shown to us, on the other hand, they honored the memory of the real Hachiko, who deserved his place in the pantheon of heroes. He has a lot to learn.
2. Emotions - well, where can we go without it. Not a single viewing of this picture is complete without ammonia and several dozen scarves, because you will roar in any case, even if you think the opposite. I myself thought I would hold back, but I was wrong. Live and learn, as they say. There is a lot of drama here, and there are even more touching moments.
3. Humor - even in such a serious and dramatic story, the writers added a little humor that fits perfectly here. Here he is unobtrusive, filled with everyday affairs and causes both a slight smile and a short laugh, which dilutes the colossal drama on which the script is based.
4. The tone of the picture is measured, unhurried, with a touch of light melancholy against which the story unfolds. The tone does not drive you into melancholy, because sometimes it can seem stringy.
5. Music - composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek did a good job, giving the lion's share of piano or piano music, which I love very much, because without such music, Hachiko's story would have looked less dramatic. Indeed, in the most touching and heartbreaking moments, it is music that contributes to active tears. I do not recommend listening to these musical compositions separately, because otherwise the very moments will pop up before your eyes that will make you literally cry, even if you are an adult man who has gone through the war.
A little about the main characters:
1.Parker Wilson performed by Richard Gere is a professor who has become an unwitting master of Hachiko, a kind and strong-willed person, as well as a loving husband and caring father. In short - an example to follow, the role of which was played by the famous Richard Gere. With the selection of the actor, they obviously did not lose, because Richard just perfectly got into the character. Bravo!
2. Kate Wilson performed by Joanne Allen - the wife of the professor, who was downloaded against Hachiko, but gradually, seeing her husband's affection for the dog, gives way. She manifests herself as a loving wife and caring mother who was able to love Hachiko, with his selfless devotion to her husband. Joanne quite successfully coped with the role, here without pretensions.
3. Chiko, Laila and Forrest performed by Hachiko - you are not crazy, three dogs played the famous Hachiko, and I can't even imagine how much effort it took to train them, because dogs of this breed are special, they are very attached to their owners, and my humble opinion - the dogs did it.
Of course, the habit of Americans to shoot ""rethinks"" of successful foreign films infuriates a little. They just do not like to watch foreign films, and the producers create ""rethinks"" with the obligatory transfer of the main action to America. To me this approach seems strange and even absurd, but we will regret the ""beacons of democracy"".
At the moment, I consider this masterpiece the most tear-squeezing in history, but I have not watched the original Japanese picture and have not even had time to check out White Bim Black Ear by the excellent Soviet director Stanislav Rostotsky, where the main role was played by the wonderful old school actor Vyacheslav Vasilyevich Tikhonov, therefore and put the mark ""one of the best"".
As a result, we have an excellent drama about Hachiko's selfless feat, with an excellent script, great music, a strong emotional component and great acting.",

I say it taught us how to waste a perfectly good life, it taught us not to move on, to dwell in memories and stay sad and depressed for the rest of your life! That was not love! It was death and withering! Also, I don't know if it was just a bad script or the influence of Hachi, but every time someone got close to him, they got really really frantic, started to call his name again and again and again, saying random phrases like, lets go, good dog, come on! etc...

That's a love that only a pure and kind animal like a dog can share. It's almost impossible to be found in humans. That's why when you are surrounded by dogs even homeless ones you can never feel lonely or abandoned. Because these cute creatures will treat you like you are their beloved king.Some people unfortunately take advantage of this.

After watching the movie, the opening scene is a sad indictment of the disloyalty of humans, it would laughable if it were not so sad. The young boy seems so proud to tell the story, when in my opinion he and family should be ashamed. Hachi is rewarded for his loyalty to his master by being abandoned. I understand that Hachi was stubbornly loyal, this does not mean he deserved to die alone, after spending the last 8-9 years alone each night under a train.

I can imagine in the true story there was more training involved in this dogs habbit and it becomes less of a romantic story I guess. It for me became even more sad that people would appreciate a story of loyalty rather than the truth that this animal wholely relied on it's owner and could have been taken in by another loving family, instead letting it wait in futility for the sake of novelty. It seamed in the end to me a story of cruelty rather than one of a dogs love for it's owner.",

In my life there had been three films that brought me to tears during my viewings of them: Bambi, Old Yeller, and E.T. Now there are four. This film is not perfect but the minor flaws do nothing to interfere with the beauty of the love and devotion shown between Hachi and his master.

First of all did you people notice how actors in most today's movies act like wooden puppets just going around and talking random words which they do not feel AT ALL, I noticed it, and I noticed how unnatural Hollywood characters are, shallow and impossible to like... I will stick to UnAmerican movies from now on( it seems that Hollywood makes everything through very old recipes, they will make something well known to audience, they will not experiment, they just want money, they don't make films anymore)... Most people here said that this story in unbelievable , but it is very common, it is just that Japanese people appreciate every hero, even the dog... In my country there are many stories of dogs who spend their lives near the master's grave, or died the same day, and for that thing for following their masters to work and back....WELL EVEN MY CAT DOES THAT... if you are connected to your pet you could expect that... But what was really annoying was that plot hole which I noticed when Richard Gere practiced katana, and I noticed it was fishy , and then at the ending, when they said that man who owned the dog was Japanese, and everything happened in JAPAN, I got depressed, very depressed. Here there was again CHEAP Hollywood, they had to move the dog to America and Americanize everything, but that story would be impossible in America, you know why, because the law says so, no dog should be on the streets, without muzzle and so on, you people are full of laws which are taking your money away( well in my country they do the same)...anyway if we would hope your state was not full of those laws back then In 1924 ( professor used internet in the film), lets say story is possible to happen in America at that time... I get this is JUST BASED on a true story, not that it is true story, but why did they butcher so much the true story? People who made this film know nothing about dogs, and they just put one stupid scene after another to make film last longer, it was agony,farce, they made JOKE out of everything! The only one who knew how to act in a whole movie was a dog so give him Oscar, and apologize to him because you put him in one manipulative LIE/JOKE of a movie... Read about true story and see what really happened...One more thing, it is impossible to make movie out of this story, because it is too simple, and it is too beautiful, it should be passed on , but through different media... and at the end I will give this movie 4 out of 10, because I give dog 10, and to the rest I give -2...",

Little did I know just how nothing would have prepared me for what was in store for me when I begun watching the film. After all my years of watching movies I could clearly say that I had been a veteran of watching other Dog-Master type of movie/TV series that were guaranteed heart warmers like Old yeller, Littlest Hobo, Homeward Bound , Lassie (the movie) and Marley and Me which in it's own right a comedy turned tearjerker at the end that leaves one with a more endearing want and need to hug your pet Immediately. Hachiko was way beyond all that had come before. IT had me bawling my heart out like this was no movie but an actual reality unfolding before my very eyes and that I had to see for my eyes the heart wrenching scene of seeing A dog's noble dedication of waiting for his master every single day fueled by PURE love.

I loved the scenes when Hachi was a puppy and Parker began bonding with him - especially watching the baseball game together the night he didn't want to leave him alone. I also appreciated the scenes that were shot through Hachi's eyes - watching Parker share his love with his wife and daughter, spotting Parker out of a busy crowd...so sweet. The scenes towards the end, when Hachi is old and still comes to the station every day had me bawling like a baby. Especially when Parker's wife returns and sits with him for a while. The dog that they chose to portray ""old Hachi"" with had the slow gait and sad eyes really stole my heart away. And when Hachi reunites with Parker in his dying dream - - that just got me thinking about every pet I have lost and hope to meet again someday too!!

There were only a few films that managed to cause tears in my eyes but for a few minutes I simply could not stop the tears.
From the beginning of the film until before the scane Hachi takes the ball and runs to the train station to bring it to the professor, it's pretty mediocre film, although whoever sees him a second time can cry even in this part.
From this scane, this movie is awesome ,brought tears to my eyes, I really couldn't stop the tears. The moment that broke me most of all is to see old Hachi walk very slowly and reach his permanent position under the abandoned train where he died.
This movie is the only movie that made me cry, even the toughest they have a dog will cry, an amazing film that made me experience an amazing of emotionality and real crying.

This movie uses that real life story which makes the film entertaining enough and you'll probably get emotional at some point. But just as a movie this movie has TONS of problems. Richard Gere is good and so is the dog and as I said the true story is great but almost everything that is needed to make a great movie fall short in this movie and that's why it's hard to rate because when I judge this as a movie I can't help but give it a low rating. The cinematography is horrible. It looks like a hallmark film and the score is overbearing and saccharine. The whole tone is quite saccharine and this story in the hands of better writers and a better director didn't need to be so saccharine. I've never seen the original film but I'm interested in checking it out because it's Japanese and the original story took place in Japan and I see now reason why this version didn't. Honestly there probably is no point in this movie even existing if the original is as good as I hear but they were going to make it anyway but I see no reason why this version didn't also take place in Japan and had all Japanese actors. If you want the characters to speak English for North American audiences fine whatever, the people in Schindlers list spoke English not German that does t matter, but when you are telling a true story be as faithful as possible. The guy who played Richard Gere's friend should have played Richard Gere instead of being a forced Japanese connection. Shoot it in the real station where the true event took place. Lots of missed opportunity's and weird desicons. Also the movie drags a lot and repeats scenes over and over and has scenes that serve no purpose. This story is more designed for a 45 min short film rather than a feature. Anyway that's my take. One of these days I'll check out the original",

The movie is well-scripted and well-acted at the same time that let you connect with the characters more personally. It clearly depicts emotions of an animal towards human especially when it comes to loyalty. The incidents in the movie are well connected and reveal how an animal could be so loyal to his or her master. No doubt, the main character of the movie is Hachi, the dog, but others have performed their part elegantly.

It will even exite you - yes, despite what you might think, there actually are moments of genuine suspense in this movie! It's by no means a thriller, but it still manages to get your heart pumping! I almost jumped out of my seat during the scene in the garage! People need to see this movie, movies like this just don't come around often. In some ways, it even changed my own life for the better. When thinking about Hachi, I always strive to be better than I am, to never give up, and to always believe that anything is possible. This might be the most important movie you will ever watch! It really has everything, an exiting, thrilling and heartbreaking story, lovealbe and relatable characters that are incredibly portrayed by Richard Gere and Joan Allen. This is without a doubt Richard Gere at his absolute best. The fact that he never won the Oscar for this is an outrage. It should be studied (and probably is) in acting schools everywhere because what they have managed to achieve here is nothing short of magical! Every scene, every cut is brilliantly concieved, there are nothing in this movie that is filler or unnecessary.

It will entertain you while at the same time cause you stop and think about what's really important in life. I will cause you to question your very own existence, to think about what is possible, what a dog is capable of and what really makes us all human. WOW! This film is history. It stands alone.

Being the second time I have watched it, I started to cry as soon as I seen Hatchi at the beginning. Everyone needs to see this film. Any film is a 10/10 if it can have this affect on you.

For 9 YEARS hachi waits at railway station for his master to come back.. This is where emotions just cannot be held back by anybody.. While you are still crying your hearts out, when Joe Allen enters the frame, and when she says ""oh hachi,, u poor thing... u r still waiting ??"" gives you final push,takes you over the peak and then u just cannot CANNOT hold back...

I've watched plenty of sad movies about dogs, and I always cry, but this one impacted me the most. And I believe the only reason for it, is that this story is not made-up and not made from an existing book (that was also made-up). It actually happened in real life, long time ago. THAT is what kills me. I'm not exaggerating when I say I was depressed for literally 2 months after watching it. No movie has ever done that to me, and no movie ever will. You know that feeling when you experience something specific, and you just KNOW that nothing like that will ever happen again? Well, that's how I feel about this movie. This one is THE ONE. The one that no other movie can ever replace in shed tears and emotions I went through watching it.

Over the years I have seen it several times and each and every time it's like the first. I can be somewhat sensitive and emotional with some movies but, thisHow I cried. It was such an overwhelming feeling that my heart ached for Hachi and his family. I cannot think of a single movie that moved me in such a way that it almost felt real.

Touching family movies like this were released every weekend. Stories about people and animals that made you optimistic that someday people would stop being cruel and indifferent and stupid.
This movie is based on a true story that happened in Japan in the early 20th century. The beautiful thing about that tidbit is it is proof that the human soul can be touched by gentility and decency no matter what land or people you are talking about.
My wife and I cried while watching the movie. The other times I cried in my life while watching a movie was Brian's Song (1971) The Elephant Man (1980) and Born Free (1966).
This movie will introduce you to the dignity of all complex creatures on this planet and anywhere else we may find them. We are the only species in the Universe that we know of that rejects our biological programming. Meaning, humans are cruel and possess few redeeming qualities. But in some weird twist of science and fate, we recognize we are the most defective species on Earth and strive not to be what/who we really are. Animals (Dogs, etc) are logical by comparison. They derive no pleasure from sadism or self-destruction the way people do. Are they better than us? Yes. Do we have more to learn from them, than they do from us? Yes.
All you have to do is be open to the learning, and the realization that wisdom comes from being the hero of your own life. And that requires elevating more than just yourself during your lifetime.",

I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the ""toy"" breeds, although they can be cute). It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).",

This went on even after the old man died, catching the attention of the train commuters, who would hail Hachiko as an embodiment of loyalty. While dogs are indeed notable for their intelligence and loyalty to their masters, Hachiko was unlike any other dogs: the bond he developed with his master was so special that he knew his master's about to arrive home by the time his train honks its loud horn from afar. These events are incorporated in Lasse Hallstrom's ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"", which is just as equally touching that I couldn't help but weep to this unforgettable story about love, friendship, and loyalty.",

500,23 May 2011,fostecc,10, Love and Loyalty,This was a beautiful story of love and loyalty between a man and an abandoned dog. The professors friend made the statement why should he pick up the ball; he did to keep his friend home because he knew what was going to happen yet he waited for more than 10 years for him to return. Every time I think of this movie I become teary......it is so sad and so beautiful....ladies a 2 Kleenex box movie. I plan to read the book; it would be a wonderful story for children to understand the meaning of love between their pet and his unwavering loyalty to someone who has been so kind and affectionate to a dog who had no one....well he found someone who was wonderful and he dedicated his life to the professor.,
501,25 May 2023,milly_ele,10, Non typical true love,"I LOVED this movie! It tells a great story without depravity or vulgarity. It is a story of a dog's and his owner's true love for each other. It depicts what true loyalty looks like. I wasn't expecting the tragedy that occurred (as I hadn't read any reviews beforehand). Nothing could have prepared me for that or for the beautiful story that developed afterward. Even dog non lovers will have their heart strings tugged. The cast, including Hachi, was fabulous. There's nothing that could have made this movie better. Even thought the ending was expected, it was done so beautifully that it still made me bawl. Terrific and innocent movie!",

503,1 January 2023,rtqdjxp,1, A Story of neglect,"Never mind the quality of the filming or acting what this film really portrays is the story of is a dog's neglect, no one saw fit to take him in and care for him, where did he live? How did he get any veterinary care, or a decent diet, shame on the family is what I say. Irresponsible of Hollywood embellishing a story to personify a dog whom in reality was left out on the street to fend for himself. Going to the train station each day because let's face it that was where his source of food was! None of his family committed to caring for him, none of his family was interested in engaging him in a productive life whereby bonds of trust could have been established within the remaining family. Totally irresponsible of Hollywood to project this dog as the next cute dog everyone needs to have - no regards for it requiring experienced dog handlers with the skill to socialise and train what otherwise could easily become an aggressive dog towards strangers and other dogs without consistent, positive and knowledgeable dog training skill. Warning next sentence some viewers may find disturbing. Dogs are not humans inside a furry body, they do not speak our language and the reason the dog wouldn't retrieve the ball was because his owner didn't know the first thing about dog training, not because the dog wasn't capable of being trained to retrieve.",

The spirited Bagong was old and dirty. I didn't like his mistress to hold it in tears. In the snowy night, Bagong was waiting again because of the fire car, It seems that the man came out of the train station and opened his arms to embrace him as before. In fact, the dog knows everything. The technique is exquisite and original, but it slowly seeps into people's feelings, moving, sad, tears, and even hurt. The most powerful weapon in the world is never hurt, but warmth. Your heart is empty. And we enjoy it. We are lonely individuals after all, and need love and warmth.",

I had heard of this film, knew the story, and was hoping for a film about a dog and their owner that wasn't trite, sappy, overly sentimental. This film exceeded beyond all expectations. Richard Gere's performance is spot on. The relationship is deep and honest. It is 180 degrees in the opposite direction of all other animal/dog pics. The POV of the human world by the dog in black & white (dogs are color-blind, BTW) only heightens the finale. If you are not crying by the end of this film, check your pulse. You are dead. RIP.

Loyalty doesn't come along with everyone and most people lack such a good trait but a dog has shown me so much more than a lot of people. Such an amazing movie, such an amazing dog, such an amazing story, and such an amazing message. I recommend this to so many people because no movie has ever touched me quite like this one. Hachi has truly inspired me and lifted me like no other. I just got a dog a week ago. His name is Max and he's a beagle/cocker spaniel mix. Since I've gotten him, he's been such a joy in my life.",

I was wrong! Until now I keep on thinking what made this film stood out. I did not cry, I almost wept! This movie is not the kind of film that will move you because of too many dramatic scenes (e.g characters crying a lot), it shows the reality of what normally all of us do everyday and how we relate to our pets. I appreciate how the story was presented, it's hard to tell a story about patience without it being boring at the same time making you feel how hard to wait. More importantly I wanted to praise the sounds that was used, the music itself conveys the story of undying love and devotion. All in all I just love the simplicity of the film that will not give you a doubt that this had happened before.

The answer is obviously: ""No, never ever again!"". The movie manages to make you sad, but even more bored. The rating of the movie just makes no sense. I guess IMDb would never put it on top 250 no matter how high rating it gets. The story and plot is given almost before the movie starts. The actors are good, but they make no good acting in this movie, where they are just as anemic as the plot. Life is just too short to waste on this movie.

I would be checking on him daily, feeding him, taking him to the vet, bathing him, providing a shelter, making sure he is well. His awful wife character played by a Joan Allen (lay off the injections because you are unrecognizable) let the dog live at the train station with zero regard to the dog's well being.

Why the dog doesn't die in the first ten minutes to solve all the problems I don't know. If I was blind and deaf I still wouldn't give it 10 stars. Frankly, Richard should be ashamed of himself.He has let his country down. My sum of all fears is this movie becoming a success, unfortunately it appears that it may be, so my final question is, who do we blame, the director, Richard or the dog. This is the peoples decision. I can't make this. But you can, please everyone think what you have watched. is poison to the mind and an insult to humanity.

568,21 December 2022,kabirzamani,6, Good Remake of the original(japanese),"Dogs were early companions of human beings, and they've been known for their loyalty ever since. They inhabit their bodies with complete delight: witness them romping in the backyard, wagging their tails, tracking down a scent, or gazing up at you with pure adoration. They exude energy and a playful spirit as they explore every nook and cranny of their environment. They are our spiritual teachers - little Zen masters calling us to live in the present moment and attend to whatever rises right in front of us.",

I have never cried for any movie but this film just brought tears to my eyes. Extremely emotional and such a beautiful movie. If you're a dog lover, beware..you will definitely be in tears. The best movie I've seen. A very few movies that we would love to watch, but we go in denial mode and refuse to watch it although it's a good movie. Because you know the outcome(TEARS).",
571,24 December 2010,alok253,10," BEST movie i ever saw.I cried and felt i couldn't breath, can't watch again because its so sensitive and loving. it tears my heart.","Hachi's dedication and soulful, selfless, immortal love for his master and Hachi in waiting for next 9 years till his own death for his already dead master is awesome and moves even the toughest heart, i am sure. This is one movie in my lifetime that i cannot watch again because it was most difficult for me to watch Hachi's loneliness and yet his never ending love and wait for his master. I actually cried and felt difficult in breathing and I was happy crying because it made me more humane, sensitive and understanding. It told me much about life that its not about being with people for materialistic reasons but its about being and waiting for our loved ones for no reason even if they are not coming back because if we love and care for someone it should be true to our own hearts. I am sure I am going to be more like Hachi and wait for my own people even if they abandon me or leave me or they are not in this world.",
572,19 May 2019,toddjacobucci2002,9, Loved it!,"I came across ""Hachi: a Dog's Tale"" via random clips on You Tube. I was captivated right away. Two days ago I watched the entire film. It's incredibly touching. Never in my life has a movie made me cry so hard. A beautiful story. When you combine the story itself with the soundtrack it is virtually impossible not to lose it. I recommend it to all but bring tissues - serious waterworks on this one!",
573,11 February 2015,dokterknow,3, I didn't like it.,"I didn't like it. I don't think Mr. Gere knows anything about dogs and it showed in the way he acted with the dog. I've watched 1500 movies in the last 10 years -- I'm not an expert but I know good from bad. A good movie is one I would watch again -- this isn't one of them. Why do they require ten lines? I said what I wanted on 4 lines. You would think they would be happy with brevity. Instead they want me to go on and on when I have nothing else to say. I've never commented here before and I wouldn't have now if I hadn't received this mention of the movie as part of my news feed . The answer is obvious, I'll block IMDb. I didn't like it.

You will be cringing at the fact that you paid anything to watch this TERRIBLY BORING flick. Don't waste your time or money. In fact, I'm actually returning my copy of the movie and demanding a refund. Richard Gere was overpaid for this job, even if he made minimum wage. He should have been ashamed to receive anything. Yes, it is that terrible. I watched the movie to the end just to see if it was terrible all the way through. Guess what? It was!!! You'd be better off watching Mars Needs Moms. Hachi needed acting--it had none. And due to the fact that my review needs ten lines to be posted, I have to bore you with another line. Here's one: Hachi was repetively boring.",

The true story does not translate well to American culture or modern times. What normal family would let their beloved pet live on the streets for 10 years, even through harsh winters? I don't care how compelled the dog was to wait at the train station, no responsible pet owner would do that.",

582,19 January 2022,masyagel,10," Hachi,my opinion.","Place in Japan in the 1920s. In his homeland, Hachiko is honoured as a hero - manga is drawn about him, books and video games are dedicated to him, and the monument to him was opened during his lifetime. In 1987, the Japanese film Hachiko was released; Halstrem's film is a remake.",
583,19 January 2022,ogaevtimur,10, Cute,"The drama that took the internet by storm was based on a true story that took place in Japan. This film tells and shows the real attachment of a dog to a person. It touches upon such moral principles as love, fidelity. The film will be relevant enough at all times and people of any age can watch it. The story is sad but very touching. I think viewing will not do without tears, so stock up on napkins. I think it will be useful for kids to watch. 10/10.",
584,22 October 2011,nakulbehl007,10, poignant!,"Only a few movies can make your eyes wet, but this movie do more than that. It is so emotional to see the loyalty of a dog towards his diseased master. It goes quite normal till Parker's death but the emotions start coming when you see the love of hachiko for his master. Bond of the dog with Parker is so strong that it make him to wait for his master from the day of his(parker's) death to his(hachiko's) death. You can't really control your emotions seeing the dog waiting everyday at same time and how the other people like carl,jasjeet feeling the pain. The most emotional scene for me was when Cate comes back after 10 years of her husband's death and see Hachi still waiting for her dead husband at the train station and seeing the dog's condition you just feel a sharp pain. You ask a question to yourself ""if the dog has so much love in his heart why the humans are becoming so cold?""",
585,14 November 2014,Ruson,10, Amazing.,"Amazing story of true devotion. As someone who have dogs for many years and knows all the qualities they have, and how dogs should be treated, even though this movie has many realistic things and it's based on true story, there's some things that made me mad and hopefully people who watch this movie will not repeat the same mistakes the family (In this case, Wilson) made:",

It's quite simple story but in the same time great and true story, I liked the performance for all the cast and music it was suitable also the dog was trained well. We got many messages through 90 minutes and really I can't imagine how come the dog for more than 9 years going in same place every day and in the cretin time to wait his friend something I think we can't find in the humanity . I found through that movie how far we are missing Wright now the meaning of love, loyalty and hope which are the greatest feelings in our life ever.

I can never control my tears.. this is the movie of lifetime..love you Hachi..Hats of to the director and so much love and respect for Richard Gere who made the movie extremely real and worth watching by his presence.

Even though I have a pet, the fact that it didn't arouse any emotion in me is another achievement. Before watching this movie, I couldn't have imagined that an hour and a half movie could be so boring. A cliché exhibition that has managed to repeat itself even in such a short time. Like other films by the director, it is officious and manipulative. I felt insincerity in every movie I watched without realizing that it was a movie by the same director. Complete waste of time. I couldn't be too cruel though 5/10.",

But let me tell you that my big brother is 26 at that time, and he was crying even harder than me. He even sobs a lot. And the only time I have ever see him cry was when our Grandpa passed and when we were watching this movie. The moment we got out of the theater, we saw a lot of people with red eyes holding tissue and some even still trying to suppress their sobs. No one talked, no one excitedly chat about how awesome the movie is to each other because I really think that everyone already know and feel how awesome it is without them having to say a word.",
598,25 November 2014,katherinepayne1992,10, A must-watch movie!,"This movie tells the story of a family and its dog, Hachiko. It is altogether incredibly touching, and most families with dogs will be able to relate with the story. It has a very sad ending, which most people have been either told or have figured it out themselves. Before watching this, one should be prepared for a devastating ending. Go and buy tissues before pressing PLAY. This movie can be watched with the whole family, as it does not contain explicit sexual material, but parents should consider whether they want their children to be hit by this movie, as it may affect and impact kids in a way that not all parents would like. All in all, Hachiko is a moving, very beautiful story about family bonding with their pet.",
