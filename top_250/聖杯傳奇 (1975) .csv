0,28 March 2006,MaxBorg89,10, WHAT is the capital of Assyria? I don't know that!,"I do know, however, that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever made. Let's face it, if the Python hadn't showed up in 1969, someone would have created them by now, or the world would be a much sadder place. Alongside Life of Brian, which is the sextet's masterpiece, Holy Grail is an excellent start if you want to get addicted to their surreal humor.",/

4,3 October 2004,uckpshh,10, The reason Robin Williams isn't in a nut house.,"This is perhaps one of the greatest, funniest parodies in the history of film. I think the greatest definition of irony is that to be believably stupid on screen, you have to be very intelligent. This is a rare occasion where something can be so stupid that it's funny, with the addition of feeling you got your money's worth at the end. Examples of failures would be anchorman, austin powers, scary movie etc. The gore and clichés of three headed, and goofy ""NI!"" yelling knights are what give this movie discreet beauty.",i

9,24 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9, Another hilarious comedy from the Pythons!,"After the brilliant Life of Brian, I was looking forward to watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail. And I loved it, I don't think it is quite as good as Life of Brian, but it is definitely one of the better Monty Python comedies for sheer hilarity and fun. The story like Life of Brian isn't the strongest component but this is in no way a criticism and yes the special effects are cheesy but perhaps that was the intention. My only problem with the film was that the ending is a little flat, but that is a minor criticism compared to how much I loved this film. The script is irreverent and highly quotable, and the soundtrack is even funnier. As a comedy it is wonderfully inventive, that debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry through King Arthur, The Black Knight, God and the ""knights who say ni"". Comedy highlights include the trial with Connie Booth's witch and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sequence. Even the sets are quite well designed and authentic. And the acting is simply wonderful, John Cleese, Terry Jones(the encounter with Dennis's mother was hilarious), Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle perfectly live up to their exceptional talents. Overall, a great comedy and a great film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",w

12,24 November 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Classic British Humor!,"As we all know, the Brits have fantastic humor. They have brought us some of the finest comedies: Bridget Jones, Shaun of the Dead, Love Actually, etc. ""Monty Python"" is a classic comedy that should not be missed by anyone. I mean, seriously, these scenes and jokes are off the wall hilarious! ""Kanighets!"" and ""'Tis but a scratch"" were my favorite lines and scenes from the film. This is such classic and slapstick humor that I miss in movies these days. This film is rightly on the top 250 and is one of those films you should see before you die. Trust me, this is guaranteed laughter on the floor! If you don't laugh, you must be dead or something because I couldn't breathe while I was laughing so hard.",0
13,3 September 2010,wwe7961,10, An example of why British humor is much smarter than ours.,"This is how to make a comedy. Laughs can be found throughout, and the 4th wall falls apart throughout the film without any actors chewing the scenery. The movie from the first scene, and on is great. The acting is wonderful. Everybody in the cast delivers the jokes hilariously. Also the the actors never seem to overact at all. There are a few jokes that go on for to long, but it is aware of this. If only another comedy that doesn't deserve to have its name mentioned (cough Disaster Movie cough) was self-aware that the jokes it had were to long. It really is a shame that British people can say that they have awesome comedies like this, and we have a lot of awful comedies like (sigh) Disaster Movie. This film is a work of genius.",6
14,22 May 2006,tlcglitznglam,3, an acquired taste...,"All my life I've heard how funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail was but I had never seen it. Being in college, a group of my friends all wanted to watch it so I decided to join, excited to finally see this movie for which I've heard so much praise. I could see how people find the movie funny but I could not get into it. I kept wanting to leave but was determined to see it through to its end... and actually, I'm glad I did because the ending ""credits"" where it's several minutes of music playing to a black screen was the only thing that made me laugh from the movie. I respect the movie because it so widely loved so I'm not trying to bash it, yet I definitely think, as with any sort of humor, it is not for everyone. There are countless types of humor: dry, sarcastic, physical, nonsense, political etc. and everyone has their own taste as to which they prefer. With a movie like Monty Python, which has a very certain type of humor attached to it, there are bound to be those who dislike it. I only leave this comment to let those of you who have not yet seen the movie hear a ""different"" sort of opinion, as nearly all of the comments here highly praise the movie.",1
15,6 January 2005,Quinoa1984,10, It grows on you- it's one of the most delightful exercises in the ridiculous in cinema history,"For years I did not watch or listen to Monty Python, and in retrospect I can't entirely remember why. I remember seeing a couple of scenes from ""The Holy Grail"" on television when I was younger (the notorious 'black knight' scene and the harem of girls in the castle) and not finding it uproarious as I might have expected. Maybe I'm just not into British comedy, I thought ignorantly. Then I finally gave into it, as I got to be a big fan of Terry Gilliam's films, and discovered as well that John Cleese is one of the funniest people to ever come out of Britain. Life of Brian was surprisingly witty and fun as it dug its claws into a subject of some controversy. Then I went on to this film, and it took two times to watch the film until I found it to definitely be a truly masterful effort in the delirious.",1
16,14 December 2006,drystyx,10, Warning-you could laugh yourself to death,"You really could laugh yourself to death watching this movie. It is nothing but hilarious. Monty Python keeps pounding and pounding you with gag after gag, and lead you down a road, but suddenly its a bridge, no, its an ocean. One of the things that really makes this hilarious is the grand spectacle that dazzles you with attention to grand sound effects, and then the next scene may be purposely cheap sets, all to make you laugh yourself to death. There is crude humor, and what I think can fairly be described as dark humor-you might not think its funny to see an animal with big teeth rip several knights to death, or a knight have his arms and legs cut off, but Monty Python will make you laugh at it. I personally think they're akin to Marx Brothers comedy, or Mel Brooks-hilarious with likable people in outrageous situations.",4

But silliness can be brilliant you know. And there is some truly inspired stuff in this movie. It's a farcical parody in which the laughs come fast and furious. You've got a three-headed knight. You've got a knight who just won't quit, no matter how many ""flesh wounds"" you inflict upon him. You have knights who sing about that silly place known as Camelot. And of course you have knights who say ""Ni!"" You have snooty, condescending French persons and their flying livestock. You have rabbits, both Trojan and killer. You have a unique use for coconuts and the question of whether coconuts can migrate. All of this surrounding the main plot, the quest for the Holy Grail. Oh who are we kidding, there really is no plot. The movie just careens from one gag to the next.",t
26,28 November 2004,marac-1,10, Wonderful movie!,"This is such a great film that a professor of mine actually used it in a Medieval Civilization class as extra credit.

I almost cringed and simply made myself watch it till the end. This is Awful. I hated every single second of this third-rate-horror-of-a-tasteless movie ever. Ever. Nobody is funny in this movie - Innes, Gilliam, Idles, Cleese - they all are horrible. This is a very fine example of really poor script, terrible play, vain efforts of being funny, but just being utterly silly. Stupid. Senseless. Clueless. Less of all. Just less. I hated it with all my guts. Right were those who said this movie did not stand the test of time. Well, it never stood at all. It dragged and crawled most miserably. My advice is this - never waste 90 minutes of your time on this delirium, this stew of unfunny skits and blunt jokes. There was nothing sacred for this bang of unfunny comedians. It is clear here. it is bad and worse every minute. Simply bad",u

Pray that you must never cross the gorge of eternal peril. Except when venturing near Castle Anthrax, where the punishment of oral sex with 17-19 blondes and brunettes awaits the foolhardy.

I first saw this on Betamax in the late 70's and have loved it ever since. My favourite scene will always be Terry Jones and Connie Booth in the Witch Trial, although there are so many others. Re-watching this over 40 years later the humour hasn't changed, it's still as mad and wonderful as ever, unlike many other comedies which don't age as well. This is the work of geniuses!",
33,4 December 2022,freethinkingworld,7, After Thoughts,"Hilarious and a movie to last through the ages! This was one I came to late, I was in my 20s before I watched this film for the first time, but boy do I wish I had seen it earlier in life. The comedy in the film is perfect for me, and every line is delivered with the perfect amount of sarcasm and wit. To some this may seem too stupid or silly, but I think it's borderline brilliant. The film has way too many jokes and gags to choose a favorite but to me some of the best are the black night at the bridge, the French, and of course the ""huge tracks of land"" quotes 🤣🤣🤣 I don't want to really give much detail about what the this movie is about because it's just an experience you have to enjoy for yourself.",
34,8 November 2009,johnmschofield,10, A film which was an unusual but true life changing experience for me,When the Monty Python programmes started on British TV in the late 1960's I tuned into the humour from the first second and what made them that little bit more amusing was that my dad just didn't get any of it. We both laughed at other comedians or comedy films but the Monty Python experience was not one that appealed to him. I highly recommend anyone watch this film because you will find out whether you find it funny or not and from my point of view I hope you find it as highly amusing as I do. I cannot adequately describe the film itself its just the Monty Python experience in full flow and firing on all cylinders. I have watched the film numerous times and it still presses all my buttons where humour is concerned. This particular piece of cinematic brilliance had a life changing effect on me and although their will be many out there that will be doubtful or incredulous I myself have no doubts about how significant this film was for me. At the time the Monty Python team in my opinion were a groundbreaking new broom in comedy and set the standard which very few aspiring comedians have been able to match let alone emulate. Enjoy the 91 minutes of comedy genius.,
35,31 December 2003,FiendishDramaturgy,10, A Masterpiece.,"Monty Python takes a bit of getting used to, as their comedy company is somewhat of an acquired taste for most Americans who aren't accustomed to the dry British wit featured in these movies. However, they are absolute geniuses of comedy, as is demonstrated here in their first full-length feature film, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" There are excellent and memorable lines, hilarious dialog, and intentionally cheesy acting, combined to give you the laugh of the Dark Ages.",

Like most knights, they fall victim at times to temptation. They are also beset on by cows fired from catapults and a man-eating rabbit. they more I write, the more stupid it all sounds. Much of it is dull and murky and overdone (the knights that say ""ni"" gets old after a while), but within a couple of minutes, there is another wacky gem, insanely delivered.

Whether it's the coconut discussion, the English-French problems, the Castle Anthrax, the Knights Who Say ""Ni!"", the killer rabbit, or the grand finale, they know just what to do.

This film just was really not all that funny to me though seriously. Everybody says that this movie is hilarious and it's entertaining well to be honest it's nether. This movie to my opinion is on my top 10 of worst films. This film of course is number 4 on the list because it managed to make me laugh once and only once. People say this movie is good so I will recommend this film to little kids. But other than that I just can not see why this is so funny.

50,23 June 2018,Leofwine_draca,7, Monty Python at their most irreverent,"MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL shows off the talents of the Monty Python team at their most irreverent. This is a very broad comedic spoof exploring the medieval legend of King Arthur, taking care to deliver a unique mix of spoofery, cross dressing, slapstick, surreal humour, animation, character gags and basically everything thrown in except the kitchen sink. It's a high-energy enterprise that gets by without very much money at all and makes the very cheapness an asset. The team are all present and assembled well here, taking on numerous roles each. The story is episodic and sometimes little more than a series of linked sketches, but most of the jokes are very funny indeed, and there are some classic scenes: the Black Knight, Tim the Enchanter, the Knights who Say Ni, and plenty more besides. This is the kind of film that makes me proud to be British.",
51,10 February 2020,davidmvining,10, Hilarious and perfectly constructed,"Watching this for the first time in at least ten years, it became screamingly obvious to me which sections were directed by Terry Gilliam and which were directed by Terry Jones. Jones tends to set up his camera from afar, capturing all of the actors in a single shot and letting them perform. Gilliam pieces his parts together from many smaller parts, individually gathered with more interesting angles and compositions. They both have their charms, and they end up working really well as a whole because while the visual aesthetic may be different between the two directors, there's a common comedic approach that crosses that visual barrier and comes together as a whole and hilarious experience.",

Ultimately, however, King Arthur is on an even more important quest - finding the Holy Grail.

55,13 July 2021,nickenchuggets,9," ""Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time""","I love it when a movie goes to great lengths trying to establish certain rules only to purposefully break them later. Monty Python and the Holy Grail might seem (to an outsider's point of view) like a relatively stable and serious movie due to its focus on King Arthur, but anyone who thinks this clearly has never watched MP before. Praised by many as the best comedy movie ever, what Holy Grail does especially well is combine aspects of humor, violence, and a medieval setting. Of course, it wouldn't be Monty Python without the familiar actors playing the various characters, and the movie gets this right as well. Filmed mostly in Scotland, the story is set in the year 932 AD and has King Arthur (Graham Chapman) traversing Britain and looking for people willing to join his Knights of the Round Table. He and his fellow traveler Patsy face strange, humorous (and sometimes even dangerous) situations along the way, such as a witch trial where a woman is accused of being one after someone says she turned him into a newt. King Arthur also has a showdown with a knight wearing black armor who is tasked with guarding a path Arthur must take to continue on his quest. Even after severing all of his limbs, he thinks victory is his. Shortly after, Arthur gathers some other men who are willing to join him on his journey. In one of the most hilarious and quotable scenes ever put to a motion picture, Arthur and his allies come across a castle solely inhabited by french forces, and after asking them about the whereabouts of the Grail, the french say they've already got one. One of the french occupiers continues to harass and verbally assault Arthur and his men, after which they launch an artillery barrage of farm animals at them. Forced to fall back, Arthur and his men are forced to use a trojan horse (or in this case trojan rabbit) to gain access to the french castle, but none of them climb inside it. The french do end up letting the rabbit proceed inside, only to hurl it back at the english with a catapult. Later, one of Arthur's knights is led astray to a place called Castle Anthrax that is inhabited only by women, which means he is disappointed when the rest of his team is forced to ""rescue"" him. Once Arthur meets a strange new character named Tim the Enchanter, things become more creepy but still manage to be pretty funny. Tim says the Grail is hidden in a cave, but unfortunately, the mouth of the cave is guarded by a deceivingly harmless looking rabbit that effortlessly slaughters a large amount of knights when they go to attack it. After deploying a new weapon called the Holy Hand Grenade against the rabbit, it is killed and the team is free to go inside. A hieroglyph on a wall reveals that the Grail is in a place called Castle Aarrgh. In the last major obstacle of their journey, Arthur and his knights must approach the keeper of the Bridge of Death and answer 3 of his questions correctly if they wish to cross it. One knight answers the three deceptively easy questions, and is allowed to pass, but one fails an easy question and another fails an unexpectedly difficult one. Both are thrown into the gorge below by some mysterious force. Finally, it's Arthur's turn. The bridge keeper asks him what the velocity of an air-laden swallow is, and Arthur asks him if the swallow is African or European. The bridge keeper can't answer his own question, and is thrown into the abyss. Finally, Arthur and what remains of his team see the supposed resting place of the Grail on the horizon, and to their horror, they learn the same french soldiers from earlier are inside it. They get ready to attack the castle, but cops show up and arrest King Arthur for the murder of a present day historian earlier in the film. This is a ridiculous movie. It makes no sense, and most people watching will know it makes no sense. That doesn't mean it's bad, mind you. If anything, Monty Python in general thrives on absurd storytelling and outrageous characters. There's definitely a lot of plain stupid and laughable moments in this movie, such as when Sir Lancelot (John Cleese) tries to rescue a girl from a castle after receiving a letter. He arrives and starts mindlessly killing everybody there with his sword, only to discover the letter he received was from an effeminate prince. Another example are ""the knights who say ni"", a clan of incredibly tall knights who want King Arthur to retrieve a shrubbery for them (one that's not too expensive). I remember seeing a trailer for this movie that is done in the same ridiculous style as the film itself, and the ending shows an ad for chinese food or something, stating that the movie's premiere is just 10 minutes from the restaurant. Even the guys who made it didn't take it very seriously, but it still manages to be one of the best comedy movies ever produced.",

In this movie, they also don't seem to be extremely concerned with disgusting their audience but rather making them laugh.  The 'Meaning of Life' had many disgusting scenes and 'Life of Brian' wanted to slap religion in the face from beginning to end.

69,5 March 2006,EUyeshima,8, Python Silliness Still Holds Up in Special Two-Disc Set,"With the opening of Mike Nichols' and Eric Idle's ""Spamalot"" on Broadway last month, it's a good time to revisit the 1975 comedy classic that inspired the musical. Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly. If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say ""Ni!"", a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.",

One of the many reasons it works is the low budget and the fact that they don't try to hide the fact it is low budget.  Also, the very serious music this movie has makes it funny because they are acting like it is a serious movie and then again they are not.  Plot summary is simple.  King Arthur must find and retrieve the holy grail and while doing so runs into one hilarious encounter after another.

For the record, I've never seen LIFE OF BRIAN and I've only seen bits and pieces of MEANING OF LIFE (and it didn't grab me the same way HOLY GRAIL did). Honestly, the first time I saw this movie I didn't really care for it. Absurdist humor hadn't really been my thing at the time, but the movie grew on me. Next thing I knew, I was buying my own copy, watching it multiple times, and planning on seeking out the rest of the Monty Python films. What's the movie about? It's all right there in the title: the story of the Holy Grail as seen through the eyes of some of the funniest men to come out of Britain. King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is tasked by God to search the lands for the mystical Holy Grail. Aiding him in his quest are Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Bedevere, Sir Galahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and their quest will take them to the far reaches of the land where they will encounter beautiful maidens, dangerous evils, and, well, the French.

Then they said that llamas made the movie, which also made me laugh. Then in the beginning of the movie when a man and King Authur are talking about sparrows and coconuts, the man says ""Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?"", which cracked me up. Then in the scene with the dead people, one of the conversations was: Man 1: How do you know he's a king? Man 2: Because he hasn't got s*** all over him.

There is no question that the Python team were talented comedians; that this film was excellent in its time and that its influences are still being felt today. However when I watched it recently I barely laughed and could not help but feel that this film has been overhyped in the years since its release. I think The Life of Brian is still a great piece of comedy and can be enjoyed as much today as it could 20 years ago but not The Holy Grail. Having watched nearly every episode of sitcoms such as Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and Blackadder before the film I can see that these shows have built on the comedy of The Holy Grail and are finer works because of it. But having seen these before the film I found the humour old fashioned, outdated and *gasp* predictable, something which would not be true when it was released. People have claimed that young people today do not 'get' comedies such as this but I would say that humour has evolved and now slicker, more sophisticated comedies have left dinosaurs such as this little more than reference points in comedy history.",

The humor and dialogue are written very well by a cadre of writers who also act in the film including Graham Chapman, John Cleese, and Eric Idle to name a few. Even after nearly 50 YEARS since its theatrical release some of the humor holds, and the movie is simply a stupid look at one of the most important crusades of the crusades. All sorts of humor besides written are used in the movie including physical and prop comedy, really anything that it takes to make its audience laugh!! I think this is why audiences worldwide like this film so much, I liked it but only gave it a 6 out of 10 stars simply because I may be just a bit too young to completely enjoy the film but I did appreciate it. The writing is excellent, the comedic acting is good, the period costuming is fair, the action is good, the limited cartoons are also good, the flow to the film is superb and the only complaint I had about the film again is that the humor might be aging.

King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table abandon Camelot (which is a very silly place, don't you know) in favour of the Quest for the Holy Grail, as ordered by God, who parts the clouds especially to have a chat. Along the way, the Knights - including Lancelot the Brave, Galahad the Pure, and Robin, the not-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot - encounter a number of ingenious and, indeed, silly, obstacles.

Maybe I just don't get British humour (well really, it's not about ""not getting it"", it's more about just not finding it funny), but I don't find this movie entirely funny. Maybe others do, and kudos to them! But this doesn't entertain me. I'm not saying I didn't laugh though. There were humorous and hilarious parts, but I was hyped up and expecting a gut busting movie, so I was disappointed. The coconuts were humorous (funny the first time, then it became tedious), I laughed my ass off when John Cleese decapitated an entire wedding party, and when he in turn was decapitated (albeit in an earlier scene). I also thought the Killer rabbit was extremely hilarious, and the bridge was funny too. Also, the logic of the witch burning was amusing. But 10 minutes of funny from a 1 and a half hour movie isn't too good, especially since I heard this movie is a comedy classic. This is one of the reasons I have mixed feelings about Dogma as well. There are some friggin' hilarious parts, but some boring parts as well (I understand they are moving the plot along, and respect that). However, I just enjoy Dogma more. Back to The Holy Grail.

It tells the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in their quest for the Holy Grail. But to be honest, the story is merely a thread in which they link a series of funny set-pieces together. For me, this is the funniest movie they ever made. To be honest, there really are far too many amusing moments to list them but needless to say they combine cleverness with stupid humour and the tone is consistently absurd. But if I was forced to names the scene that cracks me up the most I would have to pick the one that introduces us to Brave Sir Robin – the singing of his sarcastic minstrel makes me roar with laughter every time. This character is actually a bit unusual though, in that he is not performed by any of the Pythons because the vast majority of the other roles are covered by the team of John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, with Graham Chapman mainly playing the central King Arthur role in a very funny straight-man performance. Terry Gilliam appears in minor roles but is most notable for providing several of his distinctive animations. In summary, this is a very funny movie.",

One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it).",

From ""Bring out your dead"" to the Frenchman at the end making fun of King Arthur. This movie is to Monty Python what Animal House is to national Lampoon. The only difference is that Monty Python is, in my opinion, much funnier and less sexual then National Lampoon. And, no offense intended, the British accents just make the film even funnier. So in conclusion, this movie is the funniest movie ever made, and its zaniness will always be remembered. It is timeless, and I would recommend everyone see it.",

Known for abruptly ending TV skits mid-stream with the segue ""And now for something completely different"" -- due both to their distaste for writing endings and their ADD giddiness to move onward -- the troupe finds uncharacteristic continuity here, examining one fertile topic from each of its absurd angles. Yet the movie is still comprised of distinct segments, any of which could serve as a favorite for fans who want to recite the choicest dialogue and make converts of the uninitiated. But for five minutes of sheer uncontrollable hysterics, one need only watch the scene in which Graham Chapman steadily lops the limbs from a foolishly determined knight, who continues issuing taunts even after he's been totally neutralized. Irritated more than threatened, Chapman's King Arthur keeps hacking at the prating cripple just to shut him up -- it's the only sane reaction in this ridiculous world full of delusional windbags. Chapman is a wonderful constant as the frustrated straight man, and his colleagues lob one demented set piece after another ""in his general direction."" The temptation is to enumerate these clever interludes, but a catapulted cow really needs to be seen to be appreciated. The only time Monty Python and the Holy Grail stumbles is at its sudden ending, a cop-out that's pure Python. Or maybe it's just that any end to such enlightened joke slinging is cause for lament.",

Of course saying that Holy Grail is silly certainly isn't insulting it in any way, it may be the funniest Python movie ever made, although the humor isn't for everyone. The pure randomness and all out impossibility of everything that happens is what makes it so funny, this is definatly present in their other films but generally not to the degree that is seen in Holy Grail. I have a hard time deciding whether Holy Grail or Life of Brian is the better movie, while Holy Grail tends to get more overall laughs, Life of Brian's jokes seem more intelligent and well thought out. I would say that Holy Grail is better for a first time viewing, but Life of Brian tends to be funnier over repeat viewings.

183,25 March 2023,Horst_In_Translation,6," It had it moments, but people elevating this film to sainthood are exaggerating","""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a British comedy movie from 1975, so the 50th anniversary is getting closer and this one is in the English language from beginning to end, even if you will also find parts in French and Latin (because of the historic background) here and some Swedish in the opening of the film for whatever reason. I honestly did not get that at all and also did not find it funny, but just my taste and things got better as the film went on. But before I get to the story and comedy, let's look at the basics first: This is a Monty Python production which means that you will find the familiar names and faces in here. Directors are the two Terrys: Gilliam and Jones. Gilliam is over 80 now and ones died a few years ago not too far away from 80. Jones is also acting in this film and same is true about all three writers we have here: Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle. Chapman plays the central character, but sadly died a long time ago already while Cleese is still with us nicely into his 80s now and still working and Idle is also still alive and will turn 80 later this month. So he is the youngest from the bunch nonetheless. With Monty Python and especially their most known works, it is fairly common that the actors play more than just one character and makeup and costumes help them with it. Just look at Cleese, who is for me always the one with the greatest recognition value from the gang. I will not simply list all the characters he portrays in here, but you can check that out for yourself. I think that this one we have here is maybe the second-most famous film for Monty Python following their comedic elaboration on Jesus Christ. If I remember correctly, that is also not a particularly long film and same is true for this one here as it barely makes its way past the 1.5-hour mark. Usually, I say that it does if we include the closing credits, but there are none here and all of the credits are included at the beginning for storytelling purposes as this film ends abruptly when one character's camera is destroyed in the end.",

Some of the jokes are so deep, you need to cross reference an encyclopedia to get them. Besides that, their parody acting is unmatched. Completely believable - which is, of course what makes it so funny. Thanks Monty Python!",

Fortunately, the he-freaking-larious is the one that turns up most frequently-- especially during the perfectly Monty-Python-like ending (get that camera out of here!). Sadly, British comedy will never be the same without the complete cast of Pythons.

226,31 July 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Not as good as Life of Brian, but worth watching","This Monty Python film is great, partly because it works on several levels; it works as a straight up typical Monty Python movie(which in itself ensures hilarity) and as a spoof of many of the old ""medieval times"" based films. The plot is pretty good, and less disjointed than that of other Monty Python creations, so if you're looking for a linear time line based film, then this might interest you. The plot does move along a little slowly, though, even for a Monty Python film(slower than Life of Brian, for example), and the film suffers a little under that. The jokes and sight gags make up for it, but it still does seem a little slow, especially on repeated viewings. The acting is good, as it typically is with Monty Python films. I can't really comment on the characters, but I guess they pretty much stay in character all through the film. The humor is good, but not as great as it is in Life of Brian, though that may be because I've seen it too many times. I don't know, I just wasn't really laughing at any point when I saw this. I knew that it was funny, and a few of the gags do stick in my mind as amusing, but when watching it I couldn't even muster up a slight chuckle. In fact, about an hour into the film, I was getting tired with the film, and hoped that it would end soon. I don't dislike the film, nor do I have anything against the humor, I just think I've grown tired with it. When it's not new and in-your-face anymore, it just loses impact, I guess. The film has plenty of entertaining sequences, and the gags and jokes are mostly quite good. It even has a few very memorable scenes, such as the the Black Knight scene, and the witch scene. The dialog is as sharp as the Python's dialog usually are, and there is more good dialog than there is in Life of Brian. All in all, a good Monty Python film, but just slightly inferior to Life of Brian. I recommend it to any fan of Monty Python, and fans of dark and silly humor in general. 8/10",

233,25 May 2021,TheHonestCritic,2," Is the nonsense showcased in this ""film"" genius? Or, is it a complete waste of cinema? Check out my review below!","""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (1975), oh my God. That's pretty much all I have to say to start out my review of this train wreck. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top ten worst comedy films I have ever seen and I'm not kidding. This ""movie"" is based off the British TV series, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"". I have seen some clips of that show, and it surprisingly does have a few decent moments here and there. However, as a whole, it doesn't do that much for me. Keep in mind, I haven't seen every episode. But, if what I've seen already is any indication, it's just your average run of the mill comedy show. Well, I guess someone must've saw dollar signs in front of their eyes and said: ""hey, let's make a film out of this show!"" Now, making a movie based off a TV show is a difficult, but not impossible feat. That being said, I don't know how they took a TV series with very little to no substance and made it into a 90 minute ""movie"". Actually, I'm still not convinced that they did. Because, this ""film"" sucks! ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has a messy and mangled story, the acting is all over the place, most of the special effects are dated, and even the soundtrack is boring! The premise of the storyline is based on the Arthurian Legend. However, the goal was to make it as historically inaccurate as possible. Yes, I do get that was supposed to be the recurring joke, but it wasn't funny. Not in the slightest! Granted, I have seen some episodes of TV shows where they make fun of old historical events. Some of them were funny, and some were not. A concept like this works better in small doses, otherwise it just winds up being completely lethargic. They were on the right track with keeping it shorter than two hours since it was supposed to be a comedy, but those 90 minutes just dragged on forever. Honestly, for the majority of the runtime, next to nothing of substance happens. Listen, I'm all for parodies and other media that make fun of events in history. But, you have to be an expert when it comes to writing a screenplay like that! Literally, within the first few minutes, I knew exactly what kind of ""movie"" I was in for, and it was all downhill from there. Aside from the boring and uninspired opening credits (which I believe were extended on purpose to pad out the runtime), the characters were just pretending to ride horses. I just slapped myself in the forehead with anger. If that had happened only once with the horse riding joke, then it would've been more on the right track. However, they showcase that unnecessary trite every chance they get and it stops being funny. Another big issue with the plot, or lack thereof, is the overabundance of predictable humor. Now, I do enjoy predictable humor done right. One of the best, if not the best examples of a film with predictable comedy, is ""Airplane!"" (1980). For that type of humor to work, the audience has to expect what's about to happen. But, the inevitable joke has to happen unexpectedly and that's what will trigger the laugh. In ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", you can see every joke from a mile away and know what's about to occur before it happens. When you know what's going to happen, then it's not funny. Another thing is the infamous ending of the ""film"". Out of nowhere, the ""movie"" just stops, for no rhyme or reason. It's almost like the film makers thought: ""all right, we've tortured you long enough, you can go now."" This is one of the most poorly conceived and written movies that I've ever seen. Next to nothing happens and then it ends. Nothing has occurred, there was no conflict and nothing was resolved. Film Making 101: when you write a script, or screenplay, you have to end the stories you're trying to tell. That's the basics of writing! A story has to have a beginning and an end. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has no opening and no ending. Did none of these writers learn basic storytelling? Now, I'm aware that there are other Monty Python films. But, this is the first, and probably the only one I will ever see. Maybe the other movies are better? I doubt that very greatly! As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the story. The sad thing is, most of these actors and actresses are great in other roles! What's their excuse here? How could they have agreed to make this ""film""? They must've been bribed, or they had no other choice. This ""movie"" has some of the most cringe-worthy and unfunniest performances I've seen in any comedy. As for the special effects, a lot of them were well-done. But, some of them have not aged well at all. Seriously, at certain points they use cartoon animation along with the live actors! The only movies where that idea works are: ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" (1988) and ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" (2003). So far, those are the only three films to get that concept 100% right. The soundtrack is nothing short of a generic and cliched mess. Granted, there were some tidbits where it sounded like the film score was trying, but overall, it just drags the ""movie"" down even further, if that's even possible! The only good element in this ""film"" are the sets/locations. They do create a somewhat decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, that's not nearly enough to save this ""movie"" at all. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is an insult to comedy films and TV shows. It's one of the top ten worst comedy movies I've ever seen and for good reasons. The fact that it gets so much praise just blows my mind! How is that possible?! Like I've said many times before, accolades and box office records mean nothing. If I think a movie is crap, then it's crap, plain and simple. I'm giving this ""film"" only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Now, I know what a lot of you are thinking. ""Oh, this film was made before your time and you may not get the humor and comedy involved."" First of all, I know exactly what's going on. Second, I don't ever judge movies based on when they were made. I watch and critique them for what they are, as standalone films. Now, granted, most older movies defecate on modern day films! But sometimes, there is a dud here and there. No matter what year, or decade, there will always be both good and bad. That being said, calling ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" a dud is an understatement. Bottom line, do I really have to tell you to stay away from this waste of film making? You'll just be wasting your time. Even the Lord himself would be ashamed of it!",

It has many great scenes in it, but my favorite has to be the sequence at swamp castle. It also has several great moments of absurdity in it, such as ""The Knights who say 'Ni'"". The members of Monty Python all do great jobs in the film, with Graham Chapman's performance as King Arthur, Michael Palin's performances as Sir Galahad, the head of the Knights Who Say Ni, and as the King of Swamp Castle, John Cleese's performance as Sir Lancelot, Eric Idle's performance as ""Sir Robin the Not-Quite-as-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot"", Terry Jones' performance as Sir Bedevere and Terry Gilliam's animation (as well as his performance as Prince Herbert).",

236,1 November 2017,Spideyfan-963-246215,10, Monty Python and The Holy Grail (1975),"This was weird experience but hilarious. Aw man what a great way to start fantasy month with this medieval dark comedy. I don't know much about the Python group but Terry Gilliam the director I've heard about from two other films of his I wish to see like Time Bandits and The Brothers Grimm. King Arthur, accompanied by his squire, recruits his Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot and Sir Galahad the Pure. They receive a message from God to go on a quest for the Holy Grail. Throughout their quest more silliness ensues. The beginning of the film when King Arthur is looking for knights to recruit is maybe my favorite part of the film. But as they are then given their quest I find myself laughing more and more. It's a relevant comedy with lines like ""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. If I went around saying I was an emperor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!"" The taunting French guard was also super hilarious. The directors are great I had only heard of one which I mentioned earlier was Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones, he did two of Python Movies Life of Brian and Meaning of Life. They have a great comedic style. This film is just completely off its rockers. Monty Python and The Holy Grail, is probably the best comedy I have ever seen. It's as relevant now as it was in 1975, hilarity will ensue, cows will fly and we will all run away from rabbits. I'm giving Monty Python and The Holy Grail a five out of five.",
237,30 December 2004,blaki974,10, A constant laugh :-),"This is a very funny movie, woven together by a large number of skits that finally gives a very strange ending. The Monty Pythons really make the most of the absurd and you are constantly thinking: ""Did I miss something?"", and that (apart from other things) makes you want to watch it over and over again. The Plot: King Arthur, king of the Britons is collecting knights to join his court at the Castle Camelot, when all of a sudden, his is given a task by God. He has to find the Holy Grail. This task involves a mysterious Wizard that some call Tim. There is also the Holy Handgranade of Antioc. Other key parts are played by a Shrubber, a furry white rabbit and a cartoonist who suffers a heart-attack. The eating of minstrels is also a source of enjoyment. The completely crazy sense of humor associated with the Monty Pythons is evident in the movie. If you like this movie, you will probably also enjoy ""Eric the Viking"" as well as ""Life of Brian"", both with Monty Python. Funniest moment: The Crossing of the Bridge of Death. Oh, and when the Black Knight wont give up. Oh, and when the furry little rabbit turns out to be quite nasty. And so on, and so on... You must see it!",

Well, the truth is, i didn't procrastinate watching long enough. I wish i had never watched it. After 25 minutes, I had to shut it off, which makes this the worst movie i have ever watched. The so-called jokes in this movie are completely unfunny. These ""jokes"" are on par with middle school toilet humor. Worse actually. This movie is a constant bombardment of stupidity. After watching 25 minutes of it, i felt like i had gone insane. I needed to know that i wasn't the only one who felt like this was utter trash, so i came here to see if anyone else felt the same. Thankfully i am not alone.",

I may sound like an old geezer right now (which is pretty strange since I'm not even twenty), but nowadays almost every comedy is a ripoff of another. Just look at all the Scary movies, American Pies et.c. It sure is a good thing that Monty Python and the Holy Grail exists, it's almost 30 years since it was made and it's still one of the funniest and most entertaining movies in the comedy genre.

The amount of times I have spent in the pub regurgitating the Black Knight scene or the Knights who say 'Ni' is uncountable Yes it is true to the original Malory and Victorian tales, only by implication, but then it is a comedy and like ever they have used it to provide farcical, slapstick and satire to an unbelievable high standard.

Really, it's a funny flick with some very funny moments, others way over the top that are only just bearable if you really try hard to be a good public, but on its own is quite self-indulgent. This is the inside humor of a bunch of guys who love to make sketches, and they make a movie. Hopefully, you're on their side and get the humor either from a cultural pov (you are British/Irish) or you fancy it because it's such an 'essential' comedy that sticks out. Again, lots of funny moments, completely bananas in places, a good comedy I'd recommend, but definitely overrated by the pseudo-intellectual clique.",

I wasn't a big fan of the end, but I kind of expected it given what kind of movie it was, so I'll let it slide. You also have to keep in mind when it was released, because a lot of the graphics are pretty rough. Another thing I'm okay with because it's understandable, just a little peeve to watch.

There's the problem and the Genius of Monty Python-some get it, some don't. It's unconventional, chaotic, hilarious, but there's no point explaining to those who don't get it, as if you don't when you first see it, you never will. So many funny scenes and one liners, my favourites being the white rabbit scene, and the bridge/3 questions scene. And the Black night. Everything about this film is funny, from the acting and dialogue to the cheap production and unexpected ending. 8 out of 10",

The acting is superb, the plot and writing are masterful, and the effects (as usual for the pythons) just connect with me on some level that makes them seem perfect. What i'm about to say may well be cliché'd, but I don't care. The low budget actually improves the film, it adds to the charm the rest of the film exudes so well. There are two reasons I can think of for anyone to not like this film.",

Everything the Pythons have done is brilliant. Gee then... What is this question I am basing my review on... Well maybe it's ""Where can I find a decent shrubbery in early 6th century England?"" Nah, that one's easy, you just go see Roger the Shrubber. Perhaps ""If witches are indeed made of wood (which would explain their buoyancy) then why can't we make a bridge out of them?"" Ah geez I just don't know what the real question is! Seriously this is one of the best comedies of all time! The Python's are masters of whacky slapstick, silly one-liners, and tongue in cheek play and this film showcases that as well as any of the better episodes of ""Flying Circus"" (although I feel Flying Circus is a more rewarding body of work in terms of originality and scope).

Far and away the funniest film I have so far been privileged to see. The problem with most comedies is that, no matter how amusing they may be on the first viewing, on subsequent showings they rapidly pall. Not so with the Holy Grail. I find that I get just as much fun out of anticipating each classic scene as I do out of watching it. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie. If you possess any sense of humour at all you owe it to yourself to see this film at least once before you die. Oh, and the ending is NOT crap. It's perfectly in keeping with what has gone before.

268,13 September 2005,jboothmillard,8, Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"First I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, then I saw this great comedy spoof of a medieval adventure with the search for a great religious artifact. Basically King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is assigned by God (Chapman's voice) to find the Holy Grail. They agree and begin their long journey by walking clapping halved-coconuts (sounding like horses hooves). As the journey goes on, the film also shows the individual stories of each knight, Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Launcelot (Eric Idle), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin) and Sir Bors (Terry Gilliam). Along the way they meet interesting characters, and some die, with a killer rabbit (that they kill with a royal grenade), a legendary black beast, and answering one of three questions to cross a bridge incorrectly. The highlights are the Black Knight (Cleese) losing all his limbs, reading the clue to the Castle of Arrrghhh, and the bridge keeper (Gilliam) asking the individual knights their three questions, before falling himself. Also starring Fawlty Towers' (and Cleese's wife at the time) Connie Booth as The Witch. John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Eric Idle was number 21, and Cleese number 2 on The Comedians' Comedian, the film was number 6 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Films.

It is the famous Monty Python troop attacking King Arthur and the knights of the round table. Graham Chapman plays King Arthur who is tasked to tracked down the Holy Grail. Terry Gilliam plays Arthur's trusty sidekick Patsy, who famously uses coconuts to give off the illusion of horse galloping. John Cleese plays brave Sir Lancelot whose sword is mightier than a thought. Michael Palin plays Sir Galahad the pure whose ventures take him to the castle Anthrax guarded by virgins. Eric Idle plays Sir Robin the not so brave whose minstrels sing songs of ""brave retreats."" Terry Jones plays the loyal Sir Bedevere whose hilarious plan of building a Trojan Rabbit backfires when the French taunters ""taunt them again.""Brilliant comic collaboration by all involved with such hysterical moments such as the black knight who""always triumphs."" Then there is the vicious killer rabbits that can only be countered by the holy hand grenade. And let us not forget the dreaded Knights Who Say ""Ni!""

While there were funny and memorable moments like when the killer rabbit appears and attacks the soldiers, this film can be confusing and you wonder what you're watching but it's still enjoyable. It takes place during the plague when almost everybody died and even there has a sense of humor. If you're not a Monty Python fan, you may not appreciate nor understand the humor of the film. Still, it's a comedy but a dark comedy with a great cast like John Cleese, Michael Palin, and many more. The ending was confusing to say the least and there were no actual credits on my DVD. Still, you have to see it once to appreciate the mockery of old British stories which is what it's aiming at like ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" and ""The Canterbury Tales.""

You might want to throw one or two more favorites that you have into that mix, but Monty Python will still be there as well.

As many of you know Monty Pythons Flying Circus was a big British hit in the late 60's and early 70's before the Python troupe made their trip into film. This is their first attempt, Holy Grail and it's their best. There's not a man upon this planet who should die without knowing of Roger the Shrubber and the Knights who say Knee. There are some questionable moral dilemmas placed before Arthur and his Knights on their quest for the Grail.

'it's just a flesh wound', is a common saying of mine, as with 'big sharp pointy teeth', i have to say that this film has in fact effected my life on an almost daily level. however one question still remains for me, what are those peasants actually digging for, why is Dennis after some lovely slope in the river bed?",

The Lord explaining the tasks to the guards, some long annoying conversations. I honestly did not laugh, maybe it's not my type of comedy. It was way too silly and it ends abruptly. I was in a mood to watch some medieval material after visiting Tallinn in Estonia and thought this could be a good choice as I have seen the good reviews about it. I liked the figurines, the locations and the castles are great. I really like the effort put on the drawings for the chapter the medieval cartooned animation was really great. That looked amazing, but the movie was over annoying and silly. I will give a 4 for those nice points I just mentioned.",

I have been a Monty Python fan for about fifteen of my twenty years on this planet. The movie is by far one of my favorites, along with all the other Python flicks. If you are looking for something to suit your taste for the Arthurian legend...well I am sorry the name of King Arther and the use of Camelot, a very silly place, is just about as far as you will get. If you can get past that there is a great, and funny, movie waiting to split your sides, and insult your intelligence. So for a good time all you need is a TV, VCR, and someone who appreciates Monty Python as much as you do. Word to the wise, if you decide to watch this movie with someone who has never seen Monty Python before...be prepared for the usual questions of ""what was that?"", ""Why did he do that?"", and of course the dreaded, ""Now that is just stupid!"".

From beginning to end, this movie has so many laugh out loud moments. While I'm not one for dry British humor, there's still plenty of moments that had me chuckling. I first saw this film in my middle school history class (even though we weren't learning about the middle ages at the time) I can still remember so many great scenes that are now permanently in my memory. One of my favorite scenes probably is the opening scene, in which we hear what we think is a horse galloping, but then it turns out to be two knights with one of them clanking two coconuts together to make the noise. Or the famous Black Knight scene- ""Tis just a flesh wound!"", I think not. This comedy also makes fun of some of the crazy ideas people had back then, which include some of the peculiar practices of the church (particularly the monks) and some of the insane witch trials that were performed so many years ago. My only real criticism with the film is that it gets a bit stale from time to time. The first time I remember this is right around the middle, when the knights get the quest from God. I just remember not laughing as much after that point, and it makes it difficult for me to remember many details that occurred after that point in the movie. This is really the only thing that holds it back from being a perfect film, which is saying something since most British TV shows and movies turn me off just at the mention of them.

The movie opens up with my favorite scene where a peasant with chutzpah, who seems to know too much about politics for a peasant, argues with a king and points out details the king finds valid but very inconvenient. It then goes on and on making fun of various customs of the day-actually mocking many true practices of the time (just as other Python movies do).

Most people had never seen the film before and were immediately bored when the coconut-conversation came up. As I said, the humour is typical, but it's totally my kind of humour.

In the movie the forest plays a pivotal role because most of the scenes, especially the important scenes take place in the woods.

383,9 March 2007,cyberninja85,3, People will hate me for this,"King Arthur never did find that Holy Grail, but from the looks of Monty Python's movie about the search, he did meet a lot of interesting people on his quest. The loony comedy troupe that made the popular BBC television show ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" which featured silly sketches that often didn't end, the famous animation style that looks more like South Park than The Simpsons, and humor that drew as much from 1960s British current events as it did from the Middle Ages. Monty Python was Dennis Miller before Dennis Miller was out of his diapers. All of these influences on their humor come through in their most complete movie, a retelling of the King Arthur legends and lore. And when I say retelling, I mean a series of sketches that have their root in Middle Ages lore and have some affiliation with King Arthur. Methinks the Knights Who Say Ni did not exist in the late 900s. Graham Chapman plays King Arthur, who does not ride a horse, but rather simulates a horse by banging two coconuts together, as he tours the English countryside, trying to find knights for his round table at Camelot. The knights never do make it to Camelot, as Arthur claims ""it is a rather silly place,"" instead are met by God and told of their quest. The movie then follows each knight as they meet snooty Frenchmen (notably John Cleese and his flying barnyard animals), the Castle Anthrax and the 18-22 year old women who make scandalous underwear, the three-headed knight, and many other odd creatures. My favorite tale is that of Sir Lancelot (again, Cleese) as he tries to save someone from being forced to be married by their father. After taking out the entire wedding party, Lancelot finds Prince Herbert (Terry Jones) and silliness ensues. In true Monty Python fashion, the last scene of the movie does not really fit in with the rest of the movie, but if you know Python, you know it is the right ending of the movie. Fantastic points about society are sprinkled in throughout the movie, jokes about overacting are accentuated by the phrase ""Get on with it!"" as shouted by other characters in the movie, and we even get to learn some Swedish. Directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, it is a fast paced onslaught of scatological jokes, and shrubbery.",

Right from the beginning, even the opening credits fall victim to the team's trademark craziness. Graham Chapman heads the cast, as the idealistic King Arthur, who is accompanied by his trusted squire, Patsy, (Terry Gilliam) recruits a small army of Knights which include (John Cleese) Sir. Bedevere the wise (Terry Jones), the chaste Sir Galahad the pure, the over-zealous Sir Lancelot the brave,(John Cleese), and the cowardly Sir. Robin the-not-quite-so-brave (Eric Idle).

416,30 October 2021,DeathByCyan,9, YOU WILL LAUGH,"Silly, fun, ridiculous situations and a roaring musical number! That just some of what awaits you in Monty Python and the Holy Grail! The movie is a reimagined, low budget telling of King Arthur and the knights of the round table searching for the holy Grail. Think of it as a movie version of a group of teen boys role playing Dungeon and Dragons; King Arthur addition! Their sitting at a table making up the story as they go; telling fart jokes and hurling silly insults to make each other laugh.
The cast of Monty Python Graham Chapman (King Arthur), John Cleese (Sir Launcelot), and Eric Idle (Sir Robin) each play a leading character as well as many minor ones throughout the movie. The movie moves from cartoon to modern times and back to medieval times like only Monty Python can do! Their signature humor and tilted way they see the world makes for a fabulous good time!
The story begins as King Arthur is searching for honest good men to join his Knights of the round table. On his journey he meets several strange and bizarre characters, such as the Black Knight. The Black Knight challenges King Arthur to a dual and as they fight Arthur cuts off the knight's arm! Still the knight taunts him and says ""it's merely a flesh wound!"" (Fostater, & White 1975); they continue to fight until the knight has no legs or arms! King Arthur, realizing The Black Knight is a loon, and turns to leave as the Black Knight yells at him to come back and he will bite his ankles!
After much searching Arthur finally finds the brave men that will fight by his side. As King Arthur, Sir Launcelot, Sir Robin and others are on their journey they are called on by the great cartoon God in the clouds. He tells them to find the Holy Grail; they except the challenge and start the quest. Their adventure takes them to one ludicrous scenario after another! From the Knights that say Ni in need of a shrubbery to rude French guards that yell insults and taunt them.
This is defiantly a low budget film but that only adds to the greatness of it! Some scenes are cartoon, and the special effects are pretty bad, and its perfect! There's a killer rabbit that flies around on a string ripping peoples throats out. At one point the Knights (who are now cartoons) are chased by a cartoon monster, but were saved when the artist had a heart attack! The dialogue is funny and the acting is excellent. The story is all over the place with silly conversations and ridiculous situations. This movie is epic, you won't regret watching it.",

I find something special there, which makes me feel better for the rest of a day.

Although the film had a low budget, the cinematography was not bad. The blend of live-action and animation added to the comedic factor. The acting is entertaining as the cast gets to goof off on screen. The music in the film is easily forgettable, but it fits the era the story is primarily set in. The plot in this film is generic, but the comedy helps keep it fresh. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a film with good comedy and a great cast.",

All other Python material is crap too. Fawlty Towers was funny though Cleese' influence would have ruined it if he'd had more input. You could see it coming close as they bled some jokes dry.

I'm not a movie critique therefore I can't say what they did wrong and how they could have done it better. But on the other hand I don't think I would, this movie is British comedy at its best.

Just one of the many influences: does the irreverent discussion of European vs. African swallows remind you of John Travolta/Samuel L. Jackson's famous ""quarter pounder with cheese"" exchange ? To be fair, Monty Python itself hails from an important tradition of subversive humor that, at least in the cinematic world dates back to the days of Buster Keaton. Then of course, came the Marx Brothers,  the Golden Age of Warner Bros. Cartoons (1937-1957, arguably THE most influential humor of the century), and ""Dr.Strangelove"". But Monty Python really set the pace for the kind of absurdist satire we know and love today. The impact of ""Holy Grail"" reaches far and wide - from Michael Keaton's horseless galloping in Kenneth Branagh ""Much Ado about Nothing"" to the Columbine High Shootings(""It's just a flesh wound"" was reputedly a favorite quote of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold).",

You know how I really realized how cool this film was?  I studied in the Loire region (in France) my sophomore year of college.  One of our earlier group excursions was to a medieval castle called Chinon.  As we climbed up the tower and reached the lookout point someone from my group whispered, ""Fetchez la vache!""

There was a lot of funny things like a bunny attacking and killing the knights, a sword fight in which the black knight loses his arms and legs and continues to fight. I love gore in comedies.

In it, the Monty python troupe plays King Arthur and the Knights of the round table. It is filled with a large amount of clever humor, as well as some dumb (yet funny) humor.

Being able to relive some of the best scenes and lines that were ever created. My 10 year old boys just watched this movies and it was laugh out loud fun. We all needed tissues to wipe away the tears of joy this film produces. To hear my boys saying lines to this movie just warmed my heart. This was my first exposure to Monty Python and it is my favorite. I am saddened when I hear a line from the movie and guys at the fire station don't recognize it and look lost. There is a generation that missed out. Don't worry I bring in the DVD next shift to share the pure awesomeness of this cult comedy classic. This film might not be for everyone.

617,30 July 2007,kongisking94,10, Have you seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail Yet?,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.",

This is the only, the ONLY, comedy I have seen over and over and yet find myself laughing out loud. The AFI and its' politically maneuvered list of the 100 best comedies ever is a farce.

It sets a precedent for the Pythons as they moved into films from the hugely successful TV series. Several of the scenes in it have attained cult status not least the Black Knight fight scene, the rude Frenchman and the Knights who say ""Nee"". The ending is a little bit of a let down, that is true but the Python boys never kept things simple or predictable. The fact that they don't get hold of the Grail only seems to compound how bumbling their whole adventure has been. Extra credit should goto co-writer John Cleese who plays some of the movies funniest characters including the Black Knight, Tim the Wizard and Sir Lancelot who can't help hacking people to death. This is a true gem and the comedy hasn't dated in 26 years since it was made. Their humour sets a precedent in what is arguably the best of the three Python films.

A great point to this is how the movie is cut. the movie shows the scene then goes to an intermission card saying who the next scene features. the jokes are hilarious making fun of most stories featuring knights and medevil heroes for example there is a scene of king arthur talking to a peasant and the peasant tells him how monarchies are not a proper way to rule.

There are so many laugh-out-loud moments in this film that you can't help loving it.

This movie is a combo of farce and satire. It parodies King Arthur movies and movies in general. The part about King Arthur is fairly self evident, but for general movies, it makes fun of them by pointing out flaws in all types of movies. This begins in the opening credits with the subtitles about a Swedish moose and continues through the unconventional ending. The farce can be seen through all the misunderstandings and general silliness. From a bunny being the most dangerous killer to coconuts replacing a horse, this farce is used to full effect.

709,3 October 2013,meganaq,9, Awesome,"The film is a good demonstration of how masses can be easily manipulated; a red highlight to man's pride and desire of controlling all; a call to open our eyes on our blind walk, guided by blind leaders; a shout for attention to life's undervaluation and an echo that whispers the castration of men's true wills All those issues are projected in the film, although there's no shedding of tears Monty Python And The Holy Grail shows us how to deal well with the sad facts of life: Having a big laugh at it all! The film is a 1975 British comedy, written and performed by the sarcastic group Monty Python, and directed by two of its members, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones. It draws a satire on power and parodies King Arthur and The Knights of The Round Table legend. The satire starts from the chosen legend itself and as its name suggests, the table has no head, evincing that everyone who sits there has equal status. Although in the film, King Arthur goes dictating orders and affirming his position to everyone. The movie imposes a cynical tone from the initial title of credits, until the last minute of it. Monty Python And The Holy Grail starts with King Arthur, riding an imaginary horse, accompanied by his squire, who bangs two pieces of coconut in Nordic lands, making the sound of a horse ride. Arthur recruits his knights of the round table, including, Sir Bedevere The Wise, Sir Lancelot The Brave, Sir Robin The Not-Quite-So-Brave-As- Lancelot and Sir Galahad the Pure, together they go on the quest for the Holy Grail. They build a ""Trojan Rabbit"" and try to sneak into a French castle, but they forget to hide into the rabbit and fail. Arthur then decides the group should separate to seek the grail. Their separated journeys are totally absurd, plenty of strange creatures and ridiculous obstacles. The plot is gag's restless but we never get enough, one turn overcomes the other, with a really smart and anti-classical style. The English humour travels from the banal weather issue to the monarch state, although the way it's played provokes universal laughter. The script has a ""classic"" anti-structure, a style emerged in Europe after the WWII. It's got incoherent realities, extravagance and exaggeration, obviation of formal principles to ridicule the issues and express with clarity revolutionary ambitions. The narrative is constructed by random, fragmented and chaotic events, full of coincidences, starred by characters deliberately incoherent and usually symbolic, and it also has clear influences of Expressionism, Dadaism and the Theatre of The Absurd. In Monty Python And The Holy Grail, we see characters talking to the camera and also referring to other characters not by their names, but by the scene they played (""There is the old man from scene 24""); actors comment about their acting in the middle of the film; an intermission is called right when King Arthur is crossing The Death Bridge; the medieval age plot is absurdly connected to the 70's sub-plot; but in the end, it all contributes to create an absurd and chaotic situation which goes totally coherent with the film's main target: the incoherent way we live. Monty Python And The Holy Grail doesn't end, it simply stops!",

Sir Bedevere, Sir Lancelot, Sir Robin and Sir Galahad are introduced in the story one by one. When the party is about to enter Camelot King Arthur decides that Camelot is a silly place and they almost disassemble but then God appears and send them on a sacred quest: to find the Holy Grail. After every knight goes on an individual adventure,they are reunited to face different perils, a wizard, a killer rabbit, yes a killer rabbit, (photo) isn't it adorable? a monster with many eyes... Their quest comes to an end when the police intervene, yeah, the police, modern police. Strange, isn't it? specially for a movie set in tenth century England. But the most important thing in this movie isn't the plot, or the historical inaccuracies, which are always few and very calculated in Monty Python's productions, the important thing is the comedy. Monty Python is comedy, period. Intelligent, acid, sarcastic British humour. Some could say that the jokes are silly but that apparent simpleness hides the most incisive and scathing humour. Like in other Monty Python works, some of the jokes conceal political content, often to ridicule the anti-establishment movements repeating their hackneyed slogans out of context.

720,1 March 2019,williamalternativ,10, Amazing,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedic parody of the classic Arthurian legends by Monty Python. It is a great movie that is extremely funny.
 Monty Python and the Holy Grail focuses most of the story on King Arthur and his quest for the holy grail. It takes place in Britain. The movie makes jokes of many things including British-French relations and the mystical tales in the Arthurian legends. Monty Python and the Holy Grail takes place during Medieval Europe. 
 While not visually impressive it is not bad looking and has it's own unique style of showing, what looks like animated medieval murals during transitions. My favorite bit is about the Holy Hand-grenade of Antioch. King Arthur uses the grenade to kill a vicious man eating monster, a rabbit, and they explain how to use it in about five different ways.

Monty Python And The Holy Grail is an amazing comedy that is still hilarious 44 years after its release making it a comedy masterpiece.
Monty Python And The Holy Grail is about King Arthur and several knights who go on a quest to find the holy grail. At first King Arthur builds a group of knights for his holy quest. On their hilarious quest they run into several foes such as the French, a deadly rabbit, the bridge of death and several more. All along their quest they will have you laughing at all the comedic conversations and battles.
Arthur, King of the Britons (Graham Chapman) is a king who leads his knights on a quest for the holy grail. His fellow knights Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere the Wise (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin) help Arthur defeat (or run away from) many foes on their quest for the grail. The members of the cast work really well together to make this film a work of art that keeps you laughing until the very end. The film is directed by Gilliam and Jones who proved that they can make an amazing film stand the test of time.
The film is an amazing example of how to use music and sound to add humor or intensity to a scene. The costumes and film locations really make the film feel like it takes place in 10th century England. The music before an action scene always fits well with the story. The sound effects, like the use of coconuts to make the sound of a horse, find a way to add humor to every scene. The script is a big reason the film is as good as it is because it is humorous and tells the story wonderfully. The camerawork and effects work seamlessly to make hilarious action scenes that look pretty real.
One scene that exemplifies why Monty Python And The Holy Grail is an amazing film is the ""Deadly Rabbit of Caerbannog"" scene. In this scene good camera work and effects make the battle between the knights and the bunny intense. This is compounded by the sound effects of the bunny's attacks to make the bunny a surprisingly scary foe. At the same time the dialogue between the characters makes a bloody action scene more into a comedy. This scene is a work of art because it is both an intense action scene and hilarious at the same time.
Monty Python And The Holy Grail isn't a perfect film though. It's biggest flaw is the fact that it is over 40 years old. The age definitely shows with the lack of modern special effects and low camera quality. If you like to watch films because of their jaw-dropping special effects and super high definition video then this film isn't for you. However, if you can get over the films obvious age then you will enjoy the comedic masterpiece that is Monty Python And The Holy Grail.
The Monty Python group has made many more films and television broadcasts than just Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Monty Python is a british comedy group that made it big with the BBC series Monty Python's Flying Circus. This series is much different work than the film Monty Python And The Holy Grail because it's a TV series spanning forty five episodes instead of a 92 minute film. The change in format however made little difference in Monty Python's ability to make amazing comedies as after their BBC series ended they made several great films.
With Monty Python's work in films like Monty Python And The Holy Grail they have cemented themselves as one of the most influential comedy groups. Graham Chapman's stellar performance as King Arthur alongside the rest of the cast drives the film forward while the great sound and visual effects take care of the rest. Everything in Monty Python And The Holy Grail fits together perfectly to make the film a real comedy masterpiece.",
