0,29 July 2017,elvircorhodzic,10," ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.""","DR. STRANGELOVE.... is a satirical black comedy or rather an ironic approach to decisions and information in the Cold War madness. The smart choice is the mother of all wisdom. It is loosely based on Peter George's novel ""Red Alert"".",/
1,26 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10, Sharp and outrageously entertaining,"I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr.Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.",r
2,1 October 2005,Boba_Fett1138,10, The only movie that makes you laugh at the end of the world.,This movie is absolutely brilliant! It might not be THE best movie ever made but it certainly is one of the most entertaining and fun movies ever made. It isn't even Kubrick's best but it certainly is perhaps his most accessible and entertaining movie.,e
3,22 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Still laughing, long past the end credits...","Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven't seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clich√©s... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick's most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I'm not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. I know I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10",v
4,14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10, Laughing at Fear,"What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!",i
5,15 November 2006,planktonrules,10, This gets better with repeated viewings--what a film!,"I saw this film originally when I was about 12 and I wasn't super-impressed by it--particularly since my father was a bit like George C. Scott's character in the film!! However, years later (long after the threat from nuclear annihilation from the Soviet Union has greatly diminished), I was a lot older and experienced and thought the film was brilliant--and not the ""Commie Plot"" my Dad had envisioned!",e
6,24 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Gentlemen, You can't fight in here! This is the War Room!","I didn't quite understand all of the jokes, but I enjoyed this movie enormously. It is essentially one of the best satirical comedies out there. Peter Sellers was hilarious here in no less than 3 roles. My personal favourite was the president. My favourite line of the film is actually in the title of this review, as Dad and I watched this at midnight and couldn't stop laughing. I loved Sellers also as the man in the wheelchair Strangelove, who tries to impersonate Hitler, I think. There was a brilliant performance from fine actor George C. Scott, who I really admire. I personally think there isn't enough of these two stars on television, I really don't. I noticed a young James Earl Jones too, and the camera-work and direction were both excellent. Got to love the music, I did, a bit ironic, but that was the intention. Great movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox",w
7,13 February 2000,Quinoa1984,10, Kubrick takes a whack at comedy- and the cold war,"Stanley Kubrick always likes to try something new with each movie he does, and this proves it. This is truly one of the grittiest, and best dark comedies I've ever seen with some crude moments and some odd ones (who'd think to have Slim Pickens riding a bomb on it's way down). It turns into a flat out masterpiece though with the spectacular acting by Peter Sellers (in three separate roles), George C. Scott (his facial expressions are a crack up every time), and a supporting cast of crazies in a government of loons, the most impressive of these being the incomparable Sterling Hayden in his best dramatic/funny role. It contains a resonance as well that sticks till today, as corruption and pig-headedness rules in all sorts of governments, but most of all in those with the most power. It's almost worth it just for the opening credits and end sequence with ""we'll meet again"".",/
8,17 May 2017,francozeff,10, Russians In The War Room,"Spectacular and chilling to watch Dr. Strangelove in May 16, 2017. I'm not going to talk about prophecy not even coincidence. Art has a way to warn, express or simply entertain in a way that its relevance will always be renewed. That opening with George C Scott's secretary, in her underwear, answering the phone for her boss in the most professional tone imaginable, is a masterful way to introduce us to the normal absurdity we're about to embark on. Terry Southern's extraordinary script (sharing credit with Peter George and Stanley Kubrick himself) is a masterpiece of intention and execution. The film doesn't have a moment of emptiness nor a single cheap shot. Everything works with the irrational logic of tradition and set standards. How can something so serious and ultimately terrifying can be so funny. I think that's the definition of film art. I don't want to sound pompous but that's exactly how I feel. I've seen a 1966 movie by Stanley Kubrick in 2017 that's better, more relevant, ingenious and even revolutionary than anything we've seen in a long, long time. Peter Sellers, fantastic three times over (and he was also going to play the Slim Pickens part) George C Scott in one of the greatest comic performances ever put on film and Sterling Hayden in a frighteningly credible show of abuse of power, complete the pleasures of this remarkable film.",r
9,5 June 2003,Coventry,10, A must see !!! ***** out of ****,"Who else than Stanley Kubrick could take a serious subject like the cold war and tell the story like a comedy ??? He proves his genius in this film more like in any other film of his. It's the story about one general ( with the very appropriate name Jack D. Ripper) gone mad and he launches an attack on Russia all by himself. He's mad, but still smart enough to prevent that anyone can stop him. He's got this strange ( but very funny ) theories about body-fluids, but his men respect him and do everything he says. So 34 fully-armed plains are sent to as many targets. Meanwhile his Colonel, Mandrake, tries to talk sense to him and the president and another General are trying to warn the Russian prime minister. You can have nothing but great respect for Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film and every single one of them is flawless. The doctor Strangelove character is hilarious and creepy at the same time. His appearances as the doctor are, along with the telephone conversations between the president and the Russian Prime minister the funniest moments in the film... Also the classic bomb-ride of Major Kong off course. George C. Scott is clearly having fun in his role and the debut of James Earl Jones is also definitely worth mentioning. Like I said already...a must see film if you're a film lover in general.",w
10,6 April 2008,bkoganbing,9, Going Toe to Toe with the 'Rooskies',"As a film Dr. Strangelove was so well received that a more serious film on the same topic, Failsafe, failed to find an audience. Yet Strangelove made you think as well as entertain which is the ultimate object of any great work of cinema.",0
11,7 August 2017,Woodyanders,9, Please no fighting in the war room,"Stanley Kubrick's wickedly hilarious end-of-the-world black comedy gem about an impending nuclear war caused by human error straddles a fine line between being fiercely funny and genuinely chilling throughout: As evident by the gross behavior and arrogant attitudes of various high-ranking officials in positions of power that they are neither smart nor mature enough to properly handle, the greatest threat to mankind's safety isn't the existence of nuclear weapons; instead it's such all too real and unavoidable human foibles as pride, stupidity, and incompetence that we should all be more worried about.",0
12,14 October 2000,archyon,10, Frighteningly hilarious,"This movie is possibly the best comedy ever made, only with one fact against it: it's not very ""comical"". Hilarious? Yes. Comical? Absolutely not. The horrors of the nuclear war caused by a simple mistake materialize before us, directed with skill by the late maestro, Kubrick.",8
13,11 May 2017,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Better laugh at absurdity than cry,"This film has become a cultish film because of the subject of course but especially because of the tone that is really entirely conveyed by two actors, Peter Sellers and his three roles and George C. Scott. We could add Slim Pickens in the batch with his phenomenal dive into nuclear annihilation at the end. ",1
14,9 June 2002,rmax304823,9, Superlative.,"The best black comedy ever made. I could watch it a thousand times and still laugh. Oh -- dated, sure. There no longer is a Soviet Union, although there are plenty of people willing to barbecue one another nuclearly -- as in India and Pakistan. I'd like to mention the writer on this, the late Terry Southern, who had lots of input into some pretty funny movies, not to mention his short stories or novellas. He's the guy who came up with ""pre-version."" Kubrik did a fine job. He lost his sense of humor afterward. ",4

18,12 March 2002,smatysia,9," ""I'm sorry, too, Dmitri""","This film must have really stuck in a lot of craws when it came out. Kubrick's black comedy of the Cold War (right in the middle of it) is notable for a number of reasons. In many ways the film seems to make light of the menace posed by Communism, when later events proved that that menace was utterly real and extremely dangerous. There were tremendous acting performances by George C. Scott and Slim Pickens. It was interesting to see Sterling Hayden working with Kubrick again, some years after ""The Killing"". Some parts of the film dragged a little bit, and some were, of course, way over the top. A complete classic, though. And isn't it interesting how Seller's Strangelove was eerily evocative of Kissinger, years before he was widely known. Grade: A+",?
19,16 February 2001,justusmcqueen,10, The Ultimate Black Comedy,"Few films are able to take a deadly serious issue and place it within the context of a broad comedy successfully.  Dr. Strangelove does exactly that. Kubrick's masterpiece illustrates in brilliant fashion the idiocy of nuclear war and the idiots who are orchestrating it. What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individual characterisations of Sellers, Scott, Hayden and Pickens. To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With names such as President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed ""war room"" set, the hand-held camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black and white cinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of ""Strangelove.""  Quite simply, the greatest American film by the greatest American director.",r
20,8 May 2015,jimbo-53-186511,5," Very funny in parts, but sadly not all of this worked for me",Dr Strangelove is a film that is sitting high up in the IMDb Top 250 films (it's currently sitting at number 49 on the list) and therefore it's clearly a film that is generally loved by the public - the critics also have a strong liking for this film. I personally found this film a little uneven if I'm honest....,e
21,1 November 2008,thinker1691,9," "" Mr. President , . . We Must Not Allow a Mine-Shaft Gap!!! ""","In all the years of film making, Peter Sellers never disappointed an audience. No matter what the part, he always seem to find the perfect voice and therefore, his character. If you put him together with other equally great character actors like, George C. Scott who plays maniacal Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and Sterling Hayden as the insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Jack The Ripper?) and the Slim Pickens as Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong, James Erle Jones as Lt. Lothar Zogg, the bombardier and Peter Bull as the Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, then you not only have an award winning film, but the secret formula for a Classic. The story is set in the sixties, during the Cold War and a lunatic Air Wing Commander intentionally gives the ""Gold Code Signal for his wing to attack Russia. What follows is a dramatic minute ticking film, designed to illuminate the military's ignorance, stupidity and final acquiescence of the doomsday, 'Fail-Safe' device. The entire movie is a comedy of errors and one reflected of Standly Kubrick's genius. The one sequence where Major Kong rides a nuclear missal to its target is synonymous with the mentality of the pentagon. Through the passage of time, this superb movie has not only become a Dark Classic, but a possible statement of the future reality of the human race. ****",f
22,16 January 2005,kaiser44,6, Just didn't do it for me,I really wanted to like this movie. Sometimes Peter Sellers makes me laugh and sometimes I just think the way he plays the characters are too OTT.,_
23,30 August 2018,cricketbat,8, A silly comedy about a very serious subject.,"What can be said about this movie? It's a classic. One of the great films. A silly comedy about a very serious subject. If you haven't seen this one yet, it's about time you did.",=
24,19 January 1999,RufusT,10," Outstanding, timeless classic!","One of the best films ever made, this remains timeless despite changes in technology, foreign policy and world politics; the military/political madness remains the same.

25,2 October 2001,Hitchcoc,10, Just Wanted to Get My Two Cent's Worth,"This, to me, ranks as the masterwork of black comedy. From the harmonies of ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home,"" to Bat Guano defending the Coca Cola company as a nuclear weapon is about to bring about total annihilation, one cringes at the absurd potential realities.  I had heard of the strange title with its equally understated subtitle, but saw it for the first time in 1969.  I have watched it at least 20 times since.  There is so much.  The empty headed but patriotic Major Kong, played by Slim Pickens, is one of filmdom's most memorable characters.  The deranged open eyed, gum chewing visage of Buck Turgidson, with his military zealousness, talking about ""mine shaft gaps"" (man I wish we had one of them doomsday machines!)  Jack Ripper and his precious bodily fluids.  Then, of course, there are the Peter Sellers roles--Mandrake, who has the fate of the world depending on finding enough change to make a phone call; the President who works to gain the trust of Kissoff, the Russian Premier, and, of course, the maniacal schizoid Strangelove.  This film is, I believe, Kubrick's masterpiece.  It is an integration of power and what can be done about it attitude.  It ends with a song as it began--Try a Little Tenderness,"" with the sexually provocative refueling of the bomber, to ""We'll Meet Again"" as the bombs explode.  This is a great film.",t
26,4 November 2018,Bored_Dragon,5, I'm glad Kubrick gave up on comedy,"I understood sarcasm and the message this movie brings, but the idea doesn't make a good movie. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, and I've seen thousands. In what universe this may pass as a comedy?! Besides a few mediocre jokes, most of it wasn't funny at all. I barely endured to the end and I wouldn't watch it again even if my life depended on it. For entertainment qualities I would rate it zero out of ten, but because the essential idea is good I'll compromise with",_
27,11 February 2003,reaper1800,10, Subtle and Symbolic,"Entertainment Weekly called this one of the funniest 100 movies ever made. It also happens to be one of the most disturbing movies made. The humor is right there in your face, however, there is always an underlining political critique under every character, every line, and every government representation. Slim Pickins is the never quit Airman. He is a representative of our entire military system of the time. The president, played beautifully by Peter Sellers, is a demure, calm presence trying to deal with the Russian premiere. His perfect counterpart is a war hungry General, ready to accuse the Russians of any small infraction. This leads to one of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Sellers also plays a British airman who has to deal with the crazed general in the usual polite British manner. Seller's third role is that of the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a former nazi and weapons designer for the Americans. He represents the scientific community of that time period; those who worked tirelessly to build a better bomb. These characters, all of them strongly parodying a cross section of society make for an odd story. The final scene, while played for laughs, is actually a frightening image of a communist future. The final moments are frightening in their truth leading one to put themselves in a position of the characters. Dr. Strangelove is the funniest disturbing film I've ever seen.",u
28,9 November 2019,Leofwine_draca,8, Razor sharp,"An impeccably-made slice of Cold War satire, Kubrick's well-remembered black comedy is a sharp and snappy affair with the kind of production values and direction to dream for. An absurdist situation gives the famed director a chance to explore all kinds of character comedy, with the knives kept sharpest for the American military. The performers on show don't put a foot wrong, although of course the real merit goes to Peter Sellers who convinces in no less than three widely different performances. There are some wonderful lines and situations on show here that you'll remember for the rest of your life.",r
29,9 August 2020,sudhirkumarpal8,8, Amazing as hell,"What art of movie making can do, is visible in this movie. Even a serious topic as war can be satirized if the skills are perfect. That's what the perfection does, anything as perfect as the edge of a sword. Peter playing three different roles, and I had no clue of this untill I read an article about this. I took me hours to get fully convinced about the oneness of him in those all three roles. I would say the make up was to its perfection. The movie even being monochrome was more colourful and entertaining than the modern CGI mess.",v
30,28 January 2016,ironhorse_iv,9," It might be a little dated, but Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is still da bomb. A fun watch.","The topic of nuclear apocalypse might be a dark and chilling subject, yet, it doesn't mean we can't laugh about it either. This 1964's political satire black comedy film showcase, not only the dangerous of atomic weaponry, but also the pure human stupidity that comes with it. Directed by fame director, Stanley Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb tells the story of the President of the United States, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), and his staff, trying to recall a squadron of air-force bombers heading toward Russia, after an unhinged United States Air Force general, Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) declare nuclear war on the Soviet Union. Can the group save the world in a last ditch attempt to prevent a nuclear apocalypse or will we all, be listening to the tune of 'We'll Meet Again' by Vera Lynn in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, as a Cold War nut, I found this movie, very interesting. Instead of creating, a serious drama of author Peter George's thriller novel, ""Red Alert'. Stanley Kubrick chose to take a more escapism route than a oversaturate melodrama route at the time. I guess, he can already sense that a lot of Americans at the time, were already on the edge because of the threat of Nuclear War, and people need a laugh, more, than being put into fear. However, Stanley Kubrick was face with a few problems. First off, Columbia Pictures would only finance the film if actor Peter Sellers played at least four major roles. I guess, they like Seller's performance in Kubrick's previous film 1962's Lolita, because the fact, that he assumes a number of identities. In my opinion, having Peter Seller onboard was the greatest thing, this movie could had done. He was hilarious as the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Royal Air Force (RAF) officer, Captain Mandrake. All of them, were very different characters, and none of them, seem like it was played by the same guy. However, his performance as Dr. Strangelove was a bit, over the top. Despite that, I still found it, to be amazing. That's how great, he was, in this film. I just glad, he only did, three roles, rather than four. I really didn't see him, playing the Texan, Air Force Major T. J. ""King"" Kong, the B-52 Stratofortress aircraft commander at all. In my opinion, Slim Pickens was a better choice. Glad, they went with him, instead of Sellers in this case. Another key character in this film, had to be George C. Scott as uber-jingoist, General Buck Turgidson. Wow, just wow! He was laugh out loud, funny. He really had that sense of command in his tone. Ever since then, a lot of war comedies, have use his sense of tone as a comedic general. The movie dialogue helps the acting, a lot. There were a lot of clever funny jokes and memorable lines, throughout the film, like 'You'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company ', 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"" & 'Mein F√ºhrer! I can walk!' It was all very well-written. I just glad, they stick to the ending, we got, instead of the pie fight ending, they originally wanted. However, the effects of the Kennedy assassination on 1963, did change a few parts of the film. Any mention of the city of Dallas was clearly cut from the film. Another problem that Stanley Kubrick had to face, was 1964's Fail Safe, a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although Fail Safe was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film's box office potential, especially if it were released first. So, a lawsuit was filed by Columbia Pictures and himself on Fail Safe. Kubrick argued that Fail Safe's own 1960 source novel Fail-Safe had been plagiarized from Peter George's Red Alert, to which Kubrick owned creative rights and pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between certain characters, despite Dr. Strangelove being loosely based on Red Alert. The plan worked, and Fail Safe opened eight months behind Dr. Strangelove. Fail Safe open up to mediocre success, while Dr. Strangelove open up to mostly success with people, but a few controversy and mixed opinions from certain critics calling it a 'juvenal satire'. Yet today, this film is considered to be one of the sharpest comedy films ever made, and I have to agree with today's standards. Indeed, Stanley Kubrick's deserve the praise. This is my favorite movie of his. I love how it's shot. The whole Black and white feel to the film, remind me of the 'black and white' views of the Cold War, so much. While, most of the sets, visual effects and action scenes can seem a bit dated. Comedy films like these, are one of the very few comedies from the 1960s that I can still laugh at. Overall: It's an outstanding, timeless masterpiece that must be seen for anybody looking for a good hoot! An explosive of laughs.",
31,19 April 2019,gbill-74877,9, Brilliant,"Marvelous satire from Kubrick, and one that clicks on all cylinders - visually beautiful, lots of funny moments, and sharp commentary on the military, cold war, and threat of nuclear annihilation. A perfect encapsulation of the period, and yet ahead of its time as well. Brilliant performances from Peter Sellers in his three roles, George C. Scott, and Slim Pickens. The imagery is so biting - that cowboy hat, ""peace is our profession"", and the third reich salutes. The sexual overtones throughout the film add another layer of commentary, starting with the plane refueling and in many references to virility, signaling an aspect that has always been part of the military and those who would make war (perhaps the ultimate 'toxic masculinity' ... and making me think of the George Carlin bit about it not being manly to 'pull out' of Vietnam).",
32,18 July 2020,bertrambuchert,9, Extremely entertaining,"This movie had humor to an intelligent extent and was one of the most entertaining ""older"" movies.

34,4 December 2005,moonspinner55,7, Lacerating black comedy...,"From Peter George's book ""Red Alert"", turned by writer-director Stanley Kubrick into a movie signpost of the paranoid times. Plot has the American President trying to assimilate and explain unprovoked A-Bomb attack by the U.S. on Russia. Peter Sellers (in three wonderfully different roles) is amazing, George C. Scott just as good as matter-of-fact sergeant. Dark-humored essay on the craziness of war is troubling, disturbing, often highly entertaining. Kubrick, who co-adapted the screenplay with Terry Southern, does fabulous work. Supporting cast (including Sterling Hayden, James Earl Jones, Slim Pickens--in a marvelously showy role--and Keenan Wynn) are top-notch. *** from ****",

37,16 November 2019,Kingslaay,8, Decent and well made,"Dr Strangelove does not take a breath from start to finish. At first you might think its a short or standard 1.5 hours but it covers a lot of content. The apparent dark humour is there amidst a very serious plot. It also shows the dangers that can unfold when people in command lose their minds. Also interesting that the President doesn't have as much power as you think. This is an intelligent film, great story and good performances. Peter Sellers shines in his 3 different roles. Kubrick carefully and meticulously shows the workings that lead to such conflict. A classic that can be watched again and a beacon of good film making. 8/10",
38,6 April 2008,theowinthrop,10, All For Our Natural Bodily Fluids,"It can safely be assumed that DR. STRANGELOVE could not have been made in the Eisenhower years. Even after Senator McCarthy's fall from public support, Ike and the Republicans (and the Democrats) were too involved in the politics of the Cold War to consider the ultimate point of containment and confrontation of the Soviet Union and the Communists as a subject worth laughing at. I can only think of one film, THE ATOMIC KID, that appeared in the 1950s, and somewhat spoofed nuclear disaster. In that film Mickey Rooney stumbles into a cabin stocked with supplies when he and his friend/partner Robert Strauss are looking for assistance (their car broke down). Rooney is at the site when a nuclear bomb is dropped on it (it is the target). He survives, and the only rationale for it is that he was eating peanut butter sandwiches. The antics of American and Russian agents get involved in that film, as does the American habit of looking for the main chance (Strauss sees Rooney as a potential gold mine in the advertising world). But it is pretty lightweight stuff - and miles away from the real sense of dread surrounding STRANGELOVE.",

It probably didn't help either that I've been lately tracking down and watching other Cold War political thrillers of the era. I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't quite get Dr Strangelove, heretic as that may appear given its prestigious reputation.
I understand too that its anti-war message perhaps had more relevance and resonance to its original audience which had just gone through the whole Cuban Missile Crisis scenario, but for me the message here overcame the medium with Kubrick using a bazooka to crack open these particular nut(case)s.
I love Peter Sellers and of course he ably demonstrates his comic versatility and mastery of his craft over the course of the three roles he plays but just like Slim Pickens, George C Scott and Sterling Hayden his fellow-crazies, the characterisations used are just too broad, blunt and overpowering. I also found the running gags centring on sexual innuendo just too crude and obvious.
I do recognise that some of the scenes have become iconic like Pickens riding the missile down to destruction and Sellers gradually more deranged title character at the end plus I love the last line of the movie even if I suspect more of Sellers improvisatory skill than Kubrick's directorial hand in it.

70,10 August 2021,nickenchuggets,9," ""Mein f√ºhrer... I can walk""","Doctor Strangelove is a movie that has a huge amount of glorification surrounding it and is often considered one of the best movies ever made. After seeing it, I thought it was good, but not an especially groundbreaking movie that was destined to revolutionize film making. For its time, it was very important for people to have some comic relief about a serious subject like this. In the 50s and 60s, what americans feared more than anything was a nuclear strike by the Soviet Union. This movie makes light of this predicament, but in a way that still has lots of morbid themes and imagery in it. The vast majority of it is not all that funny, but the comical parts are funny in a way that is macabre and cynical. The movie is about a General in the US military, Jack Ripper, who has taken it upon himself to send a large number of bomber planes under his command to attack various targets within Soviet Russia with nuclear weapons. Each bomb contains a destructive force greater than all the explosives detonated in world war 2 multiplied by 16. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Ripper severs his base's communications with the outside world and says anyone who approaches it (even americans) are to be shot. The bombers are also equipped with a special type of radio transmitter that only receives messages if a unique 3 digit letter prefix is entered first, and only Ripper knows the combination. This basically means not even the US President himself can order the planes back home. Meanwhile at the Pentagon, the President and his top military commanders are working with a Soviet ambassador to hopefully either help the russians destroy the planes or try to get them recalled. The ambassador announces to everyone that Russia has constructed a ""doomsday device"" that is programmed to detonate a huge amount of nuclear warheads covered in the element cobalt if the USSR is ever attacked by atomic weapons. It can't be shut down, and if it activates, the resulting radiation will be so enormous that earth will be unfit for human life for almost a century. The title character finally makes his appearance shortly after (Peter Sellers) and is shown to be an ex-nazi now working with the US government. Even though he's in a wheelchair, his warnings of what a full-scale atomic war will do to the earth are all too terrifying. Eventually, the President decides he has just about had it with Ripper's insubordination and sends an army detachment to attack his base. Ripper kills himself, and his associate, Royal Air Force captain Mandrake, declares he has found the letter prefix needed to recall the planes. The code reaches the President, who relays it to the planes, and they are all successfully recalled (except one whose radio is damaged). The pilot of this plane is Major ""King"" Kong, a reckless officer who wears a cowboy hat even during combat missions. His crew selects their target for the nuke, but the bay doors on the plane won't open. Kong takes it upon himself to literally ride the bomb to the target, all while flailing his hat like a lunatic. Sadly for everyone on earth, this attack on Russia triggers their doomsday device, and their hidden nukes start going off. Dr. Strangelove suggests everyone live underground for the next 93 years, after which he involuntarily sieg heils and is somehow able to walk again. This movie is just plain weird, or rather just ""plane"" weird. The whole experience has a dark atmosphere to it where nothing short of the entire world is at stake, but the movie doesn't feel very serious. Most of the characters have ridiculous names, and Strangelove's accent is pretty ridiculous too. Despite not having much screentime, he is by far the strangest part of the movie; something that gets proven even more correct by the sudden abrupt ending. After learning one of the plane's has succesfully nuked Russia, Strangelove's right arm seems like it keeps extending on its own, like he's giving the nazi salute. Earlier, we're told he used to be a nazi, and because of this, I assume he is able to walk again because the thought of everyone on earth being killed (except people like him) brings joy to him. It's what his home country originally wanted, and now the earth will have to be repopulated by aryans only. It's one of those endings that can be interpreted in different ways, but that's how I see it. A little known fact about this movie is that the ending was supposed to involve the Pentagon generals throwing pies in each other's faces, but this was cut after Kennedy was assassinated. Peter Sellers is the most iconic person to star in this movie, and he even plays 3 characters: Captain Mandrake, the President, and Strangelove. Despite this, he manages to make each character look distinct from one another, and all their voices are different. This was most definitely not easy to do. When compared with Fail Safe (another movie about nuclear war with a similar plot) I feel that Dr. Strangelove is a worthy but ultimately more simplified experience. It caters to those people back in the 60s who were constantly living in fear of the day mushroom clouds would appear on the horizon, which is to say almost everybody. Comedy movies in general are more popular than serious films (even today) because people like to laugh and have fun. Even though Strangelove is not all that funny, it is still technically a comedy, so it's not a surprise it's way more well known than Fail Safe. Still, Kubrick knew the power of humor and how it can help you through very depressing situations, so this film is just what 60s america needed.",

Here the premise recalls what happens in Wargames (the human element to launch a nuclear attack) but in a reverse way (the attack is launched!): It's funny (and comforting) that the path to the actual detonation is very complicated and not limited as a single red button to push like we are told. The military sets and equipment looks very accurate and in this cold, serious world, it's very unusual to find indeed comedy: I remember Hot Shots but here there's no really patriot feeling but frightening humans behavior: the military mind to look for an enemy to attack, the amoral and amnesic use of Nazi scientists for the arms race...

The film was originally meant to be a serious movie, but Stanley Kubrick felt with the way the film developed it would work better as dark comedy. The film starts very seriously but the comedy develops throughout the film, using some brilliant lines, good sight gags and great performances and some jokes such as the name Jack D. Ripper. Peter Sellers was great as the American President, Captain Mandrake, an RAF officer who was on loan to the USAF and Dr. Strangelove, a German nuclear scientist who was working for America. He was meant to play the B-52 bomber pilot as well, but he was going through a divorce at the time, so could only do THREE roles. The film has be referred and parodied in many comedy programmes, especially the Simpsons. Some of my person favourite bits in the film are the telephone conversations between the US President and the Soviet Premier, Dr. Strangelove talking the President and the Join Chiefs at the end of the film.

I mean, there's Peter Sellers as an RAF captain named Mandrake, as President Merkin Muffley, and in the title role. He's a little amusing as the first character, quite funny in a deadpan way as the second, and hilarious as the third whenever his hand goes up or he tries to stop from that happening. As General Buck Turgidson, George C. Scott steals his scenes every time he goes on a tangent or when he's talking on the phone with his secretary (Tracy Reed) whom he beds. There's also Sterling Hayden as General Jack Ripper who keeps talking about ""fluids"" as if they're the most valuable thing who's both funny and frightening in his attitude. And then there's Slim Pickens as Major Kong whose most defining moment was when he took a ride on that bomb as if he was on a bull in a rodeo! I also was highly amused by Keenan Wynn's role as Colonel Bat Guano especially his line about the Coca-Coca company to Mandrake. And while there was nothing funny about James Earl Jones-in his film debut role-as one of Kong's men on the plane, I did think how amusing it was that his voice would later become the one that became Darth Vader on the Star Wars series. Of course, the accidental possible start of a nuclear war was-and still is-nothing to laugh at. But the way many of these characters talk and react to the possibility of it happening is hilarious in the way some think it's no big deal while others do think so but in the way they think of as celebratory. Stanley Kubrick gave plenty worth to laugh about while also making you think just how dangerous some people in power can get. So on that note, Dr. Strangelove...still can make one think while also still be quite entertaining. P.S. One of the writers, Terry Southern, was later on the staff of ""Saturday Night Live"" during the 1981-82 season and wrote a sketch about Dr. Strangelove (Tim Kazurinsky there) conferring with President Reagan (Joe Piscopo's voice since the entire sketch was presented on his point of view shot) on the same thing Sellers' Strangelove did to Muffley here.

The stark overhead lighting and low-level camera angles aptly illustrated the combined myopia of the military, scientific, and political communities, with all three represented by the versatile Peter Sellers in a characteristic triple performance. The supporting roles are no less memorable: George C. Scott as Air Force hawk Buck Turgidson; Sterling Hayden as General Jack D.

Considering its subject matter -- world annihilation -- this is pretty risky stuff, considering it was made at a time when the Cold War was no laughing matter and at anytime someone could decide it was time to see if those pesky missiles would work. It shot Stanley Kubrick to the position of a Director as God, and from then on, his sporadic work would produce masterpiece after masterpiece. DR. STRANGELOVE: OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB is a fantastically cold, ironic, and masculine movie, but it's precisely this kind of detached, deadpan humor that makes it so outrageous. There are few moments that can't be considered iconic in cinema history -- truly, Peter Seller's ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room! "" quote has gone down in history as one of the most absurd lines ever uttered, but his own little rendition as Dr. Stangelove, which hearkens to the mad scientist in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS who can't seem to control his cybernetic arm is comic genius at its most bizarre. However, Slim Pickens has the best exit scene in the entire film in a scene anyone familiar with Chuck Workman's VISIONS OF LIGHT or countless film montages detailing key moments in cinema in the Twentieth Century: his riding the bomb into destruction (that brings forth the end of the world as Vera Lynn sings ""We'll Meet Again"") is the stuff that nearly fifty years later has not been equaled.",

Everyone's always raving about Peter Sellers; yes, he's very funny also, but in my opinion Scott is the best of the entire cast and manages to evoke more laughs than anyone else. He's also the one whose actions are responsible for the film's best line, and most famous. (I'm not even going to mention it again!) Stanley Kubrick's war classic still holds up to this day thanks to its hugely clever script and absurdly prescient aspects of warfare and politics. This movie still holds up over 40 years later and that's saying quite a lot, especially in a day and age when most people look back on films from the 1960s and frown because they were largely known for being optimistic, colorized and starring clean-cut wholesome leading stars who don't recognize a world outside their own sickeningly sweet borders.",

As an inside joke Kubrick started his own production company and named it Hawk Films! Peter Sellers, our star or should I say three of our stars tonight. After serving in the Royal Air-Force in WWII he was only able to get a job in radio when after several failed auditions, when he struck upon the idea of calling a BBC producer, posing as one of the network's top actors. So Sellers gave Sellers an enthusiastic recommendation, and he got the job on the Goon Show! In 1964, his best year, he appeared in this film, THE WORLD OF HARRY ORIENT, THE PINK PANTHER & A SHOT IN THE DARK (a sequel to the Pink Panther.) Sellers was paid 1 million dollars to make DR. STRANGELOVE which was more than half of the films budget, he plays Group Captain Lionel Mandrake / President Merkin Muffley / Dr. Strangelove. Sellers actually improvised much of his dialogue as he developed each character. Major King Kong was intended to be Sellers' fourth role, but he was uncertain about the cowboy accent. Slim Pickens, a character actor from westerns, was brought in by Kubrick, who reportedly didn't tell him the film was a comedy. Pickens' patriotic speeches to his crew (and his promises of promotion and medals) are counterpoint to the desperate American efforts to recall the flight. Pickens was never shown the script nor told it was a black comedy; ordered by Kubrick to play it straight, he played the role as if it were a serious drama - with amusing results. ""Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!"" ''Dr. Strangelove's'' humor is generated by a basic comic principle: People trying to be funny are never as funny as people trying to be serious and failing. The premiere of Strangelove was moved from November of 1963 after JFK was assassinated and one line of the film had to be re-dubbed when Slim Pickens says, ""Heck a fella could have a good time in Dallas ‚Äì you hear his voice say Vegas ‚Äì but his lips still say Dallas. George C. Scott was reputedly annoyed by the fact that Stanley Kubrick was pushing him into an overacting performance, even though his work on the film is now regarded as some of his best work on-screen. Although he vowed never to work with Kubrick again, Scott himself came to regard this as one of his favorite performances. Paying special attention to the tics and twitches, the grimaces and eyebrow arching, the sardonic smiles and gum-chewing¬Ö it's an amazing performance. Scott was an ex-marine, ex-fighter, big drinker, troublemaker so Kubrick invited him to play chess while the crew was setting up¬Ö Scott got beat every time and learned to respect Kubrick and his strategy. Sterling Hayden plays Gen. Jack D. Ripper. Kubrick asked for the War Room's giant round table to be covered with green felt, Kubrick wanted the actors to ""feel like they were playing high stakes poker."" The only female seen in the film Tracy Reed is the stepdaughter of director Carol Reed and cousin of actor Oliver Reed. She plays Scotts secretary and can also be seen as the centerfold in the Playboy magazine the crew is looking at on board the B-52. And if you look quick you'll see she's covered by a copy of a book titled, ""Foreign Affairs."" The original ending was supposed to be a huge pie fight but after they filmed it Kubrick admitted it did not work so another ending was made using actual pictures of above ground tests, no mushroom clouds were created by special effects. Just a note about the character names used in the film (Ambassador de Sadesky, Col. Bat Guano, Premier Kissoff, Lt. Lothar Zogg) almost all of them have a double meaning and sexual connotation. Even the opening and closing shots of this film have sexual over tones, but what the heck we are all adults here and we know if we ever allow WWIII to happen we are all¬Ö (fill in the blank!) Kubrick made what is arguably the best political satire of the century, a film that pulled the rug out from under the Cold War by arguing that if a ''nuclear deterrent'' destroys all life on Earth, it is hard to say exactly what it has deterred.",

As movie keeps going it amplifies its impact and keep bringing more and more tense with questioning of what is going to happen and is there really treat such as Doomsday weapon. Creating some of very uncomfortable scenes that tend to bring just pure laugh with their seriousness. Towards the end Dr. Strangelove keeps to be in the center of attention as he delivers his ideas about what could happen and what to do with his serious determination but at the same time so comedic and physical movement and trouble with his arm. Also constant shifts towards Fuhrer are so funny so you can't help but laugh when such thing happens. Yet another brilliant movie by Stanley Kubrick that brings us happiness. 4/4",

The opening ape sequence of 2001 is too long and the ending is too ""enigmatic"" for me. Full Metal Jacket is a film of two halves, the first being far more interesting than the second.

The army is forced to storm the base, and Ripper commits suicide, taking the recall codes with him. Mandrake manages to decipher the code from the General's papers. Unfortunately, one of the planes is damaged in the attack, and fails to respond. The Soviet Premier, Pistoff, tells Muffley that Russia has recently installed a Doomsday Machine, which will automatically set off all the atom bombs in the world if the Soviet Union is attacked. The bomb is dropped with an American cowboy riding it all the way down and mankind comes to an inglorious end. This is black comedy of the finest kind.",
144,22 January 2021,RonellSowes,10, Superb Film. Hilarious Yet Terrifying,"Dr Strangelove is without question one of the funniest films ever but if you ever stop to truly observe it, its terrifying.
There's been many very talented filmmakers who have made some very good films but there's something different about Dr Strangelove. You can't help but think that the mind that conceived and crafted this is a true genius. And Stanley Kubrick was one of the few who really was that overused word,genius. Whatever impact this film has now fifty five years later in a different era, is a fraction of what it had in the midst of The Cold War in 1964. And only Kubrick could make a film that satirizes the situation the way Dr Strangelove does.
The way he assessed the state of it all, is that the animosity and fear is created by the military leaders while those under them and politicians,including the president,are just influenced pawns of their craze. It's not even really the fault of one side but more of the same people who exist on both sides. And as a Brit, Kubrick saw himself and the rest of the world as tentative bystanders to these maniacs on the verge of ending the world. This is what Mandrake represents. He,the only non American or Russian,is also the only sane mind who is actually trying to stop what might happen like a reasonable adult. Of course on the flip side there are Generals Jack D Ripper and Turgidson who seem to look forward to nuclear war. The Russian ambassador is no better and the President is helplessly caught in the middle.
Slim Pickens is riotous, George C Scott is terrific in his role and Sterling Hayden steals every scene he's in but its Peter Sellers who really makes this film what it is. He plays not one but three extremely dissimilar roles and all equally convincing and hilarious(particularly the peculiar Dr Strangelove).
There isn't really one character in this film that isn't a cartoon of a human being and they are all aptly titled. Possesing names like Jack D Ripper, Kong and Bat Guano. However, they might leave you questioning how farcical they really are?",

Let's jump right in and go for condition red, that's a jolly good idea for a start, don't you think? Make yourself at home in the war room, where a poster makes it perfectly clear that ""peace is our profession""! Here, take some gum! You might have guessed it already: If you want your humor black and apocalyptic, you've found the right movie. The doomsday machine is waiting for its cue, as some madmen got something up their sleeve. Well, admittedly, there's a wee bit of inconvenience with that whole affair, because somehow the legendary red button actually already got pushed, and it's only a matter of time until... But don't you worry - the two presidents are talking it out! However, should the world - against all odds - still stand after everything is said and done someone might get in trouble with the Coca-Cola company. Alternatively, look in your survival kit to find three lipsticks and some pairs of nylon stockings. That should help! Apparently there's no genre Kubrick couldn't do. Be it sci-fi, horror, war movie, epic, historical drama or political satire with this one - Kubrick's perfectionism leaves no doubt that he's master of his domain.

In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb.

With ""Dr. Strangelove"" it never seems to take itself really unseriously. Does it at times get unrealistic? Yes, but compared to most comedies this gets very subtle. The dialogue is simply amazing. In fact I think that if I called it that this movie has the best dialogue ever in a film I wouldn't get a lot if any backlash. The characters after seeing them one time I already feel like I have seen them a million times how memorable the characters are.

185,22 October 2015,tjgoalie13,9," A Hilarious, Biting Satire of the Cold War","Out of one of the most tense times in U.S. history came one of the more crude and witty satires on the U.S. approach and policies. The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of America. In the mid 1960's, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of Vietnam. Looking at that maybe it's best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it's time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits. The film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn't lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it's easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it. As was mentioned earlier the film's cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick's opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn't shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries. Irony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading ""Peace is our Profession"", or Slim Picken's talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film ""Gentlemen you can't fight here, this is the war room."" All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated. Coming at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting. Considering the opinions of culture towards the military, and other satirized organizations, it seems obvious that Dr. Strangelove was drastically ahead of it's time.",
186,17 September 2020,godfreecharlie,9, Hilarious Nightmare,"Nuclear war is a deadly serious game. Near total lethality. Man made cosmic catastrophe. Worse than a cosmic apocalypse; the event that keeps on giving long after everyone is gone.
Kubrik eased the tension with his take on senseless annihilation, using realistic scenarios that most Americans would recognize thru the many PSAs and newsreel boasts of American prowess. The characters K cast were spot on, giving a comfortable realism that didn't cause consternation, wondering why so and so was chosen etc. Whether so and so was the first choice is no issue here, his final decision was the right one.
All that rolled up with the plot made for a film that is so much more in a multitude of ways. Viewing Strangelove at least 2, no, 3 times is my recommendation. Sellers' dominance is not in the least bit distracting. He was a master of his profession. The other cast members are made for their parts.
This honesty is what keeps one thinking ""what if this really happened?"" all the while laughing incessantly at the absurdity.

During my third time watching it, I concentrated on counting the actual funny parts of the movie.  There's less than 20 instances in the entire movie where there's a conscious effort to be funny, and I'm counting instances of dry, backhanded humor as well (such as the president's straight-man deadpans and absurdities of calling the president on a pay phone).",

I wasn't grown enough at the time of the Kargil aggression to understand the implications of two nuclear armed neighbours going for all out war.

The casting in this film was of course a huge part of its success, with a special mention to the GREAT Peter Sellers for his triple performance. Along side ""Barry Lyndon"" this is undoubtedly one of Kubrick's most committed films, denouncing the stupidity and uselessness of the war between the two blocs, and criticizing the nuclear cataclysm.

It's shot in stark black & white and I still don't find the idea of nuclear war very funny.

However, not much is required to get an overview of the theme for those not knowing much about the crisis aka Me.",
198,22 March 2014,robert-temple-1,10, The most acerbic and hilarious satirical film of its time,"If only Stanley Kubrick were alive today, he would be making a satirical film like this about the surveillance society and the paranoia about 'terror'. In the sixties, however, the prevailing paranoia was about 'the bomb'. This earlier culture of fear was certainly heightened by the 1961 showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis. (Those of us who were alive then vividly remember how everyone was certain 'we are all about to die'.) In this brilliant film, Kubrick relentlessly and savagely exposes the madness of the system, the leaders, and the philosophy behind the doctrine appropriately known as MAD (abbreviation of 'Mutually Assured Destruction'), whereby if anyone is destroyed, all must be destroyed, the hope being that no one would be crazy enough to start it. But in this film, the world had not reckoned on General Jack Ripper, played by Sterling Hayden, drinker of grain alcohol and rain-water cocktails, obsessed by his 'precious bodily fluids' (how all we young people laughed at that when this film came out!) who did 'not avoid women' but 'I deny them my essence' (i.e. that particular bodily fluid most sought after by prospective mothers). Hayden who commits suicide during the action, has decided to wage nuclear war unilaterally on the Soviet Union with his wing of 34 B-52 bombers at Bortosdale (i.e. really Barksdale AFB in Louisiana, where the B-52s were really based) Air Force Base. (I once spent two fascinating weeks there watching those elegant birds take off: their wings dip when resting, then rise to horizontal on the runway, and curl upwards as they soar like birds. They rest overnight with their bomb-bay doors open for purposes of ventilation, but when I once thought I might try a naughty peek, I was warned that if I stuck my head up there it would be chopped off, as they are set to sever any intruder.) The film opens with an aerial scene of a B-52 being refuelled in mid-air by a K.C.135 tanker plane. (I was once inside one of those; you lie flat on your stomach on a kind of bed, looking out through a window, to feed the tube into the bomber below and behind you.) Kubrick, who was sex-mad, lovingly dwelled on the copulatory symbolism of this aerial mating dance. Inside the plane piloted by actor Slim Pickens which is sent to bomb Russia, Pickens is sitting in the cockpit reading PLAYBOY and looking at the centre-fold. Stanley was so obsessed by pornography that he had to have batches of fresh hard-core porn photos daily, so this scene came to his mind naturally enough. I knew Stanley fairly well for a couple of years, and whereas he was certainly a genius, he was a deeply psychologically disturbed one. I was especially nervous of his passion for collecting Nazi insignia and daggers, strange, considering that he was a Jew. However, I only met him after he had already made this film. Wally Veevers did such a good job on the special effects for STRANGELOVE that he was put in charge of those for 2001, where he excelled himself even further. (Wally and his team were a wonderful group of guys.) Of course, this film is also famous for featuring no less than three brilliant performances by Peter Sellers. He plays Group-Captain Mandrake of the RAF, the President of the United States, and Dr. Strangelove, who is one of the fanatical Nazi scientists imported to the USA under Project Paperclip and other such projects at the end of the War. (Considering that some of those very scientists worked for Stanley on 2001, his earlier ridicule of them was rather ironical.) If there is anyone by now who does not know about Operation Paperclip, I would be surprised, and I would merely point out to them that Werner von Braun was an Obersturmbahnfuehrer (Major) in the SS who tormented Jewish slave labourers at Peenemunde, and so go work that out along with its implications! Stanley was clever to choose some of his favourite B-film stars for this film, such as noir actor Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Keenan Wynn, all of whom are positively brilliant. The script, dialogue, and scenes are so hysterically funny and hilarious that if this were not also a serious film about the destruction of the world by nuclear warfare, it would rank as one of the greatest screen comedies of all time, which perhaps it does anyway. (After all, if 'we are all gonna die', then you sure gotta die laughing.) The film is based upon the novel 'Red Alert' (aka 'Two Hours to Doom') by Peter George (writing as Peter Bryant), who collaborated on the screenplay with Kubrick and Terry Southern. Peter George (1926-1966, dying aged 42) also contributed to Sidney Lumet's film FAIL-SAFE (1964) about a similar theme. I know nothing about Peter George or why he died so young, but maybe the 'Russkies' got him, or even SAC (the Strategic Air Command under General Le May) was taking revenge. Just joking. Or possibly the American Nazis brought over by Allen Dulles did not like being made fun of. (Hitler may have loved his dog, but who ever heard him laugh?) This film is certainly unlike any other, as was its director. I have seen this classic several times, but each time it becomes both funnier and more horrifying simultaneously. Perhaps it is even more relevant now than it was then, not because 'the bomb' is still our major preoccupation, but because of the mentalities portrayed, which are even more dangerous now than they were back then, when the worst that could happen to us was that 'we will all die', whereas now, it is what happens before then that is even more terrifying.",

One may dismiss such a scenario as mere literary hyperbole, but sadly, such characters do exist. When the president learns that his authority has been circumvented, he is powerless to do anything about it, revealing that the presidency itself is a sham and that there is no way to prevent a cataclysmic catastrophe. All the safeguards are revealed to be mere window dressing that are meant to lull the public into believing that a disaster could never happen.

On one level the movie is an exact depiction of a nuclear bomber on its way to attack the Soviet Union. On another level it's a satire of cold war politics.

207,30 October 2006,gtjgw,10, A mad general sets in motion a plan to incite nuclear war due to the monstrously conceived Communist plot known only to himself as 'fluoridation',"It is a mark of quality that this film is perhaps as relevant today as it was when it was made. Even more remarkable that it has such power at all considering how silly it comes across, yet there is surely no other film that gets its message to the viewer in quite such a brilliant way. It is the fact that the characters are portrayed as so stupid that makes the message so powerful, alongside the pessimistic ending of the film. Peter Sellars proves what an exceptional actor he was by playing his various roles with aplomb. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden back Sellars up with similarly impressive creations who last long in the memory. As for the late legend Stanley Kubrick, this - closely followed by Full Metal Jacket - is his true masterpiece. There is most certainly no other film like it and to attempt to make a film with such serious issues and film it as a farce is obviously a difficult thing to do successfully. Finally, every person in the world should see this film because it has the simple but effective message that politics of fear is a bad thing for the world, a message that still needs to made today, perhaps more than ever.",

As Turgidson debriefs the President, some of the best scenes of the film are shot in this one room- the War Room and let's be perfectly clear, there's no fighting in the war room. Turgidson informs the President that Gen. Jack Ripper has complete control and has shut off all communications to the base and the secret code, that only he knows, that can get in contact with the planes pilots have no contact with anyone. So, the President has no way of stopping the planes from dropping the bomb because Ripper has shut off all communications- sounds like some of the stories you hear from the 60s. This leads to a great, one-sided, phone call to the head of Soviet Premier, Dmitri, that might leave younger audiences thinking this is some kind of impersonation of President George Bush, but it's not. Peter Sellers best performance of the three roles comes as the President. The scenes between Scott and Sellers are both electric and very funny that hit on all six cylinders. President Muffley informs Dmitri that he's very sorry that 34 planes are on their way to drop a bomb that will ruin the entire civilization in the USSR, so he orders his own plans to be shot down and assists in the attack giving it the okay. Turgidson disagrees with the idea and would love to wipe out the entire Communist regime, but US policy is not to Nuke first. We Nuke second. It's only proper. ""I'm sorry, too, Dmitri... I'm very sorry... *All right*, you're sorrier than I am, but I am as sorry as well... I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri! Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are... So we're both sorry, all right?... All right."" President Muffley sounds very sorry. Quite panicked as well (Not really, which makes it all the more funnier).",
229,15 February 2012,Rockwell_Cronenberg,8, Satire done right.,"The best satires are ones that aren't done with a tongue in cheek or a wink in an eye, but rather with full sincerity all the way. Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a prime example of how to make a satire the proper way. There aren't any quick nods to the audience to let them know that the film is in on the joke, or cheap low-brow comedic moments to let everyone feel safe in accepting that this is a straight comedy. No, instead the film takes itself just as seriously as Citizen Kane and it's that blunt honesty that makes it so hilarious.",
230,6 February 2017,PartialMovieViewer,10, Uniquely Funny and Quite Scary,"Unique as unique can be. This is probably one of the funniest movies with tons of thought provoking luggage. As I begin, one phrase comes to mind ‚Äì they just don't make movies like they used to. For one thing, the cost of entertainment hubris is astronomical these days, and there is no way you could see this much star-power in one flick. This astounding cast is spearheaded by the sheer brilliance of Peter Sellers playing three key roles (including the 'evil' Dr. Strangelove); we also have; George C. Scott, playing the unstable General Turgidson; Sterling Hayden steps in as the nutty Jack D. Ripper, and Keenan Wynn as the frightening and somewhat dense Col. Bat Guano. All of these characters are playing a dangerous ping- pong game trying to control the flight-path of Col. Slim Pickens' fully armed B 52. End-result of all these shenanigans is either a safe and quiet earth....or poof. This movie pays real homage to Kubrick's brilliance ‚Äì ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a concoction of sidesplitting humor, white-knuckled fear, and the very believable stupidity of the government - all this delivered on a platter of excellent acting and outstanding direction. The story's concept is pure genius. This fable should is amazingly funny, but at the same time it more than hints at a much scarier truth. The story centers around a cat-and-mouse game between powerful entities controlling the destiny of American Bombers. One minute they are sent to attack the U.S.S.R.; the next they are recalled and the next they sent back out. Eventually all strings are pulled beyond the breaking point and momentum takes over. Saddest and scariest of all - are that all the evil doers identified in the movie, the worst-of-the-worst is the government's love of red-tape. Who knows? I would think more so now than ever. I really enjoyed this old movie, and highly recommend it to everyone¬Öespecially toe-scuffing politicians.",

Earlier I posted a review of his 1960 film, Spartacus which I generally liked, but did not love. Spartacus was a mainstream, straightforward film that he adapted from a novel. For this movie, it is an entirely different story. I loved every single bit of the black comedy which was written by Kubrick himself (which he adapted from the Peter George novel). This is actually one of the best films to come out in the last fifty years. It was a timely movie (for 1964's audience), and it remains hilarious for the duration of the film even though Kubrick told his actors to play it straight. It was the talent of Kubrick that turned this film into a film he wanted, a quirky black comedy.",

""Dr Strangelove"",like many a Kubrick movie,is merely an overstatement of the bloody obvious.It is clothed with the trappings of the satire boom which was reaching its peak at the time,Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce in the U.S.,""Private Eye"" and ""Beyond the Fringe"" here in the U.K. In the persona of Dr. Strangelove himself,Mr P.Sellers gives one of the worst performances ever seen in a so - called"" serious "" movie.This is closely followed by George C.Scott and Sterling Hayden in a tie for runner - up.

Kubrick puts on a tragic satire on the Cold War, showing us the anti communism and the foolish paranoid of the militaries, especially Buck Turgidson (played by a restless George C. Scott) and Jack D. Ripper (which sounds as Jack The Ripper, the famous English serial killer), which Sterling Hayden plays with great intensity. In his face is impressed all the hate and the rage of a stupid man, who became paranoid. Then, there is the wonderful performance by Peter Sellers, which plays the reasonable Captain Mandrake, the stupid and impotent President Muffey and the terrific Doctor Strangelove, a man on a wheelchair with a hand rebel to the rest of the body and who, at the end of the movie, jumps on with the right hand up revealing his Nazist origin.

248,20 January 2015,panchodh_12,9, A Cold War gem,"This movie hilariously depicts how absurd the Cold War was. Especially in the early 60s, when this movie was made and the world was so close to Nuclear War, it was almost as if people actually wanted it. Some just for the sake of the show, or curiosity of how it would actually look like, and some because they had actually suffered all the brainwashing that came with the Cold War. I think that what's best achieved in this movie is how hilarious yet realistic the whole situation is. I mean, had someone actually sent those poor boys in nuclear planes to drop a nuclear bomb in real life, I bet their reaction wouldn't have looked much different. And it's funny because we've all consumed the imagery of war full of heroes ready to die for their Motherland or an Idea, while in reality it's just made of flesh and bones people, more similar to the ones in this movie. That's what makes this movie so great: it deconstructs all the social meaning charged into the ideas of Superpowers, Nation, War. In the end, it's just people. Mention apart deserves the great acting in that good ol' American accent of the 50s and 60s, which makes the script even funnier. Sellers, Scott and Hayden pull of amazing performances the three of them, specially Dr. Strangelove's amazing role. I only realized that Mandrake, the President and Strangelove where the same actor when reading the cast, and it makes Peter Seller's performance even more praiseworthy.",

They completely believe in everything that happens. That is why this film is so brilliant. Kubrick understands perfectly the message he wants to send, and places the exact amount of irony into it. I love the way the men on the base respond to the invading troops. ""Those Ruskies are really good. Those look exactly like our tanks."" I love the glee with which Gen. Turgison talks about launching a preemptive strike. ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks."" I love the way President Muffley talks on the phone with Premier Dimtri. ""I'm sorry, too, Dmitri...

Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are... So we're both sorry, all right?... All right.""

It takes accurate looks at war and society's reaction to war with the common Kubrick theme of dehumanization. The only difference here is that Kubrick is playing us for laughs. That is what makes this one Kubrick's most accessible masterpiece. His observations still remain both insightful and relevant today and Sellers' multiple performances only grow in power with age.

What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it).

256,1 September 1999,Dr.Mike,10, POE: Purity of Essence,"Dr. Strangelove is purity of cinema.  Contrary to popular opinion, Kubrick never made a bad film, and this is one of his best.  The performances are certainly the best that he ever got from his actors, The photography is typically brillant, and the script is better than some of his others.  The film has so many layers that one viewing simply isn't enough.  It is about the Cold War.  It is about masculinity.  It is about insecurity.  It is about insanity.  And in the end, I think it may even be about hope.  Sure, Kubrick points his camera at his subjects as objectively as possible, but I believe that his films always have some element of hope in them.  In this film, the hope comes from the song over the closing montage of destruction. Even if we destroy each other, the human spirit will continue on.  Kubrick's obvious hatred for the military is never given a better display than here, and his attacks on research scientists should not be ignored either.  We must all remember that a system that man has set up must still be run by man.  When good sense vacates a system, the system will fail.  This pattern happens over and over in his films, and Strangelove is no exception.  The military is a rational set-up, but if one part goes wrong, it can detroy the whole thing.  Of course, I think that Kubrick feels that the ""rational"" way the military is set up is a lie and that it is made that way so that men can forget that they are killing other humans, just like them.  In the end, all of Kubrick's films are fighting against inhumanity.  In fact, Kubrick's greatest legacy will be his humanism.",

I'll admit that the riding-the-bomb scene at the end was classic and iconic. But I did not find this movie funny. before i watched it, i was thinking: ""okay, it's a black comedy movie about nuclear war in the 60s. dark humor, but will be funny, based on all th people saying it's the best comedy ever."" I'm watching it, and just thinking: ""this is a serious war drama. This is not funny. "" George C. Scott was probably supposed to be funny, but I thought he was just mean. Peter Sellers did some great acting, but not comedic acting. There were definitely some really good moments, but most of the film was trash. It was NOT FUNNY!!! What I'm saying is, it is a terrible comedy, and an average movie. Kubrick's other films were masterpieces, but this was below the bar. Monty Python is funny. Mel Brooks movies are funny. Airplane! is funny. Now THAT'S a real disaster comedy! Overall, this film is mediocre at best, and i think it has not aged well. This may have been edgy and even funny in the 60's, but I think everyone giving this a super positive review is just jumping on the critic bandwagon that apparently thinks this movie is a classic comedy.

It's so easy to mock the '50s that one can hardly be too amused by the jokes. Also, while the image of the cowboy pilot riding the bomb has become a cultural icon, it's pretty stupid when you think about it and it's so predictable when you watch the movie that it can really be all that funny.

The senior scientific personnel employed by the US government are responsible for the development of high-tech nuclear weapons for the Cold War and a series of related attack and defense systems. A German American. A paralyzed man in a shadow, in a wheelchair. A person with abnormal movements wearing black leather gloves on his right hand. A remnant of Nazis mixed in with the US government. A man controlled by a demon. Yes demon. Just as Chadayev was not a mind, but a spirit, a spirit controlled by demons. The Nazis, the Communist Party, the Soviets, the American spirit, capitalism, and patriotism are all demons. They promote a kind of hatred, weak meat and strong food, the hatred of the fittest. A kind of hatred preached in the name of worshiping power. They call it love. Patriotic and loving leader Yunyun. Therefore, the country must be strong, engage in a nuclear race, and overwhelm the enemy. Leaders want to create God, omnipotence, perfection, all words are truth.
An impotent arrogant, an over-trained pilot (a nuclear war hero? What does a cowboy hat imply?), A nuclear bomb hidden in an underground mine after the surface of the earth was enveloped by nuclear radiation The contested American general, a powerless American president stuck in a quagmire, a national regime that has developed a machine that destroys the world. In the film, everything that is absurd, ridiculous, and horrifying is the product of the demon being worshipped by humans.
Now that the Cold War is over, the Nazis are over, and the Soviet Union is disintegrating. So can we watch this movie in a more relaxed mood? I think it's unlikely. Because all the details shown in the film are still established.",

It's a comedy in many aspects, but perhaps more poignantly, it's funny in how aware it is in the perilous situation our world was in at that time. Nuclear war was the biggest looming threat. It was more likely then than it ever has been. By acknowledging the preposterous nature of a nuclear war, Dr. Strangelove allows itself enough breathing room to develop its farce of a screenplay.

292,1 May 2006,johno-21,9, Dark comedy from the Cold War,"When you think of the name Stanley Kubrick it conjures up a larger than life figure that few directors who have directed so few films have. A career of only 13 feature films, four in the 50's four in the 60's, two in the 70's, two in the 80's and only one in the 1990's before his death. It was the 1960's where in a span of four very different films, Sparticus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove and 2001 he forever established his legendary status. Four films that earned 15 Academy Award nominations including five wins, 10 Golden Globe nominations including two wins, and 13 BAFTA nominations including six wins. In Dr. Strangelove, he sets out to do an adaptation of the 1958 Peter George novel Red Alert but when he teamed with novelist and screenwriter Terry Southern it evolved into a satire. An irreverent, sarcastic, sardonic cold war satire filled with sexual innuendo and symbolism. A great cast with Peter Seller in three roles, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones in his film debut. Filmed in black and white by cinematographer Gilbert Taylor who had photographed A Hard Days Night and would go on to do such films as The Omen and Star Wars this film keeps your attention from beginning to end. Anthony Harvey is the film editor here who had worked on Kubrick's film Lolita and went on to be a director himself of such noteworthy films as The Lion in winter and They Might Be Giants. Ken Adam who did seven films in the James Bond series from Dr. No to Moonraker is the production designer. I've seen this film many times and have always been entertained. Interestingly this film and Fail-Safe both were put out in the same year by the same studio. The novel Fail-Safe by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler so closely resembled in premise Peter George's novel Red Alert that George sued Burdick and Wheeler and won an out of court plagiarism settlement. A flaw in this film is George's Red Alert was published in 1958 when the delivery of atomic bombs by B52s was fundamental to conducting nuclear warfare but by the time when Dr. Strangelove was made ICBMs launched from land and submarine was the primary way to conduct mutually assured warfare and B52s would be a 2nd strike facilitator. Look for great stage sets in this film. It's a great film with great pacing and direction and I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",

However, it is a very good war movie, which makes you think with its grim satire. This could have been made into a somewhat unoriginal war protest movie drama, but Kubrick and friends have put a spin on it--making it seem so unbelievably absurd, that it takes a global-thermonuclear holocaust and makes it seem light, which takes on an absurdity of it's own. And the final scene, where there is classical music amongst the destruction, is a last touch of political message.

Amidst the height of the Cold War and the assassination of American President John Kennedy only months before, Dr. Strangelove is an exaggerated view of the Cold War to see how ridiculous it could really be. America and the Soviet Union were really going to use all those nuclear weapons on each other?! That would destroy the whole world in one day! That's the point Kubrick wants to make. Kubrick always at the dark side of humans throughout his films. The cynic, satirical, and heartless humans that are always depicted in his movies. Even if they don't start like that (The Shining, Full Metal Jacket), the characters already have the potential to go berserk. That happens in Dr. Strangelove, which is a comedy. It doesn't matter what genre Kubrick covered, may it be drama, war, science fiction,or crime movies, Kubrick always got his message across.

I couldn't stop laughing for most of the film. I noticed with respect to the sound that the ""marching on"" song was played every time there was a scene with the plane that was to release the nuclear bomb. I thought that it was a good way of familiarizing the audience with the mood of the people in the plane. I found it highly ironic that all of these safety mechanisms were put into place in case the other country dropped a nuclear bomb, and yet they could not be deactivated under any circumstance. I guess the whole concept of a nuclear war is ironic in itself though. I thought that the acting was superb in the movie and I wouldn't have guessed that the same person played all three of those characters. What a feat. I couldn't get enough of Dr. Strangelove. I really liked the sequences of nuclear bomb explosions at the end of the film. I thought that was a nice piece of cinematography to add to the film. The film also made good use of parallel editing.

Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it).

But the show is stolen by Slim Pickens in the classic sowboy ride on the nuclear bomb as it crashes toward earth. And also by Sterling Hayden as the battle obsessed general gone off the deep end. George C. Scott also does his job well as the equally battle obsessed but sane general. So many classic lines and classic scenes. A great score. Young James Earl Jones in a bit part. My personal favorite scene in the movie is the trooper who is more worried about the Coca Cola Company then nuclear fallout. This movie is exteremly funny on such a dark topic.

Dr. Strangelove is simply revolutionary, witty, entertaining, funny as heck, and of course, with a powerful message underlying it all. Kubrick felt that so many of the absurdities of nuclear war (etc.) had to be left out in order to make the film a serious piece, but he also felt that they were necessary in order to get the full message across, so he decided to make the film a satire, unlike the book, which it is based off of.

The imagery and dialogue of this film drives home again and again that the reason nuclear weapons exist is that men are compensating for something. The damn film opens with a place refueling scene staged to look like coitus. The mad general who starts the war basically does so because of his own impotence. The most famous shot is a cowboy straddling a nuclear bomb like he's wielding an oversized phallus. Character names either sound like fantasies of hyper-masculinity (Buck Turgidson) or fear of a total lack thereof (Merkin Muffley, two words referencing female genitalia). The only woman seen briefly in the film is an over-the-top male fantasy, wriggling in a bikini and panting for a man's services. In short, this is toxic masculinity on parade - and the end result is the annihilation of humanity. We laugh and are aghast at the same time.",

Sellers delivers an absolute tour-de-force acting job in his triple role as bumbling US president Muffley, the stuffy-yet-courageous Col. Mandrake, and the lunatic genius Strangelove. And as with all great films, the supporting characters are just as strong, including George C.

It made watching this movie almost painful, like watching a comedian bomb on stage in front you. That said, it's a Kubrick film so it's pretty well put together. There is some starkly beautiful cinematography throughout, nicely done opening credits, a stunning set for the war room, and some interesting handheld camera work that seemed very far ahead of it's time to me. Most of the actors seemed like they were putting in a lot of work. I can't say anyone's performance really resonated with me, but I can respect the effort.

350,8 January 2000,LeCarre7,10," We've always talked about something going wrong with The Bomb...the Bomb, Dmitri, the Hydrogen Bomb!","First, let me begin my comment/review with a side-note(It's My comment, after all!).  I am currently 14 and am in junior high/middle school.  That means I'm in the ""target audience"" of the likes of ""American Pie""(I haven't seen this and I don't want to).  Now that I've said that, this is the funniest film ever conceived!  The plot?  General Jack Ripper (named after a serial killer of prostitutes) goes a little funny in the head and does a silly thing..he orders a wing of 34 planes to attack Russia.  Naturally the Premier is, err, upset.  His Executive Officer, Lionel Mandrake( I can't recall what this means now, but I know this is a double entendre!) is one of the few sane characters in this and the only man who can stop the bombers before the plaster Russia.  In the War Room, President Merkin Muffley tries the sort the mess out with Dmitri Kissof on the hot-line.  General Buck Turgison strongly believes that we should immediately conduct a full scale nuclear strike against Russia to cripple their defenses.  When Muffley declares that this is mass murder, Turgison replies ""I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, I am sayin that there will be no more than 10 to 20 million dead..tops..depending on the breaks!"".  The rest is a hilarious tour de farce as Mandrake, Muffley, The Russian Ambassador Alexei Da Sadeski, Kissof, The People's Central Air Defence Headquarters, and the rest of the world tries to stop the planes.  What makes this film so good? ""Austin Powers"" dealt with global destruction, right?  I'm too young to remember, but this film was made just after the Cuban Missile Crisis, when everyone was worried that the other side would do a silly thing and start a nuclear war.  The jokes are great.  I must say that the sight gags are witty, instead of tired slapstick.  For example, when Group Captain Mandrake is trying to put a call through to the Pentagon and demands that Colonel Guano shoot the lock off of a Coca-Cola machine and find some change, he replies ""That's private property"" and ""I'll get you your change but if you can't reach the President you'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola company!"". After he shoots the lock off with a bullet, soda splashes all over his face. There are several others I won't disclose.  The bomb ride with Major King is the most memorable moment in cinema history.  The film sticks true to its conviction: Nuclear war is absurd!.  I'm certain that today's filmmakers would have had the Doomsday Machine not go off.  Another plus is that acting is top notch.  If only Myers could act anything like Sellers I would have nominated Austin Powers to the AFI!  Did anybody notice that everyone was panicking except Major Kong and his boys who were just about to end civilization, who are eating sandwiches and reading Playboy?  The fact that Kong is wearing a ten gallon hat as he about to go into nuclear combat toe-to-toe  and is determined to bomb something if it's the last he literally does just makes a perfect film only better.(Spoiler?)  This is a film that has to be seen again and again if only for the ""We'll Meet Again"" as the world explodes!",

The befuddled U.S. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) meets with his advisers, where the Soviet Ambassador De Sadesky (Peter Bull) tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a ""Doomsday Machine"", destroying all plant and animal life on Earth. Also in the story is the story of the plane dropping a bomb, and bemused Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Sellers again) trying to help on the ground.

Don't get me wrong, I do of course understand people took offense to this. Mocking nuclear warfare in the middle of the Cold War is daring no matter how you look at it, and furthermore it creates a thoroughly bitter-sweet atmosphere only paralleled in Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"". But when it comes to the actual execution of the idea, the whole thing is sorta goodie two shoes by today's standards. Only Peter Sellers really manages to get in your face from time to time, and that's mainly because most of his material is improvised. The actual script seems pretty well thought-out and balanced, but the dialogues often just lack zest. Occasionally there's a decent one-liner in there (""There will be no fighting in the war room!""), but often the scenes just serve purely as exposition and go on way longer than they need to.

This time he plays three different characters (an R.A.F. officer, President Muffley and Doctor Stranglove). George C. Scott co-stars as a manic gum chewing general, Slim Pickens as the S.A.C. bomber pilot (playing the role as straight as an arrow) Sterling Hayden playing the crazed airbase commander Jack D. Ripper, and a early appearance from James Earl Jones as a bomber air man.",

Not really something we're not used to, but when it comes to attention to little details, such as two conflictingly subjected songs on the plane, it's quite clever of Stanley Kubrick. It might be the most sexual situations dropped into a war film, without becoming a Carry On film that was filmed at the same studio. I doubt Carry On has ever planned a film about nuclear bombs compared to space travel. Thank Peter Sellers for his experience from Goon Show? Overall, this film has some huge giggles, mainly involving some absurd situations. But even with the iconic and absurd shot of a pilot falling on a nuclear bomb, the drama therefore overshadows in a good way. Maybe the pie fight would have cheered up the drama, but that wasn't needed anyway.",

381,4 June 2009,druid333-2,10, Creme De La Kubrick,"Even some forty-five years after the release of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of cold war paranoia, ""Dr.Strangelove Or:How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb', it still to this day packs the same punch it packed in 1964. The screenplay (written by Kubrick,in collaboration with Terry Southern & Peter George)was adapted from the novel, 'Red Tide',that dealt with the possibility of an all out war with Russia. Kubrick, as usual takes many pot shots at the military (United States,as well as the British),as well as the ruling class that preside over the military (and even gets a few jabs at Russia,for good measure). A psychotic general,named General Jack D. Ripper,finally goes over the edge & calls for bombers flying over the Arctic Circle to drop a payload of atomic bombs on Russia. This triggers a catastrophic series of events. Kubrick has assembled a top notch cast to play out the various characters that pop up for the mayhem. The late, great Peter Sellers plays no less than three roles. Add the likes of George C. Scott,Sterling Hayden,Slim Pickens and even (a then unknown) James Earl Jones,as well as others,and you have yourself the basis for a sparkling cocktail of a political satire that will make you laugh,shudder,and finally think of our future. Originally released unrated in 1964,this film was eventually handed a GP rating in 1970, which was eventually changed to a PG rating for a rude word or two, some violent (but not graphic)content,some sexual humour & the potential disturbing consequences of nuclear war & it's aftermath.",
382,16 November 2012,hall895,8, It's the end of the world as we know it. And it's hilarious.,"At the height of the Cold War the fear of nuclear obliteration was quite real. If the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a nuclear war there would be no winners. Stanley Kubrick made a film about this impending doomsday. This was obviously a very serious issue so the film would have to be dark, dignified and grave. Or maybe it wouldn't. Instead it would be one of the most hilarious black comedies the world had ever seen. What to do when faced with the end of the world? Laugh.",
383,4 September 2007,rickhavoc1,10," Simply The Best Cold War Black Comedy, and Possibly The Best Black Comedy Period","This is another timeless movie that will never lose it's relevance. From the opening sequence of the titles superimposed on a film of a bomber and a tanker performing the unnatural act of midair refueling, (Ask any Air Force pilot how difficult, dangerous and frightening it actually is!), to the final sequence of atomic explosions, (both with totally appropriate music), this movie is a joy to watch over and over again. From the great character names with their sexual and scatological overtones, (for those who don't know these things, guano is the word for bird or bat droppings, and a merkin is a hairpiece for the pubic area), to the sets, the cinematography, the music, the lighting, and even the props, this is Kubrick at the top of his form. As far as the performances of the ENTIRE cast go, I'm not sure there're enough superlatives in the English language to do them justice. Peter Sellers playing three entirely different roles, (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove), and making it look effortless takes center stage, of course, but the supporting cast is just as strong. George C. Scott (General Buck Turgidson) shows that he's one of the most versatile actors who ever hit Hollywood and almost steals the show in the process. Sterling Hayden (Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper) plays the scariest psycho ever put on film with impeccable deadpan timing. Keenan Wynn (Col. ""Bat"" Guano) is also superb, as is Slim Pickens (Maj. T.J. ""King"" Kong). Let's not forget Peter Bull, (Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadesky), who put just the right amount of wacky paranoia into his part. Even the bit players, Tracy Reed (Miss Scott, Gen. Turgidson's sexy, seductive secretary and mistress and the sole female), James Earl Jones (Bombadier Lieut. Lothar Zogg) in his first movie, and Shane Rimmer (Co-Pilot Capt. ""Ace"" Owens) add to the unique flavor of this masterpiece. So, for $1,800,000.00 plus Stanley Kubrick, the world got: Some of the funniest lines of dialog ever put in a movie, including words like ""prevert"" and phrases like ""Precious bodily fluids"", ""Now you listen to me, Colonel Bat Guano, if that is your real name!"", ""If you try any preversions in there, I'll blow your head off."", ""Gee, I wish we had one of them Doomsday Machines, Stainsey."", ""Well, I've been to one world fair, a picnic, and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I ever heard come over a set of earphones."", "" Of course it isn't only physical. I deeply respect you as a human being. Someday I'm gonna make you Mrs. Buck Turgidson. Listen, you go back to sleep. Bucky'll be back there just as soon as he can. All right? Listen, sug', don't forget to say your prayers."" and the immortal ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"". All of this and more? Priceless! Also images like Maj. Kong going over the contents of the survival kit and ending it by saying, ""Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff!"", Gen. Turgidson describing a B-52 flying at treetop level, with great body language, the Soviet Ambassador attempting to photograph the War Room with a spy camera, Col. ""Bat"" Guano shooting the Coca Cola vending machine and getting Coke sprayed in his face, and Dr Strangelove's ""alien hand"" alternately trying to strangle him and shooting up in a Nazi salute. All this and more? Again, priceless! And last but not least, Maj. Kong riding the H-bomb down like a bronco, waving his cowboy hat and shouting, ""Aaaaaa hoooo! Waaaaa hooooo!"". One more time, absolutely PRICELESS!! If you haven't seen this movie, or don't have it in your collection, go out and buy it RIGHT NOW! If you do own it, watch it again TONIGHT!",

Kubrick's black humour in Dr Strangelove was the joke needed to break the ice of the cold war ‚Äì and despite its specific subject matter in this respect, his tendency to subvert conflict with comedy is universally appreciable. Dr Strangelove has the effect of La Grande Illusion, The War Game and Nuit et Brouillard rolled into one and injected with an infectious and hilarious absurdity. It is completely unique and the quintessential cold-war-era-HUAC satire. Probably my favourite film of all time.",

Not only is it absolutely brilliant in terms of comedy alone, but it communicates something through its precise satire that most comedies wouldn't dare to contemplate. I am sure that many who saw the film in its first release completely missed its rather negative undertones regarding U.S. policy - and, in fact, it has enough pure entertainment value to be worth seeing anyway.  Yet Kubrick's work is filled with innuendo and subtle insults that may bypass the viewer initally, but once they are noticed are undoubtable.",

This movie is the best ever, it manages to take a topic is black as nuclear war, and make it hilariously satirical. It takes satire, and combines it with some all out silliness. It captures the characters (although quite exagerated) perfectly, and makes you think that these people were really experiencing a cold war.",
403,4 September 2014,Seraphion,6, Nuclear deterrent in the hands of madmen,"The movie does depict a scary story of the old Cold War era fear of nuclear doomsday and the subsequent stalemate of the nuclear deterrence between the two superpowers. I really like how the movie shows the subtle but crazy scenes right after it builds up the suspense of imminent nuclear or retaliation threat. The phone dialog, or should I say monologue, between the two presidents are just a sheer twisted laughable scenes. Like most Kubrick movies, this movie also leaves the audience with quite an incomplete movie, having them wondering about the continuance of the story after the movie's abrupt ending. The acting is just nice because most of the actors can successfully depict the madness under stress of nuclear threat and also the crazy funny scenes.",
404,9 November 2001,dan-292,3, Overrated does not even begin...,"Why this film is so popular is beyond me, first and foremost because it is not really funny (yes the no fighting in the war room remains a great gag as does riding the bomb, but the rest of it....) the satire is about as subtle as an oil tanker and to be honest misfires. The camera work is average, acting average, but the use of music is good. Ultimately it is a film locked into time and place - and that is quite damning enough.",
405,6 August 2002,stephenksmith,10, one of the greatest black comedies of all-time,"Dr. Strangelove is one of the greatest black(and white) comedies of all time.  It explores with humor and spine-chilling grace: will mankind survive its own madness? or are our collective flaws so great that we will wink out in an evolutionary instant?  But these questions are explored in a farcical, dark work that, I suspect, will live for quite a long time in film history. Terry Southern's dark vision mixed with Shakesperean bawdiness of Peter Sellers et al makes for fascinating and delicious humor.  Although this was produced at the height of the cold war, what makes this work of art a timeless classic is that it transcends its immediate theme and prompts in us in our time to view our collective madness.  Do we depend too much on our technology and think-tank rationalizations to propell us in directions we would never go as a rational individuals.  Do we rationalize to life shibboleths that will propel us into immolation?  What a movie that asks these questions of us, ourselves, and at the same time entertains us, makes us gut-laugh and cry at the on-screen farce.  Wow.  Shakespeare and B-52's. Crazed generals with phallic cigars stickying jauntily out of mouth. Pentegon brass calling on secure phones to their paramours.  And Peter Sellars.  This is a tour d'farce for him.  His multiple portrayals of the president, a British miilitary attache and Dr. Strangelove are comic masterpieces.  This is a movie for the ages.  If you haven't seen it, bring your brain and your tears, for you'll laugh and cry as your intellect is entertained, and that's really sho-biz, folks.",

408,11 November 2014,ofpsmith,10, The darkest dark comedy of them all.,"What is a dark comedy? I would describe it as a movie that deals with a dark subject and looks at it in such a humorous way. The Coen Brothers are known for this for their works like Raising Arizona, and Fargo. But my favorite dark comedy is this one. Stanley Kubrick takes the darkest idea imaginable and turns it into something hilarious. A paranoid USAF officer named General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) launches a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union just for fun. Meanwhile in the war room President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) frantically tries to stop Ripper's attack. Also in the war room are the inane USAF chief of staff General Buck Turgidson and the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (also played by Sellers). Merkin is just trying to keep this whole thing under control but the first telephone conversations with the Russian Premier show that he really has no urgency yet. Turgidson is incredibly hyper and energy filled. Instead of viewing Ripper's attack as a horrible mistake and trying to fix it, he actually offers Merkin strategy on how to strike again. He was actually based on real life Air Force General Curtis Lemay and if you read as much Air Force history as I do, you'll know that Lemay was known for doing things like this. Dr. Strangelove actually get's very little screen time but when he's on screen he absolutely steals the show. This is one of the very few times where Kubrick left one of his actors to improvise because he pretty much knew what Sellers could do. All the actors do a fantastic job so if you like dark comedies (and by that I mean really dark) you have got to see this movie. It is amazing.",
409,29 October 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6, Good entertainment and sadly still relevant over half a century later,"""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is a co-production between the United States and United Kingdom from 1964 that is mostly in the English language. There are only very brief inclusions of Russian on one or two occasions, but the English-language original with German subtitles did not even have subs for these, so it is not really meant for you to understand the Russian language, just sit there as cluelessly basically as the rest of the gang. This is comfortably in the imdb top250, right now at position 68, which means it will stay in there for many, many years to come, hopefully not until the point when the same happens to us what happens to the characters in this movie in the end. It is a very long title, but not a long film as it makes it past the 1.5-hour mark, but still stays under 100 minutes. The title is also interesting for other reasons namely because the word ""or"" in the sense of a clean cut and basically two titles in one is something you really don't see too often with movies. Not back then over half a century ago, not nowadays. This is of course a movie by Stanley Kubrick, who directed this one and also co-wrote the script. Kubrick is considered by many one of the greatest if not the greatest filmmaker ever and many also consider this his best movie, so you understand what that means, even if he has quite a few works to pick from. Admittedly, I am not a huge fan of him, but still there is no denying his films are worth the watch. Kubrick was only 35 approximately when he shot this one, but still in terms of film quantity, half of his career was already over at that point because he was much more prolific in his earlier years than in the later decades of his life and career. Peter George is one of the other two writers and as he committed suicide not long after this one sadly, there is not much more to his body of work. Terry Southern had a longer and more successful career and this film is not the only one from him that resulted in an Oscar nomination.",

This is the greatest movie ever made, which happens to be a comedy. I don't consider this statement to be that bold. Let's face it, Stanley Kubrick was the greatest director of all-time. Why wouldn't his defining masterpiece be considered the greatest film ever? Moreover, Peter Sellers, one of the greatest actors of all-time, gives his greatest performance/performances. Three characters, each unique and each unbelievably funny. George C. Scott, the great dramatic actor, makes you laugh as hard as you can. Add to this, the great Sterling Hayden, preaching about the evils of communism and the greatness of a nuclear holocaust. However, when describing the greatness of this film, you have to take into account it's historical importance. This was a film about a nuclear war between two superpowers, which seemed on the verge of real nuclear war. Moreover, it was released right after the assassination of JFK. With so much negativity and impending doom everywhere, Kubrick goes and makes a film that makes people laugh at it all. Imagine that, seeing a film in the most tense moment of the cold war, that deals with the entire world blowing up, and you leave the theater laughing? That my friend, is Kubrick and that is why he was the greatest.",

414,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,10, The darkest comedy ever,"One of the worst things to ever happen to Hollywood was the end of the Cold War, and looking back at a movie like Dr. Strangelove reminds us of the fearful, sober, overall silliness that was the tensions between the Soviets and the Americans. During the 40 years or so that the two super powers threatened each other's destruction, movies had always exploited the fears of the movie-goer to create suspense that often was ""too real."" Dr. Strangelove is the darkest of the black comedies about the Cold War, and the source of the humor comes from how real it is. Examine one of the classic scenes from the movie. What would be the first words between the American President and the Soviet Premier when nuclear war is about to start? Thanks to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, we have an answer that looks ridiculous, but may be as real as anything else in movies. Or look at the George C. Scott character. As the head of the Air Force, he gleefully announces that an all out attack on the Soviets would only result in the ""death of 10-20 million civilians, depending on the breaks"", of course. There are a few weaknesses to the movie in the way of time issues (is it 3 am or 3 pm?), but those are only minor quibbles. This may be my favorite movie, a comedy about the end of the world. We are able to laugh at the circumstances that lead to the end of civilization, which also scares the hell out of us. What if these are the people running our country, with their finger on the button? Even now, with the Cold War over, this movie resonates with the viewer, showing us how silly the competition was in the Cole War (By the end of the movie, there's concern over a ""Mine Shaft Gap"") and how the leaders who controlled the fate of a planet may not have been the right men for the job.",

The characters of the movie were certainly the most satirical aspect. Peter Sellers does a great job portraying different political archetypes, such as a helpless leader, as well as a technology crazed ""mad scientist"". The General was a strong analogy for the eager-to-fight leader who wants nothing more than to see the fun toys the military has at its disposal to be put to use. The film came from a time in which society was caused a great deal of distress due to the significant potential for have government officials acting as recklessly as they do in Dr. Strangelove. The film was a satirical wake up call to the world that the current course of travel leads to one logical conclusion: the end of the world.",

I strongly believe that this is Kubrick's magnum opus. The method of presentation itself is a socio-political message, but I won't elaborate any further to avoid the risk of spoiling it. A large part of the movie's genius is how it manages to function superficially as a comedy, an extremely dark satire albeit, but a comedy nevertheless. It also works quite effortlessly as a drama once you scratch beneath the surface; and finally, as a whole it is a masterfully orchestrated period piece, tiered with humor, humankind's gravitas to tragedy, and existential philosophy. It's brilliance is in its stratum, never mind the all star cast performances, writing, score and directing. ",

This is Kubrick's best film (and that is saying a lot).  It's hilarious, insightful, and terrifying.  Peter Sellers is at his best (in three different roles).  George C. Scott is perfect.  Sterling Hayden is very good in a fascinating role.  Slim Pickens is nothing short or hilarious.  The screenplay is one of the best ever written.  I have seen it countless times and it seems to get better....",

The movie is chaotic, STUPID, all the characters drove me NUTS, the funny stuff was not funny at all, no, thats not true, the only funny part was the dialogue between the two leaders of america and russia, the rest was LAME!!! Sorry, dont waste your time or money by ever renting this movie... YUCK!!",
434,19 September 2009,johnmschofield,10, This is one film where I laugh virtually all the way through,"This is one of my favourite films. It is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made. All of the main characters are perfectly cast and Peter Sellers was at his breathtaking best. I very rarely single out anybody in any film but I make an exception in his case. He died almost thirty years ago at the age of 54 and apparently making this film with all the numerous professionals was extremely difficult for the director because there were times when the entire cast and crew were helpless with laughter because of him. When you watch this film you can understand why. Virtually all of the main characters are absurd mentally challenged individuals who really should not be let out in public on their own. Of course it is part of the films appeal that you keep being introduced to them and you laugh at their square peg in a round hole antics but at the same time you marvel at how complete basket cases can rise through the ranks and occupy positions of real responsibility. Forty five years after this film was made things have not changed much, this film is still as good today as it was then and in reality we are still as scared now as we were then. The lunatics are still running the asylums and the fact that so far we have not had a nuclear war is down to the probability that if there was, nobody would survive anyway and considering what the earth would be like after the bombs have dropped who would want to survive. This film is only just over an hour and a half long but it packs in so much in that time it seems to be a lot longer. I don't watch this film as often as I should but when I do I am reminded of the tale which as far as I am aware actually happened that in the late 1970's there was a serious alert in the USA which went to the last but one level before being stood down caused by one man who thought he saw something hostile approaching on his computer equipment and hurriedly pressed the button to start the USA's reaction. Real life is infinitely more unbelievable and frightening than any film which is why I would highly recommend anybody watch this film. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",

438,11 March 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,10," The best comedy ever, perhaps one of the best movies ever","This is the second Stanley Kubrick film I watched, the first being Full Metal Jacket. And I loved it. It combines an excellent script with excellent direction and on top of that you get brilliant performances. This movie is funny, but its much funnier if you know cold war terms and have extreme knowledge of the cold war. I think that this and Death To Smoochy are the two best comedies ever made and both are dark comedies too, although I'm sure this is going to spark quite a bit of controversy. This movie was nominated for four academy awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. It didn't win any, the first three went to My Fair Lady and I'm not sure about screenplay. But it deserved each one. Peter Sellers is excellent here, he plays the three characters very well. George S. Scott and Sterling Hayden also turn in noteworthy performances as two generals. The entire situation has a lot to do with todays impending war on Iraq so some people may find this not funny at all. The subject is rather scary but the presentation is excellent and funny.

442,6 July 2008,johnnie0168,10, Fasten your seat belts,"I had the unusual experience during the mid sixties of seeing this movie and 'a hard days night' as a double feature, which were common in those days. What was less common was to see two outstanding movies in one setting. That night I became a Beatles fan as well as a Stanley Kubrick fan. I had never seen a movie quite like 'Dr Strangelove' before or since. This was style AND substance and a whole lot more. It was one of those rare cinema experiences that pulls you right into the story. You are THERE in the cockpit of that B52 making that unauthorized bombing run over the Soviet Union and you are THERE riding that bomb out into cold empty space with Slim Pickens. (who was, by the way, a highly unlikely but equally highly effective choice for that role). Kubrick had a storytelling style unique to himself and no other director with the possible exception of Elia Kazan. One device that comes to mind is, not only his use of the right music to fit the scene but his use of stony silence to fit other scenes. A silence that imparted a sense of awesome distance and space - a device that was to be used a few years later in '2001: a Space Odyssey', another Kubrick classic. This is not a 'happily ever after' ending and may be disturbing to some but fits very well with the uniqueness of the story - and the man.",

It is a superb satire, brilliantly funny and filled with some spectacular performances. Peter Sellers' three performances are a masterclass in acting. From the wonderfully English Group Captain Mandrake to President Merkin Muffley and, not to mention, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers produces characters who will remain timeless. George C. Scott's performance, which he viewed not to be his own, is outstanding. It is tribute to Kubrick's spectacular direction that he was able to get such a performance out of one of his actors. And what of Kubrick's direction. Incredible. It is flawless. He manages to maintain a good comic script, which deals with a sensitive subject, without causing offense. Other than this, a superb supporting cast, a brilliant screenplay and the war room lead this film into the halls of the great.",
444,28 April 2023,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!","Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb (1964)' is a satirical farce about the consequences of a war-minded army general's decision to start an increasingly unstoppable chain of events destined to cause nothing but catastrophe. It's a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, albeit one comprised mostly of polite yet tense conversation. With an excellent cast that includes a chameleonic Peter Sellars, a cigar-chewing Sterling Hayden, an accent-chewing Slim Pickens and the bevy of enthusiastic expressions that is George C. Scott, the piece moves along at a bouncy pace with a purposefully light atmosphere that contrasts heavily with the darkness at its core. It's a farce, for sure, but it continues ratcheting up its genuine tension right until its explosive finale. It isn't laugh-out-loud funny, but its humour works well to keep you engaged with what may otherwise have been dry dialogue. It also takes some of the sting out of the genuinely alarming situation the piece depicts, even if its satire is still scathing and it isn't afraid to take things to a dark place. The conflict at the story's core is unfortunately as relevant today as it was at the time of the film's release. The film is easier to appreciate than it is to enjoy, and it isn't as gripping as you'd perhaps expect. Its humour is very dry and is sometimes perhaps too subtle for its own good, too. However, the performances are all spot on and the plot is relatively engaging throughout. It's a good effort overall.",
445,13 April 2019,mdarrenu,9, Very good but,I just watched part of it again today (April 2019) and actually realized that there is a fundamental flaw in the plot of the script compared to the reality of the last 30 years. It is not the general that are crazy and want to make war - it is the politicians. I like intellectual material but I have never found this movie very gripping or perhaps its satire like much of sellers is too broad for me. I appreciate his work - but I always find him a bit flat. I can't rate it less than a 9 - or I will lose credibility. But overall the movie still doesn't hit me as much as it does other people.,
446,1 July 2005,metalrox_2000,10, One of the greatest movies ever filmed,"Originally begun as a drama, Stanley Kubriak smartly followed his instincts after a screening, and turned the movie into a comedy. Without a doubt one of the most important, and funniest films ever made. George C. Scott is over the top as the crazed Turgenson, who's character was Dan Ackroyd's inspiration for the admiral in the movie Spies Like Us. Petter Sellers almost walks away with the movie, playing more roles in one movie then some actors do in their entire career. SOme of the signs posted at the various army camps are ungodly funny, as there is always something you'll catch for the first time, no matter how many times you've seen the movie (and i've managed to wear out both a VHS and DVD copy of the movie) Only a genius could have a army general named Jack D. Ripper. One of my personal favorite scenes comes when Sellers as Mutley is trying to call Sellers as the president when a stone faced soldier appears. Mutley finally gets the soldier to agree to let him make the phone call. To get change, they are force to break into the nearby coke machine, and in a drawl, rather semi-serious tone the soldier replies ""If you don't get the president on the phone, you're going to have to answer to the coca-cola company."" Perhaps one of the most memorable scenes comes at the end, with Slim Pickins riding the bomb towards the ground. As he screams yee-haw, the bomb hits, and we are treated to the song happy trail as explosions happen all over the screen. This infamous scene has been replayed many times, most notably during an episode of the Simpsons. Another bit a trivia, Pinkins would ape one of his own scenes in this movie in the movie 1941, when he is captured, and taken aboard a Japanese Sub. 40 years old, and still as funny today as it must have been then. it will still be funny when the movie is 140 years old",
447,4 March 2013,lasttimeisaw,8, Dr. Strangelove,"According to Morrissey's recent manifestation ""more gay people, more peaceful the world"", war is the malicious ramification of heterosexual men's urge to kill their peers (I'm paraphrasing here), which tallies germanely with this Kubrick's black war satire. Under the cold war backdrop, a rogue nuclear attack to Soviet Union commenced by a fervid anti- communist USA general, which would (irrevocably) launch a doomsday machine (a Soviet Union's ultimate self-destructive nuclear contraption), and would annihilate all the human beings on the earth. It may sounds ridiculous and far-fetched by the mass, Kubrick's masterful endeavor has overcome the detached accessibility of the warfare lingoes and the exclusivity of the decision-makers' political impasse to implement a stranger-than-fiction satire which grants a considerable closeness to its audience with ease.

449,1 January 2007,muhon-nin,10, The best satire every made!!!,"The smooth, cool, and funny way that Kubrick made a real issue feel. the fact that it had enough seriousness to provide a deep and emotionally layered story, bouncing back and forth from character to character till Maj. ""King"" Kong rides the bomb. Other movies like ""Fail Safe"", directed by Sydney Lummet, basically had the same message, but it didn't have the cool feel that Dr. Strangelove supplied. This movie should have won at the Oscars. Kubrick should have been noticed as the great director he is, and Peter Sellers should have won for playing THREE roles!!

The parody of the cold war and the supposed ""doomsday device"" pokes fun at a serious issue in global politics at the time, yet manages to steer clear of actually criticizing the idea of nuclear warfare.  The main characters, Jack Ripper(the psychotic general infatuated with preserving precious bodily fluids), Chief of Staff Ingridsen(a crazed politician afraid of ""commies""), and Dr. Strangelove(an insane nuclear scientist with interesting ideas about man's future), are all crucial in turning this interesting story into a memorable film event.

457,29 May 2020,cagedavid,8, Great film that still remains relevant,"Despite being in black and white and made in 1964 this remains a great film.
The cinematography is excellent especially of the bombers in mid air and the opening shot of refuelling is quire mesmerising.
It's classed as a comedy and there are scenes which are fairly funny though it's really a story of how things can go wrong with human ""error"" and lead to a nuclear bombing of Russia.
The main scenes are relatively few :-
The air base where a unhinged official plans to beat the safeguards and send a bomber on a mission to drop its nuclear bomb
The inside of the bomber with the crew receiving the shock command to drop the bomb
The presidents operational centre with the top level officials contacting the Russian leader ( Dimitry)
Peter Sellers plays three parts - An English soldier at the air base , the US president and Dr Strangelove - the obligatory mad scientist. Sellers is excellent in two roles but I thought the comedy of his wheelchaired Dr Strangelove was not particularly funny and fell somewhat flat ( otherwise I would have given it 9.0 )
It's a film that is entertaining and quite addictive to watch the build up of events - just the last 15 minutes with Sellers antics let's it down a little.
Well worth watching",

Not so with Dr. Strangelove, in fact it seems to get better with repeated viewings. Released during the peak years of the Cold War, Strangelove tackled a doomsday scenario and made us laugh at it.  Peter Sellers, comic genius, plays three different parts, all perfectly.  Co-stars Slim Pickens, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are all superb as well.  At 93 minutes, the film moves quickly and leaves practically no filler.  Even though we aren't battling the Russians anymore, the scenario could be applied to our world's current condition.

462,27 May 2002,don_the_bomb,1, What a load of BS,"From the opening credits, I could tell that this movie was going to be a low budget piece of crap. It's so bad, they have to use the same, robotic actor for three uninventive, one-dimensional characters. Had he focused his efforts into one role, albeit one that this no-talent hack could handle, he might have been able to stumble through the film without drawing too much attention to his ineptitude. However, because he is forced into three roles, his completely uninspired 'acting' takes this movie down a notch from 'utter trash' to the realm of 'camp'. The completely unfunny dialogue gives a whole new meaning to the word 'boring'. The rest of the actors are just as bad as that three-role guy. Thank goodness they aren't tripling up on their duties as well. If, by chance, you can actually pull off sitting through this tripe, you'll wonder where the last couple of hours of your life went, and you'll wish you had done something more productive, like monitoring the growth rate of your lawn. The only funny moment comes in an ironic twist, when the man rides the bomb. It would seem that the entire crew of this film was riding a bomb the whole time. Don't let over-zealous pretentious wannabe eggheads and intellectuals convince you that this film is at all worthwhile. These people are intellectual midgets who think they can come off as intelligent by praising a film that in all respects should be disregarded. In all my years of watching and appreciating films, I have never come across such a worthless, putrid, vile, unintelligent, unfunny waste of celluloid as this. There are no redeeming values whatsoever. The only smile that will cross your lips is the one that comes when you can finally breathe a sigh of relief as the end credits role. I leave this film behind as one would leave behind excreta. What in God's name were they thinking when they made this film? That is a question that we should all ponder until the end of existence.",

One of the top ten best movies I have ever seen. I'm not Kubricks biggest fan, but for this one, he deserves all the praise he gets. Seemed to start a little slow, but stick with it. It gets more and more outrageous as the film progresses until you are mired in insanity.

And justly celebrated, because this is a very funny movie, quite aside from being a disturbingly plausible story. What it isn't so good at is maintaining an air of tension: as the countdown to nuclear oblivion takes place, it's hard to really believe in the story unfolding as anything more than a set-up for the gags, and of course the special effects are predictably rubbish by modern standards. It's arguable this is a good thing, forcing the writers to rely on their script. One particular point struck me: just how much the paranoid general reminded me of the tea-partiers in modern day America. But perhaps it's just a mark of top-class satire that it retains a feeling of pertinence, even when the mood of the times has superficially changed.",

Adapting a cold war thriller to the big screen, he increasingly started to see the funny side in it and the result is Dr Strangelove, the tense, dark- and utterly hysterical- story of a war room full of generals and politicians trying to stop a general from triggering nuclear war. As this is Kubrick, everything is meticulously crafted and nothing happens by accident. Despite his other dark and disturbing movies, Kubrick's comedy is one of the funniest films ever made. The laughs flow more slowly at first, before the floodgates open and once the film gets going it never slows down. Although it's a satire, part of the films ingenuity is that there's a unmistakable ring of truth and the laughter is often bitter. The screenplay is incredible; oozing with laughs and full of clever symbolism. It also has the best use of a cola cola machine in cinematic history.",

Dr. Strangelove is a perfect spoof of political and military insanity, beginning when General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a maniacal warrior obsessed with ""the purity of precious bodily fluids,"" mounts his singular campaign against Communism by ordering a squadron of B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviets counter the threat with a so- called ""Doomsday Device,"" and the world hangs in the balance while the U.S. president (Peter Sellers) engages in hilarious hot-line negotiations with his Soviet counterpart. Sellers also plays a British military attach√© and the mad bomb-maker Dr. Strangelove; George C. Scott is outrageously frantic as General Buck Turgidson, whose presidential advice consists mainly of panic and statistics about ""acceptable losses."" With dialog (""You can't fight here!

Peter Sellers gives a bravado performance as both the President and the President's National Security Advisor (loosely based on Henry Kissinger, however unfair that might have been). George C Scott captures the moronic attitude of the period proposed by the likes of General Westmoreland (the Vietnam Blood and Guts wannabe version of Patton).

I got to know every scene like the back of my hand. It got to a point where I was looking for a flaw, any glitch or lack of any sort. None. I later read that Coppola had also called it precisely 'flawless.' Kubrick became renowned as a perfectionist to a nutty degree. In The Shining, for instance, Jack Nicholson threatened to walk off the set after more than 150 takes on one scene. The camera-work was crack-of-the-whip smart, yet unobtrusive. Black and White, the movie comes across as chromium. I think it is the very best Peter Sellers, playing three roles superbly, all funny. George Scott, also never better, imitating a bomber is priceless. Sterling Hayden as the crazed General with the 'precious bodily fluids' obsession is amazingly reality-based considering the fanatical rightwing's focus on fluoride as one of hundreds of elements of the 'International Communist Conspiracy.'

Kubrick's vision of a world teetering on the brink of nuclear apocalypse is in every way a perfect film.  It captures the essence of a time, and yet it is not at all dated. It is as funny a film as you will ever watch, but at the same time its message is deadly serious.  The acting is uniformly brilliant, led by an incredible triple-threat performance by Peter Sellers.  While his characterization of the good doctor is most often pointed at, in my mind it is Sellers' portrayal of President Muffley which shows his true genius.  His flat, toneless, midwestern accent was a work of art, as was his ability to communicate  through non-verbal cues.  In addition, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden were never better than they were here.   But the special mention must go to Kubrick.  He took a huge risk with this movie - and turned it into a cultural touchstone. In watching this film, one is struck by the lack of ""jokes.""  Every image, from the ""copulating"" airplanes to the Nazi salute in the ""war room,"" was intended as a means to further the irony inherent in a comedy about the destruction of civilization.   I especially recommend this film to younger viewers, unfamiliar with the concept of ""duck and cover"" drills and back yard bomb shelters.  In this film can be found a valuable history lesson, as well as an object lesson in the art of unified filmaking.",

He managed to generate humour out of a disturbing scenario of a mentally unstable army officer starting a nuclear war without the knowledge of his superiors. Although personally I love 'Paths of Glory' much more than 'Dr. Strangelove', however this is the film where the quintessential Kubrickian style of direction and storytelling was born.

From Slim Pickens riding the bomb down to a nuclear orgasm to George C Scott's portrayal of a murderous, war-loving general who would love to kick start the Apocalypse so long as he can spend 100 years deep underground with many women ""with highly sexually stimulating natures"". And the piece de la resistance was Peter Sellers as Doctor Strangelove, President Merkin (a name for a pubic hair wig) Muffley and Royal Air Force officer Lionel Mandrake. His improv not only on Strangelove's lines but also in the dialogue from the infamous ""hotline"" scene where the president has to talk to a drunken Soviet Premier to warn him of a nuclear strike against the U.S.S.R. are just brilliant. The fact that this movie is EVEN fresher now than it was back in 1964 when it was released shows the film's power. As if it would be allowed back into the American public.

512,12 August 2002,leex1214,10," The greatest 'black' comedy, if not the greatest comedy ever","Peter Sellers was a comedic genius, pure and simple.  Although this term has been horribly overused in recent years, it is the only phrase that can aptly describe his wonderful abilities.  You would be hard-pressed to find a performance of his that did not reveal some subtle fact about the human condition, or a performance which did not simply overshadow every other actor in the film.  Dr. Strangelove was, I feel, Sellers' greatest achievement on screen, a performance for which any sane person would have given him an Oscar (but who said the Academy Awards made sense?).  All three of the characters he portrays are done to perfection, but the character of Dr. Strangelove, the crazed, former Nazi nuclear scientist that calls the President ""mein Fuhrer"" and has battles between the left and right sides of his body, will forever live in our collective conciousness. Aside from having the greatest performance of arguably the greatest film comedian of all time, this classic has a perfect supporting cast, from George C. Scott as the crazy Air Force general Buck ""I'm not saying we won't get our hair mussed"" Turgidson, to Sterling Hayden as general Jack Ripper that decides on his own that we have to annihilate all of the Russians to stop them from stealing and polluting our ""precious bodily fluids"", to finally Slim Pickens, the gung ho captain from Texas that wears a cowboy hat in combat and rides the bomb like a bronco (that moment is, I think, the greatest moment in the film, perhaps one of the greatest moments in film history).  Also, there is superb directing on the part of Stanley Kubrick, who after making this masterpiece, unfortunately, went over the deep end with 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. This mighty team of artists brought together a plot which is at the same time both poignantly tragic and completely hillarious (if only the 'comedians' out there could take a lesson from this film, Hollywood would be a far more cultural, sophisticated place).  The basic premise is nuclear annihilation: Ripper wants to annihilate the Russians, while the Russians have just completed a domesday machine that would automatically kill all life on Earth if any foreign power attacked Russia.

516,1 October 1999,Elizabeth-328,8, Stanley Kubrick's finest,"This movie is pretty cool.  I love the names of the men...they're so funny! My favorites are Major T. J. ""King"" Kong, General Jack D. Ripper, President Merkin Muffley, and, of course, Dr. Strangelove.  Peter Sellers is amazing at portraying three different characters.  I also think that George C. Scott is really, really good as General ""Buck"" Turgidson.  He says one of my favorite lines in the movie: ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops...depending on the breaks.""",

The movie is so well written that everything could be interpreted as a joke or fact.",
518,15 March 2005,trvpup,10, an absolute must,"Quite simply, this is the best film ever made on the potential absurdity of the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), which since the end of World War II has been the dominant mode of thinking of the world's foreign policy elite regarding nuclear strategy. As this film was made in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, it tried to make comic light of a very heavy handed topic, i.e. Namely, as the title suggests, defending against another nuclear power with second strike capabilities in the event of an ""accident."" In this case, the ""accident"" is that one paranoid high-ranking General decides the time to strike the Soviets is now before they can attain nuclear superiority over the U. S., which since JFK was entering a period of detente. For those who have studied international relations, military strategy, and the history of war, this film is filled with biting insight and clever humor. For those without such predilections, this is still one of the most humorous satires on the Cold Wat around. In fact, this film is so good I have been using it in my class for years. Check it out! By the way, Kubrick had high level clearance to interview the top brass of the military and civilian think tanks to make a serious movie about the dangers of nuclear war. That is why much of the footage of military technology, protocol and methods are authentic for its time frame. Unbeknownst to them at the time, Kubrick decided to make a satire instead. This explains why the armed forces forced Kubrick to make the disclaimer at the beginning of the film, distancing themselves from the content of the film. Perhaps he was a little ""too accurate""!",
519,17 November 1999,andrew7,10, 10/10 -- Perfect comic genius!,"You have to learn how to watch this movie..., or, at least, I did.  About twenty to thirty minutes in I realized the layers of humor present in the script and the performances.  The more you pay attention, the more you catch.  Whether it's an unobtrusive sight-gag which could easily slip by unnoticed, or a beautiful piece of ironic dialogue, theirs is a gold mine of material here that a casual viewer will just miss.  At the same time, there is present a level of comedy that cannot be escaped.  Viewing it carelessly will produce the idea that the film is a dark and serious film peppered with moments of bizarre physical comedy and the odd pratfall.  Watching more closely reveals that the film is much tighter and more consistent than it might first appear to be.",

Fear of an attack by nuclear weapons against the United States was at an all-time high. This is where the movie Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb begins. A paranoid general, Jack D. Ripper, has launched an all-out nuclear attack with each of the 34 planes from his Burpleson Air Force Base carrying on average a 40-megaton bomb. His reasoning behind this attack? ""The preservation of our precious bodily fluids."" Word of this attack gets to the President of the United States and his top military advisors, who immediately begins trying to convince the drunk Russian Premier over the phone that the attack would be stopped as soon as possible. However, the attack would be nearly impossible to stop because General Ripper is the only person who could and he wouldn't do it. Another problem was that if the U.S. bombed Russia, the Russians would set off the ""Doomsday Device,"" a weapon that if set off would destroy all of humanity.",
523,6 September 2005,nisitpav,10, The greatest comedy of all times,"Perhaps a comedy is made on purely extravagant levels. In making movies, and, evidently, watching them, I discovered that such pure emotions as: cry, laugh, fright, are quite easy to create. Comedies are made to make us laugh. Think of all the Billy Wilder comedies, like ""Some like it Hot"" and ""The Apartment"", great movies, with sharp, intelligent scripts and a stylish direction. But still, in a film like those, one laughs, but nothing more. There is no deep emotion, no symbolism, no major theme or thematology, and no thinking. In a sense, the only thing that makes us like those movies is the use of humor. Now, when it comes to Dr. Strangelove. What is it that elevates this film from all other comedies: it is not humor, it is wit. Never before have I watched a comedy where I am required to think as well. What I loved about this movie was the little details, the names, for example. Although I love 2001, ACO, Barry Lyndon and Paths of Glory, I think that DrS is the best Kubrick movie ever! Not only the brilliant, flawless script, of so many unexpected twists and turns, but the lovely satirical direction. Every aspect of this film has a humorous symbolic nature, such as the title sequence, with the two planes exchanging fluids. But one can't only view a film, and particularly this film, and like it as it is. One has to consider the time-frame in which it was made. In an era of desperation and general fear of a third world war, Kubrick dared to make fun of it all, reminding people to take it easy, and love the bomb.",

Then he went ahead and plugged it up with these great absurdities that make you laugh at it all. SPOILERS: Just picture Slim Pickens riding a nuclear bomb like a horse and yelling ""Yeeehaw!"" There's Strangelove who is a psychotic former Nazi who now works for the US government. He has dillusions of seeing ""die fuhrer"" and saluting him. Even more absurd is that Peter Sellers plays three parts! Don't ask me why, it's just Kubrick having more fun.

Perhaps this is one of the few movies that show us the true nature of mankind and its constant attempt to safeguard itself against total annihilation.  But then again, it may be an attempt to show us just how close to extinction mankind really is.  Kubrick's vision of war and the Cold War in particular allow the viewer to step into the War Room and experience, first hand, the horror and the comedy of battle.  He allows us to see the decay of the human spirit in the military and the joy of an end with the final ride of Slim Pickins. Typical Kubrick, the movie fails to give closure.  Following in the tradition of ""Full Metal Jacket,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" he lets us, the viewers, decide for ourselves what happens at the end.  The ending of the movie allows us to conclude what our imaginations will allow us to conclude. I know that this movie will continue to give its fans and its viewers hours of entertainment and joy.

553,2 February 2005,ACitizenCalledKane,9," A biting political satire, and a nightmarishly dark comedy!","Some times, the only way that we can cope with the horrors of the world we live in is to laugh in defiance of them. Stanley Kubrick looks directly into the eye of the Cold War; the paranoia, the fear, the tension, the politics of major world powers gone mad, with the fate of the entire world hanging in the balance, and he snickers! Kubrick accomplished the impossible in 1963...He made the world laugh at the nuclear bomb. He didn't do it by sugar-coating anything, in fact, he did the exact opposite, painting a pointedly dark and satirical portrait of the powers that be. This portrait, too accurate not to fear, yet too accurate not to laugh at hysterically, resembles a group of little boys comparing the quality of their toys. The insanity of The Cold War is exposed, almost to the point of violation. There are clowns deciding the fate of the world, and human lives are nothing more than statistics, yet through Kubrick's lens, we find humor in the tragedy! We see how ridiculous it all is. An army general manipulates a complex Cold War strategy in order to start a nuclear war with the Russians because he blames fluoridation for his impotence. It sounds preposterous, and it is, but anyone who follows politics knows that the crazier things appear, the more realistic they usually are. The manic performances of Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and even Sterling Haden's twisted Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper provide the life to this story, which speaks so often of an ultimate doom. Peter Sellers plays three parts - Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and the mad genius, Dr. Strangelove. The President is Sellers playing it straight, while Mandrake shows a little more of Sellers' eccentricity, but it is in Strangelove that he goes completely over the top. Speaking of over the top, George C. Scott gives an incredible energy to his roll as General ""Buck"" Turgidson. Scott later admitted that this was his own personal favorite performance. Slim Pickens basically plays himself as the gung-ho Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, who caps off the film in one of the most famous scenes in modern movie history. The satire is powerful, the humor dark, and the end result - remarkable. The detail that went into the War Room and the interior of the aircraft is amazing. The fact that Kubrick could produce a comedy as hysterical as Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is testimony to his far-reaching genius, and another example of the classics that have come together to form his legacy! A must-see!",

Bat Guano) to the red-phone scene (""I can be as sorry as you can, Dmitri""), to the depraved answer to the end of the world devised by Dr. Strangelove and accepted by the War Room crowd, the film is poignantly funny because the characters (who mirror common attitudes of the time and play it absolutely straight) have no idea how ridiculous they look.

555,9 June 2003,stamper,8, Strangelove: strange but I like it,"Dr. Strangelove is a political satire of the cold war between Russia and the United States of America, which was made in 1964. The fact that it was made during the Cold War and not after it makes this film not only very special, but also daring in my opinion. The film itself is full of top secret information, suspicions people and anti communist attitudes which somehow remind me of James Bond themes from the Cold War era. But contrary to James Bond films these things are exaggerated and turned slightly comic, without making this film too strange and surreal. This is due to the fact that not only the communist Ruskies are depicted in a bad way, but so are the Americans, who (in some cases) seem to be war hungry, patriotic rednecks with dung for brains. In all of the confusion that springs from the failing of a  failsafe plan, there is also one ingredient which could not be missed in any film concerned with the Cold War. I'm talking about the German ingredient, in this case Dr. Stragelove, a German scientist, who turned American after World War II. This character is in my opinion the greatest character of the entire film and he is one of the reasons this film is still good almost 40 years after it was first released. Just watch the last 10 minutes of the film and you will know what I mean. The ending of the film, from the first dropping bomb to Dr. Strangelove, is truly funny and in my opinion a classic moment in movie making . In a way though, the entire film is a classic moment in movie making, because ultimately the film and the mishaps depicted, are of all times and Kubrick realized it just as you will (just listen to the words in the final song played).",

However, I do firmly believe that nothing he ever produced ever bettered this 1964 (or maybe 1963 depending on which source you believe) offering.  Made during the height of the Cold War, with everyone fearing nuclear combat, this was certainly a daring project and one that could have met with harsh criticism, it is a comedy after all.  Thankfully, it is now regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and quite rightly so. The story is alarmingly plausible in a number of ways; General Jack D. Ripper (played with aplomb by Sterling Hayden) loses his mind and immediately orders a nuclear air strike against Russia.  He then proceeds to lock himself inside his military base and tells his soldiers - unaware of his mental deterioration - to kill anyone who approaches.  Locked inside with him is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (played by the awesome Peter Sellers), a nervous, unassuming chap who tries desperately to convince Ripper to give him the three letter code needed to recall the planes.",

Nevertheless, as a citizen of the former Soviet Republic, it was simply hilarious to watch an American movie (made during the pique of Cold War, which deserves additional applause to the crew) portraying that the situation and people's common belief was nearly the same even overseas: the belief that the ""enemy is near and is gonna kill all of us one way or another"". 
Jack Ripper reminded me so many acquaintances of mine who lived back in days!:D Impervious, harsh, brutal, passionately believing in his own truth and sort of a satiric character for all of the listed above. The only difference is that their favorite line was: ""It's all America again"", but in the movie you can watch the vice versa.
Great movie, yet, the question got me thinking: did both parties actually enjoy dropping another war using force and guns less than a couple of decades after the hell on Earth called WW2?
P.S. The fictional president of the US being the most sane character of the movie probably ""saved"" its reputation back in times IMHO:)

""Dr. Strangelove"" is not a film that glorifies America neither Russia. Is a film that satires both this countries and the ""ideology"" of war in general. Peter Sellers is doing one of the best performances of his whole carrier in his triple role in the film; As group captain Lionel Mandrake a British RAF exchange soldiers who has the bad luck of being locked in the same room with the maniac that launched the attack, as President of the United States Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove a former Nazi and now nuclear war expert. All three of this roles are presented excellent from one of the most talented actors ever. All of them are caricatures and are mocking the principles that each one represent. Also we have an amazing performance by George C. Scott in the role of General Buck Turgidson an aggressive and jingoist Chief of Staff. But this is not a movie which is only worthy for the performances. The topic is so modern even for today's standards that makes this film so accurate is almost scary. While it's a comedic film it is not funny. It's hilarious of course because of the characters and the amazing dialogue, but in the back of your mind you know that it's not the characters that you are laughing with but the human stupidity.

The story of Dr. Strangelove is a parody about the cold war and the nuclear missiles, or in this case the doomsday machine(!).

590,11 May 2015,cro75,10, Brilliance in Peter Sellers/Kubrick Collaboration,"DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB is a monumental achievement in both filmmaking and performance art. Stanley Kubrick, director of a canon of classic films, takes audiences to a dark place, both emotionally and physically, in the form of a dimly lit ""war room."" This was released at the height of the Cold War, as d√©tente was becoming more of a fantasy than reality. It is this, and the timing of the film's release, coupled with the black comedy Kubrick employs so seamlessly into near-tragic circumstances, that make this a watershed moment in film. The comedy here, as mentioned previously, is as dark a shade of black as you can find, but brilliantly executed due, in large part, to the performance(s) of Peter Sellers and George C. Scott. Peter Sellers was known as a British comedian, famous for his work in smaller British films, BBC Radio as a member of THE GOON SHOW, as well as LOLITA (1960), with Stanley Kubrick. This film not only introduced him to an international, Hollywood audience, but garnered him an Academy Award nomination for his work in playing three integral, central characters. (He is the only actor to ever accomplish this feat.) Amongst these characters include a by-the-book, but soon befuddled Royal Air Force officer, an Adlai Stevenson clone as President, and an ""uber maniacal"" former Nazi scientist after whom the film is named. His performances, measured alongside an uncharacteristically, but welcomely, zany George C. Scott, who plays the Curtis LeMay send-up as a Hawk-like, pugnacious Army officer very much in favor of bombing the Soviets, make the comedy land with force. This was also the film that introduced James Earl Jones to film audiences, as he helps to pilot a bomber, captained by General Kong (played hilariously by Slim Pickens, though only after Peter Sellers had to drop out of this fourth role due to an injury suffered while filming) that holds the very future of the world in its bomb compartment.",

The story tells us how totally out of control a military  situation can get in spite of all the official safeguards that may have been put into place. All it takes is one wacko with enough influence for  total chaos to be unleashed. Sellers is superb as the polite English officer dealing with the insane American superior officer. He is equally wonderful as the unflappable president of the USA. His rendition of Dr Strangelove with his relexive Nazi salute is also memorable. Slim Pickens as the obediant bomber aircraft commander is terrific. His dedication to follow orders is indeed, total. George C Scott is equally wonderful in his role as top military adviser to the president.

Perhaps a slight spoiler to give you the idea : at one point in the movie, we have two regiments of the US army fighting and killing each other. That, of course, isn't funny. But if you watch closely, you'll notice that during the whole sequence, you can see a panel in the back. it's an advertisement for the US Army stating 'Peace is our Business'.

The best part is all the the subtle jokes and scenes. It really makes it worth watching over and over. Oh yea, Dr Strangelove is one of the funniest characters there is.

Its portrayal of the Cold War, including of its paranoid facets and the absurdity of it is was makes it a film I that have and still want to see over and over. In short, it is the ultimate dark comedy: poking fun at the idea of nuclear armageddon and total annihilation. These two combustible ideas, armageddon and comedy, ignite in a way that skyrockets the film into cinema history. So what if it's dated and was shot in black-and-white!

Is the voices of a director that did understand in the past how we stopped to learn and love the bomb. this one is one of that movie that I am gonna bring with me when I will live on a desert island",

I can't imagine how controversial it must have been for the time, but like a political cartoon it has its time and relevance.

631,2 March 2005,ZombiesIntheSnow,10, Dr. Strangelove a Kubrick masterpiece,"One thing that always struck me great about Dr. Stranglove or: How i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. was its genuine humor about the U.S. air force and government! It blends ingenious comedic references with action and war. It also has hilarious war references to certain characters such as ""crout"" as a slang term for Nazi, or German. It's probably one of the best Kubrick films i've seen. I think he's one of the best directors in all time mainly because he can direct a good variety of movies (i.e. A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey.) Dr. Stranglove or: How i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is definitely in my opinion his greatest film. The acting is flawless and the characters are played really good (mad props to Peter Sellers, he rules at acting.)I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes GOOD movies. At first i was a little too eager to watch this movie (mostly because all my friends keep telling me it's so great) so i couldn't really concentrate but i eventually got sucked in, hehe. It's also one of those movies that you can watch over and over again without getting bored of it. Some people think it's flawed by the Black and White picture, but i couldn't see it any different then Black and White. Everybody should watch this at least once in their lifetime!",

It mixes black humour with contemporary issues like no other movie before it and since then, and has sustained the test of time by getting more hilarious and thought-provoking with each new viewing. This remains Stanley Kubrick's finest film. Particularly noteworthy as being the writer-director Kubrick's first and only venture into the comedic genre, Dr. Strangelove is one of the funniest films ever made.

634,12 August 2002,diorio2001,10, Our natural fluids!!! Best Movie out of the 1960's,"I can't begin to say enough GOOD things about this film! I love the whole black comedy genre (which are movies that place a comedic tone to a rather morbid premise). First of all, each of the actors does an amazing job of acting out their roles (with the exception of Slim Pickens, whose character can get down-right annoying), the performance of the ultra right-winged psychotic General Jack Ripper played by Sterling Hayden was Oscar-caliber, Peter Sellers does an exquisite job playing three different characters including the title character role of Dr. Strangelove and I was deliriously amused by the part played by George C Scott. Though it may seem a little taboo to poke fun at the notion of a nuclear holocaust brought forth by the Cold War, this film is a drop dead funny and entertaining compilation of great acting, a superb screenplay, excellent directing and a FABULOUS ending sequence. Some of the scenes in the fighter jet with Slim Pickens can lag and make you want to hit the ¬ëfast forward' button, but the highly entertaining scenes in the war room do more than make up for it. It's no wonder that this film was placed at #3 on the American Film Institutes 100 greatest comedies of all time. This is a must see for anyone studying film, or planning on being a movie critic. This movie is truly a classic and I could watch it another 16 times.",

Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams ""What if¬Ö"" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy.",

After watching this movie I started wondering this is how probably most of the war must have started ,some crazy guy wants to destroy everything because of some crazy ideology and conspiracy theory he believes in . One thing which makes me laugh is how Americans had this crazy theories about Soviet and their non belief in god (you can see the reference when he calls ambassador atheist ). If you observe the conversation going in the war room I noticed that except president everyone was happy that they are bombing soviet. I can totally see this kind of behaviors in today's society ,war mongers always thinking about destroying enemy state and destroying all human race. This movie is full of such example with humor.",

640,14 February 2007,evaray107,2, Mixed bag of awkward,"I thought this movie would be a dark comedy. Toward the end, however, it tends toward stupidity for no coherent reason. the film was SO close to being thoughtful & inventive that it was painful to see it botched. The almost-funny dialog goes on and on and on and on and on and on (see where I am going with this?), in a most boring manner, with no purpose whatsoever. So you are left wondering why you just had to sit through 10 minutes of nothing. Then action scenes cannot redeem the movie, because the actors are not believable. Slim Pickens in particular made me roll my eyes in annoyance. Maybe it was supposed to have been funny - The only funny thing is that I couldn't tell. George C. Scott may have acted the only well-played roll. Peter Sellers attempted to overly-differentiate his various roles, and his Dr. Strangelove is portrayed with the finesse of a burlesque show. I must rethink my opinion of Kubrick movies. This should have been a very good film, but it was NOT. It could have been worthy. But instead, it was painfully awkward.",

The message is that we can chase invisible Commies and arms gaps all we like, but in the end, annihilation awaits Capitalists and Commies alike. The absurdity of the arms race is shown with amazing clarity twice. First, when the Russian ambassador says that they built the Doomsday device to close the ""Doomsday Gap."" Second, in the end, we are shown that nothing was learned, as nothing is ever learned, and that there is still talk of beating the Russians in the Coal-Shaft-Race. The coal shafts, of course, represent a return to primitive living. We are shown that parinoia is universal, in all societies, in all civilizations. The level of living is irrelevant. I also see a lovely parallel between the Nazis hiding in their bunkers, during the last days of the Third Reich, and of the American Leaders' desire to hide out underground. This is of course emphasized by Dr. Strangelove's compulsions (calling the President ""Mein F√ºher"" and his uncontrolled right arm). Was the Cheyanne Mountain Complex built/known of when this movie was made? If not, then I see a great deal of irony there. Also, when was the incident when the return codes to the Strategic Air Command were not sent (see my note in the goofs section)? Talk about prophecy, once again, if it was after the movie was produced. Oh, and the link I mentioned (Camus, Beckett, and Kudrick) is that of absurdism.

643,14 February 2023,bolomark,2, How could anyone like this movie? Plot is Horrid.,"I really don't see how anyone could like this movie. The plot is horrible and the acting is even worse. The highlight of the movie was seeing footage of the B-52's flying. That's where the good ends. All in all it's about 8 minutes total. Watching a movie about a nuclear war should be interesting, instead, this is written and performed like a low budget porno and there's parts that are, a low budget porno. You have a psycho general, a sex addict general, his stupid bimbos, a supposed Nazi that now works for the US but has a phony accent and even worse dialog, and the list of this horrid trainwreck goes on. Let's start with the Nazi turned US Scientist, he's in a wheelchair, has a prosthetic arm that seems to be preprogramed to the Nazi Salute, has the worst excuse of a German accent I've ever heard and his dialog sounds about the same as a train colliding with a tanker truck with about the same outcome. Then you have the psychotic general, his acting is slightly better but his whole excuse of his actions is regarding fluorination of water as his excuse of nuking the world. Now, a common thread is that Fluorination was used by the Nazis and then Communist USSR as a tool for sterilization. As a result, he starts a Nuclear War with the USSR and as a result, well, it's all downhill from there. What's stupid about everyone else in the movie is that everyone could've stopped this easily enough by NOT listening to the clearly psycho general. DUH! I won't spoil this trainwreck of a movie anymore, for who knows, you might want to watch one of the worst movies of the century and kill a few braincells in the process and waste an hour and 35 minutes of your life.",

I get the feeling that most of Stanley Kubrick's films fall into this category.  I have seen most of Kubrick's films now and I really have to say I think they're not very good.  There are exceptions; 2001 and Lolita stand out as great films.  But the wife and I bought this one tonight and I really think this a pretty boring movie.  It has it's points, it has irony, it could probably even happen.  I think however, the acting sucked, the jokes were out of place and ill timed (and yes maybe a bit too subtle) and it has lost most of it's relevance today.

But, together with Kubrick's brilliant direction work, ""Dr. Strangelove"" doesn't supports only with the jokes. The cynical song by the end of the movie, some unforgettable scenes and the mix of fear and laughs makes of ""Strangelove"" a wonderful piece of art.

He chose to deal with subjects that other avoided, from pedophilia and incest in Lolita to violence and rape in A Clockwork Orange.  But perhaps his greatest work in regards to controversy would be his satirical take on nuclear war.  Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, is one of the poignant studies into the age old fetish humanity has with death.  It pokes fun at the absurdity of the matter and doesn't care who is offended in the process. Yet, what makes this movie even more incredible is the fact that it was released at a time when nuclear annihilation was a very real threat.  It caused uneasy laughter among the audience, as they contemplated that what was entertaining them today on screen might mean their death tomorrow. Only Kubrick could have pulled this one off.",

First of all the movie is hilarious, exciting and fun to watch because of the great directing of Stanley Kubrick wich is the greatest director of all time. The names of some of the characters were very funny like: President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Peter Sellers played three characters in the movie: Capt. Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove, they were all very funny but Dr. Strangelove was the funniest . The movie was black and white despite it is made in the year 1964 but I don't think the movie would have been better in color. But the thing that made the film so great was the scene when the guy fell down on a nuclear missile and landed on the soviet missile base in the end of the movie.",

If reading that a guy who handled nuclear weapons has a dark sense of humor disturbs you, you might want to stop now.
This is black comedy at its finest and the film equivalent of a page turner book. Like Blues Brothers, you're not sure you want to watch it again, but once you start it you can't stop-every scene is so compelling. Sellers's scene on the telephone (as the President with the Russian Premier) is as good as anything Bob Newhart ever did, and he was the master of the one-sided call.

Maybe if you are into really really dark old comedies you might enjoy it but otherwise stay away! The only funny character is General Buck and he is only mildly amusing. Terrible!

661,27 July 2012,nutolm,8, Laughing at war,"This movie is probably one of the most bizarre comedies of the time, but also one of the best in its genre. A kind of anti war movie; a satiric look at the cold war in the 50s and 60s between east and west. This movie is filled with tremendous actor performances, Peter Sellers stars in three of them - and does it best as the mysterious Dr. Strangelove. Sterling Hayden is excellent as the general who steps over the edge of insanity, and George C Scott is very funny in his role, even though he's not particularly known as a comedic actor. The great thing about this movie is the actors and their dialogues, and the plot is a stroke of genius from director Stanley Kubrick. And just look at the names of some characters - Bat Guano, TJ King Kong and Jack D Ripper, that alone gave me a big laugh. This is surely a great movie, although one thing was a disappointment, the special effects was very poor, even for its time - but overall, I enjoyed it.",
662,5 December 2002,cromagnet,5, Not up to my expectations,I like Peter Sellers in some of his movies. He looks like he really loves to act. This movie was boring and dated to me. I don't remember laughing once. Maybe I'm used to the hype of newer movies but then again I just watched Vertigo and loved it. The Dr. Strangelove character though very dated was played over-the-top in the end. This didn't come across as comedy anymore but rather goofy.

A stellar cast combined with silky black and white production, this film has so much going for it, it is hard to know where to begin. This is satire at its best. Each fully developed character is played with gusto, especially Peter Sellers who has no fewer than three roles. George C. Scott as General Buck Turgeson is also granted some terrific lines that he delivers with a almost child like awareness, completely oblivious of the import of what he is saying. The film switches between artfully crafted, beautiful composed cinematography and a rugged hand held documentary style. There are scenes in a b-52 bomber that are so realistic that you feel you are right in the airplane.

It is such a great satire about the intrinsic insanity of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.  The genius of the movie is that it is not overtly funny - it conveys the situation in a plausible way in the context of the story, bringing out the lunacy of our doomsday scenarios and MAD policy against the Soviet Union, and theirs against us: the definition of the Cold War.  I also thought that in this movie, and I have seen a lot of movies, I saw the best acting of any movie I have ever seen.  Everyone played their roles perfectly, and I'm not just saying that casually.  I personally think that acting is very easy and nothing to celebrate, but Stanley Kubrick really found the best actors he could for those parts - they really could not have been acted better.

But, I was young, an Air Force veteran, and full of the conservative claptrap. Having the many decades of time between then and now, I view the film as remarkable in its structure, forceful in its message and memorable in the performances. As the B-52 is on its way to the target, for example, the litany of the crew as they prepare for the strike left goosebumps as my earlier experience in military aircraft of the time was nearly identicle is substance and complexity. We were then living on the edge of nuclear annilhilation and viewing this film, even as a satire, shows that the supposed ""Balance of Power"" concept of the time was in fact a ""Balance of Terror"". If Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" was satire that energized the Irish to their plight, Dr. Stranglove was our energizing message. Surely, this is one of the best films of all time.",

Besides being a great director, he is a talent to reveal the best performances from his actors. In Dr. Strangelove I have seen one of the most outstanding performances from Peter Sellers, for it he should have been rewarded, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden. Telling a story about cold war, which is an outmoded  subject for now of course, in a satiric way along the detailed art direction and set decoration still attracts the attention and makes people laugh about it. His devotion to perfection and details, his exceptional directing and his sense of humor makes the film unforgettable.

Kubrick has so many movies that are much better than this, in many aspects. If it was not for Sellers, I probably would not have finished watching it.

His serious side is seen in his role as the RAF officer who tries unsuccessfully to weed out a needed three-digit combination to call back our B-52's.

707,6 June 2007,agedude,10, Smartest Movie Ever Written,"Just watched Strangelove again for the Umpteenth time and still get a kick out of it. The writing is so spot on about the paranoia of the cold war and the arms race. I spent a career in the US Air Force and the depiction of the B-52, the crew, and even BGen Jack D. Ripper are eerily correct. Buck Turgidson's comment on a preemptive strike on the Soviet Union was supposedly the same thing Gen Curtis LeMay said immediately following the Cuban Missile Crisis, ""attack now while their pants are down."" If you've never seen the movie ""Fail Safe"", also released in 1964, you must as a companion piece. Same plot, but serious with Henry Fonda as the President. What makes Strangelove so hilarious are the little bits of ironic truth throughout. A bomber crew survival kit with condoms, fluoridation as a commie plot, an underground survival bunker/mineshaft for the heads of government, the Soviet ambassador complaining about ""the arms race, the space race, and the peace race,"" Turgidson saying ""the big B-52 coming in so low, jet exhaust on the chickens."" If this movie didn't kick start the anti-nuclear movement, it sure gave it a hard push with the clutch in. Young viewers may find the movie boring and miss the subtlety, but do a little research on the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis and watch ""Fail Safe"" and the cartoon ""Duck and Cover"". Then keep in mind there was a time that not too long ago the U.S. kept a dozen or more B-52s in the air at all times and 100 or more on ground alert (airborne in 20 minutes or less) fully loaded with nuclear weapons. For those under 20 who still need a comparison, think President Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfield sitting in the war room and talking about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and why it was so important to go to war. The same pretzel logic used by our current administration is pretty much the same as President Merkin Muffley and his cabinet used in the Cold War 40+ years ago. The quote used at the beginning of the movie ""Crimson Tide"" said ""the three most powerful men in the world are the President of the U.S., the Soviet Premier, and a nuclear submarine captain.""

A crazed military general launches a nuclear bomb and no one else knows the password to stop it! If that bomb reaches the soviet union the world will self destruct. This is a very serious problem to the only three men who can stop the bomb and they are all played by the same man. Although the plot is very interesting, the froidian inuendos of the movie are quite disturbing. The crazed general is positive that the soviets are out to destroy the Americans by clorination. Then the general constantly smokes a cigar, while others smoke cigarettes. (Obviously obsessed with size) Then when a bomb is dropped a man is facing the camera with it inbetween his legs.

The film/book it is parodying, Fail Safe, is a good film in it's own right but has not stood the test of time in the way Dr. Strangelove has, despite its strong cast and script.

That the subconscious or even conscious reason for the existence of the competition of creating bombs more powerful than someone else's, is lost in the midst of so much politics. A comical example of this is the delivered line which prohibits the fighting in the war room. The way in which politics and international relations were represented was comically put. During a conversation between the Russian and American president, had the audience been ignorant of the speakers identities, an assumption could have been made that it was a conversation between husband and wife feuding. Dr. Strangelove is known for its immense amount of froid content, all throughout the film many references to this subject are portrayed by the dialogue of the actors and even minor things like the smoking of varied sized cigars. The purpose and manner in which this film portrayed its message was both subtle and bold. Even though at times lengthy and seemingly pointless dialogues were present, along with an excessive amount of sexual references, it was understood that this excess was what was desired and necessary to bring across its comical message of `international bomb envy.'",

729,29 May 2005,royu,8, Very tense.,"There lots of good news, but there is some bad news as well. Before I start raving on how brilliant Dr Strangelove is I'll get the bad news out of the way. Firstly, the characters are very stereotypical, embarrassingly so. Secondly, it tries to be a comedy, but it's not. The biggest criticism I have of this movie is that it could have been so much better if they dumped the stupid stereotypes that try and make a sitcom out of what is an extremely tense drama.",

Having said that the first few times I saw this film as a teen, I didn't appreciate the depth of this truly remarkable film.

Personally I feel Dr. Strangelove is a bit overrated. The movie has hardly 5-6 scenes were you can laugh or see through the sarcasm considering the fact that, that was the purpose of the movie.",
733,10 November 2021,michaelheiser-25099,7, Good satire film,"Good satire film. In the movie, Turgidson asks Mr. Staines, ""Strangelove? What kind of a name is that? That ain't no Kraut name, is it?"" Staines replies, ""He changed it when he became a citizen. It used to be Merkwurdichliebe."" Turgidson responds, ""Well, a Kraut by any other name, huh, Stainesy?"" Merkwurdichliebe is a compound that isn't readily translatable. ""I love remembering wurd."" The last scene with Sellers as Strangelove is riotously funny. It may be the funniest scene ever put on film. A mark of the genius of this film is its script that intersperses serious, sensible and concerned lines with some outlandishly funny ones. These stand out even without video. But the visual scenes, with the facial expressions and contortions, compound the humor. Sellers' last scene without the video would lose much. Even after nearly 50 years, this film is as funny as when it came out. Here are some of my favorite hilarious lines from the movie. Gen. Ripper: ""I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration and the ultimate Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids."" Pres. Muffley: ""Gentlemen! You can't fight in here. This is a war room."" Muffley, on the phone to Soviet Premier Kissoff: ""One of our base commanders went a little funny in the head."" And, later, to Kissoff: ""I am very sorry. All right, you're sorrier than I am. But I am sorry as well. I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri. Don't say that you're more sorry than I am because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are. So, we're both sorry, alright?""
On learning of the Soviet doomsday machine, Pres. Muffley says to Soviet ambassador de Sadesky, ""This is absolute madness. Why should you build such a thing?""",
734,4 December 2001,Zunkronaut,9," ""Peace is our Profession""",This movie takes a comedic look at the paranoia of Communism and how close `Doomsday' could be. Over dramatic lighting and tranquil cinematography add to the aesthetic of this film. Peter Sellers has an amazing performance taking the roles of 3 influential characters. The dialog between President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and Dimitry that takes place in the War Room is absolutely hilarious. This scene alone makes the movie worth watching.,

739,14 November 2007,smorris-29,10, Dr Strangelove - a Masterpiece.,"The film is brilliant, upon several levels. Peter Sellers portrait of Group Captain Mandrake is excellent, he slightly distrusts the USAF officers, but his comments about the Japanese...'but they do make such good cameras!' still rings true, nearly 50 years later. The film needs watching a fairly large number of times - try to look at the file George C Scott has on his knee in 'The War Room' (OK, it's 'World Targets In Megadeaths), or goggle as Col 'Bat Guano' refuses to use his M1 carbine to blow open the Coke machine to allow Mandrake to get change to phone the White House to try and avert nuclear holocaust. 'That is the property of the Coca-Cola Corporation...' As to water fluoridation? Well, I'm a dentist, so I think it's all a Commie plot, and I'll stick to 'pure grain alcohol'. Trivia...they had to re-record Slim Pickens' listing of the contents of the B52 'emergency kit'. Originally, he quipped 'a pretty good w/end in Dallas', but JFK's assassination occurred B4 release, so he went back into the sound studio and dubbed 'Vegas' instead. 100% recommend. My favourite film of all time. Dr Steve Morris",

In my opinion, this is Kurbick's greatest movie that he made (and that's a difficult selection).

745,3 September 2009,bernardoselene,9, One of the very best comedies ever,"This is a great movie, with wonderful performances and an ending that is one of the greatest moments of absurdity in the history of the movies. Some of the comments in the trivia section above, however, are just silly. Slim Pickens was a very talented comic actor. It should be quite clear to anyone watching the movie that his is a comic performance, and consciously and intentionally so. Equally odd, is the claim that Sellers' President is some sort of straight man or voice of reason. He is rather a wonderful satire of the sensitive sort of lefty politician who is as worried about establishing his high level of sensitivity as in the main action of the film. If there is a normal major character anywhere in this wonderful movie, it is probably Sellers' RAF captain. I should also note that in 1964 fears about surprise nuclear war were precisely not paranoia. They were quite real. They only became the stuff of paranoia after 1991.",

This movie is full of amazing characters who should always be remembered, whether it be the insane Jack Ripper, or the disturbed Dr. Strangelove. Most people should find this piece of art hilarious and great, and even brilliant. ""Dr Strangelove: Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb"" is by far one of the greatest movies ever made and deserves to be in the IMDb top ten, instead of LOTR. DR STRANGELOVE: 10/10",
748,26 July 2015,Shayshay101,9, Loved It,I watched in history class of my junior year of high school and was pleasantly surprised. The move initially didn't interest me much but after the first few minutes I couldn't wait to see what else would happen and went home that day and watched it instead of waiting until history the next day to finish the story. The plot of the movie was hilarious with enough historical background to make it eligible to be watched during history but was interesting and funny enough to make high school students actually want to watch it. While the situations were too over the top to truly have any real historical message the movie was very enjoyable for a classroom of high school juniors son close to summer break.,
749,3 April 2011,bmvrock,9, Great Movie,"Dr. Strangelove is perhaps Kubrick's greatest film. It is also deeply flawed. The movie overflows with moments of comic genius, all motivated by Kubrick's devastating critiques of war and warmongers. Peter Sellers does a brilliant job in his three roles (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Mirkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove himself). And the fourth role intended for Sellers (Major ""King"" Kong) is filled admirably by Slim Pickens after Sellers broke his leg late in filming. The script is a showpiece of sight gags, caricatures, and dialogue. Especially notable are the monologues by the President while talking to a drunk Soviet Premier on the phone (we can't hear the answers). ""He went and did a silly thing."" Or: ""I'm just as capable of being sorry as you are."" Quoted out of context like this, they seem innocuous, almost boring. But Sellers has impeccable comic timing, and the whole speech has a cumulative effect. We feel like we're not supposed to be laughing at imminent nuclear war this film is the reason why Kubrick is THE MAN!",

To make a comedy about the world ending by the means most feared, and more importantly, most plausible, is genius. Everyone should respect this as one of the best comedies ever, as well as Kubrick being one of the best directors.",

Peter Sellers as the President, strangelove and Mandrake are fantastic. Never laughed more at anything in this than strangeloves operation paper clip style. George C Scott and Sterling Hayden also are awesome as hardcore military men who seem to believe destroying Russia the only chance to win. Slim Pickens also does a very good job as the western pilot cowboy Major Kong. Ripper, who is a commander of a military base has gone completely insane and this creates quiet the conflict as you will see. Highly recommend this comedic gem to anyone who likes comedies and has familiarity with the Cold War.",
755,18 January 2017,joao_luis_921,10, Kubrick's cold war political satire is a masterpiece,"Although I haven't seen all Kubrick's movies, I dare to say that this is his magnum opus and probably one of the most brilliant anti- war manifest that art gave us. I feel that there's a lot to praise on this movie as a political satire: game theory reasoning of mutual assured destruction collapses due to a single insane individual whose power to destruct comes from a bureaucrat military protocol, that was supposed to insure the nation in case of a cataclysm; blinded military diligence leads to kamikaze and mass destruction; institutionalized hatred of the communists is exposed to absurd; the cold war leads to hysteria and self destructive behavior. The best thing is that such achievements are conjugated with an incisive literary content. Humor moments are abundant and each character seems to exactly fit its purpose. The story fails on cold war leading to nuclear holocaust but it is surely successful on capturing its dangers, its hysterical, tense and prejudiced environment and the disruptive political and military behavior associated with it. Since the early 1960's a lot of more visually and sonorously appealing movies were made, even by Kubrick himself, and cinema has assuredly evolved a lot since then but unfortunately, not many examples of such a brilliant combination of storytelling, artistic expression and art as a mean of intervention appeared since Strangelove.",

The dark humor and the zealous insanity of the protagonists to avoid the ""doomsday gap"" never cease to elicit an uncomfortable chuckle from me. It is also worth noting that it does not seem much of a stretch to imagine our current world leaders playing their equivalent roles in the film. All of Stanley Kubrick's work is brilliant in one way or another, but this is my favorite of all his films, due to its satiric wit and edgy humor. I personally believe that this film should be required viewing, just to hopefully avoid a real-life situation that would parallel the one in the picture.",

He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable.",

Not sure I got my 25 cents' worth at the matin√©e. Fast forward 40 or so years and as my mom and I watched the film on TV. Two things cracked us up after all the years. ""Try a Little Tenderness"", and ""Dear John"". 1964. Things were quantum-leap different then, and ""Strangelove"" was simply over-the- top out there. Cynical, irreverent, disloyal, silly, pornographic, low-budget, and brilliant. Let's hope ""clairevoyant"" never applies to anything more than Slim Pickens' Texas war whoop in the list of adjectives used to describe this wonderful creation. The tender portraits of alpha males (Ripper, Turgidson) are convincingly emasculating enough to make one wonder how we still manage to exist today. Kubrick broke the mold with this film.

On par with any works of Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Dr. Strangelove lampoons the Cold War. With three great performances from Peter Sellers, George C. Scott playing a patriotic(and often zany) general, Slim Pickens giving his best John Wayne impersonation as a pilot, and Sterling Hayden being Sterling Hayden there are plenty of laughs to be had. Kubrick doesn't stop at satire, spanning slapstick, visual humor, sexual innuendos, political humor; Dr.Strangelove has a bit of everything. Stanley Kubrick forces us to laugh at the mutual destruction of our planet, and shows us that in the face of Dooms- Day anything that can go wrong will go wrong.",
