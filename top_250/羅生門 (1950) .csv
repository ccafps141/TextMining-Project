0,8 April 2006,MovieAddict2016,10, A brilliant masterpiece from a masterful director,"""Rashomon"" was Akira Kurosawa's first national hit (becoming, at the time, the highest-grossing foreign film in America) and even gained an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, but almost sixty years later it still hasn't lost any of its impact. It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of all-time, but unlike some other movies, it is not a film that feels dated. The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and on-par with the cinema of today -- this isn't a movie where you say, ""Yeah, fifty years ago it might have been different, but now it's done in all the movies."" Kurosawa's techniques are still superior to most of his imitators. Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film, ""Basic,"" which copies a good portion of ""Rashomon's"" concept. Which is the better film? It's not a hard choice.",/
1,5 January 2006,film-critic,8, Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.,"To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the ""Best Foreign Film"" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rashômon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rashômon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being ""borrowed"". His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.",r
2,2 August 2003,Quinoa1984,10," Kurosawa's first milestone, one of the top foreign films of the 20th century","Akira Kurosawa was one of those directors, the first from the Eastern hemisphere, to develop the form and structure of cinema in ways it hadn't been. The story he used for Rashomon is now, like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, and Yojimbo, a near archetype that at this point in the history of film has become formula and common knowledge for writers and directors. In that sense, Rashomon is as important and entertaining as a film as Citizen Kane, Battleship Potemkin, Rear Window, or Open City. Tee basic premise- Four different people give four different accounts on the rape and murder of a couple in the woods. A key ingredient to the success of Rashomon, is that the recollections given to the courts by the woman, the bandit, the as well as the four in discussion, is that their emotions reveal their humanity, even if their details reveal nothing, or everything. It's difficult to say whether character goes over story here, or if they have equal importance to understand Kurosawa's psychology with these people. ",e

4,5 June 2005,mungo39,9, I saw it with my own eyes!,"This fabulous work was years and years ahead of its time when it was made in 1950, being a work of art that engages the eyes and the ears, but most essentially, the brain. The film is both aesthetically beautiful, using amazing camera techniques, extensive periods of silence and a very limited cast to deliver the action, and the story is typically Japanese...ostensibly amazingly simple, but complex to the point of sending you cross-eyed!",i
5,24 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," Kurosawa's elaborate, intricately-plotted masterwork","Seen today, sixty years after it was made, RASHOMON is still one of Akira Kurosawa's most accessible works to western viewers. Instead of a sprawling, multi-faceted historical epic, this uniquely original and inspiring film is a different beast entirely; a cinematic experiment if you will, or an exploration of the human psyche. It covers a seemingly straightforward event from different perspectives, throwing into question the nature of truth, while also exploring themes of the unreliable narrator and perception. It's also a highly entertaining film at that.",e
6,23 September 2014,classicsoncall,8," ""This time, I may finally lose my faith in the human soul.""","This film has a lot in common with movies that turn out to be a dream in which the main character wakes up to realize that what just happened never occurred. I find those kinds of pictures less than satisfying because they seem to cop out of a final resolution to the story. ""Rashomon"" takes a somewhat similar approach, but instead of setting up a dream narrative, Kurosawa has his characters relate the circumstances of a murder from the perspective of four different observers. I can't say that that isn't a valid approach, but the problem I have is that the characters relating their stories don't seem to have credibility on their side. If I had to make a personal judgment, I'd say the woodcutter's appraisal of events seemed most valid because he didn't have a personal stake in the outcome of a murder investigation.",w
7,15 December 2007,Spondonman,9, Art!,"This was Kurosawa's first big international hit, from then on his films would be avidly watched and (usually) feted as Art. His style was always so breathtakingly simple that you can't help but get sucked into the rainy and sunny bestial world depicted in here, with a beautiful use of the black and white nitrate film stock contrasting against a sordid storyline. I've probably seen it 10 times now over the decades and it seems to get better every time I settle down to it - it's been a continual treat.",/
8,23 January 2005,FilmOtaku,8, Kurosawa is just so damn good,"""Rashomon"", Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film about a horrible crime and the various versions of the ""truth"" that come to fruition during the investigation is absolutely amazing, pure and simple. The story is told four different times, each time from the point of view of one of the participants. The basic story of the crime is that a bandit (Mifune) comes across a husband and wife traveling through the forest. The bandit, Tajomaru, seduces/assaults the Masako (Kyo) after tying up her husband Takehiro (Mori), and soon after, Takehiro is dead. What happens between the times Tajomaru encounters the couple and the discovery of Takehiro's body is what is left to be discovered. Masako, Tajomaru and even Takehiro (with the assistance of a medium) each tell their account of the story, each taking blame for Takehiro's death. The fourth telling is from a passer-by, and the audience is left to decide which is the true account.",r
9,26 July 2009,murtaza_mma,10, A rare and a unique masterpiece from the master himself,"As oppose to its commonplace plot, Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece, howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that's what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance, the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. ",w
10,7 April 2003,rbverhoef,9," Kurosawa, do I need to say more","Kurosawa tells a story four times through different characters. The characters tell the story different four times. In flash-backs, all as the characters tell them, we see the stories. Are they lying, are they all telling their own truth or is there someone who tells THE truth? The way this is handled by Kurosawa is absolutely masterful.",6
11,23 January 2001,Darren-12,9, Amazing,"The more I watch and re-watch Kurosawa's films, the more I am sure that he will be remembered as the greatest director of the 20th century. Although I prefer ""Ran"" and ""The Seven Samurai"" for reasons of personal taste, I don't think I would argue very much with anyone who proposed that ""Rashomon"" was his best film. Made in 1950, it is so unusual and so far ahead of it's time that it takes your breath away.",4
12,13 June 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, The film that introduced western audiences to Japanese cinema,"While not my favourite Akira Kurasawa(for not only Japan's greatest director, but one of the finest directors there was) film, like Seven Samurai closely followed by Ran, Rashomon is still a fantastic film. No Kurasawa film is the same without great scenery and cinematography, and Rashomon is no disappointment in that regard. The camera is always moving but never feels like too much due to how subtly composed they (and the editing) are, and the scenery especially the beautifully lit jungle is just as striking, not as epic as Seven Samurai but still making its mark. The music, though I may prefer Ran's score when it comes to scores for Kurasawa's films, is always fitting with the mood and atmosphere of the film, and with its exploration of the relativity of truth the four accounts of the woodland encounter between a bandit and a wealthy couple is written in a compelling and completely credible manner. Kurasawa's direction as ever is superb, as are the performances of Machiko Kyo and Toshiru Mifune. Overall, a truly remarkable film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",4
13,21 March 2020,rooprect,10, More layers than a Smith Island Cake,"""Rashomon"" is a classic whodunnit murder mystery, but with a major twist. You know that old board game Clue? Imagine playing that game with your friends but with trick cards, loaded dice, and everyone's allowed, if not obligated, to cheat. Got it? Solve the mystery!",0
14,30 March 2009,artzau,9, A superb Classic,"Kurosawa's magic film is a composite of 2 Japanese short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa: One, ""Rashomon,"" the title tells of a confrontation of a young man at Rashomon, the large, fortified gate at one entrance to Kyoto where people would abandon children and corpses; the other, yabu no naka ni, ""In a Grove,"" tells of the confrontation between the bandit, the samurai and his wife, told from the point of view of the woodcutter. In 1950, Kurosawa weaves this tale of human vanity and duplicity with the young Toshiro Mifune, as the bandit, Machiko Kyo as the lady and Masayuki Mori as the samurai. The tale unfolds through the flashbacks in the narration of the great Takashi Shimura as the woodcutter, supported by character actors Minoru Chiaki as the monk and Kichijiro Ueda as the bum. Basically, with a cast of six and the stark settings of a woods and a dilapidated castle gate in pouring rain, Kurosawa the magician gives us four views of human vanity, excessive pride and cultural conflict. The foibles of human needs are exposed but redeemed in the final scene where the basic act of kindness brings closure to the bizarre display of greed, lust and mendacity that has gone before. For a Kurosawa film, this one is short, to the point with an economy of emoting-- for which Mifune was never accused of under doing and the viewer is left somewhat exhausted by all the twists and turns, confused by the mix of contradictions and seeming paradox, but satisfied with a feeling of hope.",1
15,18 June 2003,RWiggum,10," ""I just don't understand this story""","These are the opening words of Rashômon, and in a way that's also a summary of the entire film. It is the story of four testimonies of the same event that couldn't differ more. It is told by a priest and a woodcutter to a commoner, as they seek shelter from the rain under the Rashomon gate. The priest and the woodcutter were witnesses in a trial, and what they heard there made them puzzled, and after they told everything, the viewer is just as puzzled as these two. ",5

They are discussing a recent murder of a man and rape of his wife by the bandit Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune, in a superb performance). Each one of them has a version for the crime, including the one from the spirit of the dead husband.

17,19 July 2006,planktonrules,9, Excellent Kurosawa flick--but see other films by this director as well,"This was the first film by Akira Kurosawa to be seen in theaters in the US, as it was an international success. And, while this is a very good film, I think that sometimes too much emphasis is placed on this film and not enough on all his other great films. While some of Kurosawa's fans might agree to the exact order, they will also acknowledge that many other films are nearly as good or better (such as THRONE OF BLOOD, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, YOJIMBO, and many others--along with is wonderful NON-samurai movies such as HIGH AND LOW, IKURU and SCANDAL).",/

But Akira Kurosawa, rather, directed this universal tale made all the way across the world, set a thousand years ago, made 60 years ago, which has actually given root to philosophical movements and fields, transfiguring the account of a foul rape and murder into a contemplation on certainty and human nature. The film is about the real animal showing through the most coercive social doctrines.",e

22,27 January 2008,ackstasis,8," ""I don't understand my own soul.""","Akira Kurosawa is unquestionably the most recognised film-making talent ever to emerge from Japan, his string of reputed masterpieces including 'The Seven Samurai (1954),' 'Yojimbo (1961)' and 'Ran (1985),' each of which I have yet to enjoy, my experience with Asian cinema worryingly limited. After recently enjoying my first Kurosawa picture, the powerful but slightly-overlong 'Nora inu / Stray Dog (1949),' I was keen to watch another, though I couldn't yet find the time to commit myself to one of the director's three-hour-long epics. 'Rashômon (1950)' proved the perfect alternative. Kurosawa's film, the first to bring him into the international limelight, uses a simple story  of a husband's death in the woods  to reveal a simple but worryingly-accurate truth of human existence: that the truth itself is unknowable. The unique narrative structure of the film, of replaying the same event four times from differing perspectives, had the potential to become nothing more than a curious gimmick, yet Kurosawa makes it all work wonderfully, aided by the exquisite cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa and electric performances from all involved, most particularly Kurosawa-regular Toshirô Mifune.",_
23,28 May 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Whom to trust?,"I've wanted to watch this since I first found out it existed. This is the second Kurosawa feature I've seen, the first being Seven Samurai. The man certainly was an artist. The concept smoothly avoids being a gimmick, as it could easily have turned into in the hands of someone not sufficiently talented, and is instead a well-used device, through which base human emotions and responses are explored, as well as relationships, good and evil, and more. Any piece of expression that so skillfully encourages its audience to think - without ever seeming like a lecture - should be respected and appreciated. The story-telling is excellent. The acting is spot-on, from all involved. The minimal cast and amount of settings are well-utilized, and keeps the focus sharp. The plot never loses the viewers' interest, and in fact only gets increasingly deep and fascinating as it goes. While the subject of this is a sexual crime, the way it's handled is immensely tasteful. The visuals are impeccable, and cinematography and editing are amazing. This could arguably, along with much of Hitchcock's work, be cited as the origins of the utter tidal wave of ""twist endings""(often overshadowing all else about those movies, including, but not limited to, consideration being put into ensuring that said surprise even makes sense) that have hit popular cinema in recent years, however, milestones sometimes do cause negatives, and they shouldn't be blamed for that. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys being challenged, and is willing to give the medium of film the chance to prove itself as possessing the potential to be a form of art. 10/10",=
24,8 October 2007,Det_McNulty,10, Distinctly Resonates As Akira Kurosawa's Finest Outing,"Examining Rashômon is a lengthy process, mainly due to the substantial amount of material on offer and the thought-provoking questions which should be probed subsequent to viewing. Not only does the film ask some of life's most profound questions, but it also begins to confront various evocative ideas. Essentially, Akira Kurosawa's unmatched classic is about gaining an understanding; the film's first conversation introduces characters who ""don't understand"" and are looking for answers, this is opening the primary theme.",t
25,10 July 2014,RossRivero99,10, A Kurosawa masterwork,"Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon is a film that works like a Japanese Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller, though it is a riveting suspense thriller it has a different plot that even though is suspenseful that Hitchcock never used a plot like this. It is about the aftermath of a murder and the many different points of view of what they think really happened. Kurosawa uses a cast full of unfamiliar people to us (in other words familiar to the people of Japan)which includes Toshiro Mifune in the title role as a samurai bandit accused of murder, and Takashi Shimura as a middle aged man who finds all of the evidence to the scene of the crime just a few days after the murder happened. This was a well executed film that really made me want to see Kurosawa films a lot more often because of how great this movie really was.",t

Each of these three figures addresses the court, the dead man via a medium – an amazingly, electrifying strange conceit, carried off with absolute conviction. A fourth witness (Takashi Shimura) offers his own version, again different.

28,9 December 2008,bobsgrock,10, The philosophy of Kurosawa.,"Akira Kurosawa, arguably the greatest Japanese director of all time, introduced himself to Western audiences in a big way with this brilliant, yet tantalizing story about a horrible murder that occurred in the woods and accounted by a woodcutter, a bandit, a woman, and a dead samurai. Unfortunately, there is no real way to know what really happened since all the stories are different and impossible to piece together. Therein, lies the meaning of Kurosawa's philosophy of this film.

29,21 July 2010,KnightsofNi11,8, Great film with amazing influence,"Rashômon is one of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's (Seven Samurai, Yojimbo) great works of art. It is a dark and cynical outlook on mankind and it's morality and integrity. It is the story of the murder of a man and the rape of his wife, told from four different perspectives. Each perspective contradicts the others and it is left to the audience's interpretation as to who told the truth. Rashômon was the first film to utilize the telling of the same story from different perspectives and that technique has now become a staple in creative filmmaking. It is used in many different films such as Vantage Point (2008), The Usual Suspects (1995), and even the animated film Hoodwinked! (2005). It is for this reason that you absolutely cannot say that Rashômon is not an influential film.",v
30,14 December 2009,EijnarAmadeus,9," - Most of the time, we can not be too honest with ourselves","Master director Akira Kurosawa released his classic RASHOMON in 1950, and became forever Asian cinema's number one represent. It's a mystery-tale playing like a crime-novel told through five different point-of-views and outplaying on three locations (the Rashomon-house, in the forest, and in court), and the film shows the relativity of truth. The scenes from inside the court involves the viewer, all of the characters are placed directly in front of the camera, addressing themselves - it's like we're the jury, deciding what to believe in, and not. Shot in B&W Kurosawa uses the lighting in the forest in interesting ways, the sunlight that shines through the treetops adverts to the hazy story - faces and situations are partly covered in shadow, and light up by sun. What actually happened, and what's fictitious? And Kurosawa uses many techniques to unveil the plot; the dreamy score, the bandit-character (Toshiro Mifune) is a raucous, beastly troublemaker with farcical acrobatics, long sequences with no sound shows Kurosawa's love for the silent era, the non-linear narrative and the uplifting climax.

31,26 December 2006,dee.reid,10, In a Grove where the Rashomon lies,"Earlier this evening, I had the great pleasure to watch Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece ""Rashomon."" A disturbing film examining the nature of truth and the human ego, ""Rashomon"" arrives at a conclusion that there still are good people out there, even if deception and lies are about to become the norm. (To this end, ""Rashomon"" might just be the most realistic character study ever made.) Based on the short stories ""In a Grove"" and ""Rashomon"" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Kurosawa's picture is set in the aftermath of a heinous and brutal crime: a samurai has been murdered, and his wife raped. Three people, including the alleged murderer and the dead samurai (through a medium), give varying, conflicting accounts of the crime, thus leaving it up to us, the viewers, to decipher these characters and their motives for deceiving. I am currently majoring in criminal justice in college and if I were to ever become a professor, I would certainly make ""Rashomon"" required viewing, and Akutagawa's book a required text. Never has conflict been so daringly portrayed on film, especially when viewed as the aftermath of a violent crime. Even after listening to the testimonies, you sort of become disillusioned that you're unsure of what really happened, and maybe that's Kurosawa and Akutagawa's point. What is certain, what is the truth, is that ""Rashomon"" is a classic of cinema, made by one of the greats to ever pick up a camera and shoot into a grove.",

Therefore, if you are still debating on who is absolutely right or wrong, then you are probably missing Kurosawa's intention. We need to analyze who is more wrong than the rest.

There is a good dose of cynicism in Rashomon, with human nature shown to be selfish and for people to lie, or perhaps more delicately, to distort the truth through the lens of their own perception. A couple of serious crimes have been committed in the forest, and what's happened is told from four different perspectives. Common to all is that a samurai and his wife were travelling through the woods, and then set upon by a bandit (the incomparable Toshiro Mifune). He ties up the samurai and rapes his wife in front of him, and afterwards the samurai is found dead. It's a grim, awful crime, and worse yet, because of the culture and the period, the rape is viewed with elements of dishonor and shame in the woman.

46,11 January 2010,tjsdshpnd,9, I want more of Kurosawa after this one,"The movie which introduced Japanese cinema to the world. The movie which introduced Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune to the west - Rashomon. Based on ancient Japan where Samurai's dwelled and women had no rights, Rashomon is actually a series of flashbacks. The movie starts with a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner discussing about something unusual that happened in the court that day. The Woodcutter was summoned to the court as a witness to the dead body of a Samurai. As, the movie progresses, it is clear that an infamous bandit killed the Samurai because of the lust of his beautiful wife. This particular crime though is recalled from four different point's of view. The bandit, the Samurai's wife, the dead Samurai himself (With the help of black magic, entering the body of another human) and the woodcutter who was an eyewitness to the entire murder scene. All four of them present completely different perspectives of the same murder and it is left to the audience to decide whose version may be true. But this movie does not stop at being a murder and crime mystery. It also takes a closer look at the human psychology and behavior in different situations and conditions.",

Akira Kurosawa's is a household name across the world, and this is an exquisite demonstration of why that's so. There's mesmerizing, unyielding artistry to every single aspect of the film's craft. Kurosawa's eye for shot composition is incredible, making nigh every frame a work of art in and of itself. Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography is rich and crisp, allowing viewers to soak in every considerable detail. Between those two elements alone even the opening credits, laid over shots of torrential rain in a village, are so beautiful one could almost cry. Fumio Hayasaka's dramatic, compelling score is reason enough to warrant a view as it lends much tension to the course of events. Every performance is a tremendous display of acting skill that counts among the best to be found anywhere. Takashi Shimura, Minoru Chiaki, Kichijiro Ueda, Toshishiro Mifune, Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, and Noriko Honma all exhibit terrific, boundless nuance, range, personality, poise, and physicality that help to elevate 'Rashomon' to only the greatest of heights.

52,18 September 2021,clanciai,9, A murder case involving rape with too many witnesses to make any sense of it,"There is a lot of hearty laughing in this film, but no one laughs for joy but rather of the malicious feeling of being superior to others. They all compete with each other in trying to outdo each other, and even the bride, after having been raped and sobbing and crying for hours destitute on the ground suddenly bursts out laughing, when she realizes she is actually superior to both her husband and rapist when she makes them fight each other to death. There is also a lot of stumbling around, Toshiro Mifune himself falling off his horse, and when in the divers fighting scenes they keep falling and stumbling, they falteringly try to rise again only to stumble and fall again - this is indeed a study of human weakness. Only the monk has any detachment, he knows humanity already, and to him this horrible atrocity is nothing new, and all he can do is to continue being in shock because of humanity. The film is slow, it is overworked, there are too many and too long moments of inaction and hesitation, but it is 70 years old, and for its time it certainly was epoch-making in its sharp psychology in charting the fundamental weakness of man. No one is right, everyone is wrong, while they all believe they are right.

56,15 October 2007,gentendo,8, Perhaps more linear than not,"Although there are many ways to define the non-linear narrative, I would like to argue that Rashomon is not a non-linear piece in the traditional sense, but rather contains only elements of non-linearity than as a whole. It includes, for the most part, digetic non-conventional elements in a linear type structure (one that is fluid in terms of its story) as opposed to the traditional non-conventional structure containing mostly non-digetic material. That is to say, when the characters and viewer do not have a frame of reference as to where they really are, (i.e. location, dialogue, and story) but are rather given vague suggestions, the traditional non-linear structure is more present than not. However, Rashomon does not leave the viewer confused or without a frame of reference. This is clearly illustrated around the stories main theme: In a world of deceit, can anyone be trusted? From the beginning, the viewer holds expectations that the film is going to reveal a story within a story within a storyall told from four different perspectives. As it turns out, this structure remains consistent throughout the piece. Already then, this film does not follow the true non-linear format. Following the true format would create more chaos and less order. This aspect of the film's orderliness brings up its digetic qualities. Not only do the characters in the story know that they are telling stories within stories, but the viewer also understands this aspect. Thus, time and space are not irrationally violated. It's true that the film contains non-linear elements that are demonstrated through its use of flashbacks, but the flashbacks themselves are set in a linear structure. The viewer always has a frame of reference as to where they are. The director presents this idea in the following way: Dissolves are used each time a character begins telling their story/flashback, thus allowing the viewer to enter that world without confusion. Knowing this sets up the viewer to contemplate the stories theme.",

The crime is recalled very differently from different people's perspectives, so the audience is never entirely sure what the truth actually is. You build up an idea of the characters, but since they're presented differently each time, you can never have a set idea of who they truly are. The way the plot structured is very stimulating.

From critics saying that it deals with the trauma Japan went through during and after WW2 to it being a work constructed to please ' Western ' audiences. I think both observations partly true, but these critics should be wary of such statements as most of them do not know enough about Japanese life and culture. I hold Japanese film, art and writing in high esteem but to pretend to ' understand ' is futile. But what I do understand is that ' Rashomon ' has greatness. What I see on the screen is a ruined temple which bears the name of the title, and a small group of people talking of a crime in a forest nearby. A woman accompanied by her husband has been assaulted by a bandit, and her husband tied up to watch. Despite the horror of the story the film is conveyed with such visual beauty that I watched it more than the ' story,' interpreted by the people at the temple, and my constant joy was to return to the images of the forest and the multiple actions that took place there. Any one of them could be true, even the supernatural one of the dead husband's perspective. The only real fact is that he does die, but how we will never know, as we will never know what really happens in any situation seen from various viewpoints. Like looking at a Cubist painting I know the ' subject ' is there but so broken up that all I can see is that the separate parts on the canvas are the real painting, and no understanding of the ' real ' subject is possible. What I do see in arguably Kurosawa's greatest film are parts which add up to a questionable reality and the seeing of it visually ( for that is the essence of film ) is all. Machiko Kyo, a great actor playing the woman is superb and her entrance on a horse, veiled in white with a white hat is a splendour of image in itself. A whole image, complete in itself but broken up by the actions of the bandit and by these multiply interpreted actions becomes the broken up ( but still whole ) world of the film in itself and for itself. She is the heart of the film, as still as the temple but ' destroyed, ' but I the viewer of this work of art has to give it meaning. A Modernist masterpiece.",

74,22 December 2004,ACitizenCalledKane,10, A masterpiece of Japanese cinema! A must-see!,"Akira Kurosawa's classic Rashomon is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It is often cited as the reason that the Academy Awards started a foreign film category. Incidentally, it did win an Honorary Award from the Academy for Best Foreign Film. More than a film, Rashomon is more of a meditation on this dishonest nature of man. As we listen to four different testimonies of the same heinous crime, we see that people will lie to save themselves, no matter what the circumstances. The film begins with a priest and a wood cutter speaking within a temple during a terrible rain. Their conversation is a mystery until another man arrives, and begins to ask questions about their subject matter. It is revealed that the men have just returned from court, where they gave their testimonies in a trial against a vicious bandit known as Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune in all of his manic, savage mastery). The bandit tells his side of the story. The woman that he most-likely raped follows with her version of the truth. Then, the story takes an odd twist toward the macabre as a medium is called in to channel the spirit of the woman's murdered husband, who provides an all-together different story. Needless to say, the case is hopeless. The priest and wood cutter find themselves drowning in their own self-pity because of the horrendous state of the world. The priest lamenting that he has lost his faith in man. The other man at the temple laughs it all off, having seen too much tragedy in his lifetime to weep over the injustice which has just taken place. The film does end on a relatively upbeat tone, however. The wood cutter is given a chance to take control of life, a reminder that his life is his own, and that his decisions are still his own, even in the face of the insurmountable odds against anyone struggling to survive in his troubled times. To me, the three men at the temple are the forces of good, evil, and humanity, which is trapped in the middle. The priest is a holy man seeking virtue in a time when virtue was essentially a sign of weakness. The man who approached the wood cutter and the priest embodies the corrupted soul of man, embittered by the harsh cruelties of reality. The wood cutter, neither virtuous nor evil, is confused, and has resigned to be neutral, no matter how much it may hurt him. However, out of the midst of all of this chaos, rain, murder, rape, and perjury, hope is found, and I believe that the wood cutter takes his first step toward realizing his dream by attempting to become that which he prays for - a man of decency.",

It's a story about how untrustworthy stories are. It unfurls like a flower, becoming gradually more engrossing and existential. Yet it's so straightforward that it manages to get away with it's layered narratives. More than that it still has something vital to say about human nature and our perception of ourselves.

The story then becomes a series of four accounts of the events of that day. Each of the participants, including the murdered man gets to describe what took place. It is a story about the sorry state of humanity, but it is more about the Japanese culture. What takes place is hard for a Westerner to really comprehend. Given those circumstances, death, rather than shame, becomes a central issue in the film. Once the woman is raped, her status as a human being is diminished tremendously. She becomes the baggage of the man who wants her. It is totally captivating to see each of the figures tell his or her story.

As you may have guessed from the year, this is a black-and-white film and except the US and very few other countries that also released the occasional color movie by then (also my country Germany I think, at least before that), black-and-white was really the standard there. This film is still very famous today and a key reason for that is that the writer and director is Akira Kurosawa, considered by many one of the finest filmmakers who ever existed. This is maybe not his most known film nowadays, but surely among his most known, maybe top5. It is also really self-explanatory if a film from the year 1950, especially a film that is not in the English language, is closer to 200k ratings on imdb than to 100k ratings. Kurosawa himself was under the age of 40 when he made this, so it is one of his earlier efforts, even if he had already been in the industry for a decade approximately at that point. He is not the only writer credited with this movie. The writer of the base material was Ryûnosuke Akutagawa who was only in his mid30s when he died from suicide in the year 1927, so he did not live to see this film's success. There have been many other releases based on his works over the years, but this one is by far the most known and most successful. In terms of the screenplay, Kurosawa collaborated with Shinobu Hashimoto and it was not the only shared project between the two. With Hashimoto, one very interesting thing to say is that he lived until the summer of 2018, became him a centenarian. Japanese people really do reach old age.",

The film flashes back to the murder trial, when the priest and woodcutter were summoned to testify, the priest ran into the samurai Takehiro Kanazawa (Masayuki Mori) and his wife Masako (Machiko Kyô) the same day before the murder occurred going through the forest, three other people who are supposedly the only direct witnesses testified as well, notorious bandit Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune), the samurai's wife, and the samurai himself testifying through a Medium (Noriko Honma). The three of them tell structured stories about how Tajômaru, who claims he did indeed rape the wife and murder the victim, but these stories contradict each other as well, with the way the motivations and killing happened. At Rashômon the woodcutter reveals that following the trials he actually knows more than he was letting on, this brings his own actions into question, but another discovery and the actions from it bring the woodcutter's own humanity or lack of into focus, a baby was left in a basket near the scene of the crime and the woodcutter stole the murder weapon, the knife, after finding the body, he wanted to care for the child himself, the priest understands his point of view. Also starring Daisuke Katô as Policeman. The direction by Kurosawa is stylised very well, the acting by all the cast members, especially Mifune as the stressed bandit is great, and the editing techniques for flashbacks and plot are for the experimentation with what is true and what we think very clever, all combined makes an atmospheric and intriguing drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it won the Honorary Award voted by the Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source.

The style of the storytelling, with all the flashbacks and restructured scenes, is really an essential part of the tale itself (based on a story by Akutagawa Ryunosuke, taken from his Rashomon collection) but Kurosawa can be credited with bringing a good few new ideas and crazy tricks to the cinema with this monster hit classic.

This Japanese masterpiece carefully sculpts the stories of a samurai and his wife's encounter with a bandit within in a small grove. Rashomon skillfully bounces back and forth between the incidents as told by all parties involved. One of the most striking features of this film is the way in which Akira Kurosawa avoids ever establishing a clear main character in the film. This is done to truly raise the more earthly aspects of the film such as nature and the society as a whole. This practice is further implemented through the cinematography of Rashomon as the camera chooses to frame long and distant shots most of the time to convey the importance of the environment opposed to the characters individually.",

While I'm told the framing device was padding to bring it up to 90 minutes, I found the ending perfect anyway - I still think version # 4, with its takedown of chivalry-and-honor romanticism, is Kurosawa's own reading (correct me if I'm wrong), but the ending serves as an announcement that even he can't be trusted, and that this message shouldn't be mistaken for nihilism. What an economical production, and yet there's just enough judicious application of style - I especially like the 'you-be-the-judge' framing in the trial scenes and the dazzling camera movement as the key witness walks through the woods in the opening scenes.

Rashomon is a great example of Japanese modernism which started in the 50's -- ten years later compared to the United States. Rashomon was made just before Japanese films arrived to Europe, and therefore is one of the most remembered Japanese classics. Kurosawa represented a complete different kind of Japanese cinema that Europeans had so admired -- Mizoguchi's lyricism.

This has a lot to do with the long rolling scenes and very few cuts at times. This can be looked at as boring to some people and that can detract from the overall experience of the movie itself. The actors made the story very believable and worked with the scenery and natural settings very well. The whole unreliable narrator aspect to this movie made it very interesting because there are very few movies, even today, which don't give you a direct aspect of what has happened.

116,12 February 2010,Jay_Exiomo,10, The truth shall prevail. Or not.,"Opening Japanese cinema to the world (particularly to the West) upon its release, Rashomon's enduring qualities is most evident in, along its title having been introduced into the English language (as in the Rashomon effect), its theme's strong resonance even after almost 60 years it was released. Narratively simple yet paradoxically complicated, Akira Kurosawa's widely hailed classic deftly examines the unknowable virtue of truth that even the oft-recited mantra ""To see is to believe"" loses its meaning when thwarted by mankind's ultimate predication to subjectivity and -- perhaps -- psychological egoism. Adapted from two Ryunosuke Akutagawa short stories, Kurosawa's saga concerns itself with an event that transpired in the woods as recounted in wildly differing perspectives three days later at a court trial by the three participants and one supposedly impartial witness as shown in revolutionary flashback sequences. The differing yet equally plausible testimonies are nonetheless bound by one unequivocal truth: a samurai (Masayuki Mori) died in the woods during an encounter with a bandit (Toshiro Mifune) who may or may not have raped the former's wife (Machiko Kyô) and who may or may not have killed the samurai in the process. The bandit claims the samurai's wife yielded willingly to his sexual advances and he killed the samurai in an ensuing duel; the wife swears she was raped and that his husband committed suicide using her dagger; while the samurai's ghost (speaking through a medium) recounts how his wife wanted to go with the bandit and have his husband killed. Compounding the issue is a woodcutter's testimony that radically differs in details from the previous three accounts that to piece together the details from each perspective into one coherent story is an exercise in futility. No matter, since Kurosawa's concern is less in presenting an objective account of what truly transpired than demonstrating the uncertainty of truth, a theme he and cinematographer Kazuo Myagawa often engage in here -- a murky perspective of the world signified by the torrential rain in the opening sequence, the avant-garde direct shot of the sun partially obscured by leaves, the dense forest where the main action takes place, and one character's continuous monologue that he ""does not understand"". Masterfully buried in ambiguity and anchored by strong performances, Rashomon isn't much about providing a solution as it is a proposal to come up with one's own conclusion based on one's partiality, a masterful artistic depiction of how truth can be flawed.",

We have as representatives of that society, a priest (Minuru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) sitting out a rain storm in an abandon temple named Rashomon. It might pass for a ruined Greek temple except that its pillars and roof are made of wood. The priest and the woodcutter declare that they just can't understand it.

He deserved every plaudit he received for it, as well as every ticket sold, because it is an excellent film. Yes, there are some flaws- minor, such as the all too sunny (literally) ending, and some of the over the top hammy acting of Toshiro Mifune as the bandit Tajomaru, but given what was coming out of Hollywood at the time- mind-numbing musicals and grade B comedies- Kurosawa brought film-making style back to an earlier, simpler place, even as he many times over increased the bar for narrative complexity.

It's also filled with fantastic performances throughout. While the premise seems as though it aims to explore the free-flowing nature of 'truth' and how nothing is absolute, instead it looks at the lies we tell in order to project a better version of ourselves and also offers a rather ham-fisted examination of the deceitful nature of human-kind.

122,23 September 2019,sb-47-608737,9, Escapism,"The basic movie premises has been covered, but still let me repeat.
In a rainy desolate temple, a wood cutter, and a priest recount the happening to a disinterested villager, forced to listen, due to the inclement weather, and also a bit of curiosity, but not interest. To him, it is a common incidence, nothing to gossip about. Across the world it is, even today, if you just replace the wife with any sort of prized/ costly belonging of the Owner, Husband in the case (sexism not intended).
A young samurai is waylaid and tied by a notorious bandit . The wife is raped. The Samurai is killed, and a chance wood cutter finds the body. Within few days the bandit is arrested (per chance) and though not for this, he boasts of this incidence. The wife has taken a shelter in a temple, where she had been found, and corroborates the Bandit's assault on her. But the gap between the rape and Samurai's murder is foggy. The wood cutter hasn't seen anything, since when he arrived, except the copse and a few of the wife's attire (hat, etc) nothing living was there.
The husband was still alive while his wife was assaulted, and it seemed that there was no intention of killing, from the beginning, then Why ? And also Who killed him? This gap is filled by three people - the Bandit, the wife, and the murdered man (through a Medium) in entirely different manner.
Practically each claiming the responsibility for the death - Fight -to- death (bandit), Stabbing (probably) to escape the abhorrence of the husband for the victim (wife), Suicide for honor (Samurai).
And here the master class of psychology comes in - each person (not only the three protagonists), but also the Policeman who arrested the bandit and even the wood-cutter had lied or had something to hide. The reason of each lie/ suppression of the truth is quite believable - and even the dead man (who should never) lying.
The story is quite fast paced, and some incidents , I found to be a bit stretched (e.g. the fight between the bandit and Samurai, as narrated by witness, who too could be lying, but at least there was no motive for this one to). But then I realised that each segment of it had its place in the narrative to justify the lies, and was unavoidable.
And even more interesting thing is... there was no actual or I would say significant lying by any - the coloring of the truth, as seen by each, to justify the action and reputation (even when dead), which made the stories entirely different. In one review the justification of the wife's lies were not understood, but even those were as required as by the others, each for their own self-sake.",

It asks a question that has continued to resonate down the years: can one have faith in other human beings if they not only can lie to you, they can even lie to themselves? The plot, an adaption of a Ryunosuke Akutagawa short story, concerns a murder trial where each of the people called to testify gives a different account. As the film opens, a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki), sitting out a downpour, recount the trial for another man sheltering from the rain. The woodcutter had discovered the body of a murdered samurai (Masayuku Mori) in the forest. A captured brigand, Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune), is accused of doing the deed, and he gives one account at the trial. The samurai's wife (Machiko Kyo), who fled Tajomaru's attack and has been found hysterical in a nearby temple, provides another version of events to the judge.

128,20 May 2007,brian-nyc,1, Overrated piece of cra... cinema,"There are several reasons why this film is painful to watch. The first reason is the childish cinematography. While this may have something to do with conditions in postwar Japan, the cinematography is far exceeded by many films of the early twentieth century, so it has nothing to do with the film's age. As for the story, it is almost nonexistentthin gruel for a film that presents so many different perspectives. The lack of a story probably accounts for the painfully slow pacing. It takes a Herculean effort of will not to shout at the screen, ""Get on with it!"" Still, good acting can often salvage the weakest story. Sadly, the acting in Rashômon mostly consists of odd poses and staring. For the first five minutes, the lingering shots of overwrought facial expressions and contorted bodies can induce an occasional chuckle. After about twenty minutes, you'll wish you had access to a dagger, too. This tedium is punctuated by comically staged sword fights. I mean, how long can two expert swordsmen wrestle and parry without a decent thrust? Again, get on with it! Of the film's many annoyances, the worst are the idiotic laughing of the bandit and the screeching of the woman. With his constant ha-ha-has, you have to ask, is the bandit insane? Is he reckless? Is he a really, really bad actor? As for the womanwell, if she's the vision of a goddess, thank god I'm an atheist! Once you hear the dulcet tones that come from this angela scream slightly more annoying than the amplified sound of fingernails running down a chalkboardyou wonder why a sword or a dagger wasn't immediately used on her.",

It encircles a wood-cutter, a priest and a common poor man and an exorcist. Thats all the cast is. The story is quite simple too. The Man travels with his wife through a jungle and a Bandit sees the wife and starts lusting for her. The bandit follows them and violates the Wife. The Husband is dead by the end of the event. Now, the story revolves around this death and the mystery surrounding it. Everyone has a different version for the event. The film revolves around all these four stories told by the Bandit, the Wife, The dead man (through an exorcist) and the wood-cutter. Every version, as told by each, is different.

Director and co-writer (with Shinobu Hashimoto) Akira Kurosawa never reveals what really happened in the forest - there is no objective view of the events - the audience only gets the four character view-points, which are inconsistent, either due to inaccurate memories, bias perceptions, and/or self-serving deception. Pride motivates the bandit, who wants to world to believe that he defeated the samurai in a fair duel between skilled swordsmen and that the women, who had ultimately accepted his sexual advances, chose him over her husband. Desiring to minimise the shame of having been dishonoured, the wife denies desiring the bandit and claims to have no memory of what happened to her husband, who had rejected her after she was attacked. The (dead) samurai accuses his wife of treachery and claims the honour of having committed suicide rather than bear the shame of her actions (this segments begs an intriguing metaphysical question: can a soul lie?). The wood cutter (the great character actor Takashi Shimura), ostensibly the most objective of the witness, also seems to have the most motivation for out-right lying, the valuable dagger that each of the others mentioned is nowhere to be found. He also remembers the battle between the samurai and the bandit as being singularly cowardly and inept - at odds with the heroic and skilled combat the bandit recalls. While the woodcutter has reason to lie about the dagger, he has no reason to lie about fight (if there was one) whereas the bandit is motivated by pride. All of these stories are told in the first person or through flashbacks to an earlier trial amongst three men (a commoner, a priest, and the woodcutter) as they take cover from a torrential rain storm in the burnt ruins of Rashomon, a vast city gate. The story is beautifully told although some of the acting may seem stagy and overly-theatrical (notably Mifune's laughing) but the film's narrative structure (audiences aren't usually seeing an event, they are seeing someone else's memory of the event) accommodates, even encourages, excesses. The ending is a bit maudlin, considering the rest of the film's nihilism, but the beautifully lensed, written, and acted film, like all of Kurosawa's oeuvre, is worth watching at a number of levels.",

Juggling with multiple versions of the same story in a way not seen before or after it, investing the viewer in the story and making amateur sleuths out of them.

But, believe it or not, Hollywood preceded him by 21 years! In 1929 Fox released a courtroom drama that is startlingly similar in theme to RASHOMON. Three witnesses tell different stories of a rape and murder in court. The last one is accepted as the truth. Don't believe me? Check out THRU DIFFERENT EYES (yes, that's the right spelling) on IMDb. At the age of 9, I saw this film when in general release, and was much impressed, although truth to tell after three quarters of a century, I don't remember actual details. It had an impressive cast, too: Warner Baxter and Sylvia Sydney, among others of note. The credited authors of this story were Milton Gropper and Edna Sherry.

The human knowledge of the truth very often rests on the trust that we place in testimonies. And then inevitably bring into question the authenticity and the credibility of the one who testifies. Kurosawa here illustrates and demonstrate the problem in a context that dramatizes it to the extreme (that of human justice). How to judge the responsibility of people, relative to a crime, when their testimonies contradict each other? How in such a situation can you establish the truth of the facts? Even if Kurosawa concludes his film on an optimistic note of hope, he still crafted the whole piece to cruelly reveal the limit of all human justice.",

I suppose the split narratives were then a really amazing innovation, but they are now somewhat commonplace, and today they sort of dragged a bit, after the first one which was the most exciting. The thematic ideas of the film were brilliant, as is the film itself, it's just dated now.

I recognize the qualities that make it great, in terms of the theme (i.e.--a visual examination of the subjectivity of knowledge), but their are aspects of the cinematography that are very off-putting for a 21st century American audience. Most notable are the exceptionally long takes focused on an actor's face while he/she emotes for the camera. After the first few seconds of this type of shot, no new intelligence is communicated by continuing to view the actor's face. I did like the realism of the fight scenes, which struck me as much more in line with reality than the highly choreographed demonstrations of virtuoso sword-play that many more modern action films offer.

The thing to ask yourself, while watching the film,is this: What is the motivation of each character? Each story reveals that person's deepest fear. In the story each person tells, they are trying to protect the one thing they are most afraid of losing. Given this perspective, I find the film is actually quite understandable and makes a lot of sense. One other comment I'd like to make is that Kurosawa-san once said, ""Women are not my specialty."" I beg to differ! The wife's emotion is so very real, certainly just as real as the men's. I could name my favorite women characters in his other films too...but that might wander outside the scope of this review.",

He's the one who found the body but he also watched the whole thing from the bushes. His version is what we assume is the true version and it's the most entertaining because both the bandit and the husband were cowards and the sword fight they had was comical.

We do not know who is telling the truth. Nor do we know the fate of the accused bandit and the helpless widow. It is entirely up to the viewer to decide which character is telling the truth (if they even are). That's the beauty of this film.

The character examined contained all of the personalities revealed and they were perceived by the onlooker through the onlooker's own prejudices.  The stories were told also by the character stressing their perception of the event and role in it.  What was the true story?  It was a combination of all the stories or none of them.

While the focal point of Rashomon involves unraveling the event involving the death of a Samurai where the Samurai himself, his wife and a bandit claim to be the culprit, the film isn't a clue-solving mystery where new revelations in subsequent scenes make it easier for us to judge who the criminal is; instead, Rashomon places us in the jury box with its characters appealing to us one by one and the only way we can reach to any decision is through moral considerations. Can the wife be a woman of such loose morals that she immediately agrees to elope with the bandit and asks him coldly to shoot her husband? Can the husband be so stone-hearted that he rejects his helpless wife because she has been raped? Can a bandit be smooth enough to woo the married lady with just a kiss? ",

I'm not sure why I have seemingly avoided this one having watched many other Kurosawa films, but I think it is that it was difficult to believe I would no longer be able to fully appreciate its qualities. The greatness of the film's revolutionary nature has been so absorbed by others as to no longer appear so very inspiring. Another problem is that the more I have been immersed in Japanese cinema the more I have tended to sympathise with the oft held Japanese view that the director is too influenced by the West. This influence has gone both ways, Yojimbo/Fistful of Dollars the most well known example but also his treatment of the plays of Shakespeare. In any event, at least the Blu-ray technology and recent restoration work mean that the film can be seen in all its b/w glory with most of the shooting taking place outside and in the woods. It is beautifully photographed and interestingly structured although the whole notion of people's memories of events differing now seems rather obvious. It is also unfortunate that the conclusion with the baby seems a little heavy handed and to somewhat undermine the earlier 'nature of man' arguments. That it was not unheard of for people to leave dead bodies and newborn babies at temples in the hope that they would be appropriately dealt is something that might be missed by an audience today but in any event does not seem particularly pertinent to the story.",

A great mystery doesn't need to be spelled out to the audience. It's always better to leave a lot up to the individual viewer's interpretation. ",

There is one version by the victim, another version by the accused, and a third version by an unbiased observer. It was the first time in cinematic history that this technique was used; three versions of one event, and it works wonderfully. A woman is brutally raped by a local bandit, or at least that is what she tells the authorities. The accused gives a totally different account of the event when apprehended by the local police. But it is in the third revealing of the event that we eventually find out the truth about what really happened, and I will leave that segment for you to discover in this masterpiece of filmmaking.",
194,28 May 2012,MovieGuy109,10, One of Kurosawa's great works,"Akira Kurosawa's 1950 study of murder and lies is a thundering moral statement. The film builds for us an atmosphere of lies and deceit in our world, showing the cynical mechanics of Kurosawa's old soul. The film plays out four separate stories, each of which are false in someway. Not revealing the true plot to the audience is Kurosawa's metaphor of how we all lie to ourselves and to others and how we barely know the truth in so much deception. Then, at the end, Kurosawa provides a moment of beauty and belief, sharpening our faith in human kind rather than fading it. This moral statement is among the best of all films and remains one of Kurosawa's greatest works of art. It is conceivable that Kurosawa made better films, but this early gem is still hard to beat.",

196,27 December 2022,CinemaSerf,7, Rashômon,"In what seems like an endless, almost biblical, rainstorm we meet three people sheltering in the ruins of an old gatehouse. Each has their own story to tell of the rape of a woman and of the murder of her husband. It was the woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) who discovered the body and who alerted the authorities. It was those authorities that conducted a trial at which a priest (Minoru Chiaki), the woodcutter, the widow/victim (Machiko Kyô); the ghost of her deceased Samurai husband and, finally, the renowned bandit ""Tajômaru"" (Toshirô Mifune) are required to testify. We are shown manifestations of each testimony: all smilier but different. Who were the two victims? Was he honourable and decent? Was she demure or a temptress? Are those testifying embellishing what they saw, what they did? What makes this film great is that there doesn't appear to be a right answer. Each version is plausible, nobody is entirely trustworthy and at the end of each story, you could easily agree that was an accurate report on the turn of events. Accompanied by the relentless sound of the rain and by a soundtrack that reminded me very much of Ravel's ""Bolero"" we explore each permutation with some super performances from all concerned, but especially from the almost maniacal Mifune and from Miss Kyô. Kurosawa packs loads into less than ninety minutes in a salutary lesson in classy and enthralling film making that is quickly paced, characterfully delivered and suitably exasperating at the end! This is a good film.",

Kurosawa's pacing may leave many of today's viewers ""bored"", but as far as I am concerned, cutting from one camera to another each second of a film (like an MTV video) is not boring.

I really think that Kurosawa was not interested in music at all.  And Rashomon is too much long. I have read the short story by Akutagawa(which is great), which is about 20 pages.  Consequently, I do not understand why the film lasts so long. So I do not say that it is an awful movie, but I don't think that it is worth calling ""the best movie in the world"".

Mifune is a compelling presence, but he, like most of the cast, overacts wildly at times. The story is interesting but becomes too melodramatic and the plot element concerning the baby seems to be tacked on as an afterthought. The score seems to be based on Ravel's ""Bolero.""

206,22 November 2004,jegutierrezp,10, Akira Kurosawa has shown all his power,"It's official. With this movie, Akira Kurosawa has proved he is one of the greatest film directors in the history. Ilked so much this adaptation, its very simple, but also very well-treated; the actors were great and also the screenplay. First I must say that Kurosawa took a short story from Ryunosuke Akutagawa and extracted all its elements: The Era, the clothes, the traditions, the houses and the bad face of the people, in order to make an excellent movie; all the atmosphere can take the watcher into the Edo time (a bit more ancient than Tokugawa, and introduce us into the realistic environment of that time: the scenery and the photography is another thing that we can include, the sunshines and the forest were some of the best parts, and Kurosawa knew how to balance them. For the other part, Toshiro Mifune should be called ""The Japanese Marlon Brando""; I mean, he made an excellent Tajomaru, a dirty, but serious thief; many times I thought he was really like that, perhaps one can't see if he is acting or not, and that's something that gives credibility to the movie; the part in which he was tied in the court, just like a dog, is so impressive; I wonder if that was part of medieval Japanese customs, or if both Akutagawa and Kurosawa made that for show a symbolism. ¡The Actress! She was also brilliant, I don't know her name, but he creates an excellent, pathetic, weak and coward character; the way he escaped form Tajomaru showed her fear, her cowardliness, and also the infidelity: First she was with the husband, but then, passed to Tajomaru. ¡How Pathetic! The character is ""double-faced"" and I love it, and so the actress. Finally, the best part of the screenplay, is that Rashomon is not just a story, but a lot of stories, seeing by each character's eyes: Each tells what they remember about the murder. And all of these are full of reflections about humanity, oneself, the others. Love, loyalty, madness, and great style of samurai fight between two man. In spite of all my comments, however, I must accept that I had problems identifying all these elements, but now since I enter deeply on the movie; all I have to say is that the film industry could not survive without Rashomon. But there are a lot of movies that we still have to see, such as ""The Last Tango in Paris"", from Bernardo Bertolucci, and ""The Last Emperor"" as well, but have faith. Watch movies, and decide if they are one of the greatest or not: the cinema and literature are very identical anyway. Technically are different, I know, but deep inside, they show art, story, love, passion, and tradition, from the countries or from the director's vision.",

211,3 January 2006,jdoan-4,10, What is truth?,"This is essentially a silent film. The dialogue, which is sparse and straightforward, is almost unnecessary. Everything we need to know is shown to us, and shown to us with amazing skill. I can think of few other films that have been as visually profound as this one. Kurosawa is a master painter. He has such an deep, innate understanding of composition and framing. Another such genius is Bergman. They have such skill in conveying emotion and mood with every frame. Speaking of Bergman, this film is similar in many respects to his masterpiece ""Persona."" Both films undermine their own authority by questioning whether or not film, or mankind for that matter, can be objective. Do we have the ability to determine truth? Are we competent enough to convey that truth? The films are very different in subject matter, but in artistry and philosophy, they are nearly identical. I find it amazing that ""Rashomon"" was made over 10 years before ""Persona."" I read one comment that compared ""Rashomon"" with ""Hero."" I thought ""Hero"" was a pretty good movie. It certainly was good looking, with striking choreography. However, ""Hero"" ""cheated"" in that it used color to establish mood and perspective. Though it did do it rather expertly, Kurosawa was working in glorious black and white. He had to use composition and shading--a far more difficult task. Yet he pulled it off with panache. I never doubted that I was looking at the same ""truth"" from a entirely different perspective. This film, though highly cynical, did end on a note of optimism. It wasn't forced or contrived. It fit perfectly smoothly into the storyline. Not many directors could do that. Kurosawa didn't remain as optimistic. One of the most cynical, dreadful endings I have ever seen was Kurosawa's later film, ""Ran."" That film ends with no hope, no glimmer of goodness, no confidence in mankind. The films were made 35 years apart. Amazing how an individual's perspective can change over the years.",

During the movie, we hear several different accounts of a murder. By the end of the movie when you find out which account is the truth you are left wondering and debating what caused the others to lie? Does no one have any honor now? I was left feeling like my favorite TV doctor Gregory House. I felt a lack of faith in humanity and thinking ""everyone lies."" But despite the cold hard look at humanities dark side, a path is preserved and shown that there can be good in the world, even if sometimes we cannot explain the bad.

Anyway, a couple of years after that I read Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's short story ""Rashomon"" and noticed that it really did not fit Chang's brief description of the movie and it was not until I read a later short story in the collection, ""In the Grove"", did I find the actual short story the film was based on.",
217,8 November 2019,kristjanbuckingham,8, Unreliable Narrators in Rashomon,"The Japanese film, Rashomon, depicts the story of a single event told from several contradictory perspectives, told through a series of flashbacks. The main elements remain the same through their various tellings, but the emotions and motivations of the characters vary greatly. Director Akira Kurosawa utilizes this approach to great effect, crafting a story that leaves the audience feeling unsure of who to trust and who is to blame.
What each version of the story shares is a young woman catching the eye of the bandit, Tajomaru, resulting in her probable rape, and the cuckolding and death of her husband. What is unclear is who killed the man and why. Somewhat ironically, rather than placing the blame on one another, they each seem to point to themselves as the perpetrator, pointing to the importance of honour in Japanese culture, placing it above honesty or even freedom.
The depictions of the flashback are actually one step further removed from reality, as they themselves are recollected by a woodcutter, a priest, and a commoner, who are discussing the trial. The film opens with one of these men proclaiming generally that he just doesn't understand; a theme that continues throughout the movie.
The emotions of the actors accentuate the tone of each version of the story and how their characters come across to the audience. Starting with Toshiro Mifune, who plays the bandit Tajomaru, he appears to be the most crazy and unpredictable in his own depiction, feeding into his reputation as a notorious outlaw. The samurai's wife, played by Machiko Kyo, arguably has the largest emotional range and greatest discrepancy in terms of the emotions her character undergoes. Kyo pulls this off very well, ranging from helpless victim to conniving conspirator. The samurai's story doesn't change as much as the others, but since he is unable to tell his version in death, a medium is brought in on his behalf. Although convincing, the medium's depiction serves more to promote herself as divine than to tell the dead man's tale.
The camera also plays a role in depicting the tone of the various stories. The trial is shown as each character symmetrically facing the camera directly, answering unheard questions from an unseen interrogator, creating the sense that the characters are speaking to the audience directly, trying to prove their innocence to the camera. Panning wide shots express the passing of time as Tajomaru lures the samurai into the forest. Close-ups reveal the absent look in the wife's eyes as she succumbs to the bandit forcing himself on her. Showing the scene take place from different perspectives of the camera goes a long way to depict the different perspectives of the characters.
The idea of a single story told from multiple perspectives has become a classic cinema trope over the years, becoming a favorite for filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, and in films such as Vantage Point and more recently in Bad Times at the El Royale. The device poignantly addresses questions of morality and undermines the reliability of the narrator. Rashomon pushed the audience to question events as they are shown on film, and filmmakers to explore the powerful effect of perspective.",

It's the kind of art film that can easily break into mainstream conversations because of the kinds of questions that it leaves with its audience. Which of the four stories that we hear are true? It's a very literal question that has no real answer on purpose, so people can navigate clues, intentions, motives, and details day in and day out until they are blue in the face.

229,12 December 2009,dwpollar,7, Well done mystery morality tale...,"1st watched 11/21/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Akira Kurasawa): Well done mystery morality tale by acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. The story is told in flashbacks and is about an encounter between a bandit, a samurai and his wife in the woods. The samurai is found dead but how did he die and who killed him? The story is told initially by the man who found the body supposedly during a rainy day where there is not much else to do. The story ends up being told from many other perspectives and each telling is different. There is an evil aspect in every telling which causes one of the listeners to lose total confidence in man and his negative possibilities. This is a very deep and emotional film that mostly involves male characters, which is very unique in films of any kind. The lone female character is deceptive, evil and not to believed. Of all the stores told, we really don't know what truths are within each of them -- only that a man is dead. This is the beauty of this film made by Kurasawa as he plays with our thoughts to the very end. When it's over we're still thinking and this, in my opinion, is the mark of a good film. We really go away not caring who did it, but we learn a lot about human nature and it's inadequacies and what really matters most to us.

It was certainly not that... well it was in one part, but I'll leave that out.

This movie is in the top ten for many directors out there for a reason. Despite it being considered an antique by most young people out there, the message and story have withstood the test of time- it's a work of art that brings up that question of human nature and how we even bother living with all the bad things going on in the world.

243,28 March 2011,LbFilmFanatic,8, Kabuke Theatre in Akira Kurosawa's niceties in Story Exposition,"In the late 50's, Akira Kurosawa was deemed a rather outlandish director before he became an auteur and a real innovator. This was essentially because his range included a large repertoire of Western Conventions with the crossover of Japan's Conventions that he executed so differently, yet so powerfully. A contingent of japan would deprecate him, not because of the quality of his work, but rather the aberrance of his movies. But when his movies really spanned across the world that unconventional streak Akira had with his movies in Japan slowly piqued American audiences eyes at the genre crossover (the influential luminary he would become in the 20th century would be tenable by directors such as George Lucas, who had the concept of the lowest character Point of View for ""Star Wars"" from ""Hidden Fortress"", Sergio Leone's inspiration from ""Yojimbo"" to create the leading character for his Dollar Trilogy, Steven Spielberg honouring him at his Life Time Achievement Award and lauding his work and Darren Aronofsky, who has said that one of the scenes in ""Requiem for a Dream"" became inspired and heavily dictated by Kurosawa's unique usage of camera angles that was so overbearing for him to imitate, testifying that Kurosawa was really beyond time) and by explicating it more into the 21st century, you will notice this in many movies with his use of music (leitmotivs), his use of segues, his skill with rain in dramatic scene, his mise-en-scenes. The only thing from ""Rashomon"" that has never seemed to catch on is the One Dimensional Character coming centre stage as we go through the environment of ""Rashomon - or more accurately, the uncertainty of ""Rashomon"". So this wasn't Kurosawa's debut film (in fact, he actually directed 11 movies before this and a couple of scenes in Uma), but it was his first lofty film and Kurosawa's first shot at becoming fully fledged master of cinema. Rashomon - everybody should really know what the movies story is - but if you don't, it's about 3 Narrative POVs that include a couple of wood cutters, Toshiro Mifune (portraying Tajomaru implicated in a crime case - if you look at the character development of his illicit character, it's so disparate now to see him in protagonist roles, where he would become the symbol of morality, anti-hero or fallen warrior. In this movie he is clear-cut evil) and a wife of the man who got killed by Tajomaru (apparently). With the one dimensional character that comes to the Rashomon under a shelter from the rain, we see that he will spark contention and bring an audience's confusion through his subordinate POV to the whole story about these other events whether fabricated flawlessly or feigned unconvincingly. The movies premise: lies; the movies focal point is more about fearing the truth, as the heinous crime that the plot centres around brings our characters to boiling point - and how Akira Kurosawa directs the flashback scenes to show how implausible some of the stories really can be. Times, places, points and evidence - This is where the movie really shines is how it revolutionised the Narrative Structure that Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" would adopt. Some of my favourite things about this movie to me is the the real human condition that gets analysed and the foundation of the world that Kurosawa composes. It has amazing Black and White, making the images and iconography eidetic. It really shows how eclectic the art of Japanese Cinema can really be (I have always misunderstood Japanese cinema until I found Kurosawa and ",

260,11 January 2023,Philipp_Flersheim,9, Required viewing for anyone interested in the past,"It is hard to overstate how innovative Kurosawa was when he filmed 'Rashômon'. Flashbacks had been used in earlier films, but always as a storytelling device. Kurosawa, by contrast, used them to demonstrate two essential aspects of life: First, that lying is human (as one of the characters points out), and second, that when we depend on verbal accounts of the past, there is no way to be sure of what 'really' happened. You might say that there are as many realities as there are people who remember the past. 'Rashômon' is extremely well-acted, with Kurosawa's favourite Toshirô Mifune standing out. It is also beautifully filmed: For example, the way the rain is used to to make it immediately clear which scenes are flashbacks and which are not is brilliant. The pacing is slow, but that actually helps the viewer to compare the stories the protagonists are telling. Combining and comparing these stories turns 'Rashômon' into a cautionary tale: It cautions us against believing others not merely because they may be dishonest (including to themselves), but because human memory is bound to trick us. Our brain distorts our memories, frames them in inappropriate ways and modifies them without us being able to control this or being aware of it (as J. Fried has shown in 'Der Schleier der Erinnerung' (The Veil of Memory), 2012). This puts detectives trying to solve criminal cases just as much in an awkward position as historians who attempt to reconstruct the more distant past. In fact, 'Rashômon' should be required viewing not only for them, but for anyone interested in the past.",

I am also aware that there is no perfect film. However, when you can achieve a level of power by visual storytelling like ""Rashomon"" or ""Godfather"", you might as well call it ""the perfect film"", even if it's close to perfection because we can never achieve that ""perfection"" that our human minds so need desperately. What qualifies ""Rashomon"" as a perfect movie is that all technical aspects and detail has been examined and executed well enough to lure us into the world of the film itself. ""Rashomon's"" specialty in this case, is the strong voices of its cast, the cinematography that's still stunning, and the overall influence that still makes the movie cunning.

Famed director Akira Kurosawa used novel techniques in the well-paced film and elicited good acting from the thespians involved. The spare, minimal and simplistic settings give the flick a confined, play-like look and vibe. The movie's biggest flaw is its length where starting out strong by the second half tedium and monotony set in despite the plot's promise. Perhaps it's the lack of music that slows the pace as the bare-bones naturalism doesn't do the movie any favors. The first lauded film outside of the U.

272,1 May 2007,indulge,8, Man's Word: Can It Really Be Trusted?,"Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon envelops two well-known stories written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa. These stories reveal the political, social, and economical reconstruction evolving in Japan during the 1950s. The cinematic elements portray the dilapidation of Rashomon not only in the set but also by the actor's clothing, for example the rags worn by the bandit and Tajomaru. The idea that humans are evil and corrupt beings and the world we live in might as well be hell provides the central theme of the movie. The individual tales told within the structure of the larger story of the day, waiting for the rain to subside inside the gates of Rashomon. The conflict between an individual and their own conscious, perceive the nature of human beings to be weak and corrupt, this realization takes heed through the recounts of each character. Verification to the priest that the world we live in is a state of decay. Furthermore, it is ironic that the bandits reveal most of the moral lessons and insights on human behavior in the movie. For instance when Tajomaru recalls that if not for the wind, he would not have killed Takehiro that day, maybe it was because he only caught a glimpse of her that he felt the urge to follow them. Another illustration of irony, in the movie, occurs when Tajomaru takes Masako to her husband. Tajomaru almost looks ashamed. In addition, it is ironic that Tajomaru would even worry about killing someone honorably. Yet, this reveals the mentality of Japanese society in the 1950s. Moreover, the conversation between the Bandit and the Priest reveals the tendency for dishonest people to generate significance of a message to obtain what they want. Although, in the same instance the bandit tells the priest he does not want to hear his sermons. The bandit informs them that it is human to lie, that half the time we are not honest with ourselves, let alone others. Whereas, the priest tries to unveil that men are weak and this is their reason for lying. The bandit also points out, that maybe even the thought of good things is a farce and man wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the make-believe good stuff. Beyond, the medium tells Takehiro's side of the story, revealing the mentality and nature of Japan in the 1950s. Considering the fact that a medium's testimony is valid in their political hearings at the courthouse, demonstrates the Japanese beliefs in the supernatural or ancestral realm. The medium also reveals the nature of forgiveness, how Tajomaru asking him what to do with his wife, makes Takehiro want to pardon him for his crime. Additionally, the woodcutter's account of the situation relates the nature of the Japanese to change their opinion of someone close to them. This occurs when Masako wants Tajomaru to kill her husband due to shame and describes her opposition to living her mundane life. Rashomon is definitely worth watching, and helps portray the outlook the Japanese have on the world and what they consider important. For the westerners that watch this movie remember it is not always the words that can tell a story, and at times one might wish the movie would move quicker, but just a thought, take that time to inquire about what has happened thus far.",

So very few storytellers know what makes good or evil. Rashamon is very Eastern in its philosophy, so it doesn't quite get it. It's not what we do that makes us good or evil. Doing good isn't the cause of good or evil in us, it's the result. I cannot see anyone come to any accurate conclusion about the heart of man by watching this film. Still, it was interesting and it wasn't without its entertainment value. Seeing the 4 conflicting stories intertwine was interesting.

Yet a lifetime of movie-watching has only made it stand out as a towering, majestic work, a pinnacle of the cinematic art form. Some peple say that the chief purpose of art is to inspire, and if that's the criterion then Rashomon inspires me to be humble, to be not so quick to judge, to realize that humans have different perspectives on shared experiences, and that we need to navigate a world in which people do not agree on ""the truth"".",

The bandit tricks them into buying swords he has stashed in a wooded area, he ties up the samurai and makes his wife yield to him. Then the samurai ends up dead somehow. Now the story must unfold through the evidence of each character to find out who is truly guilty of the crime. It is a film way ahead of it's time and reminds us how the human body works, whether it'd be through sight or hearing, the conclusive answer was always subjective.

303,11 November 2019,fsevdecoskun,8, Brilliant storytelling,"In Rashomon, we encounter four different narrators as well as four different stories. There is not chronological order, instead the story is told in a reversed manner.

Therefore, what we saw was C,B,A,C,B,A...C in the plot where the chronological order would be A,B,C. This flashback within a flashback and the sophisticated plot was amazing to see on the screen.
That the story changed in each version was brilliant because even after hearing all versions we were left with full of question and not sure which version was exactly accurate. Each character might have told the story as they perceived it which is unlikely since the murderer changed in each story. What is more likely was that each told the story in a way that they wished to have happened. However, we still do not know which elements in each story was a part of the truth or if there was any piece of truth in any version.

319,1 March 2017,BrockPace,10, One of the Greats,"I recently had a conversation with one of my friends about how much we liked films shot in a forest in black and white. It seems that forests and art-house cinema go hand in hand (i.e. SEVENTH SEAL, MARKETA LAZAROVA etc.) Of these RASHOMON may be the earliest, popularizing the setting through avant-garde techniques that would seem audacious even if made today. Breaking continuity, pointing the camera directly at the sun, constantly tracking from beneath twigs and branches. At times the cinematography appears almost impressionist, blending the characters into the background, literally forcing man to become a part of nature. This immersion of man into nature comes at a point when we are expecting excitement and action. Entering a flashback prefaced by horror and death, Kurosawa instead decides to spend 3 minutes tracking a woodsman as he wanders through the forest. In one of the most brilliant sequences I have ever seen put to film, Kurosawa introduces man at its most honest, alone, and unassuming. When the woodsman stumbles upon the deceased samurai, his hands are splayed upwards, mirroring the branches that framed the woodsman previously. All of this acts as a preface to Kurosawa's exploration of the folly of mankind through lies, manipulation, and hyperbole. The very nature of film is to exaggerate and embellish characters by placing them into easily understandable categories of protagonist and antagonist. Here Kurosawa exposes this by retelling the exact same narrative 3 different ways, with each character placing themselves as the murderer, only pretending to be in control of their own actions. It is only until the 4th version, where the woodsman appears to tell the ""truest"" version of this story, exposing how fragile these people really are. Note that I say truest since his story is the only version of the events that are revealed to be an outright lie because of the exclusion of the bejeweled dagger. When we witness the fight sequence between the samurai and Tajomaru, the bandit, the first time it appears well choreographed like an elaborate dance number, with Tajomaru noting that he fought honorably and crossed swords 36 times. When we see the fight scene the second time, however, it is much more barbaric and fearful. The fright appearing through the slight trepidation on Mifune's hand during the battle. This dissonance between the perceived ""noble"" samurai and the brutality of war would be explored 4 years later in Kurosawa's own SEVEN SAMURAI. Many times throughout the film institutions based on trust and the unknown are explored, such as the priest and the medium. Their reliance only affirmed by the others' willingness to believe them. The film ends with a man stealing a blanket from a baby. When confronted by the priest he affirms his actions by shouting that we are no different from dogs. Selfishness is the only thing that provides for self-preservation and you can't trust anybody but yourself. This idea shatters the priests faith as this solipsistic notion puts all of mankind at odds against itself, painting a backdrop of war and conflict as a continuation of false bravado and self aggrandizement. At this point when the axeman tries to take the baby off of the priest's hands he is met with hostility as there would be no way to trust a bandit with the fate of a small child. It is not until the bandit reveals that he already has 6 other's that the priest reaffirms his faith by allowing himself to believe a complete stranger. Although this may seem like a tacked on happy ending, the film has set us up to assume that we cannot put our trust in anything but our own perceptions. The bandit could very well be lying to the priest and kidnapping the child for alternative reasons. Like the religion the priest blindly follows, mankind is an institution that we have to either commit to fully or not at all.",

But after watching Roshomon I was highly disappointed, too much hype of this movie and I won't even say it's good (forget great). I mean this is a drama movie involving 3 main characters and very limited freedom for director as far as visuals are concerned, since the movie repeats same story 4 times from different perspectives. So how strong or weak the movie is, is going to depend on - how spellbinding is storytelling and performance by protagonists. And alas Roshomon lags far behind expectations in both departments. Apart from Toshiro Mifune no one was able to hold the screen with their presence. Expressions were too weak to potray the kind of emotions, intensity and dilemma required for the storyline. As far as script is concerned for this genre of movies, audience shall feel connected to some character in the movie, but to me it wasn't the case, the characters were half baked.",
323,30 April 2010,brimon28,7, An intriguing mystery,"Having first seen this film 60 years ago in a 16mm print, I had the opportunity to see a restored 35mm print. The significance of this event is that I have mentioned more than once in reviews the influence of Rashomon's narrative technique, most recently in 'Avatar'. This new print shows the detailed close-ups, but it shows also the lighting flaws. Hanging reflectors in the trees to reflect sun into the shadows might have saved a few yen, but the movement of the light spots was sometimes disturbing. Artificial, to say the least. The sound in this well-equipped cinema emphasised just how unbalanced it was, both thematically and acoustically. Nevertheless, Rashomon has earned its place in the pantheon of iconic motion pictures. The complexity of the story remains a model for film-makers. Perhaps the acting is wooden; we expect more than lengthy shots of blank expressions. Only Eisenstein seems to have mastered that trick. The rain was well done, in contrast to,say, 'Singin' in the Rain'. The Japanese used dark colouring in the ""rainwater""; Hollywood used milk!",

When the movie first opens in which seems to be a rundown house, it has a very slow storyline, but after the first 20 minutes, I was drawn into the story and found myself thinking ahead trying to figure out the mystery that was going on. The movie seems to take place in the past, but I can only assume this because the people were using samurai swards and getting around by foot and horses. The acting in Rashomon was different, but not necessarily bad. You must remember to watch this movie with an open mind, and realize that it is completely different than American movies during this same time period. The editing and framing was pretty much what one would expect from an older movie, and did not affect the film in any negative way. Like I mentioned earlier, the plot seemed to develop kind of slowly, but picks up about half way through the film when you started to get different stories on the murder and tragedy that has happened.

327,10 March 2012,Scherzonoid,10, 62 years since its making and Rashomon still stays as the best story ever presented on celluloid. Full Stop.,"Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon has totally revamped my cinematic outlook. It is because of this sole reason that I find necessary to write this review . Rashomon is a very simple piece of cinema, a subtle plot handled with great passion and care, alluring the viewer into believing each one of the characters etched out by Kurosawa. Right from the first frame showing the commoner's run in the muddy water in the rain to the exemplary fight sequences of the husband and Mifune to the concluding final shot of the movie, everything shouts of a work of a true genius. No! correction; it is the work of a real and able-story-teller. I saw Seven Samurai before watching this one, and I can assuredly say this now that Kurosawa is a master story-teller. The way he manages the narration of any given story is a gift very few of us can imagine to possess. Movie-maker or not, the art of telling a story stems from the vast canvas of the mind that is thirsty of imagination after imagination, sprinting furthermore with grand images and visuals that are nothing short of an adventure with heaps of euphoria by the end of it. And cinema is the greatest gift for the mind to express its great voyages that take place so often and so beautifully. Kurosawa does exactly that; pick a story from some folklore and create the ambiance that almost perfectly replicates the one in his own mind, sculpt those amazing characters, fill in the scenes with marvelous music and tell the story as it is meant to be, by engaging the viewer quite effortlessly and convincingly. A good film-maker will most certainly know what he wants out of the cinema right from the onset of those colorful reveries in his mind, and etch out exactly that on the reel and on the screen. And by the looks of it, Akira Kurosawa didn't just master that art-form but actually enjoyed the magic of cinema. That explains his desire in inventiveness when it comes to technicalities as a director.",

352,30 April 2007,kingm8,7, Optimistic Outlook,"This film is Akutagwa's adaptation of two of Kurosawa's most famous stories, ""Roshomon"" and ""In a Grove."" The film sticks with the basic themes of the short stories yet it offers a bit of versatility because Akutagwa shares his optimism with the audience. As we see in both, the short stories as well as the film, the characters possess many flaws. When looking at the film we see what was the pioneering depiction of the unreliable character, an art form which has been duplicated everywhere from television cartoons to movies such as ""The Usual Suspects."" The metaphors presented in the film such as weather, nature and even the stories being told by each accountant unleash multiple dimensions that not only show unreliability, but also add different venues of possibility. The type of venues one would find reading a poem. So, in a matter of speaking, this film could be described as a form of visual poetry, furthermore, given the optimistic approach of the ending, Akutagwa provides the audience with an artistic outlook on humanity. There is a recurring theme of putting people's actions, thoughts, and beliefs on trial, as if in a way to measure their purity of heart. Obviously, Kurosawa believed that people were incapable of good, but Akutagwa shows us that even in a world where there is constant evil there is still room for good.",
353,2 May 2007,morganhiatt,7, Lying to Oneself,"Rashoman is a great foreign film that follows four different views from four different people that experienced the same episode. The episode was the story of a husband and wife, and a bandit that gets in the way of the couple's travels. This movie does not have a satisfying ending where it is revealed what really happened. All of these differing views do not give the ending any help either because none of them seem to overlap one another or have many ideas that are the same throughout them. This relates to the credibility of the people as well seeing that none of them seem to know what the truth is and it is about lying to oneself.",
354,1 May 2007,iterlongum,7, Rashomon - Japanese Crime Drama,"Rashomon is a combination of Akutagawa's stories, Rashomon and In The Groove. I was weary about the combination, but Kurosawa pulled it off with beauty and smooth transitions from one scene to the next. The scenery, which was all shot outdoors, was imposing but beautiful, consuming you in nature.",

356,7 September 2021,jahter,10, a great psychodrama,"Akira Kurosawa's movie about the subjectivity of constructing reality for some, but for me it's a terrific movie about the complexity of the concept of lies.",
357,30 August 2019,Murcii,6, It's more than just different perceptions!,"I can imagine how good was the cinematography of this feature comparing it to other films from the 50's, yet I couldn't enjoy the visual experience that much mainly because of the very small number of locations used for filming. I didn't like the acting style in some scenes as well, even though I can't judge whether it's realistic or not in the eyes of Japanese culture, but I found it just overly done anyway.",
