0,17 April 2001,MadReviewer,9, The Genius of Buster Keaton,"Probably Buster Keaton's best film, and oddly enough, it's not even a straightforward comedy  it's actually an action film, with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure.  `The General', which is set during the Civil War, is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton, of course) who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.  However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier.  Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North.  Johnny's efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girl's love  become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.",/
1,21 June 2006,imogensara_smith,10, Understated Perfection,"Buster Keaton once said that if he hadn't been a comedian, he might have been a civil engineer. He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. It's no wonder he adored trains, the most elegant of machines, and brought them into his movies whenever he could. When one of Keaton's former gag-writers loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War, he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this ""page of history"" to life. His first certainty was that the production had to be ""so authentic it hurts."" He even insisted on using historically accurate narrow-gauge railroad tracks, which he found, along with appropriate landscapes, near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove, Oregon.",r
2,27 May 2006,theowinthrop,10, The Greatest War Comedy ?,"It is ""generally"" (or should I pun and say ""General Lee""?) said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keaton's career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL. Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects, it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past, but getting the correct rolling stock, costumes, weapons, and props to make it look correct. And it worked so well that Keaton never really could (despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR.) out-do it. In fact, the closest thing to his best sound film (or film that he influenced that was a sound film) was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE, where he returned to a Civil War theme.",e
3,27 March 2017,AlsExGal,9, It is more appreciated now than when it was released,"This film flopped when it was released in late 1926 for several reasons. First, its premiere was delayed because ""Flesh and the Devil"" was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks. Second, people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian, not Buster the filmmaker and director, which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny, but it was not gag after gag, like so many of Keaton's other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South. A title card declares he has two loves - his girl and his engine. when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist, but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession. His girlfriend misunderstands, thinks him a coward, and says she won't speak to him again until he is in uniform.",v

6,1 May 2011,classicsoncall,7," ""If you lose this war, don't blame me"".","I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film, but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number #17 on the 2007 version of AFI's Top 100 Movies of all time list. It didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997, so even before seeing the picture, I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. I usually line up with the majority in most cases, but I have to admit, I don't quite get it with this picture. I found it entertaining enough on occasion, but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the DVD sleeve. I don't think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy, so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. Keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. On the flip side, I wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either, so at least I wasn't disappointed in that regard.",w
7,24 April 2006,planktonrules,10, Keaton is in top form,"I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. and that makes this review VERY difficult, because I really can't decide which of these two films is better. To me, they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed--at least when it comes to stunts and laughs. It's sad really, as just after these two triumphs came the sound era--and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career, as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material--pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante.

8,29 September 2016,Prismark10,6, The Locomotion,To me Buster Keaton is more unknown compared to his other silent era rivals like Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplain whose work were shown more often on British television. Maybe Chaplain is more appreciated in Britain because he was British.,r
9,6 March 2017,SimonJack,10, Keaton shows why he was king of comedy stunts,"""The General"" is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era. It's among the best movies of the talented comedy actor, Buster Keaton. In this film, Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts. His physical antics on and off his train, The General, support his title as king of comedy stunts. ",w
10,22 December 2003,Ben_Cheshire,10, Deserves its reputation: a masterwork.,"Buster Keaton's love of history, engineering and operatic displays of action are put to their finest use in his masterwork, The General. However unwelcoming the concept of an incredibly accurate historical movie about the civil war may seem, or a title which refers to an army rank, rest assured that The General is imbued throughout with a wonderful sense of fun, as with all Keaton. The pervasive irony running through The General is the fact that little Buster is helping fight the civil war just by happenstance - all he really wants to do is save his girlfriend. The appeal of The General may lie in its ability to take you back to what it would have been like in frontier America, its remarkable visual beauty (incredible cinematography), or possibly Keaton's trademark operatic stunts, the climax of this movie which is one of his most impressive (the famous bridge scene was the most expensive shot in all of silent cinema).",7
11,21 April 2016,anaconda-40658,8, Keaton Mans the Fort.,"The General (1926): Dir: Buster Keaton / Cast: Buster Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavender, Jim Farley, Frederick Vroom: High profile silent film about one's personal perspective. Buster Keaton plays locomotive engineer Johnnie Gray who desires to join the Confederate army alongside his fiancé's father and brother but he is refused when he becomes too important to his job. His fiancé, Annabelle is misinformed and claims that she will not marry him until he is in uniform. A year passes and her father is wounded. She travels to see him but the enemy takes over the locomotive and takes her hostage. Gray gives chase and many hysterical physical sight jokes occur. Keaton is a brilliant physical comic, as seen in his clever Sherlock Jr. He meets all obstacles on the track while also trying to prevent the enemy from conquest any further. Keaton performs stunts that are far beyond normal and prevails to huge payoff. Unfortunately he is carrying the film by himself because other characters are a bore. Marion Mack as Annabelle is the standard damsel whose personality is shallow given her reasons for splitting with him in the first place. The villains are just targets for prat falls and never emerge as frightening or interesting. That aside, Keaton creates a film with action, including massive chase scenes and explosive production values that were led into a future that had forgotten how it all began. Score: 8 ½ / 10",8

13,14 November 2002,lugonian,9, The Great Locomotive Chase,"THE GENERAL (United Artists, 1926), written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman, is an acclaimed comedy masterpiece from the bygone silent era that is essentially a Civil War comedy, or, a comedy set during the Civil War reportedly based on the historic Andrews Raid.

14,27 January 2008,vovazhd,10, An instant favorite,"I haven't had so much fun watching a movie for a long time. The General is a silent comedy (mostly slapstick) about Johnny Gray, a train engineer with two loves: his engine and Annabelle Lee. Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War (they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer). Things are then sped up a year, where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan. As it so happens, they steal Johnny's engine, a big mistake.",7
15,9 June 2007,ackstasis,8," ""If you lose this war don't blame me.""","It was an early Saturday afternoon, and I was searching about for a light-hearted comedic adventure film to keep me amused until dinner was ready. My eyes suddenly fell upon 'The General,' starring the inimitable Buster Keaton, and released in 1927. I had never seen it before, but  having greatly enjoyed the absolutely hilarious 'Sherlock Jr.' of three years earlier  I was more than willing to give it a shot. On its initial release, 'The General' was a mammoth box office flop, by and large disparaged by the critics, though time has been kind to the film. Today, it is rightly considered a comedy masterpiece, and is often the first stepping-stone for newcomers to discover the treasure-trove of silent comedic classics released by ""The Great Stone Face.""",1

Keaton's character must keep the engine running at all costs, and he's furiously shoveling wood into the furnace. His girlfriend taps his shoulder, and idiotically hands him a tiny twig to feed it. He threatens, for a split second, to beat her senseless with it. Then he kisses her. Then he gets back to the immediate business of keeping the train going.",?
19,1 April 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,5, Is anyone going to talk about the whole Confederacy thing?,"Let's get this out of the way first: 'The General (1926)' is a pro-Confederate film. Of course, its very Southern take on its Civil War setting may have just been an ill-considered backdrop for its mainly train-based stunts and occasional grand-scale battles but Keaton made a movie supporting the Confederacy, around sixty years after the war was over and with enough hindsight to see exactly what it was that each side was fighting for (and who was on the right side of history), whether he intended to or not. It mightn't sound like a big deal - and, perhaps, for the critically-minded viewer it isn't - but realising you're watching what's essentially propaganda (even if it never mentions the specific ideologies of either battling side) and seeing that flag being waved around not only by the 'heroic' side but by our 'hero' himself is disconcerting, to say the least. I mean, there is always the possibility that it's trying to be ironic or satirical. Even on retrospection, though, this seems like a bit of a reach because there's no real criticism; if its intention is to be satire, it falls incredibly short. I will also note that the picture is based on a 'true story', fairly loosely speaking, which goes some way in explaining the choices made. It certainly doesn't excuse them, though; after all, a story from the Union's perspective is not only possible (see Disney's 'The Great Locomotive Chase (1956)') but is also seemingly just as interesting, if not more so, and definitely isn't as problematic. I don't want to get too hung up on this but it did, fundamentally, dampen my enjoyment of the piece and I don't think it's helpful to ignore it just because the flick is undeniably well-made and pioneering. Look, it's not as if the movie is impossible to appreciate, either. Some of the stunts are superb and to think that this was filmed nearly a hundred years ago is simply staggering. Still, the movie, even on face-value, isn't as good as some of its peers. I'm not going to pretend that I'm especially familiar with Keaton's work but I do get the sense that he's best suited to shorter fare. This feels fairly long and most of it is just action without any real character or, even, story behind it. The action is mostly impressive, don't get me wrong, and it's all terrifically tangible, too, but there seems to be something missing. I suppose it could be the comedy, really, as the feature isn't all that funny. I'm not sure if it is trying to be, though, as most of its gags come across more as escalating action-beats than anything else. It could also be the heart, as a paper-thin and ultimately shallow romance is all we have to keep us invested in either of our leads. Nobody is really all that likeable, not even Keaton himself. This is actually a big part of what makes these pictures work: their ability to present us with a person and have us root for them right away, without the need for complex wants or needs. Here, that seems lacking. What you're left with is a visually-impressive action movie that isn't really all that exciting - mainly because the people involved don't feel like real characters and, as such, you don't truly care about them. It's not that engaging, either. On top of that, you have the unfortunate fact that it's pro-Confederate and, apart from anything else, that just leaves a sour taste in your mouth. 5/10",r
20,2 August 2002,gbheron,10, A Bona Fide Classic,"""The General"" is one of the best comedies every made, and as a silent film, that is saying quite a lot. Unfortunately, I did not see it theatrically, when I live in a city where that is possible. I just couldn't wait the years and years it might take before it's shown. But it certainly wasn't a wasted rental. If you are a cinemaphile, you've probably seen it already. If you'd like to see a Buster Keaton film, this is his best (although many are very close behind).

24,13 September 2015,willcundallreview,8, Keaton is one of the very best,"When you explore the world of silent movies you not only expect only music playing but also a world where physicality makes up for dialogue. The General of 1926 is one of those where its lead actor Buster Keaton seems to communicate with us the viewer via stunts, by also using his stone wall facial expressions but also utilises his surroundings to bring us laughs, but also just a sense of awe in how he does these things. In a day when doing production on a big scale was difficult, The General succeeds in bringing us massive crashes, great little things here and there for Keaton to use to get us to smile and of course a fantastic use of slow moving trains(who knew trains going 10mph could be so fun).",t

The premise is that Keaton, a train conductor, has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War, but been turned down.

34,10 June 2013,ironhorse_iv,9," My general feeling about the film is that it was one of the greatest movies, hands down.","It was pretty good for an movie that at the time of its release was considered a flop. Buster Keaton's career reached its creative apex here, but since it fail, Keaton lost his independence as a film-maker. In later years, the movie gain such a cult following, that it became one of the best silent films of that era. Buster Keaton stars as Southern railroad engineer Johnny Gray during the Civil War. Not. He is a man with only two loves: the sweet Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack) and his trustworthy engine, the confederate train 'The General'. The film was made during the height of Southern Renaissance of 1920's, but the film can also be a bit disturbing when you think about it. With a name like Johnny Gray, his character represent the Southern every man, while his two loves interested represent the antebellum south. Let's remember, 1915's Birth of a Nation, was only filmed a decade earlier and the racism was at its height in 1920's. Keaton's best works are somewhat ruined by his patent endorsement of the racist conventions of the time when he isn't a racist. No wonder why this movie got mixed reviews at the time. Some people in the North, though it portray the South too heroically and made the North seem like the villains for trying to reunited the country. While people in the South, love the movie because of its historical romance about the ""Lost Cause"" of the Confederate States of America. This movie doesn't feed or show anything racism, but can make some viewers feel disturb in what the movie's message is trying to put out there. Anyways, the war office rejects him as he's too valuable as a trained engineer. His sweetie rejects him thinking he is a coward. Only when union soldiers stole his steal his engine, and inadvertently kidnap Annabelle to plans to use the train to supply its soldiers in a sneak attack against the Confederates does Johnny has the opportunity to prove his bravery. Buster Keaton is great in the role, as he was a fan of trains in real life. He nails the humor with inimitably deadpan takes. I would have love more facial expressions than sad stone-faced, but it wasn't needed. Marion Mack was spunky, and fun to have around in the adventure. I love the scene, where Johnny ask her to get more firewood for the train. The General is based on a real incident during the American Civil War when Andrew's Raiders, a posse of northern soldiers hijacked a confederate train and a lone southern engineer found himself fighting the lot of them alone. It became known as Great Locomotive Chase. Since this film is from the silent era, and most films had little or no record of the original music. There are only three scores that work for this film. The first one is music arranged and directed by Robert Israel. The second one is the Theatre organ score by Lee Erwin. In my opinion, the best one is the one composed by Carl Davis. I wish he could have done the same for all of Buster's films. Buster was one of the best, so he deserves the best! I think it fits, the epic scale and dramatic tone of the film. The film is more than a just a comedy and deserves more than just a comedy score. It's a matter of interpretation I guess. Besides, Carl Davis is one of the best silent film score composers and his work for Thames Silents was instrumental in the resurgance of interest in silent cinema. Since Buster did his own stunts; one of the most dangerous stunts happen when Johnny sits on one of the side rods, which connect the drivers of the locomotive. The train starts gently and gradually picks up speed as it enters a shed. The visual effect of the forlorn Buster as the motion of the side rod moves him gently up and down is very poignant. But in real life, it is nearly impossible for any engineer to start any train moving this precisely. If he had not accelerated by exactly the correct amount, the rods would have moved so fast as to send Buster flying, certainly injuring or killing him. Some people think this is the movie that the actor broke his neck in, no it was another movie Sherlock Holmes Jr. (1924) that it happen. Yes and he broke his neck in the film, without knowing it, doing an railroad scene. The water tower broke while he was standing underneath it. The water came out with such force, it broke Keaton's neck. He didn't even know it. It wasn't this film. This film does hold the most expensive scene in the history of silent movies. The famous scene in question is when a bridge collapses and the train Texas falls into a river. In 1956, the film entered the public domain due to the claimant's failure to renew its copyright registration so you can pretty much find this movie anywhere. There are two copies to know of. There is the original full length film at 105 minutes long very rare to find. Then there is the copy abridged around 80 minutes long. Some people have attempted to explain the difference is the speed as the cameraman's decision to run the reels faster or slower. I found out that in a side by side comparison, there are over 200 differences where I could find cuts in footage. So there has to be missing footage. I like the 80 minutes version more. The Allied Artist version has no score, so it's nearly unwatchable. The Kino version isn't that great as well. Depending on what version you get, you might have great restoration or really bad restoration. Overall: must watch.",
35,12 October 2017,jamesrupert2014,8, Great comedy from the twilight of the 'silents',"Buster Keaton is ""Johnnie Gray"", a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier. Unfortunately, he's not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that he's a coward. Not so, because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine (the titular ""The General""), Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures, becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee. Glorious sight gags abound as ""Old Stone Face"" deals with errant cannon, loose sword blades, uncooperative firewood, inexplicable soakings and a less-than-helpful rescuee, not to mention an entire army of blue-bellies.

If we have developed a cliched sense of the Keaton persona - the stony-faced, melancholy dreamer, defeated by modernity and women, lost in an anguished, surreal, yet modern space, successful only in his dreams - then you won't find much of that here.  'The General' is not only historically grounded, it is set in perhaps the defining moment in American history, when the nation tore itself apart over the idea of what America was. ",

Ever since I first saw it on the big screen-not in 1927, mind you, but during a special showing in my university's theater-I fell in love with it and its leading man, Buster Keaton. It's simply not possible to watch this movie and not find a special place in your heart for Buster. He's incredibly talented, and a much better actor than most people give him credit for, and plays a ""stock"" character that's infinitely more likable than Charlie Chaplin's ""tramp"". Charlie is a scoundrel who makes mischief; life happens to Buster and he has to think of a way out of it. There are exceptions, of course, but thankfully, The General is not one of them.",
48,28 February 2001,sonofcohen,10, A Failure - only in it's time,"Having read through the various comments on this movie, I find it interesting that no one has yet mentioned that 'The General', Keaton's pinnacle was a flop in it's day.  There are various theories as to why such an excellent film bombed.  Some suggest that the American Civil War was simply too close at heart at the time.  Veterans were immediate family members.  Others suggest that Keaton's choice of making the Hero, Johnny, a southerner was an error.  (If I'm not mistaken, in the book - and true story - that the film is based on, the heroes were not Confederates, making Keaton's choice just a little pondersome.)",
49,16 May 2021,nickenchuggets,10, Probably Buster's best movie,"One setting we don't often see in movies is the american civil war. In a sea of world war 2 and occasionally world war 1 movies, it is a nice change of pace to finally see something different, and the General is a movie that will make audiences realize how revolutionary Keaton was. One thing that this movie isn't is an ordinary comedy. Keaton was mostly known for comedies, but the General sits in an awkward position between comedic and serious, and this has a lot to do with its war setting. The movie follows Keaton who is an engineer on a train when news arrives that the confederate army has just attacked the union controlled fort Sumter, thus starting the civil war in 1861. Keaton thinks it's an honorable thing to fight for one's country, so he rushes to a local recruiter to enlist. However, he's turned down because the army thinks he'll be more helpful as an engineer. A girl he likes refuses to speak to him again until he joins the army, and he's mistaken for a coward. He then embarks on a wild chase when union soldiers steal his train, and he eventually gets lost deep in enemy territory. A particularly funny scene follows where he breaks into a house to get food, but some union officers enter and sit down at the exact table Buster is hiding under. After escaping into the woods, Keaton manages to steal his train back, and a big gunfight between Northern and Confederate forces ensues. A union train sent to chase Keaton down later drives onto a bridge which collapses and takes the train with it, and Keaton is promoted to lieutenant at the end of the movie. I guess you can say this movie is technically a comedy, but the war setting makes you mostly forget about it. I do know that the producers chose a confederate as the main character, because they felt the audience wouldn't sympathize as much with a northern one (since they won the war). A little known fact about this movie: the scene where the union train drives onto the bridge and then collapses is actually the most expensive silent movie scene ever made.",

He brings his fast paced slapstick and wonderful comedy to life once again in The General. Playing a typical Buster Keaton underdog protagonist, Keaton tries to save the girl he loves by getting a locomotive and chasing some villains down the railway. The result is non stop, gut bursting comedy mayhem and also cinema's greatest train ride. It has a small dip half way through, but that's not enough to affect anything. It's impossible not to enjoy and jaw dropping slapstick fills the screen and Buster does various amazing stunts all by himself without doubles or special effects. The story is fairly straight forward but it's a good plot and the main character is very easy to root for.

Well, I personally won't go that far, though it does have its moments, namely because, especially in the silent era, there are movies that far surpass this particular film.

Considering its age (1927)it is as fresh today as it must have been on its release. So much has been written about it, and Keaton, it is difficult to enthuse without repetition, but anyone who hasn't seen it has a visual feast in store! The story is told logically with astonishing, faultless continuity. Photography, direction, acting are all impeccable. I never cease to be astonished by Keaton's amazing graceful stunts, mostly accomplished on a MOVING train. It took skill and courage to fall backwards onto the cowcatcher of a moving locomotive while holding a railway sleeper (tie) in his arms. And the ridiculous little figure sitting on the con rod as the train moves into the engine shed is my favourite piece of any film. I have recently updated my copy with a new remastered version on DVD including a new orchestrated sound track and tinting. I would strongly advise anybody interested in cinema to get themselves a copy and relish the experience... Definitely 10/10!",

What I didn't like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasn't brave, and then ends up staying with her at the end. He is too good for her. I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune. There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud, and scenes where I was bored. So unfortunately the film doesn't do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen, but overall it was enjoyable.",
60,13 September 2011,Hwos,7, Very entertaining film,"Buster Keaton 's performance in ""The General"" was purely enjoyable. The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray (Keaton) a train operator in the South. Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad, and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war. When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive. Johnnie's adventure includes train chases, rescuing the love of his life, a daring escape, and a climactic battle. This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect, but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama. Keaton's performance is superb. He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood, and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy. Keaton's character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best, and good decisions in dangerous situations. It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians, and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation.

It was a flop when it came out back in the mid-20s, but has since been re-evaluated as one of the best silent comedies of all time, and rightly so. Of course, Keaton's deadpan style isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but The General uses every tool in the comic's arsenal and comes out shining as a result.

Sit-coms repeat the same formula again and again until even the fans doubt why they are still tuning in.

72,7 September 1999,allyjack,10, One of the most satisfying of all movies.,"The movie has a grace and a sophistication that make most contemporary depictions of  action and incident seem instantly dated. Keaton almost seems spiritually melded with the train as he climbs all over it, effortlessly inches it forward or backward; the staging and pacing of the action is so perfect in its flowing clarity as to be almost mystical. Keaton grasps the full potential and beauty of cinema space - such as the cannon that after the fuse is lit slips downward to aim towards Keaton himself rather than the pursued train, but then (depicted in a single perfectly coordinated shot) encounters a bend in the  track as it goes off, and so hits its intended target anyway. Keaton hardly ever gives himself a close-up (really just a couple of shots), but when he does it underlines his almost surreal impassivity - it's almost impossible here to think of him having a voice or a rounded character - not because he's flat but because he's somehow transcendent. His philosophical remove resonates against the trickery-free, expansive handling of the action. The portrayal of the war scenes further suggests he could have been a great action or epic director.

Buster Keaton is a railroad engineer in the Civil War South who is rejected by the draft board but finds himself chasing--or being chased--by Union soldiers who have stolen his train.  The ongoing shenanigans are fresh and funny, the scenery is beautiful, and the action sequences are still impressive.  Keaton is marvelously deadpan throughout.

As its primary consideration, the film tells a classic story from the American Civil War, gently sprinkling the gags throughout the telling, without letting them overcome a very serious plot. While not Keaton's greatest COMEDY (this reviewer would suggest several of Buster's short subjects for that distinction), it is undoubtedly his greatest PRODUCTION, with the values of cinematography, storytelling, acting and comedy balanced in near-perfect harmony for a truly memorable film, and one that the worldwide movie-making industry would be deeply impoverished by its loss, should it be forgotten.",

83,6 March 2002,Damfino1895,10, Take it in the right spirit,"Reading through the comments I am gob smacked at the pretentiousness of some of the reviewers who are looking for and finding things that were never there in the first place. 'The General' is a motion picture, Keaton made it to entertain, to tell a story, it is not an analysis of the futility of war or any such thing, and it should be taken as Keaton intended it to be, nothing more. The one thing this movie does prove was that Buster Keaton was one of the greatest film makers of all time, not just of silent movies, his films are among the few silent movies to stand the test of time and be as fresh as when they were first made.  What happened to him after he went to MGM was nothing short of criminal, maltreated by a studio who took away his creative independence, then not knowing what to do with him put him in movies that wasted his incredible talents, it is a tragedy for Keaton , his fans and motion pictures. When watching this you wonder what he could have done had he been allowed to do what he wanted, after all, he was only 30 when he made 'The General', how much more did he have to give creatively, alas, we shall never know. The problem for 'The General', when it was made was that audiences were not so open minded, in the sense that once an actor or actress made a certain type of movie, they were expected to stick to making that type of movie, Keaton made slapstick comedies, so when 'The General' was made it was against type and people also found the humour too black, the first World War had been less than 10 years earlier and people being killed wasn't acceptable in a 'comedy'. But, back to my opinion of 'The General', it is, in my view, one of the most perfect films ever made, it captures the feeling of the time so well that you can almost believe it was made in the 1860's. even though we all know the moving camera hadn't been invented, but, you know what I mean. It is humourous, not meant to produce belly laughs, and the stunts are up to Keaton's usual excellent standards, there is hardly a pratfall in sight as they would be out of place. It is a film, that if you watch in the right frame of mind can sweep you along and it was over all too soon for me.  The pace never drags and all the leads are excellent. This is a beautiful film in every sense, I haven't bothered with a synopsis as others have gone ahead of me with adequate descriptions of the plot.  If you don't want to see it because it is 'black and white' or a 'silent' then all I can say is that it must be terrible to be that narrow minded and at the end of the day it is your loss.  There are films that are 70 and 80 years old that are superior to many churned out today, and I'm not just talking about Keaton's movie, do yourself a favour and rent one out and this ain't a bad one to start with.",
84,9 March 2011,spdowling,5, Incredibly impressive visuals but totally lacking in story,"Buster Keaton's The General(1926) would not be made in this day and age, at least not with the use of a real moving locomotive. Keaton risked life and limb performing many amazing and dangerous practical stunts on and around the moving train that provided for a great spectacle but without a strong story and strong characters the film becomes little more than a series of spectacular but meaningless stunts. The real love affair of the picture is between Johnny Gray and his beloved locomotive, The General. The Annabelle character is so shallow and empty that it becomes impossible to believe that Johnny would care at all about winning back her affections. Indeed, Johnny cares far more about getting his train back from the Union Army than he does about winning back Annabelle but the human love story just left this reviewer feeling cold. ",

So the little guy sets out to be a hero and that gets him into many scrapes which provides many opportunities for Keaton's comic genius to come to life, and that is why this film stands the test of time nearly 100 years later. There are so many classic moments that are utilized in comic montages that the simple story regardless of what side it was focusing on during wartime doesn't really matter too much.

However, I was too distracted by the plot and slapstick to notice a lack of what would usually entertain me. Because there is no dialogue in silent films, the actors must work extra hard at their craft, and Buster Keaton's deadpan comedic acting is a sure thing to make any skeptic silent film viewer laugh. Despite the time period and lack of effects, I was very impressed with the lighting, especially in the nighttime scene. Keaton and Mack were clearly seen and there were no confusion as to what was going on. Just as the lighting impressed me, so did the fact that I did not notice the lack of dialogue. The background music helped to tell the story, following the actions of the trains and actors. The music helped to show just what the characters were thinking. Truly an American Classic.",
97,23 June 2010,jboothmillard,9, The General,"I was very happy to have a watched my first great Sir Charlie Chaplin film, and then I was reminded of the magic created by Buster Keaton in the first film I saw him, Sherlock Junior, so I found this second film to watch. Basically Johnnie Gray (Keaton, also writing, directing and producing) is a railroad engineer who is love with his engine ""The General, oh, and his girl Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). The Civil War has come to America, and Johnnie wants to be the first of many to be recruited and fight, but he is turned away as being needed more on the railroad. Annabelle thinks he didn't even try, and won't speak to him until he is in a uniform, but he is her only hope when she ends up kidnapped by Union spies who also take The General. Johnnie has many mishaps, funny near miss accidents and unintentional avoiding of danger as he chases his engine in another, ""The Texas"", and he escapes death when the Union realise it's only one man chasing. During the night he sneaks into a house, which turns out to be where Annabelle is, and where the Unionists are hiding out, he even overhears their battle plan against the Confederates hiding under the dinner table. Dressed as a Union spy get-up, Johnnie and Annabelle get away in The General and speed away to warn of the plan, closely pursued by the Unionists. In the end, the battle does go ahead, but Johnnie, dressed in the Confederate's uniform saves the day, and is granted the honour of becoming a real soldier, and winning back Annabelle. Also starring Charles Henry Smith as Annabelle's Father, Frank Barnes as Annabelle's Brother, Glen Cavender as chief spy Captain Anderson, Jim Farley as General Thatcher, Frederick Vroom as Southern Confederate General, Frank Hagney as Confederate Recruiter, Joe Keaton as Union General and an unnoticeable Boris Karloff as Union General. Buster Keaton was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. I will admit, there was a really, REALLY tiny bit of me saying that Sherlock Junior was better (which it is in my opinion), and that I don't agree this is Keaton's best film, but no matter. I thought this was a really funny film, Keaton makes a very endearing character and a story with not just good laughs, but actually some good moments of fun action, it is definitely a must see silent wartime comedy. Buster Keaton was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 90 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 65 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 18 100 Years, 100 Movies: 10th Anniversary Edition, and it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

It might tell a slightly contrived love story (i.e. she'll only even speak to John if he is in a uniform despite a reasonable explanation why he's declined to fight at first), and some of its special effects sequences are near unbelievable, but Buster Keaton and collaborator Clyde Bruckman are so in control of their elements- of crowds, of the speed and intricacies and idiosyncrasies of the train, of Keaton in the midst of Civil War terror- that it's hard to see it as anything else but a classic of its time and beyond.",

Nor is the climbing made easier by cutting the whole scene up with editing. The camera, mounted on a second train running parallel to the first, sits well back and simply watches as Buster bounds from one end of the locomotive to the other, all in one smooth shot.

102,14 January 2009,zardoz-13,10, The Greatest Railroad Action Movie Ever Made!,"Ironically, Buster Keaton's all-time favorite film comedy ""The General"" (1927) flopped at the box office during its initial release. Critics and audiences alike panned this superlative American Civil War saga. Forty years later critics hailed Keaton's film a masterpiece, and it ranks among the top ten on virtually every critical short list of silents. Unlike his closest rival Charles Chaplin, who ingratiated himself with audiences as the little ""Tramp,"" Keaton remained aloof, never cracked a smile and acquired the nickname ""The Great Stone Face."" The fun of watching any Keaton film is the deadpan acrobat's titanic struggle to gain mastery over some form of machinery and adapt to the people around him. For example, in ""Steamboat Bill, Jr,"" Buster must win the girl, reconcile both fathers, and master operating a steamboat in the midst of a cyclone. This theme recurs in his best films, including include ""Our Hospitality"" (1923), ""The Navigator"" (1924), ""Sherlock Jr."" (1924), ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" (1928), and ""The Cameraman ""(1928), More than any of these Keaton topped himself with ""The General."" Introverted railroad engineer Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) has two loves: a locomotive named 'The General"" and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mac), his girlfriend. While visiting Annabelle, he learns that the Confederacy has fired on Fort Sumter. Annabelle's father and brother storm off to the recruiting station. Johnnie takes a short-cut to be first in line. Complications arise when Confederate officials refuse to enlist him. They judge Johnnie more valuable to the South as train engineer rather than a soldier. Repeatedly, Johnnie tries to enlist, and they finally give him the boot. When Annabelle's father and brother arrive, they urge Johnnie to join them, but he walks off. Johnnie is too ashamed to tell Annabelle the truth. She refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform.",

On the other hand a truly great film will suffer comparison with the best of later eras and so it is here. If one is new to Keaton, knowing only that he was a deadpan comedian who performed hilarious yet often dangerous stunts then this will be something of (in the words Oscar Hammerstein put into the mouth of the King Of Siam) a puzzlement; it boasts a more or less straightforward narrative in which engineer Keaton's train is stolen by Union troops during The War Between The States and he sets off in pursuit. Any gags occur naturally within this context rather than being contrived and the film is better for this.

For example, in the beginning when the main character, Johnnie Gray is in the home of his love, Annabelle Lee, the camera cuts to her father, who upon hearing a sound opens his door at the same instance someone opens the front door. The camera shows this from Johnnie Gray's perspective and creates a mirror image as the two men move identically. Another example is when Johnnie Gray and Annabelle end up lost in the woods after their escape from the Union household where they find themselves face to face with a bear and then Annabelle suddenly steps into a bear trap. Having the bear appear helps the audience make the connection between how the character managed to stepped into a trap.

118,9 July 2002,wkbeason,10, The best silent picture ever made,"Buster Keaton was the single most brilliant performer of the silent era.  He even eclipsed the extremely talented Charlie Chaplin - who has more of a following.  But, Keaton's stunts (he never used a double) and improvisational skill far exceeded anything Chaplin did while equaling Chaplin's penchant for subtlety, intimacy and humor.  Keaton's ability to play a scene with the perfect facial expression (a talent especially critical in silent pictures) also surpassed Chaplin's classic eye-rolling and mustache wiggling.  The General, which Keaton wrote and directed in addition to being the film's star, was an ambitious undertaking that showcased all of his abilities for creating empathy, tension, and zaniness in a way that - unlike virtually any other silent picture - holds up very well to most viewers even today.  Keaton's secret lies in his capacity to tap in to timeless aspects of human experience.  His style is sleek and melancholy without coming off as sentimental.  He is sophisticated and his stunts strike the viewer today as jaw-dropping and completely modern. Perhaps too modern in this film - which was a financial flop in its day. Trying to infuse the War Between the States with humor did not play well with mainstream audiences in 1927.  The General actually presented itself more effectively years later before audiences less affected by the times it depicts.  The film is flawlessly exciting, poignant, funny and technically satisfying in every respect.",

Can he get back with his gal and tell his confederates of the Unionist plans? There is something about the quality of the images - they are pretty much prefect; even when the train in rattling along a-pace. There are loads of skirmishes supporting a properly constructed, and exciting, story with plenty of drama and sometimes some quite scary bits too, all jammed into just over an hour.

The film is also a convincing slice of antebellum Americana, with Buster stepping out of a Matthew Brady photograph to play a Confederate railroad engineer who rescues his beloved locomotive (and his almost-as-beloved girlfriend) from Union Army hijackers. The film is occasionally more thrilling than funny, but the thrills, at least, are honest: when the Rock River Bridge collapses under the Union train, nothing is faked.

His mannerisms and expressions really sold the more dramatic moments and the story felt both familiar and somehow new, despite being almost 100 years old now. There was a brief bit of a pause as I realized we were following a Confederate wannabe soldier as he fought against the North to impress a girl. Not that it's a horrid story, just surprised because that's not the variation of that we often see, and given our current social climate it felt... Weird. My one and only negative would be the score.

135,4 February 2010,Molly04,7, Significant elements in The General,"I have just finished watching the General. Although it is a silent film, there are many ques from the background music that demonstrate the moods that the characters can't say for themselves. It's introductory music is light with an accordion sound being the most predominant. This instrument plays well into the beginning scene and appropriately represents the bustle of life during the mid 1800s (Civil War period...just before) In the second scene of this film the protagonist Johnnie Gray learns of shots fired upon Ft. Sumter and with the strong encouragement of his girlfriend, is on his way to enlist. However, Johnnie is turned down and told he is more valuable to the South as an engineer. During this scene the music is still mostly accordion, but is slow and drawn out to represent the disappointment Johnnie feels for being unfit to serve the South. Another interesting piece of music is during the fourth scene; while Northern generals exit the train they are accompanied by a sample of quickly paced string instruments to advertise the stealth of their actions. As the music quickens the train is stolen and their plot is underway. Aside from the appropriate music accompaniments, the cinematography and the way the story was written is quite clever. There is a certain sense of sarcasm and wit put into the writing of each scene and general direction of the film. It can certainly be seen through the facial expressions and manor isms of the actors. As for the way each scene was shot and edited, I was surprised that the transition between scenes (although there aren't many) are not choppy like I had expected but rather fluid and smooth. I enjoy the contrast between the smooth changes in scenes paired with the busy/excited acting. Due to this enthusiastic style of acting, it seems as though The General has a stylized approach.

Keaton shows what life was like in the south, particually the conscription act of 1862; which is when Keaton tries to enlist but is told he is no use to the south. Then, Keaton's girlfriend refuss to talk to him until he is in uniform. When she is kidnapped, the locamotave chase begins as he sets out to find her, which is one of the funniest scenes in all of cinema. Keaton's gags and jokes make this movie enjoyabe, and I would recommend this movie over any other movie of the 1920's. I am proud to give this movie a 9/10.",

Buster Keaton is the icon of the successful comedy writer/director/actors in the 1920's.  It just so happens that ""The General"" is a history lesson as well, and scholars at the time felt that this movie was about as authentic looking as a Matthew Brady photograph of the Civil War.  It contains the most expensive stunt done up to that time-the locomotive plunging into the river (not a model).  The movie was a labor of love from Keaton and crew and deserves to find a place in movie history long after other silents of the era have disintegrated. After viewing this movie, go on to ""Our Relations"" and the other fine(and perhaps funnier) movies that Keaton made, and discover the two-reelers, especially ""Cops"".  But this one is special.  It is right out of your history book.",

Taking place during the American Civil War, the General stars Buster Keaton as a little man who wants to be a Confederate soldier. Ironic for its time, I'm shocked that Buster made the hero character a southern confederate soldier and not a union soldier. While it must have been taken in good terms with the southern audience at its time ( along with Birth of a Nation ) I wonder how audiences in the North felt about Buster's film? Still, this is not a movie about war, it is a comedy about the little guy (Keaton) and his train. Like most of Chaplin films, he is the victim in an imperfect world. The comedy is found in Keaton's actions. This is his best comedy.",

Also, even they look relatively simple particularly due to the absence of sound and lack of color, the stunts look pretty much sophisticated and highly risky. Yet then again I couldn't really enjoy silent movies so I can't really score this movie high. The acting overall is actually nice.

The version of that DVD is the one with 75 minutes only and the picture and the sound of it is quite good. Anyway, I saw it last night, quite late but I knew since the beginning that this film could keep me awake easily and it did that. Keaton is Johnnie Gray, a train engineer and s because of his work that he wasn't accepted in the Confederate Army. Is fun how actually this is good since Gray is not accepted because his actual job is quite important but of course Johnny doesn't know that so he can't tell anything when his girlfriend (Marion Mack) believe that he is a coward, thanks to what her father and bother said, and left him.

I have not seen many silent films in my life, but I am a fan of Chaplin. I scratch my head in disappointment given the praise that was sung. Still, there is much to admire. Keaton did all the stunts, even the more dangerous stunts, with such acrobatic grace. The first ten minutes are great. The scene where Keaton is turned away from the Confederacy because of his ""train engineer"" status and the subsequent walk to his love's house is fantastic.

Growing up on Jackie Chan movies I've always found live stunts exciting and the stunts in The General are very compatible to today. These stunts add such suspense to the movie that you almost forget that it's a silent film, putting this film right up there with today's Hollywood blockbusters.

It's a totally one-of-a-kind film, and completely pleasurable and engrossing from start to finish. It's been said that it isn't properly a comedy, but I think once one starts watching it doesn't matter: the simple and human but methodical and intricate story of how Buster sets out singlehandedly to rescue the train and woman he loves is so absorbing that when the comedy (which is as musically times as the rest of the film and all hits home) stop we are too busy being thrilled by the stunts, coincidences, and stunning set pieces to notice, and when these stop we are too busy laughing to care.",

The General was one of the first silent movies that I was ever able to sit though long enough to fully appreciate the medium. It had everything, drama, comedy, action, romance. It was also pretty much true to the real event also. My favorite part is when Keaton has rescued the train and his girlfriend and they are escaping the federal troops in full pursuit. His girlfriend having run out of wood to stoke the engine hands him a twig. Keaton looks at the twig and thinks about hitting the girlfriend but instead hugs and kisses her.

Out of those 4 The General is my favorite, my favorite of all films. The fact that The General manages to illustrate such a straight forward story and turn it into scene after scene of brilliant physical comedy is what in my opinion makes it so outstanding.

173,6 July 2020,dr_clarke_2,10," Despite being nearly a century old, it still manages to raise a laugh","The General is probably Buster Keaton's best known film, but it's probably the case that most people who have heard of it nowadays have only seen clips from it. Silent black-and-white movies don't have the audience they once had, with home media and online streaming sales probably limited to aficionados of cinema and film students. But if you can cope with the idea of a silent comedy, then The General is a good place to start: despite being nearly a century old, it still manages to raise a laugh.
Keaton once said that The General is the film he was proudest of, because it is based on a true story and he tells it in detail. It is indeed based on actual events, specifically the theft of a train by the Union Army during the Civil War, and the screenplay - partly written by Keaton and his co-director Clyde Bruckman - works as a solid piece of storytelling. It sees railway engineer Johnnie Gray (Keaton) setting out to retrieve his beloved train (the titular General) from the Union agents who stole it, and culminates in a climactic battle and Johnnie regaining the love of his fiancé Annabelle Lee after she earlier spurns him when she thinks he has refused to sign up for the army. Interestingly, Keaton didn't think that audiences would accept Confederates as villains, so the Johnnie Gray is a Southerner who tries and fails to enlist in the Confederate army before thwarting the Union Army almost single-handedly; this now dates the film more than anything else. Notably, the film also falls into the very small handful of films that might be described as ""war comedies"" and - unusually - it includes comic sequences in which people die.
But whilst the plot and the characterisation is well thought out, the main attraction is of course Keaton the actor, clowning his deadpan way through the film and performing stunts that still astonish today. It's pure slapstick, mostly based around one of the trains that feature heavily, and Keaton performs with such effortless choreography that it can't help impress: that in itself doesn't make it funny, and yet despite its age it remains one of those rare silent comedies that retains its power to make the audience laugh, not just admire the physicality of its central performance.
The General is also remarkably well made, acting as the best showcase there is of Keaton's (and Bruckman's) skills as a director. Shot largely on location and using real trains, it's an impressive piece of film making. The dynamic camera work of cinematographers Bert Haines and Devereaux Jennings, who mount cameras on moving trains and include a wide variety of impressive shots, is ahead of its time as indeed is Keaton's editing. The crash of the Texas looks particularly good (probably because it was achieved by buying and crashing a real train!), as does the well-staged battle between the Union and the Confederate Armies at the climax of the film. Less obviously, the sets and costumes both reflect the detailed research into the period that Keaton carried out.
Mention should also be made of Marion Mack, who gives an excellent performance as Annabelle Lee, playing straight-woman to Keaton for large chunks of the movie. She's especially good as his foil during the sequence in which Johnnie rescues Annabelle, as he gets hit by a lightening-struck tree and surprised by a bear, and Annabelle steps in a bear-trap. Keaton makes an unlikely romantic lead, but somehow his hangdog expression makes him rather endearing.
The General is the sort of film that cinephiles like to wax lyrical about and which most people born in the last century have never seen. But it's celebrated amongst film fans for many reasons, but the most compelling one is that it is still really funny.",

The General is one of several Keaton films set in a historical period and the film's budget certainly pays off when it comes to recreating Marietta, Georgia circa 1861 at the outbreak of the American Civil War. There are great amounts of historical detail within every frame from the buildings to the costumes and the grand locomotive, The General itself. On a purely visual level, The General may be Keaton's most visually stunning film, full of lush shots of Oregon landscape (although the film itself is set in Georgia) which would make even John Ford jealous. The destruction of the locomotive on the burning bridge is one the most ambitious shots of Keaton's filmography. However, my favourite shot in all of The General occurs during the climax in which Johnnie Gray (Keaton) holds the Confederate flag amidst battle - the type of cinematic shot that is forever imprinted in your mind. The scores by Carl Davies are the most ideal accompaniment for Keaton's films and The General is no exception from quirky moments to more epic and militaristic arrangements, as well as rousing standards such as I Wish I Was In Dixie.",

Buster was a comedy pioneer and stunt specialist, yet, despite modern attempts to lionize this film, not without its great aspects in staging scenes, did err in trying to turn Civil War oddity (train trade-offs) into laughs. What is curious is that one of his players, former Giants great Mike Donlin (US General), erred in similar fashion, leaving MLB (.333) for an acting career where he hit around .200 (bit parts).

The plot is as follows (don't even call it a spoiler because it's so simple): The evil Yankees steal Buster's train and his girl. He gets both back and thwarts an insidious attack of the Yankees on the heroic and good Southerners. The end. I don't want to go into the political incorrectness of the film (pro slavery), it's only about artistic aspects. The film was produced with a relatively large technical effort and contains action scenes that are remarkable (I wonder, however, if Buster disposed of the train that was sunk in the river properly). The film is absolutely not funny and hardly entertaining. Many of the ""gags"" seem rather embarrassing and far-fetched, I laughed even less than Buster himself (a.k.a. as the man who never laughed). All in all, this film has confirmed that Buster Keaton is immensely overrated as an artist. On a scale of 0 to 10, Charlie Chaplin gets 10 points, and Buster 1 point.

The gags themselves are gracefully athletic and consistently come unexpectedly, given Keaton's slight build and features that make him look old beyond his years. He plays a train engineer whose attempts to join the Confederate army are rebuffed (as are the affections of his beloved, believing him to be a coward) but who almost single-handedly manages to win a major battle by using his train to confound the Union army. There's great attention paid to detail--quite a bit is happening both in the foreground and the background of the frame--and the jokes are both laugh-out-loud funny and amusingly ironic; but Keaton's genius is his ability to isolate the individual within the crowd and draw out that individual's endearing strengths--his connection with each member of the audience is subtle but sublime.",

The event that inspired Keaton has been named ""The Great Locomotive Chase,"" as it had volunteers from the Union Army taking command over a train, planning to do damage on the Western and Atlantic railroad. Predictably, Keaton's version also provides a love story, but first and foremost in order to give our hero a personal reason to expose himself to so much danger in the first place. Johnnie Gray, as Keaton is named in the film, does not prove to be particularly informed as to what this big war is about, being mostly concerned about his sweetheart Annabelle who is kidnapped, as well as his own train THE GENERAL. Commentators suspecting Keaton for having had political motivations when he chose to present himself as a Southerner in this film, do themselves a disservice; much like Charlie Chaplin and unlike Harold Lloyd, Keaton refused to let his character ever truly win a battle, even when the last frame seemed to have him relatively happy.",

But there is one thing that makes this movie unusual. Unlike most Civil War movies, which depict both sides of the conflict in the same way, the Union soldiers are depicted as the enemy, and the heroes are the Confederates, which makes ""The General"" a rare brand of cinema.

The General isn't just one of the best films of the silent era; it is also one of the greatest films ever made. The film is just barely an hour long, but it has so much action packed into that hour that it feels longer, in a good way. Many of today's ""action"" movies don't have half as much action in them, despite being twice as long as The General. Buster Keaton tells a brilliant story and doesn't need many intertitles to do so, as the silent action on film is often enough to progress the story in itself. While there are plenty of laughs in the film, there are also plenty of moments in which the viewer is on the edge of the seat. The stunts in The General were pulled off without any special effects or stunt doubles, as Keaton preferred to do his own stunts.

I find the newer comedy today more funny then the silent films. I like to be able to hear the tone in peoples voices and how they present their tone of voice if it is sarcastic or if they really mean what they are saying. I like Adam Sandler because he really does a good job displaying that. I am not taking anything away from this movie because it was the best they could do back then. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the silent comedy movies. There are some parts in the movie where i laughed but it was not comedy compared to what i am used to watching today.,

While this film was by no means a heavy drama there was a lot more action than I expected. I was very impressed by the stunts that Keaton performed throughout the film one in particular was when he was riding on the front of a moving train. The other aspects of this film that caught my eye were how elaborate and different the scenes were. At the start of the movie Buster and and Marion Mack were sitting in a living room and then a few moments later Buster's character is in a rural town square filled with other individuals and buildings, all seemingly realistic. The shots that incorporated the moving trains were stunning, they accurately displayed the speed that the train was moving and helped me to feel like I was a part of the action. I was surprised at the range all of the actors were capable of performing in. While the dialog was shown to the audience there were instances were facial expressions and body movements were all that were necessary.

Buster Keaton shows his comic inventiveness and passion for love. he and the cast pull off a tremendous job in this movie and i would recommend this movie to anyone!",

The action scenes really contrast the sterile, synthetic action in most of today's movies. Not to mention the continual, high level of excitement and involvement. The train scenes are extremely involving. Especially since it's pretty obvious that Keaton is actually risking his own safety/life in some of the stunts. ...You're really concerned for his safety. Keaton is an artist. The stunts alone are impressive, but what is really incredible is the way all of the motions and stunts completely involve the character's personality. It's really incredible to watch. A ton of money must have been put into the movie, as so much is destroyed. Loved the train crash. The movie a valuable experience, because there's not even a real possibility for a modern-day parallel.",

The story of a southern civil war era engineer who singlehandedly foils a northern attack, this film is as enjoyable as it is rewarding. Keaton creates an exciting and suspenseful chase throughout the film, full of funny moments. The best are the interactions between Keaton and Mack. The two form a dysfunctional and comedic pair while they are escaping the north in a stolen train, but work well as romantic interests. Keaton's heroic actions against the North are creative and resourceful, and his fitting promotion at the end of the film leaves viewers feeling fulfilled.",

For example, in the romantic scene when the main character went to help the lover, the piano was performs in the romantic tune. In addition, there are many jokes which are showed by the main character. These jokes make the movie more attractive because they entertain the audience by combining with many kinds of instruments in appropriate way. Moreover, the action scene that the main character chased the another army to help the lover was very excited ,and I like the ideas of both to obstruct each other during driving the train. However, I think the scene that there is the thunder should makes more scary and looks more real including to the sound of the thunder.",

His Character is not allowed to join the southern army in the civil war because as an engineer he is valuable to the south. I never thought a Silent film would make me laugh and intrigue my mind as much as it did. Buster Keaton does a terrific job as he navigates the general back to safety and back to the south. The Sequences and Cuts in the film were so smooth you couldn't tell when a new scene stopped and another began. The stunts he also performed going from rail-car to rail-car while maintaining speed on the General were simply amazing and unheard of at that time. To learn that he did his own stunts is truly amazing because of the difficulty involved in doing them, any of which were spectacular if not dangerous. Keaton does a great job of being funny also, using everything around him at his disposal whether it be the wood he cuts up to fuel the train, or the things he does when he is off the train, he makes simple things so interesting. He also shows the courage of a man trying to get his train back and the unwillingness to give up and his will to prove everyone who doubted him on his way back to the south.",

However, what makes ""The General"" a great movie is the action/adventure aspect combined with funny situational comedy, opposed to the slapstick, physical comedy which Chaplin executes flawlessly. I found Keaton's slapstick in ""The General"" to be forced and redundant. Keaton's same sad-sack, dead-pan expression, after every physical gag, is the worst part of the film.

On a mission to rescue her from kidnappers, Gray provides us with a bevy of laughs. Keaton's physical strength and stamina allow him to perform feats that actors today wouldn't even consider trying.

The actors were very talented and even though they were doing dangerous stunts, they managed to pull off a really great comedy. The humor in this movie is a lot of good old slapstick with some physical comedy to really sell the point that the movie is a classic comedy back in the days when movies were still silent.

The story line was very interesting to me, especially how it was Based on a true story. A man in love with his engine and his Fiancé. Johnnie Gray is a talented engineer who enlists in the confederacy along his girlfriends brother and father. The confederates saw him as a very valuable engineer more so then a soldier so he was denied, but they never said why. Due to this his girlfriends family thinks he's a coward, and she cannot go near his engine ever again. The northern army steals the General and johnnies girlfriend. Johnnie is after the northerns and he reaches the Texas, another engine like the General. Johnnie picks up a large cannon at one point, but realizes it's too much danger for him to handle. He gets to close to the enemy territory and abandons the Texas. Johnnie finds the house his girlfriend is in, changes clothes to blend in, and rescues his girlfriend and the General! They go home as fast as possible. They are being pursued by the northern army. They set booby traps to slow down the army. They arrive at the town. When the battle commences, the Texas drives over the bridge, just for it to be destroyed and the engine is sent flying into the river. Johnnie then joins the fight and is a big impact. The north retreats. Johnnie realizes he captured a 4 star northern general, he goes to March him away and a southern general stops him, and commissions him a confederate soldier, and a Lieutenant rank for what he's done. He gets his girlfriend Annabelle and his engine back. What I liked about this movie is the cut scenes in between scenes that tell you what's going on, sometimes it's hard to put the pieces together but especially in a silent movie!

What I found interesting was that this film felt more like an action film with comedic elements, rather than just a comedy. From the moment The General is stolen, up until the very end, the action truly is non-stop. The stunts performed in this were intense for the times and actually pretty dangerous, which opened my eyes to the risks Keaton was willing to take for his comedy and acting. While the comedy was primarily slapstick and obviously silly, it never felt out of place during this film. I would highly recommend it as a view into this time period of filmmaking.",

The film is packed full of comedy, suspense and drama. The film takes place during The Civil War, which is what makes it more dramatic because it is a true event. This dramatic event is dressed up in hilarity and suspense and this really works. For example, the scene with the cannon. The cannon's wick slowly burns down as Johnny scrambles over the train, away to safety. In this scene the cannon is pointing straight at Johnny and seconds away from firing. The cannon becomes detached and at the last second the train turns and the cannon fires. This scene works because the intensity builds and Johnny is frantic but the cannon never does any harm in the end. The scenes with the train were very expensive for it's time but so successful and perhaps why the movie was especially comical.

I have yet to come across a film that can so combine humor, epic, and insight as Buster Keaton managed to with The General.  For a man who once claimed that ""No man could be considered a genius in vaudeville slap shoes and a flat hat"" he certainly proved himself wrong.  The General is the work of a genius, no less.",
242,24 January 2019,haondoor,8, The Loudest of Silent Films,"Silent films have never peaked my interest, and although I have never actually laid my eyes on something that would be considered a silent film, the preconceived notion of heavily made up men, running around in a black and white world, displaying their emotions melodramatically, was more than enough to deter me from ever wanting too. However, after finally forcing my eyes open for a measly hour and a quarter, I can now say that I have sat through a classic silent film, and it has changed my life.
For some reason, in my ignorance, I had chopped up all early silent films to be the cavemen equivalent of a now-booming 41.7-billion-dollar industry (2018) and boy was I wrong! The spectacle alone was extraordinary to witness, even if it was not in HD 4K High-Definition Color vision. The amount of money necessary to create Buster Keaton's world of locomotion and action was equivalent to a blockbuster film present day. Keaton's creation of what now most people would consider PG comedy, much like Mr. Bean or Pink Panther, is limited only by Keaton's imagination. The use of mortars, montages of chases, full scale steam locomotive crashes, as well as, an assortment of physical straight-faced comedy that appeals to all ages, blew my mind in a way that I could not believe possible in the early years of filmmaking. Modern camera angles are prevalent and widely used, characters are relatable and although larger than life, seems to possess the same amount of emotional honesty that contributes to the film extradentary, and the overall grand scale of the films can only be explained by its reenactment of a civil war battle.
Although the plot is not the best and by no standards does it compete with modern day action/adventure films like Fast and Furious. Buster Keaton's ability to bring to life a character that tickles the audiences' funny bones, while at the same time conceive of thousands of camera angles and shots that match most professional filmmakers present day, as well as, stunts and action sequences that appeal on a grazioso scale, make this film a definite must-watch now and for its own time period, makes it, understandable, one of the greatest films of all time.",

Buster Keaton was brilliant in his role as Johnnie and his actions were truly funny. Also, Marion Mack was superb as Annabelle Lee and her relationship with Buster Keaton in the film felt genuine. Buster Keaton was a monumental figure in the history of American Cinema and movies like The General only back up that claim. this and other films prove how well of a film maker Keaton was. The making of this movie took an extensive amount of time including the most expensive stunt in history at the time but it did not go to waste with the good story and mood this film conveys to the viewer.",

An actor and filmmaker? I don't get the impression that this is the path he should have chose. This whole film is about the choice that he has to make, it's either leave his beloved profession of being a a railroad engineer or he enlists in the army and serves his country. The woman he loves wants him to enlist into the Army however they wont let him because his profession is too important to just leave. without too many spoilers this was a very good film with a good mix of comedy and romance.",

The lack of verbal interaction leads to a heavy focus on body language and how characters perform and what facial expressions they have. The film is set during the civil war and is about a young train engineer who needs to save his beloved lady and his second love, his train. The film is clever using funny actions and techniques to entertain the audience with no sound. Lastly, I started to realize that Buster Keaton reminded me a lot of Ezra Miller and that they have similar mannerisms and look alike.",

I will admit that there's a learning curve to silent movies after growing up with instant gratification in movies with tons of items on screen along with audio to pay attention. However, Buster Keatons act in this made this movie amusing to watch. The train stunts while time consuming, were impressive to see and elevated this movie. The stunt coordination throughout this movie is just as impressive as anything else. I think the movie did a tremendous job at being serious when needed and silly when appropriate.",

It reminded me of ""Speed"" but in sepia and 80 years earlier. Buster Keaton does a great job on his stunts and is no doubt a protégé of Chaplin's. The sound in the film is comical at times, yet understandable on why they did it (small drum rolls for the train sounds, sharp snare hits for gunshots, and a weird cymbal thing they were doing for the lightning storm during the escape). One of my main criticisms is that it was hard to get past thinking that Keaton was doing Chaplin, but so expressionless on his face. He even had the same white makeup on his face, dark eyeliner, and frizzled hair. But Keaton's had far more of a danger element and could be called an action movie as much as a comedy.",

Buster Keaton brings athleticism, drama, romance, and suspense to the table with this film. I was pleasantly surprised with how Buster Keaton uses so much acrobatic moves during the movie. There was a point in the film when Keaton is part of a train chase. He has to run back and forth on top of the train to see where the bad guys are and to grab wood to keep the train moving. I thought this movie was interesting because it had so many genres of movies all in one. As the audience, you can tell when the movie was switching genres, especially to suspense; I felt there was a certain song that they used during each scene so you could tell. This did not have as much silly humor in it although it did have it's subtle comedic moments and it would be one I would recommend to someone else because it has a little bit of everything.",

I just cant believe how easy the acting looks and its just hysterical. Being a silent film, all the actors have to do is just act like there lost and its just hilarious in my opinion, probably because of my lack of knowledge with silent films. I didn't like how almost the entire film they stayed on the train. The camera view never really left the train. I think if someone was to remake this movie now in the 20th century or if they haven't so already that it would be really good. I deffinantly recommend this film if your a fan of silent films.",

It had everything from romance and comedy to action and history. Buster Keaton plays a wonderful character (Johnny Gray) who doesn't let anything scare him. He is completely fearless and in the end gets the girl and his locomotive.

As a card states Johnnie only has two loves; his train engine and Annabelle. Shortly after, as he tries to enlist, he is turned away as the military believes his profession of an engineer is too valuable for the South to lose in combat. The scene following this shows Johnnie sizing himself up to the other men, noticing that he is much smaller than them and being portrayed as an underdog. Even Annabelle's family calls him a ""disgrace to the south"" and recalling that he ""never even got in line"", in addition, Annabelle believes this over Johnnie's word and tells him she never wants to see him again unless he's in a uniform. This sets Johnnie up for his path to redemption. During a surprise attack, the Union steals Johnnie's train and by extension Annabelle accidentally. Johnnie then has to save his loves.
