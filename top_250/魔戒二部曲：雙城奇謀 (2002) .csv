0,12 August 2010,Loving_Silence,10, An Epic in every sense of the word.,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.",/
1,28 December 2005,classicsoncall,10," ""There's some good in this world Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.""","""The Lord of the Rings"" continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy, as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight.

Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.",r

3,19 March 2005,Boba_Fett1138,10," Absolutely, totally fantastic!","Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!",v
4,8 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, My personal favourite of the trilogy,"I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. ",i
5,19 December 2002,rc_whittle,10, A standing ovation for all concerned.,"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.",e
6,3 March 2023,EVON1TY,10, One of The Best battle sequence.,"Even if I watched this movie, like more than 20 times, still I feel nearly the same as I first watch.",w
7,2 March 2023,EVON1TY,10, Helm's Deep could be the greatest battle sequence of all time.,As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.,/
8,18 December 2002,JohnLennon1985,10, My precious...,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.",r
9,5 March 2006,calcat91355,9, Magnificent epic,"The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.",w
10,27 January 2003,Theo Robertson,9, My Visit To The Cinema,"Don`t you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas . But it`s a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January , popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained",7
11,30 December 2004,Mithrindir,10, A True Fantasy Movie,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.",7
12,18 December 2002,bopdog,10," Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!","I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!",6
13,12 December 2005,MaxBorg89,9, The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:",1
14,5 August 2004,Barky44,9, Tough to put on film but came out very well,"Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.",9
15,19 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Fantasy greatness with one of the best sieges put on film,"Well, I'll be darned if this isn't one of the best epic movies I've ever seen in my life. And am ever likely TO see in my life. Following in the footsteps of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, Peter Jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold, offering one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters. Thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of Tolkien's trilogy, Jackson now has time to focus on developing characters, perilous quests, and, of course, out-and-out action. I'm an action lover at heart so I was in seventh heaven watching this movie. Everything you could want from the second book is here, up on screen and even more amazing than Tolkien could render. Plus, Jackson has done his magic and inserted a few memorable scenes of his own so there are plenty of surprises even for those who know whats coming.",0
16,26 August 2008,fearfulofspiders,10, The Sequel That Dwarfs Its Predecessor...,"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was a fantastic start to Tolkien's epic tale. The only true weakness of The Two Towers -- if you can call it a flaw -- is that the film is the middle-child, in that it has no beginning and no end. Though it starts out where the first ended, The Two Towers begins with a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog as we continue to see their fight as they plummet thousands (if not miles) of feet through gaping chasms in the Mines of Moria.",5
17,27 April 2004,OriginalMovieBuff21,10, The Best of 2002!!!! Another masterpiece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy!!!,"The Two Towers is another masterpiece of returning after Fellowship of the Ring. This had excellent and brilliant action. Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares, it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film. Go LORD OF THE RINGS, BABY!!!!!!!!!",/
18,18 June 2019,hanifmuhammad92,10, The Definition of Epic!,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a ripping roaring success. It's in the company of Great sequels that manage to match the original film in nearly every way. it doesn't quite have the narrative focus the Fellowship of the Ring has but it more than matches it in overall quality. The Film delves much deeper into the Lore of Middle Earth than the original film and adds a host of welcome additions to the awesome roster of characters. In short it's pretty much everything you can ever want and more.,?
19,11 March 2015,fernandoschiavi,9, A film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in Return of the King,"A year after the release of The Fellowship of the Ring, all moviegoers were more than eager to continue the first masterpiece of the XXI century. The Two Towers comes with the huge responsibility of maintaining the fascination left by the first movie, introduce more characters and various others having to be even grander. And he does this goal perfectly. Battles unthinkable, many new important events happening, new characters emerge, and even better effects finalized and dramas more pronounced, are just some of what The Two Towers has to offer. In The Two Towers, the journey continues to seek the destruction of the One Ring. ",r
20,13 June 2006,MinorityReporter,10, The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!,"The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.",e
21,15 December 2003,raymond_chandler,10, Extended Edition is definitive Tolkien,"I have loved Tolkien's masterpiece since I was 10 years old. I bought the calendars by Brothers Hildebrandt all through college, and I have eagerly awaited the movies since they were announced some four years ago. I just saw the Extended ""Two Towers"" last night at the Seattle Cinerama, and I was absolutely stunned by how improved it is over the earlier edit (which I saw three times in theatres). As good as ""Fellowship"" is, I feel that the restored ""Two Towers"" blows it away. ",f
22,6 March 2004,John_Mclaren,10, The Greatest of the Three Rings,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.",_
23,7 July 2007,FilmCreature,10, FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers',"You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.",=
24,10 February 2004,jasonmg99,10, If there was a spotlight for all time movie reviews it would be this trilogy-to-be-one film,I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.,t
25,23 August 2020,kodiakblack,10, MASTERPIECE,I've watched these movies over and over and I always notice something new each time. So much went into these movies.

26,19 December 2002,jedsalazar,10, Beautiful Perfection,"The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful.  This film left me breathless.  I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.  I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.",_
27,16 July 2009,Tweekums,10, Exciting fantasy sequel,"This film starts off where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" leaves off; Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.",u
28,18 July 2018,caseyt-48511,9, Possibly the best Middle Chapter Ever,"Along with The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers is the perfect middle chapter.

29,1 September 2003,CharlestonNole,9, A Shout Out to WETA!!! Truly Awesome!,"First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever.  However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short.  Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players.  We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures.  Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's  more intimate look at the characters.  This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them.  They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.",v
30,5 April 2014,Al_The_Strange,10, LOTR TTT Review,"In The Fellowship of the Ring, the film saga of the Lord of the Rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. It meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. The adventure continues in The Two Towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. Only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience.",
31,18 December 2002,joe_unander,10," If you're a fan, that's not about to change.","Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.",
32,13 February 2005,Person555,9, An excellent addition to the series,Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9),
33,24 December 2004,FrankBooth_DeLarge,10, the middle of the trilogy,"In this trilogy there is a beginning that sets up the audience for the characters and the plot, then there is a sequel where the characters continue on from where the first leaves off, certain things happen throughout the second one that prepare everyone for the third, and in the third everything comes to an awesome and amazing ending.",
34,8 December 2002,justinrsko,10," The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.",

38,10 March 2017,zkonedog,10, The One That's Actually Better Than Its Source Material,"I have read the LOTR novel trilogy on a few different occasions. Each time, I struggle a bit to get through ""The Two Towers"". All the names, locations, and drawn-out battle sequences always leave me in a bit of a stupor. In this film adaptation, however, Peter Jackson--in following up ""Fellowship""--crafts an experience that is actually more enjoyable than Tolkien's original.",

41,18 February 2023,Jeremy_Urquhart,9, The weakest of this trilogy is still excellent,"Admittedly, I think The Two Towers is quite easily the weakest movie in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's cursed to sit as a stopgap between the immensely satisfying and exciting first installment, and the epic and emotional final film. However, when its inherent disadvantage is taken into account, it's pretty incredible that it's as good as it is.",
42,2 August 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," A Second Look, With Subtitles In Parts, Made This Much Better","I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: ""Gollum"" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.",
43,9 February 2004,Hairy_Lime,8, The Weakest Link - a spoiler or two,"Really, The Two Towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only natural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down.  Jackson does a nice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic - but to my mind the 10 I might have given for this movie went over the cliff with Aragorn.  I have nothing against Jackson deviating from the books - I was not troubled by the changes in the Faramir character, for instance, and adding the Warg riders themselves was a nice touch.  But what was the purpose of sending Aragorn over the cliff?  Creating false tension that probably fooled less than 1% of the audience?  Screen time for Liv Tyler? All it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes.  This crucial mistake is compunded now that we have the Extended Edition and see some of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release.  the movie would have been stronger without Aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the scene between Boromir and Faramir, or the march of the trees to the Battle of Helms Deep.",
44,8 January 2023,nickenchuggets,10, Fighting for the good in the world,"Because Lord of the Rings is arguably the most acclaimed movie trilogy of all time, you should not need to read a lot of (if any) reviews on this film to know that it is amazing. In my view, I think it's even better than the first, since the enormous landscapes of Tolkien's fantasy world are shown onscreen to even better effect here. Huge environments, memorable characters, and beautiful scenery are just things that complement a great story, so let's see if The Two Towers can live up to the iconic status of its prequel. The plot in this film is quite an undertaking to explain, as it follows three separate (but concurrent) storylines. The first involves Frodo Baggins and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin respectively), the two Hobbits from the first movie, as they continue their journey towards the evil realm of Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring. The second involves two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, attempting to stage an attack on Isengard, a fortress under the command of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). Finally, the last arc has to do with Legolas, Aragorn, and a few other warriors as they try to protect the kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's huge army of Orcs. We first see Frodo and Sam lost in the wilderness of Gondor. Gollum, a hideously malformed former hobbit who was physically corrupted by the One Ring, tries to attack Frodo because he wants the ring for himself. Only heard or otherwise alluded to in the first film, Gollum (formerly known as Smeagol) essentially serves as Frodo's guide to Mordor. While Sam vocalizes his thoughts that Gollum is a pitiful creature who should just be killed, Frodo feels bad for what the ring did to him and allows him to lead the way. Not to mention, only he knows about the secret passageways leading into Mordor. Meanwhile, Legolas and Aragorn (Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen respectively) enlist the help of the dwarf axeman Gimli as they try to save Merry and Pippin from a group of orcs. The orcs loot, burn and massacre scores of villages, but they are assaulted by a group of Rohan horse riding soldiers (known as Rohirrim), which allows Merry and Pippin to escape into a forest. After trekking further into Rohan, Aragorn and the others come to the lair of Theoden, Rohan's king, who has been corrupted by Saruman's influence. Some time later in the woods, the group are nearly blinded by the appearance of a very bright light, which turns out to be none other than Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Presumed dead after fighting a large demonic entity known as a Balrog in the last film, he actually managed to slay the beast after it dragged him deep into the Mines of Moria. Gandalf and the others go back to Theoden, and the former uses his staff to free him of Saruman's mind control. As a gesture of goodwill, Theoden sends his niece, Eowyn, to go with them as they evacuate Rohan in order to confront the orcs. A large battle ensues after refugees from Rohan are ambushed by orcs, and in the carnage, Aragorn is knocked off a cliff and apparently killed. In the mystical Elvish realm of Rivendell, it is said that Aragorn won't be coming back, and even if he did, he has a pitifully short lifespan compared to elves. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) makes the promise to defend humankind with the lives of elf warriors if necessary. She sends a large contingent of soldiers to the fortress of Helm's Deep, which is now in Saruman's sights. While all this is happening, Merry and Pippin are found in the forest by Treebeard, a giant sentient tree who is able to move around. Treebeard just so happens to be the leader of the Ent, a race of sentient trees. The two hobbits try to convince him to do what he can in order to stop Saruman's orc army, but he insists on consulting his ""council"" first. Aragorn is later found by a horse at the bottom of the cliff and brought to Helm's Deep. As he, Legolas, and the others arrive, they take up defensive positions just as the Uruk-hai (orc) army comes crashing down on them. Although the elves Galadriel sent are impeccable archers, the horde they are opposing seems without end. The orcs eventually breach the fortress and overwhelm the defenders. Just when all seems lost, Gandalf, leading a huge formation of Rohan cavalry, arrives and tears through the orcish attackers. At the same time, Treebeard, who has been carrying Merry and Pippin towards Isengard, sees a large deforested area where many of his friends used to live. Infuriated, he calls on all the Ent throughout the entire forest to join him as he attacks Saruman's tower. As the Ent and Gandalf's horsemen punish the remaining orcs, Gollum leads Frodo and Sam through swamps in order to infiltrate Mordor through its main gate. However, they are taken prisoner by Faramir, brother of the dead Baromir (Sean Bean) from the first film. They are taken to Gondor, where Sam and Frodo try to explain to Faramir that his brother is dead because the ring claimed his sanity for its own wicked amusement. As Gondor comes under attack, Frodo's mind seems to slip into the ring's influence, and he doesn't appear to be in control of himself. A Ringwraith nearly kills him, but he is rescued by Sam. Faramir eventually lets Frodo and Sam get away, and Gollum continues to lead them to their objective. Little do the boys realize, Gollum is secretly plotting to take the ring back from them. Once again, Peter Jackson demonstrates that he is one of the best directors of all time. There's so much to love about Lord of the Rings. Like I said before, I think this movie is a great improvement over the first (despite the fact that Sean Bean isn't in it). The music, special effects, and just about everything else has been refined to basically perfection. Gollum has become a favorite among fans of the series, and even almost 20 years later, you can still barely tell he's only CGI. While Frodo didn't appear as much as I would have liked, the quality of the other storylines more than makes up for this. All the characters are likeable, even the ones you're not meant to like. It was a real treat to see the Helm's Deep battle towards the end, since it really did look hopeless for those opposing Saruman. By the way, I kind of knew that they weren't going to let Gandalf disappear from this series, as he's one of the best things about it. The scene in the beginning in which he fights the balrog and we learn what really happened to him after his supposed death is still one of the best starts to a movie I've seen yet. Overall, I would definitely say The Two Towers is better than the first film of this incredible trilogy, but all of them are usually regarded as works of genius for a reason.",

There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not ""really"" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle.

Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil.",

Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects.

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hunting Merry and Pippin, are involved getting Theoden of Rohan away from Saruman's control, and fighting Saruman's Orcs. Gandalf is better than ever in this film. He is not dead as we all assumed. Gollum is great in this film. Andy Serkis should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The CGI is amazing, so amazing it makes Gollum appear life-like. I liked Treebeard in this film. He serves as a mentor to Merry and Pippin. I liked the chemistry between Legolas and Gimli. They provide comedy in perilous times of Middle Earth. The acting is excellent especially Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen. Howard Shore continues with his captivating music. The effects, especially the visual effects are great. This is truly an epic.

74,15 December 2013,ironhorse_iv,8," Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is so precious, but gees, it's a hard film to get through.","Don't get me wrong, Director Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's films are all well-done films, but the pacing of these films are just way too slow. Even with Two Towers being the shortest of the three films, 179 minutes is a very long time, to sit down and watch a film. By the time, you get to the end of the film, you just witness, a lot of things happen on screen, but not much, if that make sense. A lot of things could be cut down, in the editing room, even more. It's like being in the middle of a mile run. You glad you went this far, but it's not done yet, you got another half mile and you're starting to feel a bit tired. Since, this film is the middle of the trilogy, there is no beginning nor end, for that, reason, it's hard to say if the movie is great or just OK. In my opinion, The Two Towers is just alright. The Two Towers is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the King. It is book III: The Treason of Isengard and IV: The Journey to Mordor AKA the Journey of the Ringbearers or The Ring Goes East in the book series. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers arguably contains the most book to film major alterations, but the movie mostly follows the books, very close, mixing the two, but unlike the book starts, the movie starts a little bit later as 2001's Fellowship took the first chapter of this book opening as its ending. Instead, we get a cool new intro with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) fighting the Balrog monster from the last movie. We come into the film, after the break down of the fellowship, with smaller groups of characters going on their own adventures and story arches intercut with each other. Frodo (Elijah Woods) & Sam (Sean Astin) continuing their journey and meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the way. Gollum is the best new character, they introduce into this film. Andy Serkis is amazing actor, and he puts out the best motion CGI capture acting, I ever saw. Since, there was a decision to leave Shelob for the third movie meant that Faramir (David Wenham) had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam's journey. This change was indeed different than the book. It does add conflict, but gees... it slows the plot down. Frodo is the everyman character, because he lack power, he is the best one to carry the ring throughout the film. His real challenge is to bear the ring without giving in to its temptations. This resistance is Frodo's inner journey, in which his pure heart is constantly under assault by his darker yearnings for power. It had some pretty powerful symbolism here between Faramir, Frodo, Sam and Gollum. I do have a problem with Frodo & Sam's friendship. I have nothing against gays, but there is a huge different between friendship and being in love. It's obvious Tolkien wanted to show the strength of friendship, so I don't think it was intentional, but it's still hard to ignore that it comes off as a gay relationship. While this is going on, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) find themselves fighting the Orcs invasion at Helm's Deep and helping the war-torn nation of Rohan. While in the book, Helm's Deep is a small battle. In this film, it's the big climax of the film. It's one of the best battle scenes in film, I ever witnessed. I can do without the small awful cheesy things, like the heroes mowing down hundreds of Orcs without much battle scars. I can do without Legolas being too perfect like, shield surfing and only speak in exposition. I couldn't stand Gimli being pull into too much comedy relief role. Also, glad to see Arwen (Liv Tyler) was not in the battle scenes in the final version, as they film her earlier in it fighting alongside Aragorn. I can still do without Aragorn's life is now tied to the Fate of the Ring bit. It makes little to no sense. I understand that they (the producers) were trying to make anti-ring symbol with her character as a sign of hope, but it doesn't work. The movie is more about Aragon rise to become king and presented a coming to age story for males. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) end up encountering the giant treelike Ents and trying to stop Saruman's (Christopher Lee) army at Isengard. Environment themes are question here. Still, the whole Treebeard part were a bit boring. One thing, I hate about Lord of the Rings are the cheap fake out deaths scenes. Aragorn, Frodo, and others. As much as I love seeing Gandalf again, his death scene in the last movie was supposed to be impactful. For him, to come back makes it seem like you can cheat death here. I blame it on Tolkien. I didn't like the whole Jesus Christ metaphor with his character. Besides Boromir (Sean Bean), does any main character dies in this movie. The movie lose a bit of its sense of danger without any major deaths. Everybody seems nearly invincible. Water seems to be a symbol of rebirth in this film. Gandalf, Aragorn, and Frodo were save by large bodies of water. Similarly, Saruman's tower loses its power when its plain is flooded. Like a baptized, it's free from sin. Even the elves depart Middle-earth on a boat and sail out to a great body of water. The film has a lot of Christianity themes. The music by Howard Shore is amazing. Overall: Good visual film that can be a bit confusing. Just hard to get through all the themes, and all the characters arches.",

Walking around the shopping mall, I noticed that 3 movies were on for the nightmovie: Harry Potter, The Chamber of secrets, Treasure Planet and yes, The Two Towers. Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo & Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of ""The Lord of the Rings"" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here. After years of watching movies, this is the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave the theater......

80,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,7," ""Stupid, fat hobbit.""","I may be committing cinema heresy here, but I have complaints about the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers. Number One: It is excessively long. I know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. When someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with Frodo and Sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter Mordor, the home of Mt. Doom where the ring must finally end up. However, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. What I personally find fascinating with the Lord of the Rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the Middle Earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. That leads to Complaint Number Two: There are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. Perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. Now the good: Gollum makes Jar-Jar Binks looks like a Simpsons' cartoon character. The combination of stop-action and CGI animation, Gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, I think. What happened to him? Will the same thing happen to Frodo? These are questions I had that were spurred on by watching the Two Towers. The walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the 3 Star Wars films, I think The Two Towers is the weakest of the Lord of the Rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. It is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but I just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. I know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away. But Peter Jackson has a houseful of Oscars, and I don't, so what do I know?",

Only problem is that each episode runtime is well over 3 hours and that stretches over 4 hours if you count the TV commercials in, which means an enjoyable movie has become a huge commitment as well as a physical challenge.

The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do.

The acting was great, the special effects were great, and the story was great.  It is shaping up to be my favorite trilogy of all time.  This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters.  The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best.  The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story.  I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf.  Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would.  Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1.  I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3.  I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite.

89,6 November 2004,lasse-uk,10, The worst of what is ultimately the best trilogy of all time,This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. All in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three.,

After fleeing from an evil band of orcs, another pair of Hobbits sit with stalks, of an Ent known as Treebeard, who gets annoyed when friends are sheared, summons brethren, and against the foe they walk.

94,31 March 2016,filipemanuelneto,10, Gloriously epic,"This is the continuation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote after his passage through the trenches in First World War. This film was shot by the same cast and crew of the first, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a strategy that has given a great cohesion to the entire trilogy. In this film, the plot thickens with the division of the Fellowship: Frodo and Sam desperately trying to get to Mordor while the men, grouped around the kingdom of Rohan, begin the war against the orc's and uruk's of Sauron and Saruman. The climax of the film, the battle of Helm's Deep, is probably one of the most tense and epic battle scenes in history of contemporary cinema. From this point of view, this film surpasses in adrenaline the first of the saga. For the action scenes, the expertise of digital computerization was key. Proof of this is the character Gollum, a completely digital creation that received the voice of Andy Serkis, or Treebeard, who has the voice of John Rhys-Davies (actor who also plays Gimli).",

The battle of Helm's deep is one of the highlights of the movie, as well as the transformation of the gollum, who is one of the most interesting characters. The scenery is wonderful, adding to the main epic atmosphere a realistic note. The soundtrack too helps to the magic of the movie that captures the audience from the beginning.

96,11 January 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,10," By far the best of the three: courage, temerity, resilience and tenacity","After death, severance, separation, loss and confusion, we must regroup and recoup, rejoice and return. So let's save Gandolf first who shifts from The Grey to The White, from powerless to finally magical. The details are all accounted for in the DVD. Then the two hobbits that were captured and thought dead were only prisoners and they will manage to escape and even win the battle of the film, without anyone knowing it really. They will make friends with tree-herders and they will lead the forest against the bad wizard in his tower. And then the trio man-elf-dwarf will liberate some king in some city from the power of some middle man of a wizard and lead his people and troops to a mountain citadel, and this same man and same elf and same dwarf will have the surprise to see the king of the elves and his army arrive to reinforce the humans against the orcs. Some kind of slow growing seeds of courage and commitment. Some call that love too. And the battle will start, spectacular and grandiose, and many will die on both sides and the final salvaging reinforcements will arrive under the authority of Gandolf The White. The orcs will be defeated. During that time the two lost hobbits and the tree-herders will start a tree war against the malicious bad wizard in his tower with his mine and giant smithy underground at the foot of his mausoleum-spire that had provided the army of orcs with all kinds of arms, weapons and armours. And it will all go drowned and soaked, overflowed and flooded. That's how a battle is won, with some courage not to feel pain, with a lot of luck not to hear the warnings of Ms Caution, Miss Prudence and Mrs Carefulness, the three witches of passivity, and a fair dose of blindness not to see danger. And here we are with a long film for a young audience, though the audience of the first film must have aged a little and the film is becoming a lot more human. We even have several heterosexual kisses along with quite a few man-to-man embraces. Going on that way we may have a couple of weddings at the end of the third episode. And it all ends with two hobbits raiding the cellar and kitchen of the bad gloomy dangerous vicious wizard and we even find that funny, even if we are slightly worried for their waistlines. And the real end of course comes with the declaration of total trust from Sam the hobbit gardener who guards no one but cultivates friendship and Frodon the hobbit adventurer guardian of the ring and carrier of its powers to the final destruction site somewhere in hell. This episode though manages to leave monsters and other diabolical figures behind, which is good, and to emphasize more on the human qualities of all these characters. It even gets in a way marvelous for children with walking trees even if this is nothing but the rewriting of Macbeth, but Macbeth deserves many rewritings. And we recognize what is going to become one essential sign of Stephen King's Dark Tower. The main human hero in the Fellowship of the Ring, even after scattering and especially after it, is the surviving son of the long ago destroyed Northern Kingdom. He is a Ranger, a dying out category of peacemakers and justice executioners, just like Roland is a Gunslinger. But still, and that is going to last till the end I imagine, no bridge or door from this medieval fantasy world to our modern world and it is a shame. It is some kind of model for many sagas to come, but it stops short of real science-fiction when the fiction speaks of our own world through another layer of time or space.",

Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size.

The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White.",
108,27 January 2003,rosscinema,7, Impressive looking,"This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better.",

Then we watch Sam and Frodo have the same conversation over and over and over again: 'Oh, Sam, I can't go on.' 'It's the ring, Mr Frodo, I know!' Oh, and now they have this creepy character called Gollum that follows them around and is supposed to be entertaining, but comes across as irritating. For some reason Sam still calls Frodo 'Mr'. Oh, then some boring talking trees show up and bore to death even the characters themselves. What chance does the audience stand? Finally we get to the climax and the grand battle. Except Jackson doesn't know how to direct it. The tone wavers. It goes between terror (women and children expecting to be slaughtered) to comedy with Gimli and Legolas. And then he keeps interrupting the battle in order to cut to those boring bits with the talking trees. He even adds slow motion in the battle scenes for no good reason. The end result is that there is no rhythm to the battle and the emotion is dissipated. There you have it. Lots of noise and CGI, and no emotion - apart from boredom.",

On the other hand some dialogues and monologues as well as some characters reach an almost Shakespearean grandeur. This movie has some images of rare beauty and some others which fill us with awe and wonder. And what about the story? Well the story is the weakest part of all this with the usual plot flaws and a lot of unlikely facilities in the outcome of certain plot scenes about which I will not dwell now to avoid being a spoiler. But who cares after all? The usual spectator of this kind of movies only wants to be recreated during the projection time and devoted to all the emotions that the various incidents produce in his mind. It's therefore intrinsically one more movie aimed at entertaining the spectator and not at making him think or at conveying any message beyond the simple one according to which Good must always triumph over Evil.",

Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister.

The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added.

Picking one above the others can be difficult, but The Two Towers rises to the top because of its final battle. The moment the rain falls over the hushed armies in the last minutes before the conflict erupts is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a war epic. The overwhelming hopelessness of the remnant of Rohan as they attempt to survive the endless enemy hordes is incredibly powerful, and the tension is tangible. Despite knowing a third movie comes next, it felts as if anything could happen. LOTR: The Two Towers edges out the rest of the trilogy by avoiding the weight of beginning or ending a greater story and can be present in the intensity of its own journey.",

The differing roles of the four hobbits and cunning games played by Gollum are worthy of mentioning.

153,25 February 2005,jboothmillard,10, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"The second part to the J. R. R. Tolkien book based film trilogy is more darker than the first. Basically, the fellowship is broken, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) travel to Mordor accompanied by the treacherous Gollum/Sméagol (Andy Serkis). Merry (Dominic Monaghan, now known in TV's Lost) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been kidnapped by the Urukhai, but get rescued by Treebeard (John Rhys-Davies), and they plan their battle with other Ents. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies) have joined forces with the King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill). Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), now a White wizard has returned, and with Thoedon's bunch they plan the battle of Helm's Deep against Orcs and Uruks sent from Isegard by traitor White wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Peter Jackson has done another fantastic job, and the big battle is spectacular. Also starring Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Miranda Otto as Eowyn of Rohan, Brad Dourif as Wormtongue, David Wenham as Faramir, Karl Urban as Eomer and Sean Bean as Boromir (flashback). Featuring the song ""Gollum's Song"" by Emilíana Torrini. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Editing, Best Sound, and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction, and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Cate Blanchett was number 37, and Sir Christopher Lee number 31 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 13, and Sir Ian McKellen number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and McKellen was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actors, the film was number 85 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""My precious.""), it was number 22 on The Ultimate Film, and as part of the trilogy, all three films were number 11 on The 100 Greatest Family Films.

158,27 December 2014,Tyson14,10, something worth fighting for,"Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), ""The Lord of the Rings"" took the audiences by storm when ""Fellowship of the Ring"" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and ""Two Towers"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve ""the master of the Precious."" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: ""But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of ""Fellowship,"" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course ""Two Towers"" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, ""Two Towers"" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure.",
159,24 December 2015,cartesianthought,9, 9 - Excellent,"Some see it as the lesser entry of the trilogy. I see it as the vital bridge which allows the characters to develop. Samwise and Frodo spend more time with each other. Gollum gets significant character development as his dual personality leaves the two main characters split on whether he is helping them or not, weakening their loyalty to each other.",
160,3 August 2003,funkyfry,10, One of the best fantasy films of all time,"Jackson and his team have managed to actually top their first feature (at least in its theatrical version) with this amazing, over the top, deep-running fantasy epic.  The performances are on, with Rhys-Davies and Bloom's comradery adding an element that was somewhat missing from the first film.  The action elements are well-balanced with the dialogue, the visuals are totally stunning.  But the real star of this movie, probably for all time, is the CGI creation to top all others:  Gollum, who comes to leave breathing and smacking his lips and seeming every bit as real as any actor on the set could be.  It was truly amazing to watch this effect work on an audience that could forget, in such memorable scenes as Gollum's late night conversation with himself (as Smeagol), that it was not watching an actual fantastic creature.

A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment.

Many American film-goers (mainly American teens), are angry there were no heavy rock bands or rap in the movie, no Tarrantino type mindless gore and violence and no explicit sex. Many are angry that this, God Forbid, was a movie with European characters and that Will Smith didn't play Frodo, and it was not a movie about an invalid or a concentration camp (which seem to make up all of the Academy Award movie winners for the last ten years). In short, in modern America, we want the kind of garbage you can see in still-born crap like the newest matrix - guns blasting every five seconds, multi-cultural raves, mystical mumbo-jumbo and a movie filmed in a variety of shades of green. If, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings, loved it and understand a one-to-one translation to the screen is impossible, you will love the Two Towers.

They were all absolutely excellent, start to finish. They are like the books in so many ways and really managed to take the books and put it onto a screen in such a wonderful way. The storyline was very strong and advanced. The way the turned Andy Circus into Gollum was epic for something that came out at that time. It, by far, had the best battle scene in the whole franchise and better than the majority of films I've seen. Those who've seen the film will know which battle I'm talking about but I don't want to give spoilers. I've lost count of how many times I've seen these films. The dialogue was awesome and there wasn't a scene where I spotted a huge mistake that ruined the film. I think there was the odd CGI error but it wasn't major. The make up was extremely believable, especially the orcs and the hobbits' feet. The whole world was just so great. Overall, this was my least favourite out of the three but it is very close.

It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and it's suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.",

Another impressive feat is the computer animated creature of Gollum, a schitzophrenic, deformed Hobbit who finds Frodo Baggins his new master, alongside Samwise Gamgee, and he may just be the most compelling of the characters, along with the somewhat downsized role of Gandalf the Grey, er White, played still with skill by Sir Ian McKellan.",

While Fellowship Of The Ring is technically good,and very well made,it wasn't very fun to watch at all. The Two Towers manages to grip you for the whole 170 minutes or so and that's quite a feat to pull off,because often for me that's way too overlong. The Battle sequences are quite a sight to be hold,it honestly never stops,it's just so action packed you won't have time to catch your breath. Everyone seemed so much more comfortable this time around,they all seemed to know there roles this time around,unlike the last time where everyone seemed all tense. I've never read the novels so I can't compare them to the films,but what I liked most about this film was the growing tension of Gollum's obsession with The Ring. He is frighteningly unpredictable and managed to make my skin crawl. I hadn't felt that much growing tension in a long,long time with Gollum and Frodo it was really harrowing stuff.

So there was much expectation surrounding the film release. And i must say that i am impressed at what has been achieved. Critics have it that the film is heavily layered with special effects and that many of the characters are unexplored. In other words, more food for the eye than for the heart. However this is totally acceptable and expected. To incorporate most of the books' fantasies and characters is already an arduous task. Some aspects had to be cut off otherwise Jackson would have had to make 20 episodes to keep faithful to the book.

They could have cut her character out and given me back fifteen minutes of my life.  I think they just stuck her in because she's a big name to put on the poster...but her little plotline lended nothing to the overall plot.  I found Frodo's adventure interesting, but it was not the overall focus of the movie.  It was mainly a boring war movie.  And the war scenes were terribly boring...I felt like someone was twisting all nine of my piercings over and over and over again.  The war scenes were just repetitive.

201,15 November 2003,nixar55,10, Extended Excellence!,"I enjoyed the theatrical Two Towers even more than the first - it was darker, more suspenseful, more action-filled, and introduced some of my favorite characters. The extended edition gives viewers even more of the same - more heart, more comedy, more action, more character development, more sorrow, and more of a conclusion. My favorite scene in the extended edition is Faramir's flashback to a time spent with his brother and father. It really shows more insight into this character, making him seem less like Boromir-lite. It also shows more insight into Boromir himself, before he left for Rivendell, and introduced viewers to their father, Denethor, who is important to the third part of the tale. There's a lot more Merry & Pippin, Treebeard, and Gollum. The DVD extras are fantastic, as we've come to expect. Watch ""Cameras in Middle Earth,"" ""Tolkien: Origins of Middle-Earth,"" ""From book to Script"" and the entire special on Gollum and music and sound in The Two Towers.

It opens where Fellowship of the Ring left off within a battle. Frodo and Sam are joined in their quest by a scheming Gollum, which they captured then they continue their quest to destroy the ring. There are tree creatures that are the film's biggest treasure. Then we are given another useless cliffhanger within a huge battle. Director Peter Jackson tenses the action with impressive visual wonders. Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf returns after having apparently died in his battle concluding the first film. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is involved in much combat until nearly meeting his death after a horrendous fall. Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam struggle as keepers of the ring and the deceit as the Gollum attempts to sabotage their friendship. Andy Serkis is the Gollum and his performance is all the better because of what viewers do and don't see with his performance. The special effects are overwhelming and top notch with detailed structure but the film cannot stand alone. Fans of the books may enjoy it, otherwise it is an overrated spectacle with the two towers being the previous film and the next one to which viewing this relies. Score: 6 / 10",

205,29 August 2003,nankipoo,10, Great on several levels,"""The Two Towers"" is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus I believe its new characters (those not introduced in ""Fellowship"") are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. You have Gollum, King Theoden, Eowen, Faramir, Grima, Treebeard and many others. Peter Jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, I'll give no ground on that point. One might argue about Gollum and Treebeard's categorization as ""actors"", but I say that whether they're CG or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. The existing characters are developed even more deeply in TT. Sam's humanity, Frodo's compassion, Aragorn's evolving kingship, Arwen's deep love, Gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. For epic ""sweep"", you'll have to go far to match TT. The scenes at Helm's Deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of Sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and Jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. Gollum's split-personality conflicts as ""Smeagol/Gollum"" are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! What a relief. Howard Shore's score is again one I'd buy for myself.",
206,2 October 2012,Red-Barracuda,6, Gloomier follow up to Fellowship of the Ring,"Some people prefer this second part in the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the first. I am not one of those people. Where the first movie's strength was in its exploration of a magical fantasy world, this one is – albeit necessarily – more gloomy. I would guess that it's primarily thought highly of for two main reasons. Firstly, for its epic recreation of the battle for Helm's Deep and secondly for the character Gollum. These are two pretty persuasive reasons to be honest. The battle scene is truly massive in its scale and execution, with a lot of painstaking detail; while the character of Gollum is even more revolutionary in cinematic terms. Andy Serkis famously played the character with motion-capture devices all over his body but Gollum was a fully CGI created creature. It's pretty remarkable, therefore, that this character has so much believability and empathy. It's a testament to both Serkis acting and the artists who created him that this is so.",

Yeah I understand that it is an astounding and praiseworthy achievement in visual effects and stuff but still other than the epic scenery, the score and the acting of some the movie is just so and so. I am going to break the movie into pros and cons so that it becomes easier why I like and don't like it.
Pros:
1. The scenery with all the mountains and stuff was breathtaking. It just looked visually stunning. I think this is why so many people adore LOTR.
2. The score by Howard Shore was really beautiful. The entire soundtrack fit the movie perfectly
3. The Visual effects..duh!!!
4. The acting especially by Sir Ian McKellen. I don't think his performance was as good as it was in fellowship but was good nonetheless.
5. Gollum!! This character was really interesting and I wanted to know more about him. He(it??) was the only character I feel was deep and three dimensional. It literally had two sides. I think it sincerely loved Frodo!!

217,22 July 2020,aucoinandrew,9, The Worst of the Three But Nevertheless A Fantastic Achievement,"It isn't easy being the middle man in a trilogy but The Two Towers makes it work.
Ripe with beautiful scenery, a fully realized Middle Earth, and a worthy cast, The Two Towers is an epic in every sense of the word. Translating Tolkien's detailed work, fraught with tons of characters and plot changes, isn't easy, but Peter Jackson does a tremendous job albeit the few egregious changes to some of Tolkien's characters he felt the need to pursue. But let's start with what Peter did well:
Once again, the production, costume, and special effects teams have transformed Middle Earth into a living, breathing, world that is intricately detailed and a joy to be a part of (New Zealand was a wonderful location to film at). The cinematography is once again top notch, showing Middle Earth in all its beauty and evil. Howard Shore once again showcases his beautiful score and enlivens every scene he composed for. The battle of helms deep is, to this day, unmatched in fantasy battles and is easily one of the greatest large scale battles put to film. It is tense, emotional, action packed, and inspiring all at the same time. Bernard Hill puts on an extremely underrated performance as the King of Rohan, bent on saving his people. Sean Astin, Viggo Mortenson, Andy Serkis, Miranda Otto, and, of course, the great Ian McKellan, also cash in with great performances across the board. The second half of this film is absolutely brilliant, using what may have appeared to be a slower first half to propel the action and stakes to new heights.
Now here's what Peter could've done better. To some this may appear nitpicky, but for avid readers of Tolkien's work, it's important.
Treebeard is not this dumb. He is supposed to be wise and reasonable, not ignorant and unstable. Peter made his character pretty unlikeable, boring, and childish. They made him look silly when he didn't know about how Saruman had destroyed all those trees.
Faramir is one of my favorite characters in the book, mainly because of his strength. I loved how they treated his character in Return of the King but here, they make him into a whiny, slightly self-absorbed, loser, who, in fact, does give into the rings temptations, which, in the book, he does not. This loses a key character trait of Faramir and does an injustice to Tolkien's view of the character.
Overall, a strong 9/10. For the most part, save a few character changes, it does justice to the book and continues the story in a nail biting fashion.",

222,22 March 2007,jzappa,6, Now This Is Where I Get Kind of Negative,"I treated my first viewing of the first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, as an obligation as a movie buff. If a movie hits it big, I feel obligated to see it, because people don't trust your opinion once they find that you've seen so many movies, so you claim, but you haven't seen Lord of the Rings. Before the second time I saw the first Lord of the Rings film, I said that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but I liked very much The Fellowship of the Ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with Roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones with extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. So I decided to, extremely late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, I somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way I felt the second time.",
223,18 April 2006,drystyx,10, an Odyssey of three,"Like most good flower children, I read the trilogy, but I cheated and read the Similrilian first, which kind of gives the whole picture. First, to rate the book, because the movie does try to remain extremely loyal to the book, and in fact the director in all three movies manages to convey each character's emotions much better than JRR did, and JRR used a lot of words-three big books. Tokien was not the genius some say, but the cult that followed was of genius. Now the movie. In this episode, there is much adventure, but it is the odyssey of the three characters-Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum, that really holds your interest, much as the Bridge on the River Kwai holds the children in us in interest with Hawkins, Holden, and the other guy trekking through the jungle. Likewise, the scenes with the interaction of Frodo and Samwise with their enemy-guide Gollum, captivate the viewer. The little bits of humor with characterization, such as when Samwise cooks the rabbit. Gollum responds ""Oooohhhhh, you've ruined it!"" That whole bit is priceless. No wonder why during the 70's everyone dreamed of playing Gollum if the movie ever came out. A role you could literally get your teeth into. A delightfully depraved character. The adventures of Merry and Pippin are also likable and well done, and much like the book. They play a minor role, and it is directed as such. The adventures of the others seems a bit overdone, but then the book was a bit overdone. It makes sense that Gandalf never dies in battle, because in the book he was an equivalent of an angel sent by the gods of JRR's world from the beginning of time. One wonders why he can't actually do more. However, why some smart Uruk Hai doesn't just slice off Aragorn's head from behind is miraculous to say the least, but most audiences are accustomed to such miracles for main characters. The battle scenes have been acclaimed, but they lack reality. Never does Aragorn blink, slip, get something in his eye, in all just don't look for realistic fight scenes, but a more modern choreographed look. The bit where Wormtongue goes head over heels for a very pale, plain king's daughter is the hardest thing to believe. But the actress plays her part well, and in fact its hard for a pale woman to look good without twentieth century make-up. All in all, its hard to find fault with this movie. Quite enjoyable.",

225,9 January 2004,bh606644,10, My favorite of the 3 movies,"I have to say that without a doubt, this movie is my personal favorite of the 3 movies in the trilogy.  Why?  I love the tension and overall sense of gloom the actors, and more noteably, the score portray for us.  Rohan seems like it would normally be a beautiful, bright, happy place, but a dark shadow has fallen over it.  Very well done in this sense.  Sometimes, it is just dreadfully quiet as the actors deliver their lines with just a hint of music in the background.  When Eomer delivers the line....""Do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands."" it still gives me goose bumps.  Same with Theoden as he conveys his sense of being alone in this fight at Helm's Deep to Aragorn...""Yes, my Lord Aragorn, we ARE alone."" Awesome....",
226,5 January 2003,zetes,9, Huge improvement over the first installment,"I found the first installment of this series pretty good, but ultimately sloppy. It was just too repetitive, with the characters doing nothing but travelling forward, stopping sporadically to fight battles against forces of faceless monsters which ridiculously outnumbered them. The second installment, of course, picks up right where the first one ended, although it has broken into three narrative tracks. The cutting between the three makes the first half of the film rather uneven. The plotline of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas defending the people of Rohan is especially slow, and there isn't enough exposition to explain what the heck is going on. I'm actually glad for that, as I'd rather sit through incomprehensible plot than have to listen to twenty more minutes of explaining who the heck these people are and what the heck is going on. I turned to my friend, a long-time lover of the novels, and asked him and he quickly caught me up. Pippin and Merry, the two Hobbits who were captured by orcs at the end of the first movie, escape and run into a sacred forest and are captured by a giant talking tree called an ent. This plotline is slow, too, but the tree monsters were neat enough to hold my attention.",

But that movie was three hours long, as is Two Towers.   Return of the King is three and a half hours.  I understand Peter Jackson considers this to be ""one"" movie broken up into three parts -- that is, one nine and a half (or eleven, with the extended ""special"" editions) hour movie.  That is simply excessive, IMHO.  Anytime a movie goes much over two hours it better be for a very, very good reason.  When you start talking about a three hour sequel to a three hour original movie, you've got problems -- I don't care how good the original was.  Maybe Godfathers 1 and 2 are the exception.

The second act is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends & bring your entire tale to a satisfying conclusion. Before penning down these stories, almost every writer has a very clear conscience of how to begin & end their tales but the most troublesome part for each one of them is always the middle act. Because no matter how great the opening or closing part may be, if this vital act isn't handled well, the overall experience of the entire story will unfortunately amount to nothing.

The plot is nonexistant, most of the fighting CGI average at best, and except for the breakthrough of the Gollum character, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile in this mediocre film.  The high rating here is baffling...until you see that there are millions of people who also think ""Attack of the Clones"" is a good film.  Fans will accept the worst if it has the name Lord of the Rings or Star Wars attached to it.  I thought the first film was weak--but the extended edition on DVD was truly beautiful.

232,12 May 2005,jmcleod_5,10, Almost equal to the first.,I enjoyed The Two Towers almost as much as Fellowship. I liked the Helm's Deep battle and still think it is better than any of the battles in Return of the King. However as with most epic movies I find the little moments are the ones that define it as great. A tree with it's leaves on fire rushing towards an oncoming torrent of water to put it out. The obvious happiness of Smeagol as he finally rids himself of Gollum. Even Frodo's gradual slide into darkness as he spits venom every now and then at Sam. These are what make up a great story and that's what made Fellowship so great. The Two Towers are full of these as is the whole trilogy. The only disappointment in this film is the Warg attack. Very shoddy effects in an otherwise flawless movie. ,

The first time I watched this I got about half way through and said, this movie is so damn good I can't believe it. The acting is great and the scenery and effects are awesome. I'm not quite as excited on later watchings. What has me bothered (particularly during the second half) is when the movie strays from the source material. The original story is one of the great fantasy works ever, why go off in other directions? It's not just that the movie is unfaithful to the book, it's that there's no reason for it to go elsewhere. I'm quite sure there's no one working the script with credentials approaching Tolkien's. So I just don't get with the point of following the books 80% of the way and playing with the other 20%, but I'll reserve final judgment until Return Of The King. Post script: I should have qualified my reservations about the changes - Haldir and the elves coming to Helm's Deep is a Jackson invention and the coolest thing in the Two Towers. Enjoy.",

No good character interaction, a CGI-Gollum that is blurry when he moves quickly--in fact, all the CGI is pretty hokey--and a final battle at Helm's Deep which, I just don't get it, it's really not all that special.  Maybe the Extended Director's Edition will rescue this one the way it did Fellowhip.  I hope so, but this film is more like a bad summer movie than it is a sweeping fantasy.  The pacing is terrible, characters disappear, the dialogue is a hollow retread of the first first. Aside from one schizophrenic dialogue between Gollum and himself, we could have skipped this whole film.  Certainly, the meager story on display here could have been told in two hours.  A bore.

That is not to say that the other two films are inferior in any way, I just am simply more entertained by this one than the others and this is a large part to due with the Battle of Helms Deep. The Battle of Helms Deep is simply one of the finest battle sequences ever in movie history. Though not only is the battle exquisitely crafted, but thanks to Peter Jackson's wonderful direction, he makes us feel for the heroes and makes you want to continuously jump up and cheer each time Aragorn mows down a row of orcs, or Legolas rides a shield down a flight of stairs, pummeling enemies with his arrows on the way down. Still the battle is not the only thing that makes this film more enjoyable. I felt for these characters more so in this film than any of the others. Part of that is because this film puts more focus on the characters and who they are than either of the other two films. In the first one it was all about exposition, the third one it was all about drawing it all to a close, but this one was all about getting to know the characters better so that by the time we reach the third film we are so emotionally attached that we could not bear to see any of them pass.",

Sure, it is a bit slower moving than Fellowship, but it's more focused on its narrative. Also, the performances are spectacular, especially coming from motion capture actor Andy Serkis, who truly serves as a scene stealer.

This may sound like a tired cliche but so is the production of this movie. The sheer arrogance to mess around with the greatest story put to print is unbelievable. The changes in the story and characters go far beyond interpretation and seem to suggest that Mr Jackson simply feels that Tolkien got it wrong.

I tried in vain to put it back together but it slipped through my fingers like sand. I slumped back in the theatre seat and surpressed sleep. I watched Elijah Wood's strugle with his one expression and attept at Homersexual flirting with Sean Astin, the miscast fat American. The dialogue sounded like it was being excreted. The dwarf is now just comic relief in the tradition of jar jar binks. I had to shut my eyes every time Peter thrust the camera in Aragorn's face. Golumn was horribly unrealistic. Puppets look light years better when used properly. I want to believe what I see. The line to the effect of ""I hope someday someone will write a book about us"" had me cowering under my seat in embarrassment. The battle scenes tried to be too flashy and as a result you can't get a scope of the battle or see what's going on. The fact that its rating is almost nine says almost too much about todays generation (to which I am also part of). LOTR above Citizen Kane? come on!

260,18 February 2007,general-melchett,10," Hugely epic and well-made, The Two Towers is another success for the Lord of the Rings.","The Two Towers dwarfs The Fellowship of the Ring in size, scale, and the grandeur of the action scenes. While FOTR followed Frodo and co. as they started their journey across Middle Earth to destroy the Ring, TTT is our first glimpse at what happens in the bigger world as the Fellowship breaks - a war is being fought over this Ring, and the war is starting now... Needless to say, TTT is a bigger film than FOTR. Instead of about 100 Orcs and a troll against nine men, we have armies of thousands of Orcs and Uruk-hai, against armies of thousands of Men, and proper big weapons. And the results are amazing. The battle for Helm's Deep is brilliantly done - Braveheart can pack its bags and go home, this is the new champion of sword-fighting epics. The way tension was built up to the battle was brilliant - you found yourself practically drooling by the time the Men were gathered on the outer walls of the castle, ready for battle. And besides from ending with the smaller fights and starting with the larger wars, this film also started off some new plots - the story of King Theoden and Eowyn and the first meeting with Gollum (we got some glimpses of him in the last film but this film is his real introduction) - and develops these plots sufficiently for them to be continued and ended in the next film - the epic close to this great trilogy. This film definitely did not pass on anything, and though the relatively slim budget (believe me, $93,000,000 is not much for a film of this scale) tells you that a lot of it is CG, it is still bloody impressive, and builds more on the LOTR trilogy's status as an epic series.

I can [barely] accept the whole 'Arwen as Frodo's saviour' from The Fellowship Of The Ring, but what Jackson has done this time made me feel nauseous - I actually felt the desire to vomit while watching this movie. The movie started and seemed to rush forward without any sense of coherency or sense of timing, and then they started on the action to blind the audience to the significant gaps in the plot.

I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune.

280,1 December 2014,Horst_In_Translation,6," Flawed, but still worth a watch for fantasy lovers","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the middle piece of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings""-trilogy. Awards-wise the least successful, I would also classify this film inferior to 1 and 3. It starts with the plot twist that Gandalf is actually alive and we see Gollum for the first time, the visual description of what the ring does to people. For the most part, we follow Sam and Frodo (group 1) and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (group 2) after Boromir's death. Sam's behavior towards Gollum stood a bit in contrast to his warmheartedness with Frodo, but apart from that I liked these two story lines and also the introduction of Gollum (possibly the most interesting character from the trilogy). I really was not impressed at all with the storyline of the king who obeys to his evil snake servant and the whole family business of the king. Aragorn looking at the traces and seeing that the two Hobbits must still be alive was complete nonsense. The tree creatures (on which the Hobbits spend pretty much the whole film) were quite nice though. However, there were some problems with these too. The tree promised Gandalf nothing would happen to the Hobbits. So how come these Hobbits climb right that tree who vowed to protect them? He sure did not follow them. He was even sleeping before they woke him up. And why does he think they are Orcs at first? And when did the other hobbit duo become brave enough to scream at the trees to get them to help? They were just fools before all that and I just cannot see them transforming into credible heroes. Nonsense, I say. Also they don't even ask if Gandalf is still alive.",

It's not hard to see why both opinions are held. The narrative has epic sweep, but the moral motivations of the characters are simplistic in the extreme. They may be torn between good and evil, but these are presented as primeval, opposing forces: the concept of mixed motive scarcely exists. The much noted absence of sex from the book typifies this: it's not that the book would benefit from sexual content per se, rather that the heroic model of its universe cannot accommodate anything as challenging as the fusion of love and lust.",

I never seem to get enough, it's like every time I watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies, it's a whole knew adventure. This was the first trilogy to see with strictly my dad and brother. That was our thing, we even went to see the Harry Potter trilogy but it's not finished of course. But anyway the three of us went to see the second one, Two Towers. Once the movie started we couldn't of been more thrilled!!(Im so glad I saw all of them on the big screen!!) All of our actors were great and the theatre was so loud!

296,16 December 2020,SeyedYasinHosseini,10, A review on The Lord of the Rings: The two towers,"Starting with a general idea about The Lord of the Rings, I should mention, predictably that the film cannot reach the book's level. The book has much more details and it can be even more attractive. However we all know it is impossible to bring too much information of the book just in a trilogy; therefore Peter Jackson, the director, did his best. Perhaps this issue would solve if a Tv-show had been created instead of a trilogy.
Anyway, many people believe that just two or three great and epic scenes make the movie memorable and this is the factor that the two towers does. In my opinion the 2nd part of this trilogy is the best one. Certainly this film is great In terms of technical things like filming, music, special effects, acting and so on. Apart from these, what really I noticed and enjoyed were the dialogues; very beautiful and impressive and also full of metaphors. At the beginning of the movie, Saruman has a sinister speech about ruling the world by a new order. ""The old world will be burned in the fires of industry,"" says Saruman. I was shocked as soon as I heard these words. By the way, this speech is a good one to just have some fun moments and let our mind have some Conspiracy theory.
In this episode, existence of poor Gollum, who is seriously involved with his two characters, adds to the attractiveness of the film. Gollum was cursed by spirit of lasciviousness. Furthermore, he was defeated by his own carnality.
On the other side, Frodo tries not to be cursed by the ring because he does not want the Gollum's fate for himself. So he has an odyssey in order to destroy the ring. Sam, a friend of Frodo who is accompanying Frodo in that odyssey, has a strong will and personality. Despite hydra-headed problems in their path, Sam always helps his friend.
Another thing which I noticed is about Ents and walking trees. They were victims. The gloomy point is that the situation in the real world is not better than the film at all; even in some particular cases, it could be worse. For instance, considering that problem about cutting down trees in the film, believe it or not, I would say in the reality is much more worse than the film. Statistically we cut down over 15 billion trees each year in reality, trees moan louder and they are much angrier. Trust me.
Anyway, there is an epic war in this film, called battle of Helm's Deep, which is designed beautifully and professionally. Among all these we have Merry and Pippin who create some fun moments. Actually they do not let the film be saturnine. There are plenty of things in this trilogy and I absolutely recommend that to everyone.",
297,2 March 2003,meeza,2, Lordy! Lordy! Lordy! This one is also awful!,"We have witnessed another melancholic Two Towers tragedy. That is the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. This ring also fits into the hand of pathetic cinema just as the one of the previous fellowship. The film brings back all of its characters: hobbits Frodo & Sam, Gandalf the Wizard, hobbit defender Aragorn, and all the rest of these ludicrous characters who are more reminiscent of `ringling circus' animals than lords of rings.   My quest, just as it was last year, is for this ring version to get destroyed at Oscar night and not receive any major wins. * Failure",

I wasn't disappointed with 'The Two Towers'. Peter Jackson draws you into the film with the opening score, and leaves you breathless until the very end.

301,24 May 2003,jaesboxer,10," A true masterpiece, despite what Tolkien purists may say","Reading over some of the IMDb comments on this film, I am truly appalled by the number of people who rant and whine about the films deviations from the book.  Film and literature are two different mediums, not to be confused, and very rarely are they entirely compatible.  Tolkien's book, while brilliant, is not the 'perfect series' as I have heard it proclaimed, and cannot be expected, even by the most adamant of fans to be portrayed to utter perfection in the movie.  Jackson's film is an utter masterpiece, giving the audience what they want, entertainment, emotion and raw pure spectacle.  Almost all of the most brilliant films of all time are not entirely faithful to the book, including 'The Godfather', in which rather large sections were left out, 'Gone With The Wind', 'The Silence Of The Lambs', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'The Bridge On The River Kwai', 'Apocalypse Now', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'Amadeus', 'Raging Bull' and 2001.  And yes, I have read all these books so don't doubt me when I say it.  Literary structure is different from the structure of movies.  And any good screenwriter will tell you more often than not it is necessary to take liberties with a book in order to create the aesthetic of a good movie.  So the ending was changed. It will be in the next one.  So Arwen's appearance was an invention of Jackson's.  It created a bridge in her character between the first and third films.  Okay, I can understand the argument about Gimli being made into comic relief, that annoyed me too, but it did not mar my impression of the film in any way.  In no way do the legitimate complaints of people annoy me, but when I hear such comments as 'Like Merry And Pippin would ever let Frodo go to the boats, he should have snuck to them through the shadowland like in the books', I get really bothered.  Menial arguments such as this are the product of disgruntled Tolkien purists, many of whom I feel would not be satisfied even if the book followed the writer's vision perfectly.  The smallest flaws are made into an ignominious nuisance by those who, even if those flaws were not there, would still complain about something else.  I myself have read 'The Lord Of The Rings' about 6 or 7 times, and I agree it is a great book.  Yet no book is so perfect that it should not be changed in any way.  And I apologize to any Tolkien fans I am offending, but speaking from the view point of a huge literary afficionado I must say that 'The Lord Of The Rings' is not the greatest book ever written, nor is Tolkien the greatest writer.  His mammoth fantasy epic is by no means the standard for literary style, nor for characterization or meaning.  I shake my head when I hear 'The Lord Of The Rings' referred to as the quintessential novel. Despite being the greatest masterpieceo of fantasy ever written, it still does not measure up to Joyce's 'Ulysses', Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov', or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'.  I love Dostoyevsky, yet if a movie were made of 'The Brothers Karamazov', and 'The Grand Inquisitor', perhaps one of the most incredible sections in all literature were removed, I would not damn the director, and insult the film, for I realize the scene, though essential to the writer's purpose, is not essential to the story the film is trying to portray.  If I may parody a line from 'Inherit The Wind', The Lord Of The Rings is a great book, but it is not the only book, and its brilliance as a film may not match its brilliance as a book (though in my opinion it does) but it cannot be insulted merely because it deviates from its source.",

While comparing it to Fellowship would be nearly impossible. The way I see it these films are two different types, while Fellowship was character development with enough action to keep you excited, Towers is action with enough character development to keep you caring.  It's hard to say which is better because I feel that I have reached the middle part of one fantastic nine hour epic film, and you don't find people saying what third of a movie they liked best.  The acting in Two Towers is top notch, as it was to be expected. But the true stand out wasn't who you would have expected, it was Gollum.  If ever a CGI character deserved an Academy award or at least a nomination, it is Gollum.  The CGI is so beleivable its creepy and the acting really lets you see whats going on inside of his head.  This was a difficult job you could tell but Serkis pulled it off with style.  The action will keep you begging for more as Jackson never ceases to amaze you with what he can do with the camera.

Battles are changed (for example no elves appear at Helm's Deep in the book, especially not high elves!), Gimli becomes a parody of himself, parts are added to the events (poor Faramir!), epic parts like the Ents are resized and reduced... the best actor is definitely the only non-human: Gollum.

323,24 June 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," It suffers due to its transitional status, becoming unfocused and meandering; there are a few stand-out scenes, though, and it is still entertaining.","While 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002)' initially seems like an improvement upon its predecessor due to an almost instant start, to the point of totally leaving anyone not already on-board with the story behind, and constant 'in-the-moment' feel, the piece soon becomes a baggy and generally slow affair that does, in itself, seem like the so-called 'extended version' (how an actual 'extended version' exists, I'm not sure I'll ever fully understand). This middle instalment falls victim to its transitional status, which is essentially a kind way of saying that not all that much happens - at least not considering its bloated three hour run-time - while it ties the knot between the first and last part of its larger tale. It also suffers from a meandering narrative that opens up its world in a way that seems unfocused, taking away from the core - and, incidentally, most interesting - story of our protagonist and his journey to destroy that which would seek to destroy the world at every opportunity. There's still a lot to like, including a clarity of vision most prominent in the brilliant battle sequences - which are some of the largest in scale seen in cinema (only to be bested in size by its follow-up) and yet still retain a remarkably tangible quality - and smaller character moments - mainly surrounding its landmark 'motion capture' character. Indeed, this character is a groundbreaking achievement that did almost as much for the industry as the rest of the effects combined, being the premier creation of this kind essentially still to this day. He has some of the best moments in this feature, moments which are only slightly less interesting because of all the apparent 'filler' which surrounds them. It's made out to be essential perhaps because it sits in the source novel, but trimming sequences shouldn't be discouraged even in something based on a beloved book. This flick ends up perhaps the weakest of the trilogy. In the end, though, there are enough stand-out scenes and it's entertaining enough to make it more than worthwhile. 7/10",

The three volumes Anderson referred to, The Fellowship of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King, were initially developed by the original publishers for purposes of cutting down on the cost of printing (David Colbert, The Magical Worlds of The Lord of The Rings). According to Colbert it was the publishers who first came up with the title The Two Towers for the second volume. Given his fascination with and penchant for referring to dozens of important towers within the novel, Tolkien himself wasn't sure which two towers were in fact denoted by the title and was therefore initially unconvinced by the title itself. However Tolkien eventually conceded and thus the myth of the trilogy of The Lord of The Rings was born.",
327,8 October 2011,KineticSeoul,10, War of the Ring,"I said this before but I highly recommend anyone to watch the extended edition for this. It was a real treat seeing this in theater, but seeing the extended edition you can't help but appreciate this film even more. The first film in this trilogy was mesmerizing, and for the most part this movie is mesmerizing as well with it's amazing action set pieces and design but just not as much as the first film. And although it's engrossing I didn't feel the magical experience that I had with the first movie. But that still isn't to say this movie is any less, this film really leaves a mark in cinema and is a memorable movie that will stick with the audience for a long period of time. The first movie in this trilogy is inspirational in many ways but this film is inspirational as well with it's fantasy, magic and action. It will inspire countless movies and especially when it comes to video games. The story is superb although the whole movie leads up to a huge battle at Helm's Deep. The atmosphere is more dark and blue this time which adds a lot to the feel of this film. And I couldn't help myself but care about the cause for the big battle to come and the actual main party that is fighting against Sauron's army. Yes, there are some one liners in this but those one liners stands out in a good way and gets the emotions going and kept me pumped up for whats to come. The speech during battles was actually one of them and it works. The characters in this with the circumstances made honor and virtue really stand out while some characters must fight through temptations. To be honest I liked Tolkien's book this movie is adapted from but found it a bit dry so I didn't really see that big of a problem when Jackson decided to spice things up a bit while staying true to the main story at hand. Even if few great parts of the book is different in the movie, the movie makes up for it for the most part. Although a lot of Tolkien fans might disagree with this, but it's just my opinion. This movie wasn't as enthralling or magical as ""Fellowship"" but it holds it's rightful place in this trilogy and is a great film. Just wasn't enthralling as it's predecessor which was a masterpiece but this one comes pretty close. Some may say this movie isn't well edited but like I said before you have to watch the extended edition to truly appreciate this movie, it just has those key scenes including battle sequences that is missing from it theater release. Anyways this is a awesome second part of the trilogy that should not be missed although it's probably not good as ""Fellowship"".",

I sat through 4 hours of this junk simply to be amazed at how terrible it was. The plot is so thin and the dialogue so silly that one is amazed at how many people were hired on this picture.  Spending millions of dollars, on mostly awful animated sequences that aren't done very well, the director has given people expecting a story nothing but reason to critique him. In one scene the light is very bright and when the scene is cut to a part which is illustrated with computers, it becomes dark, such inconsistencies are obvious throughout.

331,16 September 2007,Robert_duder,7, Suffers from the middle child syndrome of the trilogy but still a must see!!,I feel almost bad giving this film any sort of flack after reading other people's reviews because people truly are very passionate about this film. After re-watching Fellowship of The Ring and truly being enchanted by it I anxiously watched The Two Towers and it just didn't quite captivate me the way that Fellowship did. Many trilogies stumble during their second installment because it's almost a necessary drawl between the first and the third...beginning and end and you have to fill in all the important information to join the two. Certainly the climax of The Two Towers is very important and that's the battle of Helm's Deep and that is really what The Two Towers is all about and it just continually builds up to that and it drags while it's getting there. The characters don't give near the same effort to the expanding story and the action is minimal compared to the original. Yes it has the epic Helm's Deep Battle but it's just a different all around feel to it. Much has changed and there is a lot going on but it's almost too much. I mean The Two Towers spans a lot of information from the book (no I have never read them) so it does have big shoes to fill and I respect that but I just didn't get the same epic feel from it.,

Most people (whether fans of the book, or those just interested in the hype of the first installment 'The Fellowship of the Ring') started with 'Fellowship' and watched 'The Two Towers' to see where the story went next.

336,26 January 2019,tabuno,8," Gorgeous To Look At, But Not Quite Perfect","22 December 2002. I'd say 8 stars out of 10 for this movie. The scenery was spectacular and the overall appearance is of epic proportions. The were a few distractions however and perhaps the DVD (and I'm assuming even longer version will help fill in the gaps). Frodo's internal conflict as the ring-bearer doesn't come across the screen as personal to the audience, we get to see more from an observer standpoint without getting the feelings and the emotions and the actual pull to the dark side was one might get from Star Wars. The Rohan King's son is a person we never really get to know and to feel the bond between the King and his son and again we're left to see the King's emotions from outside, never getting to emote with him. Gollum is perhaps the most amazing character of all in this movie and I'd say should earn an Oscar nomination for something. Except for the ending scenes which seem to suddenly turn the Gollum in another direction from the prior scene which doesn't seem smooth and consistent in character, the Gollum and Frodo's and Sam's interaction was the highlight, brilliant, and intimate creative genius of the whole series to date. Another strange figure is the 10,000 warriors that march to defeat Helm's Deep and King Rohan. But even the Vietnam War, the American Civil War, the Russian Revolution, the numbers offered as to the size of the massed army in this epic fantasy don't seem to conform to the gigantic clash between good and evil of the massive size of Tolkien's novel - I'd think that 100,000 soldier army would be the minimum size to defeat any fortified fortress in the Lord of the Rings. The battle seemed to be awful fast and the feeling of lingering doom, the seige over days (more in line with most fantasy battle scenes) is missing in this movie. However, overall, Lord of the Rings brings to the screen images that have been waiting a long time for Fantasy fans and almost (not quite) capture the essence of Middle Earth. A great attempt, a near perfect success, but there is even better movies to come if this significant benchmark is any indication of the future of fantasy movies.",

338,28 October 2011,The-Sarkologist,8, The war of the ring begins to heat up.,"It is not that Tolkien is original in his stories, he is not, but rather it is the way that he uses his knowledge of European literature to create such a colourful and engaging world. His characters are not shallow, nor is he strictly black and white in his characters either. Granted, there is absolutely nothing good about Sauron, but his better characters are not necessarily pure either. In this regard I think of Gandalf. He is the closest character to what one would consider a good guy in his story, but instead of calling him good, I would say that he is incredibly wise. However it is not that Gandalf is immune from corruption, it is just that he is wise enough to avoid it.",

""The Two Towers"" is always a very satisfying watch. Just for the record, I saw this movie twice in the theater.

340,6 August 2006,Miqque,10, Best of 3!,"Having followed the entire production from green-light, I was entirely pleased with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. However, I did prefer the extended versions on DVD, with the voice-over commentaries and all. The shorter theatrical version of THE TWO TOWERS holds a very special place as perhaps the most exciting film ever made. True, it is not 100% accurate to the novel. It stands on its own. Theoden's speeches, the lighting used, the great Warg battle, and of course Gollum working as well as he did all contributed to an eminently satisfying experience. Every actor has taken their role and made it completely their own. The spectacular sets, particularly those of Isengard, blend so well with the natural beauty of New Zealand to provide both eye candy and attention to the fine details of model-making. The dramatic changes of scene to the approach to Mordor are dynamic. And Brad Dourif gives yet another creepy performance, being one of the finest living actors who has carved out his own niche. Perhaps this is a bit violent for younger children, but once they turn ten or so they will likely eat this up with a spoon. Never does the gore overwhelm, nor do the spectacular effects dominate the intricate story. Great stuff!",

To begin with, this should have had a disclaimer that the film was ""Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's the Two Towers,"" so that geeks such as myself could've saved the $10.00 that I'll never see again, and preserved a fond childhood memory of spending time discovering a literary masterpiece.  I thought I had been scarred by the first film's brilliant dialogue, e.g.,""Let's hunt some Orc!""  (And many people who apparently love this film think George Lucas writes clunky lines!)  but this entire installment left me wanting to pluck out my eyes in a vain effort to cleanse myself.  Of course I see the need to condense a long novel to run within an alloted time, but that's not what happened here, they apparently felt that they could improve upon something that was already nearly perfect.  That was mistake number one.  Mistake number two was devoting a good portion of the film to Liv Tyler, for reasons unkown to me, since nowhere does her character appear in the book.  Other gripes: Turning the land of Rohan into a shanty hippie commune. Then feeling the need to show some hippie kids fleeing, in order to stir up some sympathy in the audience, is my only guess.  Suddenly finding myself in the middle wondering if the movie had stopped, and I was now watching a New Age music video (see Liv Tyler above), Enya, Enigma, something like that.  Half expecting Gandalf to turn into Max Von Sydow when King Theoden is ""possessed"" by Saruman, and begin bellowing, ""The power of Christ compels you!""  Aragorn dying, to be healed by Arwen (more Liv Tyler), and then awakened when the horsey starts kissing him.  Then there's the time that... Ugh!  I give up!

While the sweeping vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable, a noticeably slowing plot means we're seeing more of them, for longer periods of time, than in the previous installment. Rather than the perfect balance of action, adventure and fantasy seen in Fellowship of the Ring, much more time is devoted to romance, pontification and elaboration in The Two Towers, with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very long-winded, literary feel. There's still room for a bit of warfare, of course, with the lengthy battle for Helm's Deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself, but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry. Perhaps that's just a case of too much material in the Extended Edition, though. Andy Serkis is a revelation as Gollum, while Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo is an improvement over his one-dimensional turn in the first film. It's also worth mentioning that the CGI creature effects, which looked so convincing on the screen back in '02, don't benefit from the crystal clarity of a Blu-Ray translation.",
353,1 September 2022,GusherPop,10, They accomplished the near impossible with J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved story,"The stunning three-hour epic was just the first part of a three-part story. New Line released an extended cut of the film last year, and we went on to declare it the ""Best DVD Ever Made"". And it was. The four-disc set has really yet to be surpassed in terms of the amount of depth in its analysis of the films' production. Exactly a year after the release of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers stormed into theaters. It raked in the cash like its predecessor and earned much of the same critical acclaim. However, fans of the books were split on some of the controversial changes made to many of the larger elements of the story. What the filmmakers did was take the two parts of the book and intertwine the stories into the normal film narrative that one expects. In the process, some big changes were made and entire sequences were dropped; some to make the events in the film match up with the timeline that Tolkien put in the book. For example, in the book the action in Shelob's Lair doesn't take place until well into the Battle of Pelennor Fields, which is about in the middle of The Return of the King. Thus, that scene is not in the second film, but will instead show up in the third. Since all three films were made at the same time, Towers feels like the natural progression of the story from Fellowship. It's a darker story, but this second chapter of the epic puts the final pieces of the puzzle together to set things up for the final film where everything comes to one major finale. Thanks to Andy Serkis' acting and the work of WETA Digital, Gollum is the single greatest achievement in visual effects since ILM brought Dinosaurs back to life in Jurassic Park. There's really no other way to say it. Gollum is a computer generated character that can act and hold up to live actors in the same scene. Gollum truly breaks new ground. It crosses that threshold that effects cynics have been talking about since the subject of digital actions came up. With ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" it's clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J. R. R. Tolkien.",

Boromir and Frodo are two diminutive human-like creatures (hobbits) from a threatened region of fantasy world. They have been entrusted to return an evil ring of power' to its source and so destroy it. The Ring has a mind and personality of its own and tries to corrupt its bearer. Line up the good guys: Gandalf, (friendly magician), The Ents (tree-creatures that can walk and talk), various human and half-human species, and CGIs that generally are wont to inhabit such tales. Then there's the baddies: Saruman (corrupt wizard), the Dark Lord Sauron, and an army of custom-bred nasties (queue more fabulous CGIs). Finally, one of the most popular characters, Gollum (Smeagal) who has been twisted body and soul and tracks after the ring bearer in the belief he is its rightful owner. (Smeagal is such a remarkable feat of special effects that he has endeared himself to many audiences who come out pining for a pet one.) The Two Towers' of evil unite against the forces of good and slug it out for another three hours. (This synopsis for the benefit of anyone who hasn't spent many hours reading the book). The good things about the film are much the same as Part One (Fellowship of the Ring) or even better  great scenery, great battles, believable acting and judicious use of special effects in a movie that respects the intelligence of the adult cinema-goer without being too horrific for a young adolescent. On the down side, you have to like this sort of stuff in the first place, or be willing to be won over, and you have to put up with built in flaws like a dodgy and seemingly random mix of accents throughout.
