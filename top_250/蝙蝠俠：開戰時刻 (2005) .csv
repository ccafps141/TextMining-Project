0,15 August 2005,pyrocitor,10, Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. ",/

2,10 September 2015,jaredpahl,8, Mature Batman Origin Story With Enough Comic Book Flair To Satisfy Fans Of Every Kind,"Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.",e

4,16 October 2015,Leofwine_draca,9, A reboot that works,"British director Christopher Nolan is better known for his lower-profile thrillers such as the excellent MEMENTO and the brilliant INSOMNIA, but his first big-budget Hollywood blockbuster is still in the same league as the other two: a tremendously inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking, which breathes a whole new life into the Batman saga and proves to be the best film of the series (shame it took till number five to get it right, but that's life). Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines, instead taking Batman back to his roots, and the result is a tough, violent, realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here, without any superpowers, but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night.",i
5,6 June 2005,motta80-2,10, Everything I could have hoped for,"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)",e

8,22 June 2006,marshall_web,10, Nolan is the real superhero,"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.",r
9,12 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," A Batman that is stylish, dark and gritty- simply brilliant!","My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.",w
10,5 June 2006,Hitchcoc,9, By far the most intense of them all,"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films.",1

12,4 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,8, Good start to Nolan's trilogy,"Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.",4

14,16 December 2015,ivo-cobra8,10, Rebirth Of A Legend - The greatest reboot of an origin story!,"Batman Begins (2005) is actually great reboot of The Dark Knight trilogy and a start of the origin tale of Batman, but is not the best one in the series, that will be The Dark Knight (2008). Batman Begins is strayed from the comic books. My DC comic super hero on a 1st rank will always be Batman I always love Batman from comic books, cartoons and movies more than other superheroes. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it because I thought, it was boring and I didn't got the story. I grew up with Batman (1989) Michael Keaton and I did too loved much more than this one. But than I kept watching and watching it and I fall in love it, It always entertained me. In my opinion Christopher Nolan's and Burton's Batman are all great movies. ",8
15,16 December 2015,paul_haakonsen,6, Better the second time around...,"The first time I watched ""Batman Begins"" I can't really claim to have been overly impressed with this origins story, and I remember finding the characters sort of plain and the story equally so.",9
16,13 April 2006,daniel-johnston,9, Batman has truly begun!,"To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze ""You're not sending me to the cooler"", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man.",3
17,28 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10, Outstanding Batman 'Prequel',"This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman. ",/
18,18 July 2008,bobsgrock,10, The start of something truly spectacular.,"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.",?
19,6 June 2005,streetsmarts101,10, Finally!!!,"I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is the movie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.",r
20,10 September 2005,gavin6942,9, Batman Begins Again - This Time With a Vengeance,"Anything I say about this film will sell it short. I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer, but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting, the directing, the mood, the plot, and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation.",e
21,13 March 2008,freemantle_uk,10, The best Batman film so far,"This is the best Batman film so far. I enjoy for the fact that it was psychological and takes the most realistic approach possible. This was because the director Chris Nolan is known for making psychological thrillers, and he also only used CGI when needed, he made the film using stunts and keeping the action down to earth.",f
22,4 July 2005,preppy-3,7, What's all the fuss? It's just OK,Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.,_
23,6 June 2005,Shinra78,8, The Batman film I've been waiting for...,"Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.",=
24,28 July 2005,fjhuerta-2,9, I had basically forgotten there was a time Batman movies were great!,"This is the movie The Hulk wanted to be, and failed miserably - the story of the man that turned himself into a legend. While Hulk failed on every conceivable level, though, this ""Batman"" succeeds.",t
25,27 September 2005,unakaczynski,9, Batman whips out his bat-balls!,"Well, it's official. Batman has gotten his balls back. This film is dark, extremely dark. So dark in fact, there are a great number of scenes filmed, I kid you not, exactly like a horror film. Now, I'm a huge fan of the ""real"" Batman movies. You know, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" which were done by Tim Burton, starred Michael Keaton, and were carried along by Danny Elfman's rousing musical score. Let's not forget, that old Batmobile from those films. This tank-like monstrous new Batmobile may very well be the coolest car I've personally seen in a movie in ages. Of course, if you're a fan of those rather putrid, embarrassing ""other"" Batman films (Forever & Robin), then you may very well not like this movie. Because it doesn't totally suck like those films did.",t
26,2 October 2008,tburke85,10, Batman Begins A Great Reboot To The Series,"This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for. The popular series has been on hiatus after the terrible 1997's Batman and Robin that nearly ruined the franchise. Well Batman is back and better than ever. In Batman Begins acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan explores the mysterious origins of the legendary Dark Knight. With an all star cast including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Wanatabe, and Morgan Freeman. You can go wrong with a cast like that. Christian Bale steps into the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. He's phenomenal in the role playing three very distinct characters in one film pulling it off respectively. He plays the angry grown up Bruce who's full of rage and guilt, the arrogant billionaire playboy persona he shows to the public who spends his days dating beautiful super models and buying things that aren't for sale. Christian also plays Batman and he's the perfect choice to bring this popular character to life in ways that none of the other actors were able to no offense. Bale's fantastic in it and makes us care just as much about Bruce as we do Batman. The voice he came up with is fitting for the character and didn't bother me. Michael Caine is superb as Bruce's most trusted butler Alfred providing comic relief and acts as Bruce's conscious keeping him on the right track. Liam Neeson is solid as the mysterious Ducard who is Bruce's mentor. He offers him guidance and eventually becomes one of the films main villains later on in the movie. Liam is effective as both Bruce's mentor and a formidable foe to Batman. Well done. Katie Holmes is good as Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes a childhood friend to Bruce and potential love interest. Gary Oldman is excellent as Jim Gordon one of the only honest cops left in Gotham City. Gary is so good you forget that he's acting. He inhabits the role of Gordon and is perfect for it. Cillian Murphy is exceptionally creepy as Dr. Jonathan Crane better known to comic book fans as the twisted Scarecrow. He's a gifted actor and his character does sort of take a back seat to Ra's in the third act but he was still good as the deranged villain. Tom Wilkinson is terrific as the menacing crime boss Carmine Falcone. He's the first villain Bruce faces when he returns to Gotham as Batman and Tom Wilkinson's role in the film may not be large but he proves to be another effective villain (like Neeson, Murphy, and Wanatabe) in the great ensemble cast. Rutger Hauer is solid as the greedy Mr Earle whose trying to take control of Wayne's company in his limited screen time. Ken Wanatabe's impressive as Ra's Al Ghul the cult leader of the League of Shadows. His part is very brief and he doesn't have much dialogue either but he makes the best of the small role of someone you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Lastly veteran actor Morgan Freeman is fantastic as scientific genius Lucius Fox who works alone in the forgotten Applied Science Divsison located in the basement of Wayne Enterprises where Bruce finds the tools he needs to become Batman. Lucius helps Bruce in his quest of ridding Gotham of crime and corruption. His character may even very well know Bruce is Batman but there's an unspoken understanding and respect between them that grows into an admiring friendship. I quite honestly can't think of one thing about this movie that I didn't like. From director Christopher Nolan daring vision of bringing Batman into a realistic world to the great all star cast who are good in their roles to the exhilarating action sequences that at least felt very realistic and not something that was made up in a computer and of course the re-imagining the Batmobile known as The Tumbler. This Batmobile is truly unlike any other vehicle you've ever seen and they really did build it so the Tumbler can actually do nearly everything it does in the movie. It gets just enough screen time that makes you wanting more of it but in a good way. Also worth mentioning is the music for the movie by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. It matches perfectly with whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. Batman Begins is a spectacular adventure with plenty of action especially the second half. It's now one of my favorite movies and I can't wait to see what Christopher Nolan has in stored next for the sequel. Nolan has taken this Batman movie and done justice to the character. It has character development, drama, suspense, and humor (from mostly Caine, Freeman, and some from Bale) with just the right amount of action thats well executed including Bruce's fight with Ra's in the Himalayan monastery perched on a mountain, and an intense chase with Batman in the Tumbler on the streets and rooftops of Gotham. The action packed monorail chase sequence finale will have you on the edge of your seat too and if you're not than something's wrong with you. This film had a great balance of character development, action, drama, suspense, and some humor. Nolan is admirable in making this film crafting an intricate story that's a character driven action crime drama that makes you care about Bruce and Batman while he tries to save Gotham from sinister villains instead of just making it into a special effects extravaganza with zero character development, a poorly written plot, and so-so action sequences. Yeah I'm talking about you Spider-man 3 and Transformers 2. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining action adventure based on a comic book. Go see it. You won't be disappointed with Batman Begins.",_

28,30 July 2005,alfiefamily,9, Christopher Nolan shows us what a Batman movie should be!!!,"""Batman Begins"" is an absolute triumph!! Christopher Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Schlockmacher could not. Give us a caped crusader with a totally believable human side to him.

29,16 June 2005,Quinoa1984,10," a spectacular re-invention of the series, 2nd (or perhaps as good as) Burton's 89 vision","It's always a challenge to take material from the comic to the screen, and to make it powerful enough, and entertaining enough, without getting overly preachy with the material, getting hyper kinetic with the action, or worst of all losing your audience. The last Batman film, Batman & Robin, committed the later crime, and put a stigma on the franchise for several years. But now there is Christopher Nolan, talented director behind the cult favorite Memento, and the under-rated Insomnia remake of 2002, who has taken the origins of the Dark Knight into a different direction, or at least to a better one. His film, Batman Begins, has the power, has the entertainment, and it doesn't cheat its target audience (the die-hard Batman fans) or the general public. There isn't as much humor as the first film (this film's only tiny liability), but there is that genuine dark sensibility that can take in kids as well as adults. That the story and characters are as important as the action sequences and fights is another bonus.",v

After Tim Burton's idiosyncratic vision of the comic strip , the film series became very stuck with the Joel Scumacher version . You wouldn't really blame Warner Bros if they'd ended the franchise there and then due the law of diminishing returns .Indeed it might have been seen as something of a risk casting so many big name ( Read expensive ) actors in one movie .

This is a very long film, but if offers a detailed account of Bruce Wayne's life, and for the first time in the franchise we really get to know the character.

35,5 January 2007,disdressed12,10, one of the best superhero movies ever made,"Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader.obviously,there is a fair amount of character development involved,which you would expect based on the title.but not so much that the film becomes tedious.Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations.this version is also more faithful to the comic.Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director,pacing the film very well.there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne.The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre,instead of simply being devices for the hero(the protagonist)to have a villain(antagonist)to defeat.Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles,as is Liam Neeson.Katie Holmes Has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role,so she is a bit weak.This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts,and is closer to the realm of realism(relatively speaking)the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros there is much more substance.in fact more substance than style,though it is just stylistic enough.All in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader.this movie sets the bar high for its successor,the Dark Knight,which is to be released sometime in 2008. 10/10",
36,16 July 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,9, A kick up the arse to the whole franchise,"I am reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of either loving or hating this film, because it appears that is the popular thing to do when reflecting on the films of 2005.

So the relatively high quality and watch-ability of ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" was a great surprise to me, since I had fully expected them both to be lame, camp, and stupid.

This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.",
39,15 November 2005,keithlivingstone,10, The bat is back***************,"All i can say is thank you Chris Nolan,,,I still think you will have to be a magician to beat Tim Burton's Batman film's but Nolan has is well on his way to becoming Houdini. This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did..",
40,4 June 2005,yeahindie,10, The BEST movie of the year!!!,"I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of ""the young girl"" or ""girlfriend"".

41,13 July 2005,sarastro7,8, The dark & gritty Batman comes to the big screen,"What we see in this movie is the ""dark & gritty"" (TM) Batman, which was introduced by Frank Miller in 1986 in the comics mini-series Dark Knight Returns, which was an alternate future version of Batman. But Miller also gave the ""real"" comics Batman the dark & gritty treatment in the seminal Batman: Year One story, which is perhaps the greatest Batman story ever created (also because of the effective artwork of the excellent David Mazzuchelli), and which chronicles, among other things, Bruce Wayne's initial (pre-Batman) martial arts training in a remote mountain region. In the comics, a creative force as strong as Frank Miller was bound to yield massive imitation by less original comics creators - and so the early 1990s saw the Batman character getting consistently and increasingly dark & gritty, to the extent that the entire Batman universe was based on that darkness and grit.",

43,16 August 2020,mfellipecampos,8, Very good,"'Batman Begins' started on the right foot and started the best superhero trilogy of all time. In this film, the protagonist character is so well represented, that the whole environment around him seems to reinforce his characteristics. Gotham City has never been so well represented, and the scenarios that gave life to the city made it seem that it was always night and that perfectly portray the darkness experienced by the bat man. To complete such harmony, the plot created in the viewer a sense of reality so well thought out that darkness seemed to be everywhere, except in the moments of light from Bruce's past in the dear Wayne mansion, or when it involved him with other dear characters, like Rachel and her butler Alfred. And, magnificently, the villains Falcone, Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul only magnify the story further by gradually causing terror in Gotham, spreading crime until it reaches the main point that gives life to the bat man, protecting the city from its own destruction, and justly the one who contributed most to bringing Batman to life became the one who most needed to get him out of the way simply because of a divergence of opinions that define a hero of the villain, although still within the line of justice. It is an intelligent morality and better preached than in any other superhero film, and that define hero as such, but that still makes you understand and admire the lines of reasoning of all the characters, including the villains. If you have never been satisfied with superhero stories so far and consider them silly, watch this movie and you will never have the same opinion again, and you will see that reality is much more like comic fiction than you think.",

Nolan exceeds well at what he tries to do, and its a sort of achievement that no director has accomplished. Personally, I don't love his style - it relies more on impressive setpieces then the language of film. But it mostly works. Yet I find this movies to be exactly what Christopher Nolan should not be directing - a fantasy.

I never cared for the campy Adam West version of the mid-Sixties TV series, and even looking back at the early comic book stories, the appeal of the character was always geared more toward a kid's eye view of good guys triumphing over bad guys.

I liked elements of Batman and Batman Returns, but for all of the beautiful sets and bangs and whistles, Batman was a 2-dimensional supporting character in his own films, and we never saw much of anything that drove him to don the costume and battle evil. Batman needed a beginning, and now he has it. The first hour is spent delving into Batman's past as Bruce Wayne as a child gets the crap scared out of him by bats, and watches his parents get murdered right in front of him (I actually cried here, to my surprise). It's dark, gritty, and emotional. We see Bruce get trained physically and mentally. He learns to harness his fear and use it. Fear as a weapon is a recurring theme in the movie, a key tool of Batman that was somehow left out of the other movies, and the old 60's show.

'Batman Begins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again, giving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against suffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be trained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his technological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance as not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the means to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also responsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we notice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the other movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing feature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless classic.

This movie is loaded with class A starts (like other batman movies) but they are the best of the best .. Liam Neeson & Michael Caine were very good ..

I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However, despite enjoying the first film, the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development.",
63,4 August 2005,sol-,8, My brief review of the film,"A well made action film, especially of its sort, it constantly tackles below surface ideas, such as justice, fighting crime, fears and corruption, while at the same time the film offers exciting action on the surface. The visual effects are very effective, and the overall visual style suits the project very well. Cillian Murphy is worth noting for an intriguing performance, even if the rest of the cast members only act adequately. The film is somewhat slow to build up, focusing on some of the story elements for too long, but once the film gets going, it is superb. There are certain imperfections that one generally accepts in these types of movie blockbusters. Yes, the on screen romance is dull, but at least here it is not a useless subplot. Yes, some of the characters are inserted just for laughs, and not to add anything to the story. Yes, even some of the necessary characters have pointless moments of comic relief. Yes, the special effects tend to go over-the-top here and there. However, do all these points really matter? If you are expecting a flawless masterpiece then they do, and you will not find such a film here. But, if you just want to see an action film that is a cut above the rest, this is a great example: a film that is engaging both below as well as above the surface.",

Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham.",

The first time we see him as an adult he is in a Himalayan prison; he is released and invited to train to become part of an organisation called the crime fighting organisation; League of Shadows. Upon completing his training he learns that the league's methods are radical in the extreme... they intend to destroy Wayne's home city of Gotham and everything in it because they believe the world needs to be cleansed of its corruption.

This, I must say, is the the best Batman movie yet. It really blew my mind. There was character, depth ... they really did their best to figure out why of all things would a vigilante dress up as a bat and fight crime in a metropolis. Their effort shows.

69,22 July 2015,Scarecrow-88,7, Batman Begins,"While I wasn't totally blown away by Nolan and Bale's interpretation of how ""it all began"", I think it has its moments. Despite a busy plot where the League of Shadows adopt a broken Bruce Wayne, needing guidance and a path to a better him, train him in martial arts and how to engage, out- think, and outwit the enemy, and attempt to invest their philosophy on annihilating injustice (through whatever means necessary) among other things (dealing with Rutger Hauer's managing of his company, working in weapons which might not have been Pops Wayne's desired property in the business; trying to recover his shaky relationship with Holmes' assistant DA; building his crime-fighting lair, costume, weapons behind the symbol of the bat, what he fears the most due to being trapped in a well as a child; contending with a mind altering drug being used by Cilian Murphy's crazed attorney (he's the scarecrow villain); trying to recuperate from the loss of his parents and the nature of having to live up to his father's honored reputation; learning how to be the kind of crimefighter his father would be proud of...), I think there are distinctive personalities that work. Michael Caine as Alfred (never giving up on Bruce), the butler who has kept his affairs in order, Hauer as the company's chief operating executive in the company (with an obvious interest in attaining power in the company), Morgan Freeman as an old company employee in charge of a section of the company that dealt in ""abandoned weapons designs"" (Bruce's go-to guy for kevlar, the elaborately designed batmobile, among other things), and Murphy (the devious, cold- bloodedness is brought out well; that and he plays a prick, douchebag authentically) all bring it even if Katie Holmes (a target of undeserved vitriol) doesn't quite achieve what the part really needed, and Bale, while brooding and providing enough angst and inner anguish, speaks in that dark tone that has been quite the victim of mockery. Liam Neeson, as Bruce's mentor and adversary, is a bit stone-faced and delivers his lines as a man rooted in his philosophy to the point that when he talks about genocide to an entire city it feels like little more than crushing out ants. The action scenes are sparse, but not altogether satisfying to me. They don't have the pizazz I was accustomed to with Burton. The police chasing Batman in the batmobile, and the effects of the toxin on people, to me, are the film's best moments. Gary Oldman plays it straight in a part that he's seldom seen in...a straight-arrow cop totally in favor of justice. He plays the character with valor all the way. This isn't Romeo is Bleeding Oldman, for sure. Tom Wilkinson even shows up as a gangster running the criminal underground, victim of Murphy's toxin when he threatens to expose the plan to poison the city's water supply. A ton of faces, a lot of subplots eventually converging, and Bruce's developing into Batman: there's no way around a lengthy movie. Holmes, if anything, suffers from not having the right chemistry with Bale, but it works both ways. She just lacks this passion and energy the part kind of needs.",

Back in Gotham, he must walk the tightrope of keeping his crime fighter persona as secret as possible, namely by being the hardest partying, biggest spending millionaire the city has ever seen. By showing the world his playboy ways, he is free to consume his real self in honing his skills and toys to making sure Batman has all he needs to succeed on the streets.",

91,26 February 2006,DarthBill,9," ""Swear to *me*!""","First, a recap - after the success of the 1978 Superman film, Warner Brothers was eager to bring another DC Comic book character to the big screen, so naturally, they turned their eyes to the only other DC character who could rival/match Superman for pop culture icon status, Batman (although Wonder Woman is in third place). For ten long, seemingly fruitless years, Warner Brothers and DC struggled to bring Batman to the big screen in hopes that the Dark Knight could have back-to-back success with his big brother the Man of Steel (at the same time, sadly, Superman's film franchise went into a slow, steady decline), with various writers, directors and actors coming, going, jumping on, jumping off, jumping back on, jumping back off again, etc. But then Tim Burton, then a new visionary talent on the rise, came along with just enough familiarity with Batman and just enough strength of will and vision to make it happen, and with the backing of the success of ""Beetle-Juice"", Warners Brothers were just crazy enough to let Tim have a go at it, even if it meant hiring the seemingly less than ideal but in the end very effective Michael Keaton to play the title character. Then in the summer of 1989, with Superman's never ending battle for truth, justice and the American way having died on the big screen, Batman stepped in to fill the void, and a phenomenon of epic proportions so rarely seen before or since was born. Then came 1992's ""Batman Returns"", which was also a mega-hit but inspired a backlash from parents who found the film to be too dark and mean-spirited for their kids (parents reportedly had to drag crying children out of the theater that summer). In response to this and speculation that Batman couldn't hold the fort, Burton was politely asked to step aside and his friend Joel Schumacher came on board with a new Batman, Val Kilmer, stepping in for an MIA Keaton, with the flashier, more light-hearted ""Batman Forever"", which was also a hit despite taking a great deal of flack over stuff like rubber nipples on the bat suit. But then everything came falling down with ""Batman & Robin"", which many complained was too campy while the 2nd film had been too dark, and which featured another new Batman, George Clooney, playing the Dark Knight as a light-hearted scamp (Kilmer at least tried to capture the essence of Batman) in a film that proved to be too much of everything - too garishly bright, too over the top in spectacle, too overly produced and over-exposed it forced the WB to give Batman a time out, leaving Joel Schumacher with a long and bitter battle on his hands as he fought to rebuild his reputation as an actually good director while Clooney went on to bigger, better things.",

93,12 October 2005,claudio_carvalho,9, Excellent Batman,"""Batman Begins"" is certainly the best among the five movies of this great hero released in the theaters. After 1776 reviews in IMDb, I do not know what I can write that have not been written before. In my opinion, this film begins wonderful with the director, Christopher Nolan, of the fantastic ""Memento"", one of my favorite movies. The cast is a constellation, composed of excellent actors and actress: Christian Bale is awesome in the role of the troubled and confused Bruce Wayne; Michael Caine, as Alfred, elegant, gentle and tough, is also perfect; Cillian Murphy, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, Hutger Hauer are very evil bad guys; Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman complete this lovely cast. The special effects are very good, and the cinematography recalls ""Blade Runner"", with rainy and dark locations. The story explains the origins of Batman since his childhood in Gotham City. The soundtrack fits perfectly to the scenes. It is amazing to see that there are bad reviews of this movie, which is a very above average entertainment. My vote is nine.",

95,26 August 2012,hanifmuhammad92,9, A perfect reboot,"This film is absolutely Outstanding! Its nails the character,the world he inhabits and everything around him Beautifully. I couldn't have hoped for a better and more cinematic experience. To call batman begins the first perfect batman live action movie would be true but a complete understatement. This is still easily one of the greatest comic book films of all time and the most thorough origin story that I have ever witnessed. The film explores everything that previous live action incarnations either never could or never thought to. The first thirty minutes of the film don't feature Batman at all but instead the audience is acquainted with Bruce Wayne as both a child and as young and troubled man. He is portrayed by the amazing Christian Bale. The audience develops a Intimate bond with him the way that we have never seen before. The rest of the cast is absolutely magnificent. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Bruce Wayne's martial Arts master. He inspires Bruce when he is at the most vulnerable point in his life. The training sequences in the snowy mountains are some of the most memorable parts of the movie for me. What impeccable screen writing! Michael Caine was born to play Alfred. The relationship between Alfred and Bruce is beautiful. You can tell that Alfred is the closest thing that Bruce has to a father. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman is beyond excellent as Jim Gordon. Finally the character Gordon has a say so in these movies. Cillian Murphy is Fantastic as the evil Scarecrow/Jonathan Crane. The weakest link in the film is Katie Holmes but she still does a good job for the most part. Her characters relationship with Bruce is very engaging even if she doesn't have much chemistry with Bale. Also she gets to deliver one of the best lines in the film ""Its not you who are underneath but what you do that defines you."" The film is gripping unlike any Batman story that you have ever imagined. The film is dark and gritty but not merely for the sake of being dark and gritty. This has a meaning story about a young man who uses a fearful symbol to exact vengeance on the criminal underworld. The character grows and matures as the film progress from a victim of fear and tragedy whose world was falling apart to a fully fledge unstoppable hero that makes the criminals fear him. The Hanz simmer score is masterful and in my humble opinion the best ever put in a batman film animated or live action. This movie is a masterpiece and underrated by fans of its slightly superior sequel The Dark Knight.",

That's usually what happens when we bring in a new director more often than not sad to say, but its true. But with ""Batman Begins"", Batman is truly reborn, no lie. We have a spectacular cast assembled here, with Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and Michael Caine as Alfred, excellent choices. I do consider myself a fan of Batman, being my favorite hero and all (I use to watch all those Batman shows that were great if you ask me), but I am unfamiliar with some of these characters, such as Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and Luicus Fox (Morgan Freeman). Luckily, thanks to Goyer's story, these new characters fit in perfectly. The story of Bruce Wayne is told perfectly and one can really feel his pain and struggle to find his true destiny. I feel the wait is totally worth it and the audiences will enjoy watching Bruce's journey to becoming the dark knight.",
97,9 June 2005,abstrak003,10, Character development in a Comic Book/Plot movie? What a GREAT IDEA!,"Saw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low for this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over the top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think that spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted ""Batman Begins"" has a pretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book, but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and Cillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!).",

101,4 July 2005,Coventry,7, Very good...but something's missing.,"I don't like to comment on giant blockbusters because their humongous fan base usually doesn't appreciate criticism of any kind. Oh well, my rant here contains more 'remarks' than actual criticism, so I'm going to spill my guts anyway. Although a very good film (and definitely a vast improvement over those dreadful Joel Schumacher films) there's something essential missing in Christopher Nolan's reprising of the Batman-franchise: comic-book darkness! Whether intended or not, ""Batman Begins"" doesn't seem to take place in an imaginary world where good battles evil but in a real-life drama setting where every individual has to fight for survival Basically not a bad idea at all, but it's not exactly the ideal setting to have a man flying around, wearing a bat-suit. Bruce Wayne ought to be a superhero but instead he's an emotionally and physically vulnerable man with phobias and no sense of morbid humor. Also, the gimmicks and designs are a lot less exhilarating than they should be. For example: the Bat-mobile here is nothing but a car-tuned Hum-V and Gotham City looks an awful lot like an (even more) pauperized version of New York. Yes, the script is very solid and the cast is terrificbut by no means this ""new"" Batman can live up to the unequaled and blackly ingenious Tim Burton movies that launched the hype about 15 years ago. The film's opening (featuring a young Bruce Wayne on a meditation tour in Tibet) is long and complex but very interesting and a rewarding intro to the new Batman myth. When the story is then transferred to Gotham city, the movie becomes more action-packed and the class-A cast receives the opportunity to show off their talents. I particularly liked Gary Oldman in the (for him) awkward role of honest cop, Tom Wilkinson as the mighty underworld gangster and Rutger Hauer as the greedy and corrupt business manager. I personally found Michael Caine to be unfunny and sophomoric in his role of Alfred the butler and it was sad to see the role of Scarecrow played by a bizarre young nerd.",

The acting is first rate and the story fit within the accepted origin of Batman.Of course Hollywood being Hollywood they do make changes and they are acceptable changes. They actually add to the movie in small ways. Michael Caine is excellent as Alfred he delivers a strong fatherly performance and Liam Neesan is nothing short of great as Henri Duchard a man with a incredible hidden agenda. Inspired casting Gary Oldman as James Gordon. Christian Bale is now firmly entrenched in my mind as Batman. I hope the Dark Knight is just as good as this one or better.,
116,15 December 2014,squirrel_burst,10, It makes a Batman fan out of all of us.,"""Batman Begins"" is not only an expertly crafted superhero movie, it's flat-out a great action film. Every element of the film is top notch. We're given a solid cast of professional actors who take the material seriously, which means we get characters that are iconic and memorable and would be even if they weren't based on the immortal characters of DC Comics. What I still find surprising is that even though any Batman fan, and most people that are somewhat familiar with the character will know roughly what his origins are, but the story does not feel repetitive at all. It feels fresh, and it's very tightly written. As an extra bonus, there is plenty of exciting action sequences. The movie is filled with memorable moments, some great lines and the score is a real powerhouse. There's at least two great car chases during the film that are both really thrilling and the movie gets very inventive with some of the gadgets used by Batman. If you have a friend that has been turned off of the superhero films or never took comic books seriously, this is the movie you want to show them. Not only will they be easily converted but it will give you a chance to watch this movie again. If you haven't re-visited this chapter in the trilogy since the original release date, you've likely forgotten how good this movie actually is (which is likely due to the success of the later films) but on its own or as part of the franchise, it's a landmark in the comic book adaptation genre.

Once Bruce Wayne returns home, he is reprimanded for showboating by his loyal butler, Alfred. In this sequence, the strengths of the film are neatly summed up. An exciting chase sequence is mixed with ambiguity surrounding our protagonist with questions raised over what is necessary for good to triumph. Indeed, at some points during this film, we are left asking what is good and whether it is triumphing at all. In short, this film merges superb action, clever character work and intelligent moral and philosophical questions all the way through with perfect balance.",

121,11 March 2008,scott-sw,9, The real Batman,"Batman Begins was a movie I liked marginally when I originally saw it, but have grown to like it better the more I see it. Christian Bale plays the renegade billionaire Bruce Wayne who mysteriously disappears for several years while studying the criminal mind and element in the Far East. He is found by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the League of Shadows. This organization uses Ninja tactics and sees itself as the guardian of the world. The League of Shadows exists like a Star Chamber, taking actions against criminal elements government courts will not deal with. This secret league was responsible for the sacking of Rome, and the London Fire. Now, they wish to level Gotham City. Bruce barely escapes after learning their battle tactics. Returning to Gotham, he dedicates himself to ridding the city of Falconi, a ruthless crime lord who has the city in his grips for decades. In fact, the man who killed Bruce's parents worked for him at one time, making the stakes higher. Wayne uses his clout to look into weapon systems his company developed. He find some body armor. An unusual car. A cape. He forges them all into his new persona, Batman. While he brings down Falconi, someone else gets to him first: Dr. Jonathan Crane or the Scarecrow, played by Cillian Murphy. His gas agent causes people to go insane by releasing their worst fears. Apparently, he is working with the League of Shadows and release his chemical into the drinking water. We also meet a young cop named James Gordon (Gary Oldman), who is trying to go against the crooked police department. Another player is Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), an attorney who works for the city. This is how Batman should have been. Director Christopher Nolan deftly puts Batman into the real world. While I enjoyed Tim Burton's concept for Batman and Batman Returns, it was foreign - removed from reality into an uncertain time with uncertain technology. What Nolan does is give us not only circumstances, but also consequences for a man driven to the edge. I also enjoyed his use of non-linear time, which he seems to be a fan of. It keeps the audience interested and puzzled until the third act when it truly unfolds and fully makes sense. Also, Chrisian Bale does a wonderful job as a man conflicted. He hates the criminal mind and believes they should be stopped. Still, he cannot bring himself to kill those he hates. He also deals with his own hatred and propensity towards vengeance. The other performers also give great performances. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the company man who leads Bruce Wayne to the interesting toys. He tells him how they work and how they should be used. Michael Caine gives the best performance as Alfred Pennwise, the faithful butler to Bruce Wayne. His charm, charisma, and dedication are portrayed so well. I was even moved by Gus Lewis as a young Bruce Wayne who took the role seriously and gave us a boy who truly blamed himself for his parents' death. The best scene is when Alfred comforts his loss. This was one of the best of the superhero movies of the last ten years. I hope the next one is done just as well.",

Everything en-thrills this classic to be what it is. Christian Bale can once again be looked at as, not just a corrupt lunatic (American Phyco) but as an actor who enhances his talents to the full, weather it be a hero or villain. Christopher Nolen directs quite possibly his best film to date. Cunning angles, exhilarating action sequences, solid acting and on and on.

All I got from this one was a king-size headache and a sore bottom where I was bored senseless for the best part of two hours. Chris Nolan thinks 'Batman' should be taken dead seriously. A rich man who goes out at night in a rubber suit designed to resemble a bat? Oh, come on! Putting the Caped Crusader in a film like this is like making 'Austin Powers' the star of a Daniel Craig-type Bond film. Worse, the chief villain - The Scarecrow ( Cillian Murphy ) - is another nut, only this one runs round with a sack on his head! Michael Caine's 'Alfred' cannot hold a Bat-candle either to Alan Napier or Michael Gough. The story of this film...well, was there one? All I saw was a lot of fighting with nothing in-between.

134,13 March 2006,Sherazade,10, 206+ pages of great reviews for this film can't be wrong!,"Wow! I was blown away by this one. It's almost like somebody dared them to bring it after seeing the previous installments of the series of movies under this franchise, and they sure as heck brought it! With an Oscar-winning, Oscar-nominated cast that included the likes of: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe and Morgan Freeman you wouldn't expect any less but don't be fooled by that because the manner in which this installment was chock full of who's who names, so were the arguably disastrous ""Batman and Robin, Forever & Returns) sequels to the finer classic ""Batman."" Luckily, the writers backed up all that talent with a good story in its script and incredibly witty Dialogue. Batman Begins starts off with Bruce Wayne as a little boy, playing around with childhood friend Rachel Dawes when during hide and seek he falls down an old well shaft and is attacked by a nest of bats which frighten the heck out of him. He is rescued and nursed back to health by his parents who then treat him to a Broadway play days later. During the play, young Bruce is frightened by the thematic elements and his parents decide to ditch the show early. They leave through an alleyway where they are attacked by a homeless druggie, who upon obtaining the Wayne's wallet, shoots both parents dead. The film then picks up about 15 years later where Bruce(now played by Christian Bale) travels the world in search of ways to get rid of injustice (basically what his parents were fighting for) as well as get revenge. He meets two Samurais (played by Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson) who train him in weird but efficient ways to face his fears and conquer his enemies. He returns to Gotham city to attend the hearing of the man who killed his parents and there he meets Rachel Dawes(now played by Katie Holmes) who is the assistant district attorney, naturally sparks fly and he is instantly smitten with her from the moment he sees her all grown up. Bruce had come prepared to shoot the killer dead when he stepped out of the courthouse, but somebody beats him to it and he finds out the set up. This leads him to go and confront the drug-lord (played by Tom Wilkinson) the killer work for and the meeting infuriates him. It is this and more that slowly turns Bruce into his alter-ego Batman and there is never a dull moment as he comes to terms with occurrences around him, his true enemies become revealed and he comes to terms with his fears. What with the intense action sequences, the high tech equipment and visuals and not to mention CGI! If you haven't seen any of the other Batman films, skip them and see Batman Begins first!

Christopher Nolan took the movie at the correct time, when much of us were waiting for the return of The Dark Savior, whose dark suit hides a thirst for justice that lies in a humanly more developed way; not like Schumacher's Batman that was almost Captain America with a little more colour. Great Christian Bale: his gestures show power, his words resentment: best Batman although he had no big competition. The supporting cast shines for itself; but Katie Holmes really lacks appealing actoral power. The cinematography which catches dark at its very best, and the incredible sound make this a very pleasant experience.Fast and moving editing.

He makes Bruce Wayne the main character not Batman. This realism is what makes the film so revolutionary it is by far the most realistic superhero film I have ever seen. Batman doesn't defy the laws of physics, Gotham isn't an over blown fantasy it looks as it could really exist in the states and the villains aren't fake people there real criminals. The cast is brilliant and its not dominated by American's with the exception of Holmes and Freeman. The main cast, the major characters are all British/Irish brilliant actors none the less.

Witty, ironic humour mixed with drama and excellent action all made for a gripping tale for this soul. To me, Bale looked fantastic in the bat suit - so much so that it didn't look like Bale at all. I thought the rest of the cast were perfectly placed, particularly Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. As a fellow Ulsterman, I was very happy to see Liam Neeson doing his thing here. Cillian Murphy was very good as well, as far as I'm concerned - he was the source of some quite chilling moments. There are some nice twists along the way.",

It's very dark, very thoughtful and ideally cast almost from top to toe, with Christian Bale making a fine Bruce Wayne and Batman, Michael Caine giving the movie some genuine warmth as Alfred (and pretty much stealing the movie, along with Freeman's Lucius Fox), and it never treats the audience as anything less than adults.",

This is the film that not only proves it, but puts would be pretenders such as Spiderman and X-Men in the shade with a superb piece of film-making that puts script and characters above action sequences (although there are plenty of those too). What is so satisfying about the movie is that while Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly putting his own statement on the character, he has also reverted more to the style of the first Batman movie of 1989, by making the universe are characters inhabit a plausible and real one, even in the presence of bat-caves, gadgets and over the top villains.

156,1 August 2005,hokeybutt,8," Best Batman Ever? Yep, I'd Have To Agree...","BATMAN BEGINS (4 outta 5 stars) When I first heard about this movie... and saw some of the preliminary designs (big rubber mask, fancy Bat-gear, tank-like Batmobile) I expected the worst... some brainless action movie with lots of noise and explosions and not much else. I thought the world needed another ""Batman"" movie like it needed another ""Rocky"". Well, I was wrong. This is definitely the best ""Batman"" movie ever filmed. Much as I enjoyed the first Tim Burton movie, I have to admit that it's Jack Nicholson's performance that made it memorable. The script had some fun scenes and some good one-liners but it didn't really have a satisfying story. This time around they have a decent script to build their action scenes on. The story and screenplay by David Goyer and director Christopher (""Memento"") Nolan deals with the entirety of the Batman legend... telling us in great detail just how he evolved from rich playboy to obsessed crime-fighter. I found it amazing how the movie could pack in so much story and background and not make it all seem rushed and crammed together. They even toss in a completely unnecessary love interest for Bruce Wayne... a childhood sweetheart played by Katie Holmes... but it still works! The movie's elements all come together and even though there are several name actors in small roles (Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe, Tom Wilkinson, Morgan Freeman... not to mention Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Caine as Alfred the butler) none of them seem short-changed on screen time... or good lines. Michael Caine almost walks off with the movie... as probably the definitive Alfred... but Morgan Freeman gives him some fierce competition as the Wayne Foundation science tech who is able to provide Batman with some of his fancy crime-fighting equipment. Christian Bale is probably the best actor who has taken on the role so far. In previous movies the Bat-suit was the star... it didn't really matter much WHO they put in it. This time, Bruce Wayne takes center stage and Bale makes us see him as a man... and not just a secret identity. There are minor flaws (Ken Watanabe could have been used more, the Scarecrow character seemed a bit superfluous) but this still ranks as one of the best superhero movies ever done.",

Christain Bale as Batman? He's better than George Clooney, that's for sure, but he didn't give much depth to his character. It's like ""Look! My voice can get scary! I'm Batman! No, really, I am!"". Katie Holmes? I'm recently ticked off with her and Tom, so I'm going to back off and just pretend she wasn't in the movie at all. The villain? Who was it? There was no main one! ",
158,16 June 2005,colonel_green,10, The dark knight returns in style.,"As every review of ""Batman Begins"" mentions, the Batman franchise self-destructed eight years previous when Joel Schumacher's ""Batman and Robin"" turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. The campy elements of the franchise had overrun Schumacher's two films, and now the studio turns to virtuoso indie director Christopher Nolan and ""Blade"" screenwriter David Goyer to revive their classic superhero. Marvel Comics heroes have been ruling the screen for the last several years, and now it's only fitting that DC get in on the act. Christian Bale picks up the role previously essayed by Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney, playing a younger and much more dramatic Bruce Wayne/Batman than any of the other actors had (although Adam West's series retains its campy nostalgia value). As is fashionable these days, a young rising star is surrounded by a phalanx of veterans performers: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe, and Tom Wilkinson have between them three Oscars and a further ten Oscar nominations. Add to that Rutger Hauer, Cillian Murphy, and Katie Holmes, who does surprisingly well with her role, and you have perhaps the best cast assembled for any film this year. Gotham City is no longer the twisted, stylized metropolis of past Batman films, but a relatively normal city, which adds to ""Begins""'s authentic feel, much like Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" movies. My one complaint has to do with the way Nolan chooses to shoot the hand-to-hand fights, which is in extreme closeups and rapid editing that makes it difficult to understand what is happening. The fights could have benefited from a more remote vantage point and less frenetic editing. Regardless, this adventure gets a 10/10.",

And Christian Bale is simply superb in the role; making Batman dark and brooding, the way he should be. Many have criticized Katie Holmes, but I liked her in this film (especially in Pieces of April, Abandon, The Gift). The villains also get top billing and are far more menacing and three dimensional than before. The original movies were good in their day but they pale in comparison to what Nolan and co brought to the big screen because staying true to the source material pays off and is more engrossing in the end. Some superhero movies have tried to go the other way around resulting in failure but this film nailed it spot on. My main complaint is the fight scenes were too heavily edited. Hopefully they will be fleshed out in the next film. I enjoyed Spider-Man and X-Men and their sequels (except the third installments) and Iron Man respectively but Batman will always be my favorite superhero and with the sequel approaching this summer, it's gonna be one hell of a treat.",

161,27 July 2019,kriscot-48548,9, A great time,"Almost ten years ago Warner Bros. declared the Batman franchise as dead as a teenager in a Friday The 13th film. After the abomination that was Batman & Robin WB felt as though fans would not be interested in seeing another Joel Shumacher helmed Batman film. WB was right. fast forward a few years and Director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) & screenwriter David Goyer (The Blade trilogy) decide they have what it takes to resurrect the Batman franchise. Nolan & Goyer were right. Batman Begins is by far the best live action Batman film made. Nolan & Goyer did the best thing they could do to a franchise that was on it's way to looking like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. They wiped the slate clean and started it from the ground up, hence the title Batman Begins. Unlike the film predecessors Batman Begins stars and features Batman. Meaning Batman is the main character (He was only the main character in Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm an animated Batman movie)instead of his villains. Batman should have been titles The Joker. Batman Returns should have been called The Adventures Of Catwoman & The Penguin. Batman Forever should have been titled The Mental Misadventures Of The Riddler & Two Face. Batman & Robin should have been called.....Crap! The Movie. Batman Begins is the perfect title for a Batman movie because this movie is absolute Batman. The plot is smart & intelligent and his origin is entertaining as hell to watch unfold. Whoever casted Christian Bale as Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, & Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon please stand up and take a bow. The casting was great. If I had to compare Batman Begins to any film I'd say it was like a cross between Spider-Man & The Bourne Identity. A great origin superhero movie mixed with a thinking man's action film. This is not dumbed down like any of those other Batman films (Batman Forever, Batman & Robin) it's smart, witty, & intelligent with out taking itself to seriously. I'm a comic book geek so I take my films based on comics very seriously. Until now Batman was never done right in Hollywood. For some stupid reason Hollywood kept trying like hell to channel the spirit of the goofy, campy television series of the '60's. Well that recipe has been tossed out the window. Not only is Batman Begins (In my opinion) the best movie of the summer, the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer, but the best superhero movie (granted he has no super powers) made. I only hope I walk out of The Fantastic 4 nearly as happy as I did with Batman Begins. Long live the new king of superhero/comic book movies. Welcome to Hollywood Batman, you have finally arrived. On a scale of 10 i give Batman Begins a 10 out of 10. Do not wait for video if you do you'll regret it.",
162,16 June 2005,FMACDONALD,10, Finally Batman has been done right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After an excellent film, a great film and two diabolical films, there is finally a brilliant Batman film. Tim Burton's Batman offerings were undeniably superb and eclipsed their follow ups in greatness, but even then there were severe weaknesses in the Batman franchise's transfer from page to the big screen. Burton didn't manage to fully shake Batman's unfortunate ""camp crusader"" persona that the Dark Knight picked up from the terrible 1960s TV series. Though considerably darker, the high camp, pop art undertones that were never intended in the Batman comics were still present in Burton's films. Then of course, ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" took that to an incredibly unnecessary extreme. Batman was lost. Thank heavens for Christopher Nolan. Obviously as disillusioned with the failing franchise as most of the disgruntled comic book fans, Nolan has managed to not only restore the dark, Gothic ambiance of the comics, but also take Batman to new heights, and ""Batman Begins"" is far more than a comic book adaptation. For the first time in a Batman movie, Bruce Wayne's introduction and character foundation is so fascinating and emotionally charged, that you are not merely waiting for him to put the Bat suit on for the first time. Being the first chapter chronologically in the Batman saga, Wayne's character pre - bat is essential to the success of the narrative. His motive for wanting to fight injustice and his childhood traumas are told so beautifully that the movie would almost work well enough if the Batman alter ego never came into play. But, of course, when he does, Batman really begins. Christian Bale is quite simply the best Batman audiences have ever had the privilege of viewing. For the first time, Batman really is a symbol of fear, as was the comic's intention. This is all thanks to Bale's flawless performance as the dark Knight. Criminals and do-gooders alike fear Batman. But, frightening as he is, he is just another Superhero in terms of fear when it comes to Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. With the genius use of hallucinogens to enhance the fear, Scarecrow might just be the most frightening antagonist since ""The Exorcist's"" demon. The point of view shots from his victims are a more effective alternative to his character than just giving him superpowers. That way, Nolan manages to hold onto the film's overall sense of reality and drama. The film's most effective aspect is the darkness. The stunning set piece creates a nightmarish world that is pure fear incarnate, and with fear being the film's driving force, the darkness is perfectly placed. All of the supporting actors, bar none, are without imperfections in this movie, particularly Katie Holmes, who proves that she is more than a tabloid friendly teen idol. Its just a great shame that her performance in ""Batman Begins"" was very much overshadowed by her bizarre relationship with Tom Cruise. Michael Caine is severely amiable as Alfred, and the eternally impressive Gary Oldman delivers yet another excellent performance. But of course, it is Bale who steals the show. Obviously relishing the role, Bale makes Batman a character we've never had the privilege of meeting before. More than a straight talking superhero armed with one liners. Batman, thanks to Bale, is now an emotionally unstable, fear inducing warrior. Batman Begins is free from superhero cliché and camp humour. It is, finally, a real Batman movie. The dreaded prison break scene is no less than amazing, and the subsequent parade of justice and optimism, combined with a considerate reference to a legendary Batman enemy, make this film perfect from start to finish.",

The genesis of the character as well as inedited insights into the seven mystery years in the life of Bruce Wayne makes the whole enterprise engaging even thrilling. Christian Bale is an American Psycho Batman, pouty lips and unexpected sexual presence. Katie Holmes is lovely, with a sharp intelligence and a riveting imperfect beauty.

The film takes a more grounded and realistic approach to the Batman, exploring his origins and the events that shaped him into Nolan & Bale's incarnation of the Dark Knight. The film features a strong supporting cast, including Liam Neeson as Ra's Al Ghul and Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow, and a compelling story that will keep you engaged from start to finish.

The Batman saga was revived by Tim Burton and it started under auspicious skies with the two following novel chapters: ""Batman"" (1989) and ""Batman Returns"" (1992). With the arrival of Joel Schumacher, the series plumbed. ""Batman Forever"" (1995) and ""Batman and Robin"" (1997) were real downers which tarnished Batman's reputation. Due to this, Gotham City's most well-known inhabitant took refuge in his den and waited for things to evolute. In the meantime, he was upstaged by other superheroes like ""Spiderman"". Was there a future for Kane's son? Rather than pouncing on the elaboration of a new adventure (at one point, one even talked about the possibility of a story called ""Batman vs Superman""), why not plumping for a streak which has been seizing the Hollywood firm for several years? Just look at the titles of the following works: ""the Exorcist: the Beginning"" (2004"" or recently ""the Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the Beginning"" (2006). These titles give this inkling: to go back to the sources and roots and unearth what made Batman a myth. Like many moviegoers on this site, when I learned that Christopher Nolan was the heir of this work, I felt that the project was in good hands.

A great movie for fans and wannabe fans.,"There are not too many surprises in BATMAN BEGINS in terms of plot -- after all this time, let's face it: We know how things will turn out for the Caped Crusader. No, the real surprises are in the style of the film, which Christopher Nolan adapts from a whiz-bang comic to a modern era. He takes his time developing the familiar story about how billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (a ripped Christian Bale; his biceps are the size of cocker spaniels) goes from orphan to avenging angel with the help of a mysterious mentor (Liam Neeson). Batman's skills, we learn, are those of the Ninja, and Gotham City exists in a world of its own, neither present-day New York nor some retro-fitted '30s idealized set. The cast is exceptional, the sound design spectacular (although the editing gets a little frantic and confused). It owes more to Alec Baldwin's THE SHADOW in its mythologizing and mystical treatment of the hero, who here is at the center of the action, not peripheral to the villains. In fact, this is probably the Batman movie Tim Burton wishes he'd made: Brooding, contemplative, paced like a novel. Holy prequels, Batman! (c) AWJ",

Oh well enough about the first one Batman Begins is wonderful,I would call it better than the original. I only viewed it for the first time after I purchased the DVD and from the first few reels I was hooked. Batman is a welcome return for one of my favourite superheroes after some pretty awful outings. Batman Forever was OK but Batman and Robin was shameful and an embarrassment to fans of Batman. Christopher Nolan is rather good,Micheal Caine is good as Alfred,Gary Oldman was good but Katie Holmes disappointed. BB tells the story of Bruce Wanye before he became Batman, which I found fascinating to find out.

195,20 June 2005,mungo39,1," I'm sorry, but I hated it.","Batman Begins isn't another superhero movie in the line of Spider- Man, the X- Men or the Hulk. In fact, even if you don't care for Batman or any of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a good action- thriller. It doesn't thrive on special effects and big action scenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to character development. The movie is fairly low tech and because it doesn't rely on computer technology in the way other recent superhero movies do, it has an old school feel to it, kind of like an early 80s fantastic film or even Superman: The Movie. Of course, Batman Begins is much darker than Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main characters from youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders is depicted in a similar way. As far as the actual crime fighting goes, this movie puts right everything that was done wrong in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Our hero's weapons are not covered with blinking lights, but sober and practical: no computer controlled Batarangs, but ninja stars shaped as a bat. No design costume, but military armor, decorated with a cape and mask. The Batmobile is no skyscraper climbing super car, but a rejected army vehicle put to new use that befits the general atmosphere of this movie. Batman doesn't fight villains in shiny outfits who fly around on supersonic gliders or have tentacles as arms. The bad guys in this film are real people: gangsters, a corrupt warden of a psychiatric ward, a martial arts specialist and lots of crooked cops. If you take into consideration that Batman Begins is based on the Year One comics, written by Sin City's Frank Miller, one cannot help noticing the similarity between Robert Rodriguez' newly created world and the one depicted in this movie. In fact, Sin City could just as well be Gotham City without Batman. So forget Joel Schumacher's monstrosities. In fact, Christopher Nolan has even gone one better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a good story, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world's Darkest Knight has ever called home.",

I actually prefer the first three installments of the 1980s & 1990s Batman franchise, though none of them are great movies, either. Tim Burton  and even Joel Schumacher  brought at least some vision into their Batman worlds. Nolan attempts to do this realistically  that was the original idea, anyway  but he is bogged down by screen writing and action movie clichés. There weren't half as many explosions in all four of the 90s Batman films combined. Batman Begins does little to deepen the story, as some critics have claimed. The backstory was told perfectly, and with great economy, in 1989's Batman. There was no emotion lost. Nolan takes nearly an hour to tell it, and he doesn't make it any more interesting. They didn't find a better actor to play Batman. Christian Bale is as dull as Keaton, Kilmer, and Clooney. The villains are uninteresting. Ra's Al Ghul (which is mispronounced throughout the film) has always been my least favorite of the Batman villains. Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka ""the Scarecrow"" is wonderfully played by Cillian Murphy when he's out of his mask, but he is supremely uninteresting when he's in it (doesn't help that Nolan resorts to stupid distorted images and noise pollution whenever he puts the mask on). Katie Holmes is a wonderful actress in small projects, but, like Natalie Portman, she doesn't translate well to blockbusters. Plus, Tom Cruise just ruined her for me. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson are horribly miscast (Wilkinson as a mob boss?). They actually might have just switched roles and it would have been better. The only things the film gets excessively right are Alfred and Lucius Fox, played by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. But, really, while these two consummate actors bring an air of class to this kiddy pool, they out-act both the hero and the villains to such an extent that it warps the movie. I really should not desire more scenes with the butler. I should add Liam Neeson to that, as well. He's very good, and perfectly cast. Batman Begins is often a good actioner, but it should have been much better.",

The threat is a psycho-hallucinogenic drug that the villain is threatening to put into effect in order to destroy Gotham completely.

This live-action adaptation has been smartly directed, scripted, and cast to produce the more realistic dark nature of a human hero out to avenge his parent's murder with every criminal that threatens his Gotham City. It's the best of all the Batman movies, and stands tall next to the godfather/blueprint of all superhero movies, 1978's ""Superman"". Where ""Superman"" left off with a more campy telling of it's superhero, 'Begins' ushers in a more adult, serious take on it's mythic hero, dispensing with any camp and treating Batman seriously, grounding him in a more realistic environment that is more accessible for the audience without dumbing down the story.",
215,28 August 2005,IMDbigONE,10, The Dark Knight Returns,"""Batman Begins"" joins the Superman films of the 1980s and both Spiderman movies as an example of a movie comic book adaptation at its best. This is no surprise with Chrisopher Nolan at the helm, the man who brought us ""Memento."" True to the unique take that Nolan has on Batman, this film is not a sequel to the other four, but rather a new beginning for the caped crusader (as the name suggests). Like the other films, Batman faces multiple villains at the same time, including an old-style gangster named Carmine Falcone (played remarkably convincingly by Tom Wilkinson, who would not have been my first choice), and a devious psychiatrist named Dr. Crane (who proves that looks can be deceptive). There is a third villain whose arrival on the scene comes as a shock to the audience as well as to Batman (no, it is probably not who you think it is!). Naturally, I will not give anything away, except to say that there is a history between Batman and this person that makes facing him or her a psychological challenge as well as a physical one.",

And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are low and they can't make as much money? I realize the fans and critics felt this installment took the legend seriously but sorry comic geeks. A man dressed up as a bat is something that could never be taken completely seriously without a touch of camp. That's why Burton nailed the task of dark with just the right amount of campiness. As for this film, it's neither a sequel or a prequel. Good actors with the exemption of casting mistake, Katie Holmes, good director but other than utterly unnecessary retread of the origin story. Batman has already been reinvented twice and now a third. I will give props to Christian Bale but still not up to par with the likes of Michael Keaton. And Jack Nicholson's performance that was fascinating and brilliant at the same time? That's an impossible act to follow. The villain in this film was neither scary or interesting. Boring and instantly forgettable is more like it. It's no wonder moviegoers are left in such a catatonic state from Hollywood's desperate attempts at creativity. How many times can you reinvent the same franchise? A far more interesting installment should've been BATMAN ENDS.",

They were both great films with strong acting, but Nolan has really nailed it here folks. This is the REAL Batman. It's dark, scary, serious, sad, and most of all it has a real world feel that makes the whole film believable. This film does not have any make believe action sequences like in DareDevil where he jumps 50 feet off of buildings and lands perfectly unharmed. Everything Batman does in this film any man could do if he trained hard enough and had all the right tools. If you are a fan of Blade Runner that you will love this film.

One by one, great actors started to sign on for the film(Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Micheal Cane, Gary Oldmen, Morgan Freeman) and i was all over it. My friends thought it would be really bad and even the great cast and promising trailer didn't really interest them. And then finally i saw the film..... and i was amazed! Chris Nolan has created something other than the Tim Burton Batman we saw in the 80's(and i'm not even going to mention Schumacher's ""2 flops in a row"" Batman). He has made Batman the way he is, dark, anti-social and filled with revenge. Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were flops because the films were too much concentrated on the villains. Batman Begins, however, was centered on Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and defeating his fears. This film is truly the best Batman film ever made, and possibly the best film of this year.",

However, it would be blasphemous to consider this even a door step in comparison with Tim Burton's masterpiece, which starred Michael Keaton in his signature role. The original, a realization of a comic legend, only received 7.4 on the IMDb scale. It confuses me how the general public thinks these days. Are they comparing Batman Begins with the other films released during the year, or are they being serious about it exceeding the original? Here is what I think about Batman Begins............It doesn't even feel like a Batman movie. It misses the point completely. And I hate the excuses of 'making a new Batman film for the new generation'. THE NEW GENERATION ALSO NEED GOOD FILMS. I agree with the casting of Christian Bale, a great actor and once a child prodigy (most memorable in Spielberg's Empire Of The Sun), however he alone could not save this film from disaster. Christopher Nolan is a respectful director, but did he really think he could create his own Batman? Or was it a cash-in opportunity? ",

The cast is perfection (yes Katie Who? does a fine job) and I won't mind looking forward to the sequel, the remake of the sequel, whatever they will call it. Bring the Joker on. Makes a real case for the fact that the right cast means absolutely everything. This is entertainment and comic book characterization come to life. Christian Bale's Batman makes Ben Affleck's tortured Daredevil character look absolutely ridiculous (sorry, maybe that is really not giving Christian enough praise - he deserves all he gets). Since we are in for a few more years of comic books as movies dominating the scene, I vote for more like this - made for adults, not children, with superb casting, and Hans Zimmer (with the help of Lisa Gerrard, maybe Moby, and the like) scoring the music. I felt that in no way was I cheated here - unlike so many other movies that I see where the corners that are cut are bleeding so profusely that you can't help but notice. See this on the big screen.

233,4 December 2014,evanobrien100,9, Extraordinary Filmaking,"He's a billionaire. He is the heir to a very successful private enterprise, and he is devastatingly terrified of bats. Ever since falling down into a bat-infested cave, the bat has been the symbol of his dread. Following the murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne went in search of a way to stand up and fight the injustice in his city, living among criminals in Asia. While in prison, he meets a mysterious man named Rah's Al Guhl, who offers him a way to fight the world's corruption through a special type of training. When he realizes that the brand of justice is not the same as his own, Wayne returns to Gotham, and he does not like what he finds. Utilizing the training he had received, as well as the resources from Wayne Enterprise's Applied Sciences division, Bruce puts on the cowl and cape that we know and love, and he sets out to defend the city that his father worked so hard to preserve. The Caped Crusader has appeared in comic books and other mediums for decades, and the quest for a permanent success in a film portrayal was very elusive. Though Batman (1984) was a relative success, the failure in the projects that followed were enough to drown out this spark of triumph. The infamous Bat-nipples and such were too much for comic book geeks and the general public to handle. Thankfully, a new director named Christopher Nolan, who had just come off of a successful project called Memento (2000), took up the reins of the DC Comics icon. With the release of Batman Begins, the once depressingly faulty franchise was up to par with a more contemporary success, Sam Raimi's Spiderman. In contrast to what the previous films in the Batman franchise brought to the screen, this installation brought some major pieces: great themes, realistic action sequences, and depth to the main character(s). With a notably darker portrayal of Gotham's hero, this movie was a breakthrough for superhero flicks, and it has been a heavy influence on those hero movies that followed it. The only aspect of the film that the Academy recognized was the cinematography, which definitely deserved such attention. It was the sequel, The Dark Knight, which grabbed the most attention for Oscar categories. The biggest difference in this Batman movie is the themes. While the previous films tried to capture the cartoonish, comic book essence of the character, this one was as realistic as a fictional hero story can be. Tackling deep themes like redemption, rebirth, and standing up for one's beliefs, Batman Begins is much more than men in tights saying ""POW"" and ""BAM"". On a negative note, the acting is not quite up to par with the rest of the film's quality. Though it is not the worst acting in a Batman movie (see Batman & Robin), it is not the most well performed film either. Though this is the predecessor to the best superhero movie of all time, The Dark Knight, I strongly suggest that any interested viewer see this film first, as each of Nolan's trilogy plays off of the other films. Just make sure that you keep in mind that this isn't really as family-oriented as the Marvel movies (Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.). This is the grownup's turn to appreciate the Caped Crusader.",

235,29 July 2008,stiva,10, The best Batman ever created.... A classic...,"Finally. FINALLY!!!! I love the Batman cartoons; Justice League, and even Batman Beyond. But I tire of cartoons, and they lack visual impact. I didn't like any of Burton's versions. I never bought Keaton as the dashing billionaire playboy smart enough to pull off a double-life. I liked Val Kilmer, but thought the vehicle itself wasn't good; too campy, too over the top. But this... it simply doesn't get better. Great storyline that defines not only the character of Batman, but also of Alfred (who supports and assists Bruce in these somewhat unusual endeavors), Gordon, Lucius Fox and even the city itself and the Batcave. The history created in this story, and the characters that populate it are 100% credible. It was so real; so believable. Christian Bales was perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman - not necessarily the most dashing of playboys, but obviously even that played into the aspect of Bruce Wayne trying to define himself and this life. Bruce Wayne was smart -really smart - and thoughtfully developed so that the audience could understand the method behind Batman's madness. Finally, The Dark Knight wasn't just a man with a grudge - or a man on a mission. He was a man with a vision who wanted to not only wanted to avenge his parents, but wanted to make criminals afraid of being criminals. And through it all, his own code defines his actions, and determines which boundaries he will and will not cross.",

Now remember this is just my opinion. First of all I don't think the acting in this film is good. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, but Goofy as Batman. Mainly because of that infamous growlish voice. Liam Neeson does good as Ra's Al Ghul. Needless to say I don't really like Ra's Al Ghul, but Liam Neeson does good as him. Scarecrows is the coolest of the two villains, but it's a shame that there's not much focus on him. Michael Kane is also great as Alfread. He's better than Michael Gough. Morgan Freeman also does a good job, but I need to ask one question. Is he in the comics? I just always wondered that. Now lets talk about what is easily the worst part of the movie and that is the action sequences. They are the worst of all time. The camera angles are annoying half of the time, I could not see what was going on. Also I really dislike the scene where Comisioner Gordon drives the Bat-Mobile. It always seemed Dumb. The story to this movie strikes me as not to interesting. When his parents a killed, millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne relocates to Asia when he is mentored by Henri Ducard and Ra's Al Ghul in how to fight evil. When learning about the plan to wipe out evil in Gotham City by Ducard, Bruce prevents this plan from getting any further and heads back to his home. Back in his original surroundings, Bruce adapts the image of a bat to strike fear into the criminals and the corrupt as the icon known as 'Batman'. But it doesn't stay quiet for long.

His acting performance in the movie is just outstanding, therefore my high rating. The movie itself, plot, dialogs and so on, its nothing out of the ordinary, but then you start to think about those 90's Batman movies. This just seem more realistic, more ""Bruce"" than ""Batman"" and with the perfect acting from Bale, it makes all other Batman movies look really dull and daft.

242,28 August 2005,denharmailenarunik,9, Batman Begins,"I can honestly say that I am one of the biggest Batman fans around. I've been a fan my whole life. I've read the graphic novels, own collectibles, toys, etc. I am a fan-boy. Plain and simple. I could not wait for this movie to come out. 8 years since, ""Batman and Robin"" a.k.a ""A Death in The Family"" 2 years since it was announced and the anticipation was killing me. This move was just everything I could of hoped for. I saw it last night and It just hasn't hit me. I think one of the reasons a lot of people are Batman fans is he is a character we can in someway relate to. He's human, he makes mistakes, he has fears and secrets and goals. The way he is portrayed on screen has all of those items and then some. Christian Bale's performance is quite simply amazing. He gets great material to work with and he covers the 3 sides to Bruce Wayne with great transition and believability that it makes him the best on screen Bruce/Batman yet. He's read the graphic novels and the man just gets it. What also helps make this movie more believable is the seriousness of the incredible actors he is surrounded by who don't get full of themselves. Freeman, Caine, Oldman, Neeson, Hauer, Murphy and Watanabe all believe in this movie. Freeman is as always, awesome in his role as Lucius Fox explaining all of the gadgetry and sharing stories with Bruce. The gadgets are also explained really well. No-more wondering what magazine order form he filled out for his grappling hook and other items. Caine and Oldman give performances that are worthy of many fan-boys praise. They take there characters and run with them and it is exactly how it is represented in the comics. Holmes did a decent job in her role and is there not for eye candy, but to show us a little more into Bruce's head and how he deals with feelings. Neeson plays against the grain in his role as Ducard and does some good stuff with an almost unrecognized character from the comics. Hauer, Watanabe, and Murphy have minimal but important roles and really do a good job with what's given to them and have fun while playing it serious. Nolan also needs to be commended for going all in on something he believed in from the get go. He had his image of a Batman movie in his head and took it to Warner Brothers and they backed him up 110%. Taking examples from the different graphic novels and combining them to basically create a city all his own. He also brought out the best in each actor you see on screen. Goyer wrote a great script. He knew what the fans wanted and as a fan-boy himself, he delivered. The fight scenes were tight and well done and the style brutal. The fact they didn't use a lot of CGI made me enjoy it more because it added to the realism that is nowadays missing from movies that are loaded with CGI effects. The sound is simply out of this world. The sound of The Batmobile when it is first shown is something I cannot explain unless you hear it yourself. The editing and cinematography is excellent because it incorporates new techniques with old ones. This movie still has me thinking and I like that. I like going to movies and leaving just unable to think about anything else except what just happened on the screen and where it is going to go. The inevitable sequels have big shoes to fill. The end will leave you drooling over the possibilities of what's to come. This is one of if not the best superhero movie ever put on film.",
243,16 June 2005,GothamGuy9,10, Batman truly does Begin....and hopefully will continue....,"I came into this movie with high expectations, but was increasingly disappointed by the end. There was no one aspect that really annoyed me, but rather a lot of smallish things that seemed to taint the experience. Firstly, I thought that Bale was a wise choice for Batman, although I've never really understood what Bruce Wayne has got to do with a bat, but that's not something you could pin on this movie. Well not completely anyway as they attempt to sort of explain it away with the whole fear symbol thing, and the well at the start - still nuts if you ask me... Anyway, that's not important, what is important is the confusion that engulfs our view of Bale throughout the movie. Some of the worst points being: His relationship with his parents - this is not presented very well, with his memories of his father more likely to furrow the brow than produce tears. Bale's motivations - they are not easily understood - why go see Wilkinson's mob boss after he kills the guy who killed his parents. This seems to be a random or arbitrary way to send him off on his quest. Also, what's the deal with his turning on Neeson and his cronies in such a big way on the spur of the moment? One minute he's learning from them - the next he almost kills them all. A tad abrupt perhaps? And speaking of Neeson and his League of Shadows, or whatever, I'll put it simply - their whole plot is ludicrous. How do a bunch of guys living on a mountain succeed in creating a depression in the biggest city in the world, and why do they think it better that a whole city should tear itself apart instead of live with a high level of crime. Surely they could wield the (unlikely) power they seem to have to improve the situation in Gotham? This leads me to the bad guys as a whole. Being from Ireland I was delighted to hear that the two main villains of the film were from here, but on viewing the film I was a bit let down by the way they were used. Neeson and Murphy are both excellent actors and could have been perfect as complicated modern bad guys, but I think they were let down by the script and direction. I was expecting something brilliant from the scarecrow character when he was shown initially, but it all went downhill after his introduction. All he gets to do is spray Batman with his fear thingy and then capitulate in a random sort of way as the plot comes to an end. Why does he turn into a wet blanket when Batman traces him to the asylum and what the hell is with the scene where he gets tazered while sitting on a horse! Neeson starts out very well as a mentor for Bale, but as soon as he comes back to initiate his insane plan he does not make the same impression. His last scene is also rubbish, bearing more of a resemblance to Speed 2 than a great villain death. Also can anyone tell me why a monorail has so much screen time in the film, I know his dad built it, but it's not that interesting... Possibly my biggest complaint about the film is the style with which they shot the action/fight scenes. It's funny that a much lesser known (and also quite silly) film, that also stars Christian Bale, has endlessly better action scenes. If the fight scenes of Batman Begins were more like those in Equilibrium then maybe I would have left the cinema feeling a whole lot more satisfied. As it is they feel like you are watching a brawl in fast-forward, through the bars of a cage. This must surely have annoyed a few people? Altogether, I got the feeling that a large part of the movie was a victim of committee-thinking. Scenes seemed to pop up out of nowhere as if a spare director had been allowed in on one day of the week. Examples of this were the scene where Katie Holmes' co-worker finds the thingummy in the crate - and is then killed. This had me wishing that they served headache tablets with the popcorn, and was made worse by Holmes' brief mention of it again - to explain why she was so crabby at that time - I mean what the hell!!! Anyway, it wasn't all bad, Freeman was fine as the Batmechanic and Michael Caine produced the only real comic moments of the Movie. I didn't think much of Katie Holmes' performance though, she had no central motivation or character trait and suffered from the wishy-washy style of a lot of the movie. Wilkinson and Oldman were also fine. To finish up I would ask those of you who gave this movie a ten: How can you give ten to a movie that has such a crappy, abrupt and ineffectual revelation scene where Bail reveals to Holmes that he is Batman, and how can you give ten to a movie in which Batman's voice sounds like a 12 year old kid playing in his plastic suit?

Christian bale is the perfect batman,In fact everyone was perfect in their roles!!! In my opinion its better than Burton's batman. I also liked how Nolan made Gotham dark like Burtons Gotham unlike Schumacher who made Gotham all cartoon like.

Its nice to see how he is becoming Batman, and acquires all the weapons the instruments and the bat suit. The bat mobile is quite impressive!! it is not a car, is a tank.....amazing. One of the other thing that really stand out are the characters. All of it has a very well defined paper, and the performance is spectacular. Michael Caine doing Alfred is really good. Christian Bale rolling Bruce Wayne is really good too, but what is most spectacular is that he gives Batman back that darkness he has lost in the last two horrible movies, Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.

Just look at certain interviews about how he portrays the character Bruce Wayne. It's almost as if Christian Bale does research and takes notes on Batman before he starts acting the part out. He makes all the right moves because he surrounds himself with a great group of actors. We can all relate to Bruce Wayne's character in some way and this is where we can thank Bale.

It is a detailed telling of Bruce Wayne's fear of bats and the death of his parents. Story opens with his release from prison and the training he undergoes to preserve justice. Central plot regards a toxic substance released in the water supply in the city of Gotham City. Assuming the identity of Batman he captures a mob boss and discovers that an even greater foe by the name of Scarecrow is behind the madness. Easily the best screenplay in the series thanks to Christopher Nolan as director. He previously made Memento and Insomnia but this ranks among his greatest work. Christian Bale is fantastic as the caped crusader who struggles with revenge and justice. Fine supporting work by Katie Holmes as an attorney whom he knew since childhood. What is interesting is that she is instrumental in defeating one of the major villains. Cillian Murphy plays the Scarecrow, an effective terror of nightmares and brainwash. Liam Neeson delivers a knock out performance in perhaps the most surprising role of the film because he is not as typecast as it may seem. Gary Oldman plays Commissioner Gordon who ends up in an alliance with Batman. Excellent film about facing fear and becoming one with it. Score: 10 / 10",

Never really cared of Batman, like I do with Superman, and I'm a die hard Spider-Man fan. This film was AWESOME!! After I saw it for a fourth time, I went out and bought the game. Great acting. Christian Bale makes a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. No. He's the BEST Batman I've ever seen!! George Clooney, and those other losers who have played the Dark Knight were all just really lame and bad actors. The rest of the cast for this film was great. Great special effects. The Batmobile is totally sick!! It has never looked SO COOL!! The story line was easy to follow. Scarecrow kind of gave me chills, although Cillian Murphy did an excellent job as Dr. Crane/Scarecrow. He stands proudly next to Christopher Reeve's Superman villain, Lex Luthor (played by Gene Hackman.) And, Spider-Man villain, Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe. Great movie overall. I've got no complaints. Although, I've never thought that Superman and Batman made a good team. I actually think it's quite stupid having them as ""World's Finest."" Now, Superman and Spider-Man? That's truly ""The World's Finest!"" See this movie, but, I strongly suggest, I STRONGLY Suggest, that you skip Superman Returns! That movie was an absolute failure in every way!

He returns to Gotham City in time to see it being overwhelmed by crime and corruption, which is when he found his calling. Unlike the previous Batman films of the late 1980s to 1990s, this film elaborates on important elements like Bruce's first encounter with bats, the discovery of the cave (Batcave) under his mansion and the creation of the Batmobile and Batsuit.",
264,25 June 2007,OllieSuave-007,9, Great Beginning for Batman.,"I watched ""Batman: The Animated Series"" during my childhood. And that was the closest thing to a legit Batman at that time besides the comic books. Didn't like Tim Burton's version of Batman all that much, maybe adults at that time enjoyed it more than kids. I thought ""Batman Forever"" was a cool movie when it first came out in theaters but watching it now, the movie is crap. And I don't even want to get started on ""Batman and Robin"". What this is, is a fresh reboot to the Batman franchise and is the first live action movie that shows the roots to how Bruce Wayne became Batman. At least of what I know of. When I first saw the trailer I had high expectations for it, and Christopher Nolan really delivered. This movie met my expectations and was very entertaining to watch how the road of the Dark Knight or the world's greatest detective. There isn't much detective aspect to this one, but it shows how batman utilizes stealth like a modern day ninja. Christian Bale is so far the best Bruce Wayne so far although Michael Keaton can arguably be the best Batman. Anyways Bale was perfect for a role of a tortured soul fighting for justice. Bale is a serious actor and Bruce Wayne/Batman is a very serious and dark character for the most part. I also like how Bruce acts like a billionaire playboy, well he is a billionaire but act like something he is not. In order to throw off suspicion that he is Batman. Unlike in ""TAS"" where Bruce was also a boyscout outside of the the batsuit. Liam Neeson plays the mentor or master character really well, not only he plays badass character but he brings a sense of charisma. You can't help but buy into his character in a lot of his movie and this applies here. Although he is the one that trained Bruce Wayne they have different views on justice and justice does collide. Cillian Murphy gives wits to his character in this as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow and give off this sense of ambition and maliciousness. Also a bit of creepiness to go with it. Even though he is just a side villain in this he does make his character at least memorable. Carmine Falcone is a despicable mob boss that basically owns Gotham and is played by Tom Wilkinson. The dialogue and the presence that is given by Tom Wilinson makes it not so far-fetched why Carmine Falcone owns Gotham. The guys has some street smarts at least when it comes to running the underworld. Katie Holmes was just okay, anyone could have played her role and she doesn't really stand out. Even though her character plays a prominent role in this and the sequel. It would have been cool if the lawyer she becomes friends with in this turns out to be Harvey Dent so it can be more coherent with the sequel. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox brings intelligence but also seems like a character you can trust, which is a very important element despite Freeman also having one of the best movie voices. Lastly Commissioner Gordon and Gary Oldman is perfect for this role. While the past Batman movies this character was just wasted but he at least has a role in this. And it feels like the beginning of a friendship between two men fighting crime. Same with the bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred in this, Alfred actually has some good lines this time around. Christopher Nolan decided to go in a realistic superhero direction and it really works in this. It looks like with the right training and billions of dollars you can be Batman. This movie does a excellent job of using flashbacks, even though it's used a lot in this. It just isn't distracting, props to the editing department. Although it can take up to 50 min to find out exactly what scene happened when and where in the story. The build up is so very intriguing and entertaining. The story blends right into a Batman origin story and the action although there may seem to have a bit too much cuts and out of focus sometimes and not sure of what is exactly going on. The utilizing of stealth from Batman makes it cool. But still if it was less choppy it would have been better, this ain't a comic book strip. However this movie shows that Nolan really did his research or a fan of Batman. It's awesome when a director knows what to do with a superhero based on comic books. If you like superhero movies or action movies with a great build up this one is definitely worth seeing. This is Bruce Wayne's journey of building up his symbol at it's finest.",
265,18 July 2012,KineticSeoul,8, The legendary superhero movie trilogy begins...,"In my opinion the very fact that this film was a batman film is the element that weakened it. It seem to work so much better when it was character building, in the first 40 minutes. I found as soon as our hero put on the black cape the film didn't work, it lost its attention to detail, sloppily slipping in and out of sentiment. I think Christian Bale is a great performer, his performance in American Psyco and his butt kicking gun carter from the cult hit Equilibrium, have proved his presence. His performance as Bruce Wayne is deep and rooted, but as soon as he plays batman, it becomes a rather cheesy affair. The same can be said for Cillian Murphy, who is suitably sinister as a corrupted Phycologist, but his character nose dives with the cheesy lines of the Scarcrow character. I have to say this now that Katie Holmes is a promising performer yet her performance is rather poor here, not terrible though. Another problem with this film is the music, not denying the prowess of such grand performers as Hans Zimmer(Gladiator) and James Newton Howard (The sixth sense). Unforortunately these two creative forces collide like two power sources canceling each other out. The composers music worked much better when it was separated. Howards sweeping emotional score, with Zimmers synthesized epic quality. Yet personally i would have just gone with Howard, for a strong emotion suspense score. forget Zimmer as he didn't suit this film. Yet not all is lost, this is a great film, and its nice to see major studio's such as Warner issuing such, investment and creative control to a too often ridged and commercial industry. Christopher Noland, director of the masterful 'Momento' brings this film a dark edge. This film isn't perfect, but its miles ahead of most of the crap American studio's are pumping out these days. i can only hope that this is the start of an assent ion from this slump wave been having with originality and quality. 14/11/07: after viewing the film again it's clear this film is a bit of a mildstone. looking forward to the dark knight.",

A version that is more superior to Tim Burton's version and definitely more superior to Joel Schumacher's version one of the things that stands out in this movie for me is when Christian bale is in the bat suit he becomes a different person his voice the way how he moves it all changes and after the ending how could i not be excited Gordon unveiling the bat light to the bat and then giving him the calling card of another criminal which happens to be a jokers card.

273,20 February 2022,gabriellikeaboss,9, An excellent and well-deserved film for the beloved Batman.,"Batman Begins is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast. Before this movie, fans started losing faith in Batman, after the disastrous Batman Forever with Val Kilmer, followed by another major disappointment, Batman & Robin, but Christopher Nolan saved this franchise, he made the universe much darker and more realistic, the villains are genuinely terrifying, even more so because they could actually be real, unlike villains such as Mr. Freeze or Poison Ivy. My only problem with this movie is that it struggles to find it's main villain, it focuses on Ra's Al Ghul at the beginning, then moves to the Scarecrow for a while, and then towards the end there's a lot of back and forth moving from one character to another, they are both great but I felt like the Scarecrow probably should have had less screen time as his story simply wasn't as important. It's makes a great decision by focusing on Batman and diving deep in to his origins, I didn't like how the Tim Burton films focused on the villains origins and barely showed how Bruce Wayne became the caped crusader, this film focuses on it immensely and that's really what we want to see. The start of a terrific trilogy that only improves, Batman Begins is a terrific movie that I would recommend to all fans of the franchise and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. ",

It was not good as Batman (1989) It was not as good as Batman returns. It was not as good Batman forever. It was not as good as Batman and Robin. But is was still a very good movie.

277,21 June 2014,jacobjohntaylor1,9, A good movie,Batman Begins (2005)-,
278,22 January 2022,adamjohns-42575,9, Even Mother stayed awake through it.,"Without rehashing the many good reviews posted about this film, I'll just comment on how it was perceived by an aging baby boomer who, like many, grew up reading Batman comics (among others) during the late 1950s and early 1960s. While they were termed 'comic books', many kids took the character seriously. His portrayal in those early comics was done in a serious manner, with barely a hint of humor. That was the indelible image I maintained about the character thereafter. I recall how disappointed, indeed angry, over how Batman was portrayed in the (to me) idiotic television series of the 60s. I was livid that he had been turned into a buffoon. Wild horses couldn't get me to watch that wretched program, even to this day. When Tim Burton's first film version was announced, I was excited. I had enjoyed Burton's other films, and expected great things. I was, once again, disappointed. In spite of the big budget, great costumes and nifty special effects, it just didn't deliver what I had hoped it would. I didn't care for the garish color, the 'villians' were a joke and frankly, Michael Keaton was a curious choice for the role. Subsequent films in that series were even worse (I presume, since I stopped watching them after the second Burton film). Batman Begins, however, hit the mark! Christian Bale was a superb Batman, the development of Bruce Wayne/Batman was thorough and logical (for a comic character, anyway), the sets impressive and the action exhilarating. As others note, finally it was done correctly. I found this version to be as definitive as one could get, and feel that off all the efforts to bring comic book characters to the screen, this was the most successful. Granted, some others have faired well, such as the first two Superman films with Christopher Reeve and the two X-Men movies. Even Spiderman was reasonably good, although the special effects drug the first one down a bit. To those Batman fans that, like me, have waited decades to see the character done as he should be, this is the one. A couple of minor criticisms would be the casting of Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. While he did a good job in '28 Days Later', he seemed too juvenile to be believed as a psychiatrist. And, while Katie Holmes was okay in the role, I had a hard time looking at her without thinking of she and Tom Cruise and all of the Scientology controversy, since I did not see the film upon it's release, but on DVD later. Which brings up the final point: those who intend to purchase this film on DVD would be advised to seek out the widescreen DTS surround version. It provides much better surround separation (as DTS generally does) compared to the Dolby Digital version, and the full-frame edition leaves out too much picture information, which negatively affects the enjoyment. A truly excellent film, with a sequel now in production (which will apparently feature The Joker, based upon this film's ending). Highly recommended.",

282,23 September 2022,gianmarcoronconi,8, Nice,"'Batman Begins"" at last penetrates to the dark and troubled depths of the Batman legend, creating a superhero who, if not plausible, is at least persuasive as a man driven to dress like a bat and become a vigilante. Batman Begins kicked off Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, which has gone on to become an integral part of the world's conception of not only Batman but also superhero movies in general. Christopher Nolan's First Batman film really shows that very smart and unique directors like Nolan can make a superhero trilogy and its watched over and over, and everyone loves. When Wayne refuses to kill someone as a membership requirement, Ducard becomes his enemy; the reclusive millionaire returns to Gotham City determined to fight evil, without realizing quite how much trouble he is in. Gotham crime details and the counsel of the faithful servant Alfred (Michael Caine) delay the actual appearance of Batman until the second act of the movie. Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), apparently Gotham City's only honest cop, are faced with a local crime syndicate led by Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). The movie has been directed by Christopher Nolan, still only 35, whose ""Memento"" (2000) took Sundance by storm and was followed by ""Insomnia"" (2002), a police procedural with Al Pacino. What Warner Bros. Saw in those pictures that inspired them to think of Nolan is hard to say, but the studio guessed correctly, and after an eight-year hiatus, the Batman franchise has finally found its way. The movie works dramatically in addition to being an entertainment. There's something to it. Nolan casted the characters very well, and Christian Bale was the right way to go to play Batman, and in my opinion, he's the best Batman yet.",
283,2 March 2022,GusherPop,10, Comic book to the Big Screen,"In the hands of some directors (Brian Singer, I am looking at you) a ""realistic"" approach to a comic book property means draining it of all fantasy and joy and grounding it in a mundane, gloomy realm of blunt topical references. Thankfully Chris Nolan does not take this approach. There is plenty of fantasy and awe-inspiring spectacle in Batman Begins, but all of it is well-motivated and well-explained. We've got ninjas, flying heroes, super-fast tanks, and Bond-villain-esquire weapons of mass destruction, but all of them feel an organic part of the heightened universe masterfully created in this film. We've seen big vistas before in Batman movies, but they always had a back drop feel to them and the action of the films was relatively confined. Here, a Gotham truly epic in scope is painstakingly created and explored. This city only exists in miniature and on computer but it feels like somewhere we can genuinely go. These are all high points of the storytelling itself. The movie would still fall flat if it weren't support by a near-endless string of knock-out performance. Christian Bale's Bruce is stoic, introverted and tormented, but Bale still manages to keep us engaged and interested even as he's holding it all in. Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred, warm, drily witted and endlessly loyal. Gary Oldman plays against type as a likable and to all appearances fairly normal cop and Morgan Freeman imbues what little time he has with pure charisma and charm. Liam Neeson also plays against type, showing a cruelty one wouldn't expect out of one of the screen's most charming actors. The real surprise is Cilian Murphy who, though cast in a supporting role as a fairly minor villain in the film's considerable rogues gallery, manages to leave a deep impression upon the viewer. He is thoroughly creepy and disturbing, even without a particularly impressive costume. Batman Begins also succeeds in delivering those comic book essentials, action and intrigue, in consistent amounts, rather than falling to that bane of franchise beginning films, the endless setup. True this is an origin story, but Batman's origin is so riveting that we hardly miss the Bat until his appearance halfway through the film. And even then, there are at least three major action sequences and plenty of stunts to go. Though you can't complain about the level of action, some argue that the frenetic, murky style in which the action is presented is rather off-putting. On the contrary, the flash frame editing serves to punch up the impact of the fights and even if the viewer is sometimes lost in the melee, he never loses the sense of brutality that Batman brings to his battles. We are left as bruised and battered as the numerous foes of whom Batman makes short work. All in all, a fantastic effort, both as a franchise beginner and a stand-alone epic.",
284,3 May 2008,timbasa77,9," At Last, Batman Soars Again","I hate to say it, especially in light of the raves, but Batman Begins is a bore. This thing needed a few more rewrites (or at least one by a good writer) before it was set to film. The basic story is very well thought out, the origin of all Batman and all his iconic and psychological paraphernalia, but the dialog is horrible and the visuals lack style. Now I know that director Nolan was trying to set Batman in the ""real"" world, but does the real world have to look so dull? More importantly, do the people have to all talk like zombified, robotic idiots? Even the fatass morons down I see buying candy bars with food stamps at the Safeway utter more colorful dialog than is offered in this movie. There is a complete lack of any wit, spontaneity, or intelligence in the dialog. The conversational dialog is stiff and--oddly enough for a film striving for realism-- archly cartoonish. And there are more lame, unfunny scene-ending bon mots in this thing than a 1980s Roger Moore James Bond movie. Oh, it's just freakin painful! If they couldn't hire someone who could write decent dialog they should have at least hired a director who knew when to CUT out bad dialog; this would have been much better as a silent film. And on top of that, the thick rubber bat costume STILL looks stupid. It is really jarring to have all this drab, ""realistic"" set design with a guy in a fake-looking, goofy rubber suit running around in it. This thing makes thin Christian look like a black chipmunk with its ears clipped. ",
285,16 June 2005,curtis-8,4," Dull, except for the horrifically bad dialog","Batman certainly has always been the most famous and important character of DC Comics universe. Previously, the film portrayed the character with two distinct approaches with Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. With the monumental failure of Batman & Robin, the damage done in the image of the Dark Knight was so great that other adaptations have been set aside for eight years. It was then that she was the revolutionary and brilliant Christopher Nolan, the director of the excellent Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002), stunned the world with his vision. The Warner Bros. wanted to revive the story of the hero. After trying to contact some directors, Christopher Nolan himself presented his vision of the character. The British director has always been a fan of the character, but was not an expert on comic books. So even called a fan of the character to help him to write, David S. Goyer. ",

I remember this came out my senior year of high school and it blew everyone away. The Dark Knight trilogy broke ground in the comic world and attracted a ton of acting talent, had amazing stunts and interesting technology. It combined various Batman comics. It made social commentary and made you think without being political. The only thing I didn't like was the growling voice Bale did while in the suit that got old sometimes but the villains were always scary, realistic and well acted.

289,20 March 2022,julieicoburn,10, I loved all of Christopher Nolan's Batman films,"This 140-minute film we have here is the first from writer and director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and if he wasn't considered a top-notch director before already, then this film lifted him up into the elite where he still is today with everybody talking about Dunkirk. But we talked about that one on another occasion already and now lets take a look at the only film from the trilogy that is missing the ""Dark Knight"" in the title. The lead actor in this over 10-year-old film is of course Christian Bale still before his Oscar win and it's not about great acting from him here as it is all about the story. But still for example the likes of Neeson and Caine managed awards-worthy performances. It was a pretty good idea to have Wayne's mentor and trainer become his worst enemy at the very end and it also fits really well with Nolan's dark 0% comedy approach to Gotham City, very different from Burton or West or everybody else. It's almost a catastrophe movie, well with what is happening to Gotham it is and the tone fits in well, also with Bruce's emotional state. I personally could have done without the Scarecrow story as he felt rushed in, but he is also not a character to be a main antagonist for an entire film really, at least not with Murphy playing the character or Scarecrow's looks. Tough challenge. Maybe make the mafia boss or Hauer's character more influential instead with the time gained. Or just make it a 110-minute film.",

I hesitated for years to buy the DVD because my wife doesn't like science fiction movies. Here I was wrong. It explains step by step with flashbacks the development of this very interesting character. The story is not complicated and very intelligent. Finally it came out rather real than fictive except the bat car or the supernatural forces from Batman. The script has great substance to transmit to the audience. It shows that we all are living in a corrupted and intriguing world. Here I saw many dark situations mixed with some good jokes. I had to laugh a lot with my wife and even my ten year old enjoyed it very much. The sceneries were all well built up. The special effects were well executed too. Christian Bale and all the other actors delivered also great performances. The absolute master of this great work is director Christopher Nolan. Congratulations for this masterpiece.

292,27 October 2012,Luigi Di Pilla,9, The best Batman so far,"I saw Batman Begins on opening day and let me say WOW. I was very impressed at the way this movie was put together. First I would like to give props to director Christopher Nolan (Memento) for creating such a more believable Batman then its predecessors (B, BR, BF, B&R). I like how the first half of the movie focuses on the character of Bruce Wayne and not Batman. This allows viewers to get a more detailed description of why he became Batman and his reason for choosing a Bat as his persona. The Cast was well assembled having the likes of Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne), Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes), and Cillian Murphey (The Scarecrow). But what made this movie work were the more older veteran actors such as Morgan Freeman who plays the helpful Lucius Fox, Rutger Hauer as power hungry Earle, Liam Neeson as the mysterious Henri Ducard/Ra's Al ghul , Gary Oldman as the honest Jim Gorden, and Michael Caine as the insightful Alfred. These characters are the ones the made the story move. I recommend everyone to see this movie. There are many plot twists that only Christopher Nolan can conjure so go see it 4/4 ****/****",

He was not nearly as comic book as he could have been. No, in this movie he was genuinely creepy and seemed like a freak. Batman's relationship with Ras Al Ghul is also played up very well.

What makes this movie so great is how it takes its material so seriously. There is also a main theme that ties the movie together: Fear. It's relentless in its quest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public persona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of the movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a movie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier for the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic experience, and it shouldn't be missed. One of the year's best films, and quite possibly the best comic book-hero-movie of all time. ",
307,17 August 2005,aaoppe,10, A big cinematic experience,"When Tim Burton conquered the cape crusader with a darker approach to suit the atmosphere of the comics, it marked a definite start for the popularity of the comic book hero. But when Joel Schumacher took over the franchise marked the decline of Batman's reputation in the celluloid. Visionary director Christopher Nolan however, strikes the screen with an all-new examination of the cape crusader with a much darker and brooding approach in attempt to strike at the heart of the comics. Tackling on the origin story which follows the genesis of Bruce Wayne's venture into becoming the caped hero, Nolan and writer David S. Goyer grants the film with a portrayal of Batman that breathes new life into the hero's reputation in the Hollywood realm. And the new man stepping aboard the title role is Christian Bale who follows the footsteps of Michael Keaton to capture the brooding essence of the lead character with soul-crushing charisma. This film follows Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale), a man haunted by the murder of his parents at the hands of Carmine Falcone (played by Tom Wilkinson). Relocating from his mansion in Gotham watched over by his old guardian Alfred (played by Michael Caine), Bruce trains with the League of Shadows lead by his mentor Ducard (played by Liam Neeson) and Ra's Al Ghal (played by Ken Watanabe) to seek revenge against the slaying of his parents. When things get terrifying, Bruce relocates back to Gotham to support Wayne Industries, a company previously run by father. When he learns of sinister plan to wipe out Gotham with a toxic gas, Bruce adopts the identity of the hero known as Batman and must fight face-to-face against Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a.

Not prone to repetitive, flashy, gimmicky directorial style (see Darren Aronofsky, not dependent on pop culture references in the dialog to keep it ""hip"" (see Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith), and he's not prone to the same IL' tricks every time he tells a story, like telling the plot out of sequence (see Aronofsky, Tarantino & Smith). He did that twice (Following and Momento), he moved on. He's a storyteller with class, creativity, and diversity. Now, onto Batman Begins. Wow. What a visceral powerhouse. Loved it. I thought Revenge of the Sith was good, but this is very good. Nolan actually makes the concept of a ""Batman"" seem remotely plausible. The performances are solid across the board, even if the dialog veers into the realm of the hokey at times. Caine is stellar. Freeman is great as usual.

While I did avoid this film during its theatrical run due to the presence of Christopher Nolan at the helm, I have to say the man has gone some way to redeem himself here. While Batman Begins is still a vague second to Tim Burton's directorial essays on the character, it does work as a great prequel. I just hope they have the good sense to pay the 1989 and 1992 films their proper respect, as I doubt that superhero films would be as polished as they are now without their contribution to history. As the original blockbuster, the original certainly still stands as one of the best. But this is all a moot point, for no film franchise can have a chance of success without a good film.

A parable of a materialistic world deliberately distorted as if it were the expression of a totally corrupt essence, where the absence of civility and compassion of abject beings obsessed with maximum profit at all costs rules. #BatmanBegins is just as dark as #TimBurton's masterful duology, but it is even tougher because it is inked in 'reality' and grabs the viewer's guts. The film starts with a detailed explanation of the origins of #TheDarkKnight. From the trauma of childhood up to a philosophical and martial training path - 'Buddhist': the renunciation, exploring one's dark side and mastering fear, the right views and actions, the path of the middle way, 'Nietzschean': what does not kill you makes you stronger, and 'Chivalrous': protecting the weak... - Ready to fight against injustice, Bruce Wayne returns to this decaying society. And #ChristianBale delivers an outstanding portrayal of #TheCapedCrusader! Who becomes a symbol fighting the evils that plague our society. Just like #RevengeOfTheSith"", #BatmanBegins is a blockbuster militating for a better world; several scenes are real gems: When the 'godfather' is surrounded by bribe-takers including law enforcers of all ranks. When Bruce Wayne is feigning intoxication and chastising the hypocrisy of the intelligentsia of the city. When the founding father of Wayne Enterprises has always rejected the IPO of the patrimony, but the corrupt new CEO allows himself to dismiss employees who honor the memory of Thomas Wayne. I highly recommend this masterpiece and I am already eagerly waiting for the next episodes.

317,2 July 2019,OMTR,9," ""Why do we fall? ... So that we can learn to pick ourselves up!""","Christopher Nolan is one of filmdom's newer directors who never seems to let us down. His Batman Begins is the first Batman film in eight years, and what a dandy it is. The film is a much harder edged characterization of Batman and Gotham City than we've seen previously. Christian Bale is perfectly cast as a more realistic Batman than Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and especially George Clooney. This film has noir-like elements and the cinematography was Oscar-nominated. The soundtrack was grand but not intrusive like some movies of this type. The supporting roles were all mostly well cast, especially the villains. Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Wilkenson actually help the film retain some of the comic book qualities associated with the character. Liam Neeson fits the current mold of a Hollywood nemesis with a mysterious past. While Micheal Caine and Gary Oldman disappear into their characters of Alfred and Gordon respectively, Morgan Freeman, as Luscious Fox, comes the closest to being a Hollywood distraction. However, Freeman is very enjoyable as always. Outside of the standard superhero moments and plot at the center of the film, we get to see how Batman came into being, how he came to be a superior fighter, and how he developed the many trademarks associated with him: Bat-cave, Bat-mobile, Bat outfit, and why the whole bat thing. Gone are the campy and over-the-top Batman elements from previous films. The film also marks a transition point from its comic realm with the lopping off of the Falcone character. The film stops short of exploring the public idolization of the character, but it does hint at it a couple times. The action of the plot resolution does echo too many other films though. Still, it's a superior and vastly entertaining action/comic book hero movie that delivers. Although like many other films, I think it definitely appears much too high on the IMDb's top 250 list. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",

Nolan makes both Burton and Schumacher look like Ed Wood — most impressive of all is that, while technology has improved tremendously since 1997's flop ""Batman & Robin"", ""Begins"" chooses to take little advantage of it. A-list actors are casted as supporting characters, with Michael Cane as Alfred, and a calm Gary Oldman (that's a first!) as Gordon; among others like Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes and Morgan Freeman. Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe and Colin McFarlane are also so wonderful in their minor roles. Cillian Murphy modestly appears as The Scarecrow, which one can say is a bit underused as a well-known villain, but it actually makes it all the more realistic.

For comic book fans who have read the earliest stories, this movie series should be heaven. Christopher Nolan is taking audiences back to how Batman was intended to be: a dark master detective who is HUMAN. His ""villains"" are crime bosses and mobster, just like in real life. But Batman must also face madmen like Scarecrow. The villains are more realistic (Nolan said you will never see the Penguin in his film series because it is too unbelievable and far feetched to be real). Begins is the beginning (which is refreshing given the slew of poor quality prequels that seem to be coming out lately). We learn how Bruce Wayne altered from poor little rich boy into the vigilante of justice. This film introduces the long standing comic villain of Ra's Al Ghul to film. And Nolan (mistakenly) creates a love interest for Batman/Bruce Wayne in Rachel (played poorly by Katie Holmes). The story and the action are truly inspired. And the direction this series is taking is from the original comic icon, not from the 4+ decades of camp and overacting. It's darker than Burton's, better than Schumacher's (but what isn't?), and true to the original. What more could fans ask for? Highly recommend.",
338,21 September 2008,Sasha_5,9, A return to the real Batman,"Teenagers have a tendency to be terribly self absorbed, boring people, and this is ably demonstrated not only by the teenage Bruce Wayne, but rather the whole movie too. The film centres around Bruce's boring attempt to overcome the pain of seeing his parents killed, his anger and so forth. Being a terribly wealthy kid he can indulge himself in becoming a criminal, and training to become a ninja of some sort so that he can fight crime. Very much like a teenager, he thinks his problems are worse than everyone else's, and his overly emotional response is the only way to deal with it. It's unutterable tosh of course, but to compound the sin, this pathetic self-absorbed garbage is hooked up to a pathetic, self-absorbed storyline. The ninja teacher guy (obviously) wants to destroy Gotham (obviously), and Batman has to save the day (obviously). There some monkeying about with a scientist, and then Batman is having a fight with the bad guy, who dies. Unfortunately, the whining little bat doesn't kop it too. Oh, and Tom Cruise's girl is in it too, but I guess you noticed that already.

Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight and is easily the best Batman there has been. Liam Neeson (Ducard) is excellent as the sensei/villain, and Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes) brings her ""girl next door"" charm as the love interest. Cillian Murphy is frightfully creepy as the Scarecrow/Dr Johnathan Crane. The Blu-ray version of this movie is definitely the way to go. Unsurpassed picture quality and superb audio make this the definitive version to own, it makes a great movie even better.",
340,12 September 2008,Shannon38,9, Thats bat-tastic!!!!,"""Batman Begins"" (2005), I've always been a huge fan of the superheroes in DC comics, especially Superman and Batman. So, when this movie was first announced, I was stoked to see it. However, I feel that I must confess something to you. I didn't really care for this film so much when I first saw it. Hey, I was 12 years old and pushing 13 at the time. Maybe because it was a bit too complex for my young brain? However, after it came out on DVD, I decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did. I paid much more attention, and I got more into the story. Then, from there, it just got better and better with every viewing! Now, I simply can't get enough of this movie, it gets better with age! ""Batman Begins"" has even found a spot on my top ten all-time favorite superhero films list! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, Bruce Wayne undergoes training from his mentor, then soon goes back to the corrupted Gotham City to eventually become his alter-ego, Batman. This was an interesting concept, we got to see Batman's origin story, which has never really been shown on the big screen. Another thing, they gave this storyline much more realism and grittiness, which really helps it to stand out. The two ""Batman"" films with Michael Keaton are dark and gritty, granted. Which is a good thing on their part and I like those two movies just fine. However, those two films lack what ""Batman Begins"" does, and that's character development, which is crucial for any movie. That being said, showing the origin story for Bruce Wayne/Batman gives us much more appreciation for the character which yields a stronger story. Along with great character development, ""Batman Begins"" has an exciting and intriguing plot that will keep you invested and excited all the way through. I won't go into any details about the story itself. But, I guarantee that it'll be a storyline you'll never forget. At 140 minutes, it goes by in the blink of an eye! On a final note, Batman's suit in this film is a big improvement over the one in the comic books. Now, hear me out on this, all right? Yes, the Batman suit with the spandex and it's symbol are iconic. But, the one used in this movie actually looks like a bat and makes the superhero name Batman more superficial within the context of the story. Plus, it's an awesome suit, and the symbol/logo is cool. The unique design really helps it to standout above the other Batman suits! Normally, I'm against when they change superhero suits to meet film standards. That being said, this is one of the rare times when they got it 100% right. As far as the acting goes, it's just as strong as the plot itself. The casting is some of the best I've seen in any superhero movie. The on-screen chemistry between the cast is nothing short of impeccable. A lot of actors have played the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, but Christian Bale is head and shoulders above the rest. To say the least, he was born to play this character! All of the other actors and actresses cast do a phenomenal job as well. Michael Caine is the best Alfred, Liam Neeson is brilliant as the villainous Ra's al Ghul, Gary Oldman is outstanding as James Gordon, Katie Holmes is great as Rachel Dawes, Morgan Freeman is exceptional as Lucius Fox, etc. The only nitpick I think I need to point out with the casting, is that maybe Katie Holmes was a bit too young looking for the role. Granted, she nailed her performance, but she looks like a teenager! Nothing wrong with that, but it can get kind of distracting at times. Overall, the whole entire cast do a sublime job with their respectable characters! All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film a stunning atmosphere. Gotham City for example, was filmed in multiple cities; London, New York and Chicago. Yet, with all those cities combined it all looked like one single location. At the end of the day, it stayed consistent and that's all that matters. As far as the special effects go, they are all perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is not surprising, being that this movie came out in 2005! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is exceptional and the film score sets the perfect tone for the movie. Hans Zimmer is one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers, and his work in ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy is some of his best. James Newton Howard does great with movie soundtracks as well, but Hans Zimmer is in a whole different league. ""Batman Begins"" is a phenomenal superhero movie. As far as superhero origin stories go, this film is one of the best in that category. On top of that, this movie is the first one to get Batman right. Prior ""Batman"" films have come close, but this one, along with the rest of the trilogy does Batman and all of the other characters in it justice, and then some! I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to say go check out this movie? I think that's pretty obvious with my review. I'm still surprised that I didn't really get into it the first time I saw it. But, when I saw it on DVD, I loved it. That being said, all films, good or bad, deserve a second chance. If you're a huge fan of Batman, or any of the DC comics, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. I promise that you'll love it. If you don't, then be on the look out for Batman!",

Christopher Nolan understands there's a reason he's called ""the Dark Knight""! Most of the other reviews have said pretty much all that needs saying, although from the negative ones I read through it seems to me they didn't really 'get' the character. Batman is like Mephisto from Faust, out of the shadows, come from Hell, to avenge the innocent, and settle accounts with the guilty ... that is what makes him so scary, and that is why this movie succeeds - he is a frightening thing, and until now, he's only ever been portrayed like a carnival attraction, with no real menace to him.

I only ask because this movie makes you feel as if you could actually go there, as if it actually exists somewhere. I liked Tim Burton's Batman, but Christopher Nolan's vision is so well paced and so real, that it is, in my humble opinion, the first REAL Batman movie. Christian Bale brings Batman to life with all of the emotion of a real person, I guess it takes a real actor to do so. The supporting cast is a group of actors with so much character that they could have had there own movies. Alfred is awesome.

Batman always seemed he could snap, and bale, an expert at psychological roles (american psycho, the machinist) actually looks like breaking down in parts of the film. but this film is not just about bale. Bow down to the king of creepy, Cillian Murphy. what a change from the scruffy git in 28 days later to the smirking and outright shocking scarecrow. the first time scarecrow appeared on screen the cinema sounds near threw me from my seat. personally, i can't wait to see him in red eye.then there is Micheal Caine, humorous, confident, great acting (as always) and for the first time relaxed.

Previous movies have only mentioned it, or had a short flashback about it. This one takes it's time and is as much of a Bruce Wayne movie as a Batman movie! It also shows how life is in Gotham before Batman, and what motivates Bruce to do what he does. Every aspect of the story gets it's fair share of time, and it never feels rushed or dragging. The cast is very good, which is expected since most are well established actors. Christian Bale is good as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. There are many memorable moments and scenes. If there is something, that is a bit off, it might be that action sequences are filmed maybe too closely so often it's not all that clear what's happening.. but this is quite a minor complaint. When Batman hangs thugs from rooftops and screams ""SWEAR TO ME!"" it's epic!

The action scenes are great, especially the first time Batman goes out on the town. It brought back memories of the old horror movies, when the characters get picked of one-by-one. The film does have humor, and most of it coming from Michael Cains' character. The twist at the end is golden.

It must be Nolan fans and studio plants. This movie was a train wreck from beginning to end from the casting mistakes to the nonsensical plot. As for being more true to the comic books, are the people who believe that on crack? This was a complete departure from not only the previous Batman films but certainly Bob Kane's original intention. There has to be at least a sprinkling of humor for Batman to work and make sense because a man dressing up as a bat does come across as humorous no matter how you cut it. The idea is Bruce Wayne has gone so far into a dark place in his mind that he does go crazy and a man running around as a bat is crazy and a little funny. This film tried to make the notion so serious that it was too serious to be taken literally. And as far as everybody complaining about how in the first Batman Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by The Joker, stop your whining. I laughed at the court room scene where the criminal who killed Bruce Wayne's parents is shot walking out of the court room by a...woman! Then Katie Holmes reaction saying, ""Bruce you don't need to see this."" to Christian Bale muttering, ""I have to see this"". It was beyond ridiculous.

Viewers see Gotham's corruption, Wayne's disillusionment, and the reasoning behind his decisions. Supporting characters establish genuine relationships with Wayne. Each one has purpose, perspective, and motivation. Even the villain has twisted logic. Plus, this is all tied together through themes of fear.

Keaton had it all but the build. Casting is everything in a movie, and obviously they went all out on this one. From Gary Oldman(on the side of the light, this time)and Micheal Caine (who works in any movie and usually makes them better than they were before) to Liam Neeson and even a small part by Ken Watanebe who shined in ""The Last Samurai"", the cast truly made the movie. (Even Katie). And apparently Katie makes much better choices in work than her boyfriend. The plot was simple, yet elegant. We all know the story of Batman, where he came from, why he does what he does, and his backdrop, Gotham, and the crime within the city. We are given reasons for the crime, another good performance by Linus Roache (Riddick)as Bruce's father, and some great performances by the villains, especially Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow. The plot is simple but seamless. There are beginnings and endings which flow smoothly. The action is great, the cinematography is excellent, with Gothom stark and dark at the same time.

That is until a ballsy director and writer came along, those people being Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, and FIXED Batman. Goyer, I had faith in. I'd just hoped he could retain the characters' personalities. Nolan, has MORE than proved he can deliver a dark and gritty Batman film without turning it into dark camp like Burton,or something so insane and flamboyant it would never happen, like Schumacher.

The word ""fear"" must be used at least 50 times in the first 30 minutes of the movie and I don't know how many times after that. Bale makes a very good Bruce Wayne, but when he is ""finally"" in the Batsuit he does sort of a whisper shout line delivery which is sometimes way over the top. Of course being in the Batsuit is about kicking Bad guy ass. In this department we get confused shortish fight scenes against bad guys who obviously have no chance. The cast is full of good actors all of them have their moments, though that's about all they are allowed. Katie Holmes is miscast and not especially good in a not too well written part.

Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW! BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!) as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth. A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon  apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity. The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero. Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham! ** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!

The way this film handles its central character is just perfect, Nolan creates a wounded and damaged character that is just amazing to watch. Wayne in this movie is not the perfect billionaire playboy that other films have presented him as he's got some major issues and makes some questionable choices in this films flashbacks. His training with The League of Shadows was done just right you got just home Important it was for him to pass them but understandable why he doesn't stay with them. Christian Bale was fantastic in this movie he captured all versions of the character that was require and to date remains the best iteration of the character. Katie Holmes was fine here she did that was required of her and was a good support for Bruce, while far from a great performance not razzie worthy. Liam Neeson was great as Ra's Al Ghul he's not in the film much but was really good when he was their and really felt like he was another version of Bruce and made some good points. Michael Caine is absolutely perfect casting for Alfred he hits just the right note between funny and fear and is never dull for a single second. Before this film the character of Commissioner Gordon had never been done much justice in film but Gary Oldman gave such a good performance in this movie and was a really likable presence. The action sequences in this film were really good they felt very realistic and gritty especially the final the sequence on this train that was a really intense and well done action set piece. The fear toxin was a really good plot device, you got his dangerous this was a why it needed to be stopped. I do have but one flaw with this film and it's the way in handle the villains. Scarecrow was good for the most part but he was far the easily defeated.

In some ways that works but in other ways it veers off into a Batman universe that makes no sense and becomes basically a movie that seems like he's attempting to have Batman seem more realistic to being like a person in our real universe. This is where Nolan fails. The magic and fun of Batman evaporates quickly. A man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime has a humorous element to it that Nolan completely ignores with this incarnation and everyone in this universe acts really dumb about it and their reactions to it make little sense especially Gordon's character. A lot of what Gordon does lacks logical sense and he never seems to really question the mental state of the person he first sees dressed as a bat. He's portrayed like some idiot willing to eventually put complete trust in someone he knows practically nothing about running around in a bat suit. His reasons for being so trusting are never clear. Does he know something everyone else doesn't? Bale's performance was pretty average but not as compelling as Keaton or Kilmer. He also tries to have a Batman voice that sounds ridiculous. The only reason for this film's critical success is that it struck a cord with the comic book fan die hards. It certainly didn't do that impressive box office numbers.

The origin story held your interest and not too much with the flailing of past /present like Superman 2013. The pacing of the film is spot on as I tend to see these comic adaptions outstay their welcome. A great watch. 7/10.",
405,8 June 2022,dieseldemon85,7, A great star to franchise reboot,"I would say I did like the movie in general, enjoyed it. What really impressed me thought, was actually the script. I though the script was really well written. Nolan keeps me interested and focused on the movie. Christian Bale was good, but he was too angry and cold, I believe he is a better actor than that. I absolutely loved Morgan Freeman, I think that man never fails.",

407,25 October 2005,Hoochie-Turner,10, At last a REAL Batman movie!,"Won't take too much time from this unbelievably enthusiastic crowd to state all the reasons I found this flic so slow and tedious, but have to state quickly that I found the 3 younger actors to be the most lame and wimpiest of any in the Batman series (even though I thought Val Kilmer was a total farce!). Luckily Katie Holmes got a big diamond from Tom Cruise this a.m. at the Eiffel Tower so her future may not be too dependent upon her acting ability. Christian Bale was definitely not believable as having class and polish in his role of a young millionaire. Also, does anyone else think Cillian Murphy would be a good one to cast in a young Bo Derek role? Just throw a long blonde wig on him and he could pass for what she looked like in the mid 80's. (OK, so he'd need a built-up bra and some longer legs!) Thank goodness for popcorn, Morgan Freeman, Ruttger Hauer and Gary Oldman...at least I didn't fall completely asleep.",

Big action films can have character, too!","It still doesn't beat Tim Burton's first film, but ""Batman Begins"" is better than the rest of the Batman movies to date. Christian Bale makes a terrific Bruce Wayne--he may be the best actor to have played him so far. And top-tier actors like Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, while maybe not greatly challenged by the material given them, still make the most of smaller roles.",
410,5 July 2005,evanston_dad,7, Second Best of the Series,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fans of the Dark Knight (like me) have been waiting anxiously for this project. Anticipation built when Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") was named director and suspense grew as many young bucks pursued the lead. ""American Psycho"" created many cries of ""WHO?"", but those in the know, were pleased and the anticipation grew. Slowly the supporting cast was put in place: Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, the great Rutger Hauer and even Michael Caine! Then began the year long wait.",
411,19 June 2005,ferguson-6,8, It's all very technical,"What else needs saying? Apart from a quick mention of the turgid idiots who work the projection booth at Cheltenham Odeon, and let the film run blurred on numerous occasions. So sorry, even that couldn't ruin what is quite frankly the finest comics movie ever, better even than Sin City, no need even to pause for thought about any of Marvel's efforts. Let's hope that Bryan Singer is prepared to bring it all to the table, because anything less than perfect will look like soggy crap. So there it is - great script, great acting, a great movie. Where do you start? Its not just the Batman movie that fans have waited there whole lives for, it's the Batman movie that Batman has waited his whole life for - from bad comics in the thirties, through Adam West, and Frank Miller, and (God help us all) Akiva Goldsman. This is it, Batman as Batman should be, Batman as we always hoped he'd one day be, Batman done right.",
412,16 June 2005,history_light,10," Thank you, Chris Nolan","This is possibly the best Batman yet, the only other that comes close is the original Batman directed, by Tim Burton. This Batman is different from all the others and delivers a terrific plot. It shows how Batman became Batman, and it really impressed me. The villains in the film are finally believable for once, but they still are interesting and creepy. I recommend seeing this Batman if you only see one Batman movie, this or the first Batman. I don't want to reveal anything about the movie so I'll quit here. The other Batman movies are: Batman, Batman Returns, Batman and Robin, Batman Forever, All of them are good except Batman and Robin, it pretty much sucks. In my opinion Batman Begins will blow you away.",
413,1 December 2006,GoldeneyeQuinn,10, One of the best Super-hero movies ever!,"No one could see what Batman was to me. It was a mess, a well million dollar mess, yet it still made money. I thought it would flop because Katie Holmes and Christian Bale weren't the best chemistry and Christian was no real Batman. Of course, Val Kilmer couldn't do a remake because he's too busy with his surreal life and all his material that he gets now for better movies. Well Val we have some news for you it wouldn't have made a difference cause the movie still would have sucked with you or without you. I may be critical of this too much but in my opinion going back to how it began is a typical directorial thing and everyone knew it maybe was going to flop. Even Conan O'Brien said Christian was super dramatic as the role so what was the point of seeing it? Their is no point just for some money that is all. So I thought it was awful.",
414,26 June 2005,Drew-Barrymore-Obsessed,1, Horrible.,This movie was absolutely dreadful. Christian Bale as Batman was just absolutely ridiculous not to mention Michael Caine with his accent. There were several points in the movie I burst out laughing at Bale's delivery of lines. It was like he practically growled as if to sound menacing. I think the public at large just has no idea what is an accurate portrayal of Bob Kane's comic character. To me the closest I think was the original 1989 Batman movie. The absurdity of Batman Begins was how serious it was trying to be which made you laugh at it rather than with it. The Scarecrow was the most disappointing villain of any of the previous Batman films. He was completely boring and just downright stupid. This film was such a complete insult to the fans who have stuck with the movie series through the good sequels and the bad. Unfortunately a new generation of children think this is cooler than a Batman that makes much more sense and has an element of fun to it. Tedious and bland is the only way to describe this new reinvention of the Dark Knight. Next!,

Now, before you start hurling your baterangs at me for saying that let me explain. As we all know, Joel Schumachers disastrous run on the Batman franchise nearly annihilated any possibilities of future Batman films making it to the silver screen. His films where campy, cartoonish and didn't take themselves seriously. Dumb story lines, too many characters, bat nipples, reverse photography, neon colors, you name it Schumacher did it. And with one final blow know as Batman & Robin the series ended its ones fruitful and artistic run that Tim Burton helped shape with his first two films.",
417,17 June 2005,spacemonkey_fg,10, Realistic Batman Film,"I had seen this movie before, obviously who hasn't? But I wanted to watch it again as I was very young when I first saw it and I don't think and fully grasped the concept of the movie. Now being a bit older and having rewatched it, it was amazing. I love how realistic and serious the movie is, it's how a Batman movie should be. The villains are also excellent, there was a small twist which worked fairly well. Christian Bales performance is great, he pretty much plays 3 characters...Batman, Bruce Wayne as an excessive millionaire and the real Bruce Wayne. I will say there are very few comedic moments which is good for this film but when there are it feels forced and is placed in at the wrong time. The action is brilliant, being a Christopher Nolan movie means that most of the scenes are practical effects which adds to the realism and allows the watcher to be drawn in to the movie. Some of the dialogue although necessary got a bit boring due to all the business talk and so on but for the most part it was really strong. The suit looks great and Gotham really does look like a real city with real problems. Last thing is the plot which I think is the best part of the movie, it's so expertly written and creates such a great atmosphere, the story jumps straight into things leaving no time to waste and not dragging on in any scenes. Truly amazing movie. 9/10",

422,29 January 2022,iamksheikh,10, Best Origin Film,"Batman Begins is the grittier, more realistic telling of how Batman actually trained to become the Caped Crusader that we all know and love. Played wonderfully by Christian Bale (Ford v Ferrari), Bale takes on the role of the Dark Knight/Bruce Wayne and the audience never looks back!! For the purpose of this review we start with his late teen years where he was about to kill the man that killed his parents in the alleyway of the theater only to be beaten to the punch so to speak just outside the courtroom where someone else killed the defendant. After that, Wayne really didn't have a purpose in life so he travels the world to learn the criminal mind and find himself and his purpose in the world in a way. It is through this period that Wayne meets Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul played by Liam Neeson (Taken) who puts fourth a very strong performance in this movie. Ducard takes on a mentor's role of Wayne, but he has dark intentions for the younger man and eventually Wayne senses this. At his final trial to become part of Ducard's crew, Wayne splits from the League of Shadows in a climatic fight and vies for his freedom!! This movie really is terrific!! There is so much depth and realism to it, not to say that the movies that we got in the late 80's and 90's were bad but this one and the two Christopher Nolan (the director) Batman films that follow were so realistic it made you fall in love with Batman again!! The action was outstanding, the writing was good, the special effects were good, the sound editing was good, the soundtrack was outstanding, and the movie had a tremendous sense of fun!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",

MUCH better than the last 2 Batman movies, but not quite up to the bar set by Tim Burton's films","This is a new Batman, not the Batman of TV and past films, and not really the Batman of DC comics. This Batman is really good. He almost makes me fell like I could be Batman, if I had all the money and all the smarts. The movie is a step above all the other theatrical pieces of Batman and uses good acting, good writing and good directing, over political correctness and Hollywood standards. But it also has great stuff, the Batmobile, the new Batsuit, realistic fight scenes, and a cast that is like an old studio stable. This is a really good movie. But I can't help feeling that all of these people can give us an even better film next time.",

While not a bad film, it didn't have that dynamite punch you expect from a film touted as a summer blockbuster. I found the very beginning confusing and it took me 40 minutes in till I started finding it entertaining and not boring. The beginning is from the title, it shows how Bruce Wayne trained to become a deadly fighter with a secret organization. He goes back to Gothem after being gone years to rid the city of crime. Rachel, the girl he had a crush on, is an assistant DA and one of the few that has not been bought by the mob. The movie shows how Bruce developed the bat suit, mobile,and weapons. And of course he must battle the surprise (though he was gone/dead) villains at the end who want to destroy Gotham with a chemical that makes people crazy.",

I have watched every single Batman movie there is and I got this feeling that this particular depiction of Batman is the most realistic. He is after all human and the whole psychological background of the hero, his story, his fears and how he ended up being a ""dark"" hero all add up. In a few words, convincing, thorough and with a balanced sense of humor, adventure, romance. Michael Kane, Christian Bale and Liam Neeson, as well as Morgan Freeman all deserve at least congratulations! Can't wait to see the rest of the sequel movies!

434,27 October 2005,Monotreme02,8, One of the best comic book movies ever,"I cannot remember the last time I was so disappointed with a movie. I went into BATMAN BEGINS with pretty much no expectations, and I was very disappointed. I actually felt sad on the way home afterwards because I was so disappointed. I really can't even think of much that I did like. Christian Bale was alright, but the only scene where he really shined as Batman was when he interrogates a crooked cop atop a fire escape. But otherwise, he was just so-so as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. I missed seeing Michael Gough as Alfred, but Michael Caine was the highlight of the film, without question. My favorite scene of the whole film is in a flashback where Alfred tells young Bruce that his parents' murder wasn't his fault. The rest of the cast was okay, except for Katie Holmes, badly miscast as a District Attorney. Gary Oldman fared pretty well as a pre-Commissioner James Gordon (he certainly looked the part), but he's given almost nothing to do and seems to only be in a handful of scenes. Rutger Hauer is the CEO of Wayne Enterprises in a subplot that isn't needed at all. I couldn't help but feel that a lot of the movie was just padding that could have easily been trimmed out.",

Whoever had the vision to cast Christian Bale as Batman deserves the award of the year. This movie was my introduction to him and the impact he had on me was similar to the impact I felt when I first saw Russell Crowe on the screen. What a talented actor! (both of them). The movie was not camp. It was serious and intense and made you almost believe that there could really be a ""Batman"" out there someday. The villains were menacing and nasty without being cartoonish and campy. The background story on Bruce Wayne was detailed and very welcome. It laid a strong and credible foundation for everything he did. The other actors were also strong in their roles. Morgan Freeman is simply irreplaceable. What will we do if and when he retires? And what a turn-about role for Gary Oldman! He's another of my favorites. I'll never forget him in Dracula--absolutely superb. But this movie belongs to Christian--no doubt about it. Great story, great effects, great acting, great package of a movie. Highest recommendation.",
436,16 June 2005,EJCommer,10, Best movie of the year. Christian Bale is a knockout in Batman Returns,"I cannot find anything wrong with this movie. Batman has always been a more complex character than any other from comic books, and in this, he is in his element, portrayed flawlessly by the ever great Christian Bale. The training period, the way the plot goes out, it really is amazing. It fit so well. Christopher Nolan gave back the way Tim Burton portrayed Gotham, but better, but that perhaps is attributed to the fact that there is a lot more things you can do with special effects nowadays. Kudos to him. Liam Neeson is a wise powerful leader, wonderful. Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, rock solid. Katie Holmes is not as good, but definitely up there with the best of them. Cillian Murphy gives a believably evil performance as the scarecrow. A powerful tour-de-force. Bravo to everyone who helped make this movie. Batman has begun.",

There was no entertaining bad guy other than Scarecrow who didn't have enough on screen action. Batman and Batman Returns were good because of their colorful and enchanting atmospheres and entertaining villains, this movie lacked both except the Scarecrow who wasn't in enough scenes. The movie is very boring and it can cause you to miss a major or major plot points so you just have to assume what the story the rest of the way because it is too hard to catch on. Without understanding the plot you can clearly see Katie Holmes is wanted by the bad guys because she is a DA and that the movie is about stopping the guys with drugs and stopping the plot to destroy the water supply. Michael Caine is good though he doesn't have enough screen time to develop a bond with him. Christian Bale is non charismatic, as were I believe the past Batmans in the other movies, but it doesn't have to be about Batman, it can be more about the villains, with some Batman, as long as it is entertaining.",
