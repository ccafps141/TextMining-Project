1,16 January 2020,UniqueParticle,10, The most peculiar Star Wars and under appreciated,"Totally should've won at least some of the awards it was nominated for! A very different adventure story with lots of adorable characters, more truths and the epic Emperor Palpatine! I love all the majestic forest aspects. Still crazy to me that they filmed so many parts especially the chases. The bulk of this art in cinema is done so well and always entertaining. Quite lovable many years later and not many movies have that kind of force!",r
2,2 December 2005,evanston_dad,10," The Boy Who Loved ""Star Wars""","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).",e

4,12 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9, One Of The Best In The Series,"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.",i
5,8 April 2022,kevin_robbins,10, This movie doesnt get as much credit for its greatness that it should,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows the Jedi and Luke needing to save their ally, Solo, who even after being saved will need to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke seeks out Yoda to finish his training and the Jedi sets out for one last battle against the evil empire. For them to be successful, Luke will likely need to face his father one last time.",e
6,19 February 2019,P97,10, a lovely conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies of all time,"This movie might not be as flawless as the first two but everything involved with those throne room scenes were some of the highest points in the entire saga, the conflict between luke and vader, the emperor himself finally showing up for the first time and he's so good at being this manipulative evil, the final lightsaber battle is just breathtaking with that amazing music by john williams and the beautiful ending of the film that brings everything together, those moments alone makes this one of the most underrated in the whole franchise and in my opinion it's the second best movie behind the empire strikes back.",w
7,28 April 2016,ivo-cobra8,8," Flawed, very entertaining solid third sequel an epic conclusion to the original trilogy!","Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.",/
8,18 October 2019,AlsExGal,7," 36 years and 737 reviews later, what is new left to be said?...","...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.",r
9,12 June 2022,poseyfan,10, My favorite ending of all time.,"There's a reason why Anakin Skywalker/ Darth Vader is my favorite character of all time. Even after everything he did, he still fulfilled the prophecy and brought balance to the force. The scene where luke takes off his helmet makes me tear up all the time. Poetry.",w
10,3 February 2005,mjw2305,10, The end of the Star Wars Saga,"Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.",1
11,5 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," My least favourite film from the original trilogy, but it still makes for essential viewing","So what made this movie a step down than its two predecessors? Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.",3
12,23 February 2007,DKosty123,9, Strongest of the Series Besides Episode 4,"Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.",1
13,5 October 2015,luke-a-mcgowan,5," Its fun, but full of holes and inconsistencies","In many ways, Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing, you can't just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here, Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I'd chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn't agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell because Return of the Jedi's story makes absolutely no sense in places.",9

15,27 September 2022,nickenchuggets,9, Vader's redemption,"At last, I am covering the final installment of Star Wars' original 6 films, before I have to take on the unholy duty of discussing the more recent Disney entries. Even though this film is leaps and bounds ahead of whatever nonsense the franchise's new owners can create, many people don't feel this way about it. Surprisingly, I kind of agree with them. Return of the Jedi is sort of the black sheep of the first 3 movies, and while the first 3 Star Wars films are all excellent, I feel that this one is the least best. I'll explain why later. ROTJ takes place a year after Han Solo has been frozen in carbonite to be transported to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, a large slug-like alien, for a bounty. C-3PO and R2-D2 travel to Jabba's palace on the desert world of Tatooine in order to show Jabba a recording of Luke saying he wants to rescue Han. Princess Leia, disguised in a bounty hunter garb of her own, sneaks into the palace, thaws out Han, and rescues him, but is caught by Jabba and chained to him as his slave. Luke shows up and tries to assassinate Jabba himself, but falls through a trap door into an area where he must fight off a large, carnivorous beast called a rancor. Jabba is infuriated when Luke manages to kill his pet by dropping a portcullis on its head, so he sentences Luke and all his friends to be executed by being eaten by a sarlaac: a sand dwelling creature consisting of a beak, sharp tusks and tentacles. Jabba and the others are taken by floating yachts to the area where the sarlaac is, and as Luke is condemned to jump into its maw, he has R2 shoot his lightsaber to him from Jabba's yacht. After Luke kills almost everyone, Leia strangles Jabba to death with her slave chains and is freed by Luke. After speeding away from Jabba's exploding sail barge, Luke once again flies to the planet Dagobah to hopefully complete his Force training with the help of Master Yoda, whose physical body has become very ill by now. As Yoda's 9 centuries of life come to an end, he tells Luke that it is true that Vader is his father. Outside Yoda's hut, Obi-Wan's ghost tells Luke that he will never be a true Jedi until he comes face to face with his father. Meanwhile, the Rebels find out that Emperor Palpatine is building a new Death Star, which, despite its incomplete appearance, has a fully working superlaser. Han and the others manage to hijack an Imperial shuttle and fly to the forest moon of Endor in order to destroy a shield generator which is providing the Death Star with an impervious defensive forcefield. While there, the group comes across a tribe of what appear to be man-eating teddy bears called Ewoks. While the ewoks and Han's strike team fight the imperials and try to bring down the shield, Luke surrenders himself to Vader's forces so he can meet with his father. Vader tells his son that he's been following the path of evil for too long, and that he will always be part of the dark side. While Luke is brought before Palpatine, a large space battle erupts around the Death Star as rebel forces try to destroy it. Palpatine taunts Luke and urges him to give in to his anger, saying only his hatred and dark side energy can destroy a frail, unarmed old man such as him. Luke tries to swing at Palpatine, but his attack is blocked by Vader's lightsaber. The two fight somewhat inconclusively, until Vader tells Luke that if he won't submit to his inner evil, maybe his sister Leia will. Luke savagely batters Vader with everything he has and cuts off one of his robotic hands. Palpatine is pleased, and says he wants Luke to finish him off so he can replace Vader as his malevolent enforcer. Luke refuses to end his father's life. His plan thwarted, the infuriated Emperor starts using the Force to electrocute Luke to death. Vader watches helplessly, but finally decides to redeem all his past sins by lifting Palpatine up and throwing him down a reactor shaft. Fatally wounding himself by doing so (but saving his son), Vader then asks Luke to remove his helmet so he can see him with his real eyes, if only for this one time. Vader says Luke was right about there being a bit of good in him, and then dies. Luke then puts his father's body in an imperial shuttle and flies off the new Death Star just as it explodes, since the rebel attack on its power core was a success. Back on Endor, Luke attends a party to celebrate the entire galaxy being freed from imperial tyranny. As he cremates Vader's corpse, he sees the ghosts of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his now redeemed father Anakin watching over him. While I think this movie is still great because (obviously) it's Star Wars and also gets quite sad at the end, there are a few things fans like to harp on it for. For one thing, I thought it was pretty stupid how Leia manages to choke Jabba to death inside his sail barge full of his servants/associates and nobody tries to stop her. A more obvious weakpoint of this film is the introduction of Ewoks. Some people love them, but I personally couldn't stand watching the Empire's soldiers get turned into stooges trying to fight these furry things half their height. The ewoks use ridiculous traps more fitting of a faction such as the Vietcong rather than something out of Star Wars, and they literally show stormtroopers being subdued just by rocks and spears. At least it kind of highlights the fact that huge military industrial complexes can be defeated just by a few people determined to defend their land. As for the positives, there are too many to list. We finally get to see Luke become a Jedi while managing to keep his mind clear of hate; something his father never accomplished. After watching the prequel movies, it's sad when you realize that Anakin has basically been a slave his entire life. He was born one on tatooine, was a slave to the Jedi, and was a slave to Palpatine as Darth Vader. Seeing such an evil character like him turn good was deeply moving. Speaking of Vader, there is a somewhat annoying inconsistency only present in the last 30 or so seconds of the film. For some reason, George felt it necessary to replace the original actor playing Anakin's ghost (Sebastian Shaw). Now, it's Hayden Christensen. I know the logic is that they're trying to make Anakin look like the way he did before he became evil, but didn't he redeem himself by killing the Emperor? Aside from the various changes made in the re-releases of this movie, it is still my belief that Return of the Jedi is an enjoyable, moving, and fitting end to the original Star Wars saga.",3
16,15 December 2015,claudio_carvalho,10, The Last Jedi,"Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO and R2-D2 go to Taooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the powerful criminal Jabba the Hutt. After many fights, they are well succeeded in their mission. The group returns to the Rebel Alliance base while Luke heads to Dagobah to finish his training with Yoda; however the Jedi is dying and he confirms that Darth Vader (David Prowse) is his father and Luke also learns that he has a sister, Leia. Meanwhile the rebels discover that the Empire is building a new Death Star more powerful than the first one that is protected by an energy shield generated by a generator in planet Endor. Luke and his group goes to the forest in the planet to destroy the generator while Lando and the rebels wait for the right moment to attack the station. The group in Endor teams-up with the inhabitants, Ewoks, to fight against the Imperial troops but they are captured in a trap; Luke is brought to Darth Vader but he refuses to fight against his father. When he meets the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid), he tries to bring Luke to the dark side of the Force. What will happen to Luke and the rebels? ",3
17,14 May 2020,saadanathan,8, The perfect ending for the perfect trilogy 8/10,"So I think on a personal note, I prefer this third film over the two others. Simply because it is really good. The movie stars with a time gap between ""The Empire strikes Back"" and it's opening. Which is something I prefer in movies: a time gap of a few days or weeks, maybe months to give the audience a feeling of change. It's better then starting the film exactly where it ended last time. That is one thing. The other is the hugh battle in space that has become a tradition in star wars films, to have large scaled battles in space. The final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is really remarkable and gives us a little father - son fight. I mean for real now, don't you get emotional from the scene where Luke and vader talk to each other? Overall the ending on the planet endor is the perfect ending for this perfect trilogy.",/
18,16 January 2020,ismail2020,10, Real END,"Legendary all-encompassing, complete a great final.star warsa not after starting 6 movies 60 movies you would watch, you never want to end this series in this series. .Because all of them are very friendly, cute and warmly created characters.But unfortunately we have to finish the series with the return of the jedi.As Luke enters into a war of will with his father and emperor, the rebels are struggling both in the woods and in space, especially the dialogues between the emperor Darth Vader and Luke are well written and immersive, and the Ewok are so sweet and especially fun to think of 3CPO as a god.",?
19,14 November 2001,exterminator_99,7, Age helps final episode of sci-fi saga,"Perspective is a good thing.  Since the release of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies.  What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films.  This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: ""Return of the Jedi"".  Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question.",r
20,12 January 1999,Gen S2rt,10, ...and the trilogy is finished with yet another great film.,"After ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" redefined science fiction, and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" redefined ""Star Wars"", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" and the more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special Edition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans.",e
21,11 May 1999,ladysolo,9, A touching end,"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks!  True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!",f
22,2 September 2005,JTurner82,10, All things must come to an end... even a classic space saga.,"This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.",_

25,21 July 2002,Anonymous_Maxine,9, The end of the Star Wars saga?,"The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years, until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review, Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure (although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects), and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005, the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977. ",t
26,2 June 2007,blanbrn,10, An excellent way to end the saga. It's full of adventure and it puts closure on the dark side.,"""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983 was a great way to end the ""Star Wars"" saga the film was a blast as the Rebels and Jedi Knight(Luke) finally won the civil war against Lord Vader and the evil empire. From the start this film begins with action and drama as Skywalker returns to his old stomping grounds his home of Tatooine, but a special mission in plans that's the rescue of Han Solo from the slimy Jabba the Hutt. Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang are along side Luke for the journey that after the defeat of Jabba they land on the forest moon of Endor, it's here that Lucas introduced us to furry little creatures we loved that's the Ewoks! The Ewoks join up with the rebels to fight the empire, though Luke must handle his own business against Vader and the evil that is tempted upon him. The showdown between Luke and Vader is classic as it's over before the death of evil a final sad good bye is said, and Luke gets to see his father without the mask. The torch has finally been passed and the rebels are free and Luke the Jedi Knight rules superior. Really again a super film from Lucas with drama, and action and excitement from start to finish he picked a good way to end the saga. We will always remember George's creations, his characters, plots, and the musical scores of John Williams will never leave your mind, and final thanks to Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill who all were magnificent in all three legendary classics.",_

28,16 December 2016,cdjh-81125,10, The Greatest and Most Undervalued Star Wars Film,"Despite the original Star Wars trilogy being considered one of the greatest trilogies of all time it's final instalment Return of The Jedi is only considered to be good and I have to say that not only do I think this movie is on par with the past two entries, I actually think this is better than them. A large part of why I love this movie so much is how satisfying it is, the entire trilogy has built up to the events in this film, so we're completely invested in the characters and situation, it all came together perfectly. All the characters in this film are different than they were in the last two films and if adds to there characters to see that there are still consequences to every action they take. I thought that The Emperor was a fantastic villain for this film as we truly realise just how powerful he is and it was interesting to see how he controlled Vader. The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series.

29,10 April 2022,dieseldemon85,9, Best of the lot,"Of the original three this is the best one. Returning to the lighter approach of the 1977 film I felt.

30,13 September 2008,kyle-cruse,9," Underrated, and completely satisfying","Some people have disliked this film, and I truly don't see why. ""Return of the Jedi,"" does not, contrary to popular opinion, ruin the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy but rather ties it up in a perfectly satisfying way. The opening scenes at Jabba the Hutt's palace are well done. Jabba is a much meaner and scarier villain here than the short clip in the 1997 re-release of ""A New Hope"" showed him to be. Luke Skywalker is forced to make his most difficult choices in this film, and the intensity of the film's last half-hour is some of the most compelling film-making I've ever seen. The themes and messages of redemption and good vs. evil are superbly done here. ""Return of the Jedi"" is a very exciting and engaging film, memorable and worth watching many times, especially now that Episode III has been made. It's not as perfect as the previous two Star Wars films were, but it is a very pleasing and happy conclusion to an amazing story. The fourth best in the saga, behind the two originals and Episode III. Nearly perfect.",

36,9 August 2005,MinorityReporter,8, A fine ending - especially after having seen Episode III,"When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padmé and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.",
37,22 October 2017,tomgillespie2002,6," The least effective of the original trilogy, but packed with charm and excitement","As a child, I owned all of the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS, purchased when 'remastering' was all the rage and the iconic sci-fi saga found itself on the receiving end of a much-needed cleaning-up. This was, however, before George Lucas tampered with his already- near-perfect legacy, adding unneeded special effects and elongating certain scenes for seemingly no other reason to show how far CGI had come (although it now looks incredibly dated). Despite the perfection of episodes four and five, my go-to Star Wars movie on a boring Sunday afternoon was always Return of the Jedi, the third instalment now widely remembered as the poorest of the bunch. I don't quite know what it was about Jedi that always caused me to reach for it. It certainly wasn't the Ewoks, those cuddly fur-balls shoe-horned in to sell more merchandise, although they aren't as annoying or distracting as I remembered.",
38,1 April 1999,Michael_Pilkington,9," Very good, if not perfect 'Jedi'","""Return of the Jedi"" is almost on par with the previous ""Star Wars"" films. There's more special effects (some good, some cheesy) and more new characters and creatures, including the Ewoks.  What makes Jedi the least perfect, is that it's very routine -- more of a reworking of ""Star Wars."" There's more new surprises, though.  A victory is celebrated at the end.  New scenes are featured in the ""special edition."" The ending is very satisfying.  My evaluation: ***1/2 out of ****.",
39,25 September 2010,bkoganbing,9," The Last Of The Force, I Doubt It",About the only criticism I can make of Return Of The Jedi is that the film could easily have been two films.

47,6 September 2008,captkirk_4,4, Uhhgg!,"Spoilers: I remember looking so forward to this as a kid after loving the first two movies. They had previews for new characters on the back of the action figures boxes I'd get at Toys-R-Us and I'd eagerly wonder what the blacked out Ewok characters would look like. Must have really been something special! I even remember how they switched the name around as ""Revenge of the Jedi."" This was just going to be THE movie of the summer, and waiting in line to get in while hearing the thunderous noise of the climactic battle as the audience of the screening just wrapping up applauded enthusiastically, I was just SO excited. When I saw it even as a kid I knew it was somewhat of a disappointment, watching it now as an adult...Uhgg! Now I see how Lucas went so wrong with the abomination of the prequels, all the threads started to unravel with this Turkey. (Though Return of the Jedi is still much superior to those aforementioned prequels which had a plot harder to follow than Dune.) First of all are notoriously unbearable Ewoks, even as a kid I HATED them. No adult could possibly find anything watchable about the whole Ewok sequence on Endor. The Emperor is ridiculously ""comic book"" evil, tyrants usually have charisma and are more like gangsters than lunatics. The choice to add another family revelation by making Leah Luke's sister is stupid and ruins the relationship from the first two movies. The original Cantina scene with the various aliens was creative, here Lucas has gone overboard with a new bizarre rubber masked actor or puppet cropping up every minute. In some respects this whole thing is nothing more than a commercial to sell action figures to eight year olds. And the Climax: Another Deathstar? Lucas, you already did that before, but considering the fecal ideas he spewed out in the prequels, perhaps a rehashing of the end of the first movie was the best we could hope for. After all, to sum up the cinematic ideas going through Lucas' head during this period: Howard the Duck. Don't even get me started on the vandalism Lucas did to the Original Trilogy with the CGI additions to the new copys of the Star Wars movies for sale. The original 1977 print is a piece of American History, to alter the imagery that swept the nation that summer is akin to someone painting over the Mona Lisa.",

IMDb ranks ""The Empire Strikes Back"" above ""A New Hope"", with ""Jedi"" coming in a distant third.

Reviewing this film so many years after it came out, the only flaw I can see is the blandness of the lightsaber duels in comparison to the modern movies. That is all I can say bad about it though. People have enjoyed talking crap about the Ewoks, but those same people forget that these movies are geared towards families, and you need the cute to counter the ugly.

With his appearance, the third entry in the iconic series shrinks to juvenile desperation (obviously to create a massive toy product tie-in), so a good part of the adult audience appeal is diminished. The main story, dealing with the aftermath of Darth Vader's admission, should be the main focus rather than these silly subplots, and while most of film overall is good, the Jabba jam (complete with weird musical number) takes this down a point of no return that makes the film a bit eye rolling, especially the sight of Carrie Fisher in a dominatrix outfit and Pippi Longstocking braids.

You can't hate Return of the Jedi!"" However, this movie really bothers me every time I see it. The creativity of the first Star Wars made it a great movie, and the shocking twist in Empire made it quite possibly the greatest sequel ever. Yet this incredible scenario presented at the end of Empire was wasted in a movie full of rehash. First of all, could Lucas really come up with nothing better than a SECOND Death Star??! And just like the first one, the movie ended in an all out assault on it. Luke and Vader fought with light sabers (again!). Not to mention, in a desperate attempt to recapture the emotion created in the audience after Vader said his famous ""I AM YOUR FATHER"", Lucas made Leia turn out to be Luke's long-lost sister. Give me a break! A little competition between Han and Luke might show some semblance of conflict among the good guys. Just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean it can't be somewhat realistic in character presentation. Vader's unmasking was disappointing. Instead of Lon Chaney unmasked as the phantom, we got Uncle Fester with acne. Carrie Fischer can't act worth $#\&*! Although I could go on and on, I'll give just one final reason. Three words: Ewoks! Ewoks! Ewoks! I hate those furry little muppet wannabes. They were added for one reason and one reason only, so Lucas could line his pockets by making Ewok stuffed animals, talking Ewok toys, Ewok lunchboxes, and even an Ewok TV show! The bottom line is, this is the most OVERRATED movie in the history of Hollywood!!!",

The best part of this flick is clearly the rescue of Han Solo from Jaba the Hut.  These desert scenes are great and the flick is at its best here.  We also learn of the empire, which is constructing a new Death Star.  Then the movie gets to the weaker part of the film where they go to Endor which just looks like any North American woods rather than any alien world.  And we are introduced to the ewoks who are nowhere near the pain that Jar Jar would later become.

Return of the Jedi is the most brilliant of the original three films. It is mind blowing and the best story, battles, creatures and more!! It also ironically is the film that probably has the most memorable and pop culturally significant moments. Right from the beginning you have the world of Tattooine and Jabba The Hut and eventually Princess Leia's infamous gold slave bra and outfit. The object of every teenage boys fantasy in the eighties. Yoda's touching death and Luke's full circle training as a Jedi. The intense and special effect driven escape from Jabba The Hut with Han Solo and the incredible final showdown between Luke and his father Darth Vader while an incredible battle rages on Endor with the adorably creepy Ewoks. All of this is packed into the third installment and it is truly a spectacle to see.

93,17 June 2019,andrewroy-04316,5, Episode 6 rehashes the same content of the previous two with little energy or intrigue,"Return of the Jedi is a fun and pleasant movie, but adds little to the Star Wars universe in the way of novel ideas or character investment (arguably Anakin aside). The movie runs along two storylines: the darker Luke storyline of him becoming a Jedi and confronting his father, and the lighter storyline of Han and Leia continuing to be in love and work with the Ewok. The latter storyline was cute, but utterly uneventful. Nothing new happens with Han or Leia, and the Ewoks are given far too much screentime for their one-dimensionality as just cute and somewhat strong things, so that storyline ended up being rather boring. The Luke one definitely held more tension - the late scenes with him, Vader, and Palpatine were exciting and built well to the climax. Unfortunately, that climax was quite a disappointment, for several reasons. First, unlike the previous one, we get little in the way of Luke's character development and have little reason to be invested in or root for him. Second, Luke's ability to hold his own with Vader and Palpatine was unrealistic - why not pout some physical restrictions on him until he agrees to serve you? But the biggest frustration is what the plot hinges on: Vader's transition to help Luke. Luke doesn't really do or say anything novel, and Vader is a smart guy who has thought about this issue long and hard, and yet Luke being there is enough to just get him to switch? Vader is so deeply established and has been working as a head of the Empire for years, a conviction that should not be so easily shaken. He didn't raise his son but left him at birth, so there's hardly even a huge familial connection. We aren't given anything to latch on to in explaining Vader's monumental shift. Between the lack of interest in the other storylines and the disappointment in the way the climax is resolved, the pleasant effects, acting, and other peripherals present in all three are not enough to save Return of the Jedi from fun but easily forgettable mediocrity.",

Living Teddy Bears? what Kind of Allies are that?",
95,1 September 2021,SPZMaxinema,9, The most memorable Star Wars to me as a kid.,"While many don't like the Ewoks and creatures in this particular film, and while the two before this are much better imo, I personally really liked the scenes at Jabba's palace, plus the 3 ending battles all meshed together! This also has many emotion-stirring parts to it and awesome suspenseful battle scenes and I think that it's one of the best final films to a trilogy that there are and can be! Everything wrapped up well, and the crappy Disney sequel should not have been made since this was a great conclusion and how Palpatine ""died"" was perfect! The only valid thing that came after this was the Mandalorian and maybe the Book of Boba Fett.",
96,26 December 2008,gizmomogwai,8," Sufficient conclusion to the original trilogy, but should have been great","Return of the Jedi is the third film in the Star Wars series, and the last of the original trilogy. It is sometimes seen as the weakest of the three. The reason? Ewoks, ewoks, ewoks. These furry aliens have been deemed too cute for Star Wars, too much for kids, too much for merchandising. But personally, I don't loathe the ewoks like some do. I actually think it was neat to see how such primitive weapons could beat the Empire, which after all was Lucas' intent. Nevertheless, I agree this is the weakest film of the original trilogy. It is, however, a sufficient conclusion.",

Brr...they certainly aren't as bad as Jar-Jar Binks but close enough. I personally think they were created to appeal to girls because Star Wars is more of a guy trilogy. I mean, Princess Leai is in some wooded area on some planet or whatever, and she sees these oversized teddy bears running around in what appears to be bandanas and sling-shots. What? Where? Who? But what really insulted my mind about the Ewoks was that they were able to kill Vaders henchmen (what were they again?) with stones and arrows while the henchmen are wearing hard plastic and metal. What?",

This masterpiece captures all the aspects and doesn't fail to keep the audience to jump out of their seats. It's a tragedy that George Lucas gave the franchise to Disney in hope that they would make an amazing sequel, but was rather extremely disappointed. I hope the Obi Wan Kenobi series won't be ruined.

And, it is, I think, the best of the trilogy. Here, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Chewbacca rescue Hans Solo from Jabba the Hutt, and are set to complete their mission of restoring freedom in the Galaxy. Joining them are the little furry friends called the Ewoks. This time, the Emperor himself oversees the construction of the new Death Star by Darth Vader. From there on, it is the fight to be finish, in an epic battle of good vs. evil. What results is another breathtaking action-filled movie, with great direction by Richard Marquand, awesome script by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, superb music score by John Williams and terrific special effects. This film offers hope and rebirth, character development and beautiful sceneries like the galactic city. In addition, there are two spectacular battles: one in the forest and one in the Death Star. Fast-paced and action packed - no boring fillers or sub-plots. ",

Every emotional beat hits, the characters are all so lovable and you really feel how their journeys through this movie impact them. All their journeys come to a pretty satisfying conclusion. Seeing Vader looking back and forth from Emperor Palpatine to his son Luke, and then eventually choosing to intervene and save his only son hits hard. The Emperor is done fantastic in this movie, you can feel the creepiness oozing out of him. The musical score is, as expected, fantastical. The Ewoks are done pretty well in my opinion as well.",

I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.",

But I gave it another go and boy am I glad I did. In the trilogy, this was the very best yet.

A genuinely bad movie, truly awful in every possible way, ""Jedi"" features a screenplay aimed squarely at four year olds and absolutely terrible acting from an understandably embarrassed cast; in addition, the film offers us the shoddiest array of cheap, plastic-looking space aliens since Irwin Allen's ""Lost In Space"" tv series. Yes, I realize it is this very cheapness that endears the movie to a legion of kitsch loving fans, but, as a direct follow-up to ""Empire,"" one of the most entertaining and inventive fantasy movies of the last twenty years, ""Jedi"" comes across as a particularly insulting spit in the face from George Lucas.

Has everything, a little boy could want: shootouts, sword fights, amazing creatures, beautiful women, cool vehicles, and magic. But what good is all that if you don't have a good story? Thankfully this saga successfully integrated that in so the eye candy doesn't overpower it all. This last installment has got a bit of a bad wrap due to its over-emphasis on action, and less on emotional pathos, but I disagree since it all wraps everything from the previous two up perfectly. Some have frowned upon the Ewoks, but I love them. They're cuddly and they prove very resourceful against the Imperial Empire (they're the Birnham Wood that came to Duinsane Hill). I actually adore Leia in the Gold Metal Bikini, very gorgeous eyeful!! My favorite part however, is Luke's last battle. Returning the favor with a hand slice finish, he prove's what a real Jedi is.

135,25 January 2021,Jackblyth8,9, Very Under-appreciated,"The epic space opera adventure continues in Episode 6 with it set 1 year after 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Following on from the entrapment of Han Solo by Jabba the Hutt and the news broken to Luke Skywalker by Darth Vader, explaining that the Sith Lord is in fact his father. The two famous droids R2-D2 and C-3PO are integral characters to the Star Wars saga, with 3PO supplying his protocol skills and impressive memory bank, and, R2's navigation skills and ability to hack into various systems. The pair begin the watch when they are sent to Jabba's palace on Tatooine in a trade bargain made by Luke Skywalker to rescue Han Solo. Disguised as a Bounty Hunter, Princess Leia infiltrates the palace under the pretence of collecting the bounty on Chewbacca and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved, held hostage by Jabba himself. Jabba the Hutt is a puppet character, marshalled by three men inside his thick rolls. He is best known for his large size, slimy skin and low-pitched voice that produces saliva when ever he speaks. The crime lord has connotations with a slug, in his overall appearance and lazy nature, there is an extreme lack of movement from Jabba as he is predominantly placed on a stand and surrounded by his slaves, doing things for him. His profession entailed trafficking in illegal good, piracy and of course slavery that generated the planet of Tatooine's wealth, making his business so successful. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by rancor, an immense, warm-blooded predator native to Dathomir. After Luke kills rancor by brutally slicing him by opening and closing an escape door, Jabba sentenced him, Han (who can barely see) and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the Sarlacc, a huge, carnivorous plant-like desert beast. Having hidden his new lightsaber inside R2-D2, Luke frees himself and battles against Jabba's guards, on a ship hovering above the sanded trap. As Luke engages battle, Leia cleverly chokes Jabba with the chains she was connected to whilst enslaved by the gangster, killing him. Han and Chewbacca combine to save a fallen Lando, inches of sliding into the Sarlacc's trap, obtaining the pilot and fleeing with Luke and Leia. As the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his training with Yoda, whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that Darth Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with the Force. The ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the Empire. The Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the supervision of the Emperor himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. In a sequence of chases, Scout troopers, also known as biker scouts, were plotted in the forest as a part of the Imperial army, many of which were defeated in a high speed bike race, featuring Luke and Leia. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. The Ewoks are bear-like and seem to occupy their own language. Their tribe are all small creatures and armed with sticks that they poke to those alarming them or trespassing. Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is he father, and that he must confront him. This overwhelms Leia who struggles to believe the news, but trusts Luke and knows he is doing the right thing. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tried to convince his father to reject the Dark side of the Force, to no avail. Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the Dark side, as he did to Anakin. The Emperor - withered and weak - reveals in his sinister tone that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a cleverly executed counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator, purely due to the Ewoks teamwork and knowledge of their village. Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon and Admiral Ackbar lead the Rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them, cue Ackbar's famous line... The salmon-skinned admiral is a member of the amphibious Mon Calamari species, his role as military commander of the Rebel Alliance is crucial to the organisation of any mission. His large fish eyes and unusual appearance, encouraged his voice actor Erik Bauserfeld after just one look at the character, although, Ackbar is a puppet portrayed by Timothy D. Rose. The Emperor informs Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke fo give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the Dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's prosthetic hand. The Emperor is impressed by Luke's attributes, almost a carbon copy to when he saw Anakin defeat Count Dooku, and entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke's loyalty to the Rebellion means he refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightening, the same that helped kill Mace Windu. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader considers Luke's pain and suffering that the Emperor is causing, seeing that his son can't fight back he lifts up the Emperor and throws him down a reactor shaft to his death, but Vader is mortally electrocuted in the process. Luke supports Darth Vader until the Sith Lord can't continue, resting on the ground, he requests his son to remove his mask, so that Anakin Skywalker can take a proper look at his son, the redeemed Anakin dies in his son's arms, in a moving scene. After the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the Super Star Destroyer's executor. The colossal capital ship is both utilised as a forward operating base and as a mobile weapon systems platform, the Star Destroyer is known to be the headquarters of the Empire. Lando and the X-Wing fighter pilot Wedge Antilles destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the Falcon escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. Returning to the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a pyre before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the Galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi Wan and Anakin watching proudly over him. As the original saga ends, 6 well-directed films make up the achievement of bringing peace and prosperity to the Galaxy. The 6 Episodes feature incredible characters, intense battles, defeat leading to despair, and success leading to celebration. With many deaths along the way, the journey beginning with the 'Phantom Menace' and ending with the 'Return of the Jedi' reinforces the key message, and how integral teamwork and leadership skills are. The power of the Force is something not to be tampered with and is the heartbeat of the Jedi credentials. With major setbacks, the Republic was no more, the Galactic Empire evolved, so too did Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. The Empire's target of dominating the Galaxy was imminent with the construction of the Death Star, but with help of many unsung heroes who sacrificed themselves to obtain and pass on schematics of the superweapon, allowed the newly formed Rebellion to counteract the Empire. Luke - the 'New Hope' - destroyed the Death Star, and witnessed the death of Palpatine and his father, who helped him by killing the Emperor, before dying in his arms. Peace was restored across the Galaxy!",

137,9 August 2022,deruytterwolfgang,10, HOW TO MAKE AN EPIC CONCLUSION,"I know this movie is considered the weakest of the original trilogy, but to me it's always been my favorite ever since I was a little kid. The entire rescue sequence is so creative, so well thought out. The ending is amazing. I love the ewoks, who might look weak and little, but in a group together with the rebels are brave and strong, that's a message that Star Wars always has. Luke being tempted to hate but strong enough to resist is such a cool thing to see. The entire battle between Darth Vader and Luke is classic. And then their last emotional moment is just...wow. The original trilogy contains only masterpieces and joy. When I think about it, I transform into the kid who watched star wars for the first time, not knowing what it is, and then getting a feeling of true passion. And George has passion. We even see it in the prequels. And since Disney runs the show, things have not been quite the same. The magic dissapears. Vader, Luke,etc are milked dry until the spark is gone. They're not special anymore. That's what Disney misses. Force Awakens had it, but it hasn't been quite consistent. GIVE US STAR WARS BACK DISNEY!!!",
138,5 September 2020,DrTuvok,9, The Real End to Star Wars,"Return of the Jedi is certainly the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy, but fortunately we have the redemption of Darth Vader arc which goes and salvages the entire film. Without it the movie would be a disappointment on par with the Matrix 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, The Godfather 3, the Hobbit 3, and all of cinema's other failed three-quels.
The road to Vader's redemption is quite bumpy, however. All the Jabba's palace scenes, while relentlessly creative, really add nothing to the overall story and function simply as a protracted and needlessly convoluted procedure into bringing back Harrison Ford. That being said, these scenes are probably where the original trilogy gets closest to its pulpy inspirations as possible-I've read a fair share of 1930s pulp sci-fi, and everything in these scenes (goofy monsters, rancor pit, bikini slaves) simply SCREAMS 1930s sci-fi. It's interesting but ultimately not that necessary.
Once we get to Endor the movie improves. After some sluggish pacing and a perfectly shot speeder bike chase, we finally get to see Luke's confrontation with the Emperor, which is where the movie really succeeds. The scenes with Luke and his father on the Death Star are probably the most powerful of any Star Wars movie ever; they also give the story meaning, and even achieve a moral statement that nearly no American blockbusters even try to show. Kudos to Lucas for pulling that off. (Also, it's not against Vader's character that he turned to the light side; is it so surprising that he would chuck Palpatine down the chasm when the latter was literally trying to get his son to kill him a few minutes ago?)
Meanwhile, the rest of the battle of Endor is pretty excellent. Lucas likes multi-front battles woven together-the Phantom Menace had an even more complex one-and he delivers here. While a second Death Star implies creative bankruptcy, the space battle above it is more exciting and massive than in the original film. The Endor forest battle is controversial, and the Ewoks defeating the Empire's 'best troops' is a little cheesy, but it's still exciting for what it is. (And when watching it for the first time, I was probably one of the only kids who got the references to the Swiss Family Robinson film from 1960.)
Anyway, the fact remains that the ending is perfect for the Skywalker saga, bringing the two previous movies, and yes, the prequels, full circle. Why follow it up with a mediocre sequel trilogy bent on giving all these characters terrible ends? The empire was destroyed forever, and balance was restored. Let them celebrate. They won.",

I loved this movie when it came out back in '83 and was very excited to revisit it. As I sat here watching it my heart just kept sinking lower and lower. Is this the same movie I saw in the theatres?? What's up with all the cutesiness? And the myriad issues extend far beyond the infamous and very problematic Ewoks. The whole thing is just cheeseball bad. It's very poorly put together - poorly edited throughout, Boba Fett's demise is cartoonishly out of place, did I mention Han Solo is a complete waste of space? I could go on and on and on. I mean wow, George Lucas jumped the shark 30 years ago! The Phantom Menace was simply a continuation of the already declining quality.

Not anymore. A lot of the special effects don't work as well as they used to. They look very dated. That normally wouldn't bother me but as the look of ""Return of the Jedi"" diminishes, the weakness of the script becomes more pronounced. The acting by the three leads (Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford) isn't so hot either. All three of them seem to be going through the motions most of the time.

The incest being retroactively added to Empire does not help. Worse the film is split into distinct sections that don't function as a story overall.

It's just not as good as the other entries in the franchise. What saves it is the storyline leading up to the final scene with Darth Vader, which is incredible. The rest of the movie isn't. The Ewoks especially are terrible. Not only do they look like puppets, they feel completely out of place.

But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart.

It has lost a star for additions to it post prequel trilogy, one of the worst of which turns that disgusting Sarlacc creature (sand beast that devours people dropped into it) into Audrey from the Little Shop of Horrors, and some other additions. I forgot about that particular addition, and it made me rage again upon seeing it when recently watching the movie on Disney+. It's original version was far more impressive, as a giant thorny hole in the sand, and much more menacing as a result. In addition I didn't much care for adjustments to the entertainment in Jaba the Hut's base, those moments seeming to be particularly disjointed. With respects to original elements, the Ewoks, while cute, do seem to be something of a mistake, in that they occupy too much movie time, with no meaningful amount of Ewok character development - there was indeed a regular one that popped up more often than the others, but they didn't go to any lengths to make that really resonate. Endor also seemed a location that had little meaning, in so far as that new death star's development was concerned - I suppose it would have been a tactically discrete location for construction, and testing maybe, but it didn't make all that much sense either, in terms of ramping up the stakes!

Thus, from his head did burst forth the Ewok. (Ewoks seem to be based on Australian tribes people, which is actually a lot better than the crazy Jar-Jar primitive race alien in Ep. 1.)  The story for this movie is excellent, the movie itself is just so half-assed.  I think the entire movie can be judged on the scene in which Luke is fighting off the giant monster creature in Jabba's lair.  The blue screen my weatherman uses looks better than that.  There was really no point in adding new scenes to this film, if not to clean up at least that one shot.  And although Lucas never expected to shoot Empire or Jedi, I'm sure that somewhere in the back of his head he must have been thinking that Mark Hammil would mature into an actor with a more Jedi-like screen personality.

It opens with the search and rescue of Han Solo whose frozen body is held within the lair of the ruthless Jabba the Hutt. This is a masterpiece of art direction and creature effects as Jabba's lair lays host to creatures of all distinctions. Luke Skywalker sets to complete his Jedi training with Yoda. The third act involves the Rebel Force gearing up for an attack on the Death Star. They are joined by a tribe of Ewoks in their battle. Visually spectacular without the cliffhanger of The Empire Strikes Back. Director Richard Marquand does a superb job at combining blazing action with humour. Mark Hamill as Luke is more focused and ready to face certain facts. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han are more certain of their feelings. Billy Dee Williams returns as a reformed Lando Calrissian and even leads the air battle when given opportunity to fly the Millennium Falcon. David Prowse again provides the physical presence of Vader whose corrupted soul is penetrated. It completes the trilogy but not without a victory that truly demonstrates good over evil. Score: 9 / 10",

I cannot even express how much is wrong is these movies, in every possible respect. Obviously they are cynically manufactured with money in mind (Ewoks!? C'mon!), and obviously they wrecked the notion of film as anything but lightweight, even dull and stupid, entertainment.

This film is a definite showcase of how the third film in a trilogy should be, it maintains all of the things that made the original two so amazing while adding more on and ending with a very satisfying conclusion. As always the acting, special effects, directing, editing, production design, etc., it's just all top notch, easy to say it is a well made film. There really isn't anything bad to say about this one, everything is just perfect like the other two in the original trilogy. A new addition to the Star Wars universe is the teddy bear-like creatures known as Ewoks, they add some great comedy and in the end help deliver a great message. Overall it is another great installment of the Star Wars franchise and concludes everything in one of the greatest, most joyous endings in movie history, it's just perfect.",

Return of the Jedi resolves Darth Vader's struggle to truly redeem himself in Luke's eyes, and the finale of the film (in the Death Star II) is an unbelievably potent ending to one of cinema's greatest characters. The Skywalker Family is probably one of the most traumatized families in cinema history: incest, orphaned as young ones, a force-sensitive-tyrant as a father who has destroyed millions/billions of lives, yet a family that is destined to bring balance to the galaxy.",

Shall we start at the beginning where sound quality was so bad that it was near impossible to hear what any of the woeful actors were saying. There was obviously NO editing, as character development scenes were painfully long and pointless (although a good opportunity to make a cuppa!). The ""5 hot chicks"" were average, and if you're hoping for a bit of skin you'll be disappointed, as the best on offer is a passably attractive girl in skimpy shorts, fleeing for her life for about 10mins at most. The plot is barely existent, the filming dreadful, and there are simply not enough negative adjectives to describe this film. Did someone mention that this was made with ""just"" $35 million US? That would have to be the most destructive use of money since the ""eat a tapeworm to lose weight"" campaign in the 60's!

People are still lining up whenever there's a new Star Wars movie on the horizon despite the fact that the last decent Star Wars movie released over 40 years ago.. Some people just never learn. As for this movie in specific, it falls under ""Mediocre"". It was nowhere near as good as it's predecessors and the only reason it's rated 8.3 is because of biased fanboys with clouded judgement. It had great music and cool visual effects but that's about it for the positives, same thing goes with any Star Wars movie made after this one.

I remember watching the movie for the first time all excited considering I thought the first two films were perfect (and still pretty much do!). I was wondering how this film would conclude the story arcs especially after how dark The Empire Strikes Back was. With Han Solo frozen in carbonite and the reveal of Darth Vader's lineage to Luke, I was very excited. Now I have seen this film many times since, but my thoughts remained the same. This is a very fun, satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy. While it does not reach the height of its predecessors, there are enough highlights to make this one memorable sci-fi adventure.",

All those die-hards (and believe me, I am included in that category in every respect except for this deviation) who proclaim this to be equal or better to the other two are only kidding themselves.

Sappy stuff with the Ewoks, overlong, new creatures not that fantastical (Jabba), an emphasis on the chase scene over the dramatic thrust, a bit of self-importance, and a touch of weariness - the actors look tired and bored, as if publicly greating each other is the way to get audience cheers. Carrie Fisher really needs to quit smoking - sounds like they have too many Marlboros on that planet.  Mark Hammill is starting to look, well, not-so-good.  Not bad overall, but a clear sign of decline - not as precipitous as the next installment, but the first crack in the Jedi's armor.",
218,6 July 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,6," He did return, but he left behind all the wonder and entertainment, in short, almost all that was good in the others","I'm not sure where it went wrong. Maybe Lucas just did not feel right about the middle one being dark, so he made this all warm and fuzzy. I didn't care for it, myself. Going by that this is about ten times further down the #250 list than the first two, I'm probably not alone in finding this a letdown. Of course, if the tone was all it was, this could still be great... but, alas, in neither case is that true. Marquand presumably also deserves portions of the blame. I don't know if he just can't do action, I haven't seen anything else by him. This just never actually engages, it certainly didn't, me. The light-saber stuff somehow never goes beyond ""dull"" and ""flat"". I know that it should, but it doesn't. The universe... honestly isn't that heavily expanded in this. A handful of new creatures, several of which are at least one of the following... irritating, more or less poorly realized visually and too cute. Designs aren't that imaginative, for a few. Places and ideas are revisited and redone. The sound comes off as not very unique. The score is still magnificent. Situations tend to be silly, their solutions, as well as how they come about. There are points of this where it seems like George forgot he wasn't writing a script for Indiana Jones. The effects don't particularly get better from the preceding entries(though, admittedly, some do). The pacing is reasonable, the film runs fairly smoothly. This doesn't have memorable or quotable lines. There is little of interest in the characters and their development is basically all in episodes IV and V. The DVD has a commentary track and it's worth a listen. I recommend this only to those who really must watch all of the Original Trilogy. 6/10",

A movie like Pink Flamingos is good with bad acting, but a movie like this needs good actors.  The plot is thinner than that of Bloodsucking Freaks, and is completely unimaginative.

It ends the chronicles of the pivotal human characters in the series, mainly Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader. It brings back other characters who seem either more or less than human, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Chewbacca, and the darling robots C-3PO and R2-D2. I wonder how fascinating it would've been for Chewy, 3PO and R2 to have arcs the way the humans did. After all, humans seem to be the minority in this galaxy: In this sixth and consummate episode in the Star Wars saga, we meet various inimitable characters, including the implacable Jabba the Hutt, who is like a goiter that was possessed with a life of its own and grew and took control as an evil leader of other strange beasts; the adorable, fuzzy Ewoks, the mammalian aborigines of the forest moon of Endor; a terrifying desert monster made of sand and teeth, and obnoxious little rodent creatures that hasten across the corners of the frame. And there is an admiral for the Alliance who's like a sapient dinosaur who began a career as a general and statesman. These are the most intriguing characters, to me, anyway, which is never more apparent to me in the original trilogy than in Jedi, with its overtly trite soap opera passages between Han, Luke and Leia that resemble General Hospital more than anything else.",

""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" the Empire, including loyal servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) preparing to welcome the Emperor to the new Death Star battle station, being rebuilt and more powerful than the last. Meanwhile, on the planet of Tatooine, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are representing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) by a message, and trying to convince Jabba the Hutt to release Han Solo from being frozen in carbonate, but he does not listen. Disguised Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) does release Han, and Luke shows up, having to face a giant monster, but the eventually escape with the help of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and Leia strangles Jabba to death. Luke quickly returns to the Degobah system to see master Yoda (voiced and performed by The Muppets' Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) where he confirms Darth Vader is Luke's father, and he speaks of another Skywalker, before naturally dying. This other Ben (Obi-Won) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) says is Luke's sister, and he realises it's Leia. When they get back to the Rebels, they see the plan to destroy the shield generators of the new Death Star (from plans) by destroying the satellite on the planet Endor. Meanwhile, after a little rapid speed hover craft chase and meeting the cute and cuddly (for kids) Ewoks, Luke tells Leia of his revelation, before leaving to face Vader. He hands himself in to the Empire, and soon enough, Vader takes him to the psychopathic Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). As the battle between the Rebels and Empire goes on outside, and the Emperor convinces him of his friends being in danger, Luke eventually catches his light sabre to have a fight with Darth Vader, and release the Dark Side that the Emperor wants to see. Eventually, Han, Leia and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) knock out the satellite power, and Lando in the Millennium Falcon head for the centre of the Death Star. Luke ends the fight after cutting his father's hand off, and refuses to join the Dark Side, to which the Emperor starts electrocuting him with his Syth power. Darth Vader has a sudden change of heart though when he grabs the still electrocuting Emperor and tosses him off the edge. In his dying moments, he asks Luke to take his mask off so he can see him with his own eyes, and you see why he wheres the mask, and then he dies. Lando meanwhile reach the centre, blow it up, Luke gets away just in time, and the Death Star explodes. The ending has Darth Vader, or Anakin Skywalker rather, cremated, and everyone having fun at the concluding party, where Luke sees all three people that have helped him, the ghosts of Ben, Yoda, and of course, his father. Also starring Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound.

Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is prisoner to Jabba the Hutt, so Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and friends (R2-D2, C3P0, Leia) set out to rescue him. After a successful mission, Han and Leia lead a band of Rebels to the moon of Endor where the second Death Star is being protected by a force field, whilst Luke tries to bring Darth Vader back from the dark side of the force. The long awaited last film of the Star Wars universe ends well but falters slightly on the way. Strong detail and a quick drive pushes the plot forward, hitting a bump when the Ewoks make their appearance. Han and Leia's mission's halted by the furry little creatures, spoiling what we want to see with what George Lucas wants us to see. The humans' story is sacrificed by the Ewok's screen time. At least a spectacular big space battle and Luke's personal endeavor compensates for the events on Endor. One small blip won't trouble the fans too much.",

The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters.

276,7 April 2020,deloudelouvain,7, Finally a story that improves the more they make movies about it.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, and the Empire Strikes Back it's now time for Return Of The Jedi. I thought A New Hope was the weakest one, okay it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but the truth is that the later ones are just of better quality in every domain. the Empire Strikes Back was already a bit better and so is Return Of The Jedi but still not of the same quality as the others. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1983 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One that I thought was of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the eighth movie of eleven in barely 72 hours for me, next one today will be the series The Mandalorian as I saw they recommend you to watch it between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens if you want to watch it in chronological order. I'm sure the quality will be even better as it's so more recent, looking forward to it.",

That final scene between Vader and Luke is the most touching scene ever and the saddest for me it's worse than seeing Old Yeller get shot or watching Bambi's Mom buy the farm when I was a youngster. I guess the point was that no matter how evil or unscrupulous a person is they can always be saved if not in this world then the next. The Emperor is so unfathomably twisted it's sick he's worse than the Wicked Witch of the West, the Evil Stepmother, and that kid from the Omen all rolled into one. But damn he's so cool. I guess that's why he's in every Star Wars movie except ""A New Hope"". Lucas probably had a field day dreaming him up. I still can't understand why he didn't make the top ten villain list he deserves a spot no doubt about it in my mind. Maybe since the last three they will realize they have made a mistake and put him in. He's a really good actor probably the most talented of the bunch.

280,28 March 2013,StevePulaski,7, A fitting conclusion to a masterful franchise,"After the technological innovation that was the original 1977 space opera Star Wars, and its convention-defying, unbelievably dark sequel The Empire Strikes Back, my expectations for the conclusion of the iconic franchise, Return of the Jedi, were soaring into galaxies far, far away. Not long after, I fell back to Earth somewhat wowed but considerably disappointed. Return of the Jedi is a solid end to the franchise, competent, alleviating, and without a doubt, intriguing, but simultaneously bland and underwhelming. To, yet again, quote Dante Hicks from the everlasting Clerks, ""all Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."" Of course, that's a vast oversimplification of what the film really features, but it's not an inaccurate statement. The last thing I ever expected to call a Star Wars picture is artificial-looking, but it must be said. Occasionally, the film will have points of sheer beauty and marvellous technology. Consider the briskly-paced sequence where Luke and Leia race through the forestry, evading a slew of enemies closely on their tale. Yet, frequently, much of the film looks like it was shot on the backlots of studios where the presence of a fully-designed set was dually noted. The mystifying qualities about space's contents and other-worldly galaxies seems to have been traded for modestly-interesting scenes, confined to solid land mimicking that of a forest preserve. It looks good. Not beautiful.",
281,2 June 2020,Ruskington,6, Well at least the Ewoks are cute,"Another fairly boring and massively overhyped sequel. The quality of acting is very poor and the narrative takes on an almost soap-opera feel at times. The special effects are generally pretty average as well and have certainly have gone backwards since the original. Overall, I just don't find the Star Wars triology to be a particularly interesting story. It's littered with flat characters, terribly executed battle scenes and extremely corny dialogue. Plus the Stormtroopers must be the most pathetic villains in the history of cinema. Did they land a single shot in any of these movies?",

In many aspects, its status equals its chronological rank, but that doesn't say much.

286,29 April 2006,tom-darwin,6," Pompous, Ponderous Cuteness","The last ""Star Wars"" sequel avoids some, but not all, of the pitfalls that the series had so deftly steered around before. Luke (Hamill) must rescue his friend Solo (Ford) & foil the Empire's latest diabolical plot while facing down the demons in his own heritage. ""Return"" undermines one of the great strengths of the series--the excellence of its villains-- by introducing not one but TWO new ubervillains. One is the Emperor himself (McDiarmid), an arthritic, dermatoligically challenged fugitive from ""Kung Fu,"" while the other, wholly unrelated badguy is the giant, sexually depraved worm (yes, really a worm) Jabba the Hut. After slowly building a tough damsel-in-distress under her enveloping costumes in the first two films, Carrie Fisher is reduced to a harem-girl plaything for the huge, slimy puppet Jabba, which has to be some kind of record-setting low for an actress. Hamill, though talented, doesn't have the presence to be an epic hero while Ford is mostly reduced to comic relief. Much of the film is taken up by events on the planet Endor, a Disney Adventureland inhabited by teddy bears. Except for the rousing theme carried over from the earlier films, John Williams's music is heavy & ponderous to the point of parody. Still, ""Star Wars"" is about spectacular, heroic action & ""Return"" delivers, with the opening battle on Tattooine & the climactic space fleet action making up for the mushy molasses of Endor. Billy Dee Williams helps take up any heroic slack left by Hamill & Ford. As with the rest of the series, ""Return"" isn't science fiction but outer-space fantasy adventure, so forgive any pretense of technological or social commentary. ""Return"" is aimed at devotees of the ""Star Wars"" but is still an enjoyable thrill ride for anyone.",

A good conclusion to one of the most well know sagas of all time.

It's a very pleasing finale to one of the most renowned trilogies of all time, it ties up all the loose ends perfectly, while still being its own original story, having the majority of the film set on a planet that isn't seen or mentioned in the previous films was a clever move, and the Ewoks are a fun and lovable addition to the series. There's only two problems I have with the movie, one is that we never really see the main characters in too much danger, in the Empire Strikes Back the villains have the upper hand for the majority of the movie, but here it feels like Luke Skywalker always does, we never feel frightened or worried for him or his associates as it always seems that they have dominance over Vader, I also felt like the movie tried to be too cute with the Ewoks, with long shots of them silly running around and doing something adorable, I do like these characters but I felt like this was overdone at times and took away from the story too much. There are a lot of characters to follow in this franchise and it seemed like a tough job for any writer to have to wrap up all of their story arcs in just two hours, but hats off to George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, who did so here perfectly with the significant and even smaller characters, and also managed to never make it feel cluttered or rushed. Though it may not live up to its predecessors, Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a great finale to a terrific trilogy, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure film or sci-fi.

While it would be dishonest to remark that I share in the unabashed, unchecked and often maddening enthusiasm for the films that others certainly have, I cannot say I disliked them and the way ""Return of the Jedi"" rounded off loose ends; did well to keep fresh characters who might otherwise have become tiresome and told its own narrative, was satisfying.",

However, after all these years, when I watch this film, I can't help but notice all kinds of flaws. The most glaring one is the confrontation between Vader and Luke. The premise of the confrontation is that the Emperor hopes to turn Luke to the 'dark side'. However, he never becomes tempted, which renders the whole thing pointless. Of course, there is the other plot line, namely the attempt by Luke to bring his father back, and that does provide some emotional payoff, but it doesn't save the film.
The best part of ROTJ is actually its first act, in Jabba's palace. The plot becomes rather confusing and ridiculous here, but no one cares, because it's just too much fun to watch. The rest of the film is quite entertaining, though it never gets as original as it does in act one.",

314,16 February 2016,mdenvee,1," JEDI: Following a sad, predictable pattern of 3rd installments...","Before saying anything else- anyone who felt the prequels or recent Force Awakens films were even remotely watchable, please stop reading. You people are just unable to understand why ROTJ was so terrible (just as I am not able to understand astrophysics). In a nutshell, ROTJ has all the usual bad elements in a sequel and none of the good (aside from improved special effects). How anyone can mention this film in the same breath as the first two is beyond me or anyone who has any objectivity about this trilogy. The two biggest problems were the acting and story/script. The acting seems wooden and emotionless, Ford seems like he doesn't want to be there at all, Luke is monotone and boring, Leia looks and sounds worn out. I felt Lando and the Emperor did a good job (they seemed actually part of the movie). The script for everyone was repetitive, unoriginal, no comic relief or wit, and far less intelligent- and if fans can't see this, then as I said, they are simply unable to perceive/observe these details- not everyone can. Story line- poor. Half the film takes place rescuing Han, and while I enjoyed the segment concept, it was hugely overlong, and irrelevant to the main theme. The story and backdrops were also terribly unoriginal and repetitive. We spend half the movie on Tatooine (like the First film) and then half the movie in a very standard earth-like forest like Yavin (first film). The return of the same death star threat also, while not terrible, worsened the banality as did its demise by blowing it up similarly like the first film- yawn. Chronology was also hugely erroneous- In Empires, Lando & Chewie leave to go to Jabba's to rescue Han. Yet, Luke is somehow a virtual Jedi in a matter of days or weeks. I thought it takes years to become a Jedi- and who would have trained Luke since he returns to Yoda to ""continue the training"" after confronting Vader. This anachronism makes the audience feel like Lucas thinks we are stupid (maybe we are). Now, the biggest flaws of the film are the detail errors (from beginning to end): why did Jabba permit Leia to unfreeze Han when Jabba enjoyed him as a wall decoration? Why did Luke attempt to clumsily attack Jabba with a gun from the holster of a guard? Did he actually think he could single handed defeat all of Jabba's guards? How could Leia strangle Jabba with a chain? He's enormous and she's frail. With all of the forces of the Rebellion, why did they only rely on 4 of them to rescue Han from Jabba- risky, no? Why not send an army or have a larger force waiting outside once Luke and Lando infiltrate? And actually, why didn't Lando unfreeze Han since he was already under cover? Please. Why did they have a door closing panel on the 'inside' of the monster dungeon that Luke threw a rock at? Why would being ""digested for 1000 years"" be scary when you'd be dead in moments once swallowed? Why were the languages spoken at Jabba's so dumb sounding- ""wonga wonga""? Why does C3PO have so much trouble speaking a common Jabba dialect? For an interpreter of 6 million languages, he sounds like he is stumbling for the words all the time he speaks another language. Why are the creatures at Jabba's so juvenile looking? Absolutely stupid and silly compared to the sinister creatures in Star Wars. Speaking of which, the Ewoks really were silly- perhaps if they were not such a huge part of the movie! So, watching little people wearing teddy bear costumes for over an hour speaking in the least convincing dumb-sounding Ewok language was hard to bear, and listening to C3PO storytelling put me to sleep. Seeing Yoda on death's bed in ROTJ yet seeing him spry and jumping around like a teenager in Empires just shows how bad the errors in the timeline are in this film- and he just happens to die exactly when Luke arrives? Then the story line of Luke actually thinking he could 'turn' Vader just by approaching him and asking is completely delusional. What did Luke think was going to happen? Even a jedi would have a bit of trouble escaping alive from the Emperor and Vader on the Death Star. So why risk it as the last living Jedi??? Not plausible. Then let's fast forward to watching a Super Star destroyer (5 miles long) have a single fighter hit it and make it veer into the Death Star? Really? That's like a seagull hitting an aircraft carrier and sinking it. STUPID. Also, if you look at the scale of the Super Star Destroyer and the surface of the Death Star that it impacts on, the Death Star looks like it's a million times the mass of the Super Star Destroyer- not likely. And since when was it so close to the Death Star??? Wasn't it much, much farther away staying out of the conflict? What is most pointless is the fact that Luke could have avoided going to the Death Star and avoided Vader killing the Emperor and just watch as the Death Star gets ultimately blown up, killing but the Emperor. Redundant. Lastly, just because the Emperor is killed off, what about the thousands of Imperial ships and Destroyers, millions of storm troopers, and I'm sure plenty of high powered corrupt Senate officials and other bureaucrats who would obviously take over control? This movie ironically had literally all the movie making resources at its disposal. That may also ironically be exactly why this movie sucked- Lucas had way too much influence in it and not reigned in by smarter producers and co-writers and directors. Lucas may have succumbed to the hype of his own cult status and started to believe his infallibility and just couldn't imagine ROTJ could possibly end up being anything but amazing. He was wrong.",

Jedi, is also a great film, though is definitely not on a par with the first two installments of the original Star Wars trilogy. The story is still good, and George Lucas' character development is still superb, but Jedi is still slightly 'less good' than episodes IV and V. Maybe its the Ewoks- Lucas' idea of the determination of primitive civilization to topple the mighty empire seems less of a good idea today. Maybe it's the fact that Darth Vader, so anonimously evil in the first two films, is revealed. Maybe it's just the fact that everything fits together seamlessly, and the dawning realisation is that it's all coming to an end. Perhaps the answer is with the force.

Return of the Jedi is the movie that ends all drama for Star Wars fans. The characters in this movie gets bigger; I remember Jabba The Hutt from the 4th installment, then there's The Ewoks of Endor. Lando Calrissian(Billy Dee Williams) went from Bespin outcast, into a General for the Rebels to fight against the Empire. The Rancor monster in Jabba's pit was very fierce. And Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) was elegant in that metallic bikini when she was the slave of Jabba. Of course, she made him limp and lifeless when Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) jumps into action. The final showdown between Darth and Luke is a classic. Luke shows he is much stronger than his father when he became a Jedi. He didn't give in to the Dark Side of the Force. After Darth tossed the Emperor down the shaft, he became Anakin again; wounded, humbled, and redeemed. Seeing Luke with his own eyes was the sign of redemption and the facts are revealed. That part was a little sad that Anakin died, but he was with the Force again, and he joins the other Jedis. I would rather be a Jedi than a Sith, any day!

There wasn't much of a drama, romance or relief. And it had a certain sense of boredom all over it. The movie is divided into 2 halves; the first is an adventure one that reminded me of Tarzan's movies in the 1940s, and the second was a pure war of a movie, running semi-randomly and uninterestingly for most of the time (20 years later, The Matrix Revolution would fall in the same mistake).

However, there is a lot of good stuff here and it does tie a lot of things together. The film originally could have gone in a different direction with it's original working title Revenge Of The Jedi. Luke does appear to be well on his way to the dark side, dressed entirely in black and uses his force powers for much more than ""knowledge and defense"" when he slaughtered fifty or so people on Jabba's sail barge. The warm and fuzzy corniness of the Ewoks is balanced out with sometimes having a darker tone that was prevalent on Empire.

Star Wars is an every day phrase now, and it's hard to find someone who hasn't at least heard of it, and the force. Blending real life morals (I'm not getting into the theological side of Star Wars) with outer-world settings, with sweeping action and emotion Return of the Jedi provides exactly what this third installment needed, closure. If the other trilogies hadn't happened, these three films would be among the elites of all trilogies.

374,11 April 2005,baquepaque,5, A weak film - very disappointing,"I am baffled by the high ratings this film has received. It is actually quite weak, suffering from poor directing, a weak script with stupid (not corny) dialog and improbable situations. Enter the Ewoks, and the whole series ends in a blaze Toys-R-Us glory. The only story line of interest is the one pitting Luke against his father, but unfortunately Mark Hamill is not up to the task. The script calls for him to mourn the loss of Yoda, appeal to a (supposedly) conflicted Vader, fearlessly face the Emporer, be the matured, slightly aloof Jedi to his swashbuckling Solo and Calrisian, but until the very end, when Hamill finally pulls out all the stops, it is simply difficult to accept him as a mature jedi knight. The final fight between Luke, Vader and the Emporer is well-staged and beautifully shot. Unfortunately, one must traverse a lot of goofy material to get there, beginning with Jabba the Hut, who is wonderfully realized but his den of thieves and vagrants comes across more as a children's version of Ali Baba. The standout performance is Dave Prowse/James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, while Carrie Fisher is obviously looking forward to wrapping the series and getting on with her career, as it were. But enough. This film does not warrant deep analysis. A disappointing ending to what could have been one of the most compelling film series in historic. After 20+ years it still hurts.",
375,27 July 2004,mentalcritic,9, Underrated...,"By 1983, the market had become so saturated with Star Wars and science fiction clones that programs were beginning to fail left and right. Even the mighty Doctor Who was faltering under the weight of its own canon, and new ideas had become thin on the ground. Many people criticise Return Of The Jedi as suffering from creative burnout, or Lucas getting too offended that the best film in his series has been the one he had the least amount of control over. There's a certain level of truth to this theory, but when you strip back the Hollywood politics and look at the story, you simply see Lucas being Lucas.",

377,26 November 2015,sharky_55,8, You already have saved me.,"Return of the Jedi has the conclusion of the trilogy's Skywalker and Darth Vader's redemption at its core, which nevertheless does not save it from being the weakest of the trilogy. In many moments, it seems to echo its previous instalments, but with a lesser sense of wonder and escapism that Star Wars first wowed audiences with, and which Empire improved upon. There is another intergalactic band entertaining at Jabba's palace, but although the design and costuming of the aliens is creative and often unique, the derivative jazz song is not nearly as memorable as the Cantina Band theme. In Tattoine we had endless deserts, twin suns, houses submerged blow ground to avoid the heat, sand creatures and scavengers roaming the cliffs...here we have a impressive looking sail barge and an imposing creature in the dirt, but it does not feel entirely otherworldly, and the conflict and threat (specifically the iconic Boba Fett) are quickly extinguished, and it does not feel nearly as engaging as the Battle on Hoth. I point to a different little moment that expresses the world of Star Wars more effectively; as Jabba's rancor beast is killed, its handler emerges and sobs at this personal loss, and this is something which we can all identify with, and speaks volumes of the depth of Lucas' universe.

380,30 April 2020,fmarkland32,10, A more innocent time.,"Luke finishes his Jedi training with Yoda to confront the Emperor, reach out to Darth Vader and save Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba The Hut. If I was honest in my criticism, I'd give this probably a 3 star rating as it is a little bit weaker than the two before it. Also the narrative is a tad disjointed as the beginning is Luke trying to rescue Han Solo, then you get the final training montage, then the Ewoks and then finally the confrontation. All of this works reasonably well, but it feels like you need to have seen the first two to understand the full scale of what is happening. My point is, it's a great sequel, but not as strong as a stand alone. That said, who cares? This sequel is the most character driven and has a lot of heart. There are two tragic death scenes that are moving and an epic light saber showdown climax that probably features the best action sequences in the series. Again, I was not at all disappointed in 1983, and like the others took my wife to rerelease in the 90s, because, sure I loved The Terminator, Rambo and Bruce Lee, but Star Wars was and always will be the cornerstone of my childhood.",

Just before he expires, Yoda tells Luke that he's close to being a full fledged Jedi and that to complete his training he must thwart Darth Vader once and for all and that there's another Skywalker. There's just one problem, which Yoda finally confirms: Vader IS Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker. It is here that the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi comes clean about Luke's dad, that O himself was very impressed with Anakin when he met him and arrogantly believed that he could train Anakin as well as Yoda. Big mistake. Luke doesn't want to fight Vader knowing that he's his father, but Obi-Wan tells him that saving Vader's soul is a lost cause: ""He's more machine now, than man. Twisted and evil."" Then another bombshell is dropped - Leia is Luke's sister.",

383,26 December 2000,stamper,9, What a miraculous thing...,"happened when I saw this movie again. I, who actually always had not understood why so many people like this film a lot better then The Empire strikes Back finally understood it. I mean I had seen this film about seven or eight times before, but when I saw it again, I realized what a great film this is. I'd immediately have given it a ten out of ten if it wouldn't have been for the beginning of the film, which I think sucks a bit. First of all I do not like that singing performance in the beginning that much, but that is not what bothered me. What really bothered me were the bad, bad, bad effects in the Rancor vs. Luke fighting scene. The bad effects draw all the attention to them than to focus it on the action and that was so bad no 10 can ever be given by me to this film. Apart from that this film is just one enormous accumulation of excitement, fun, action, emotion, surprises and twists which will not let you out of it's grip until the end. All this is held together by the performances of the great cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Billy Dee Williams (Lando) , Clive Revill (Emperor Palpatine) and the Voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. As you may have noticed during my other reviews I really like Harrison Ford as Han Solo most but I must say my other personal favorite is Carrie Fisher as the Princess who does not mind to get her hands dirty. This (again) does not mean I do not like the other characters, as a matter of fact I like them all, but these two have the biggest amount of memorable scenes together. My other favorite pair in this trilogy (mostly due to this film) would (of course) be Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.",

385,26 December 2015,barbagvido,9, Almost a masterpiece,"Now this is an unpopular opinion, but I think this movie is a little bit better than A New Hope. A New Hope was a very good movie, but something felt missing there. The Empire Strikes Back was a masterpiece, and this one is also very good, but flawed. I think almost everyone agrees that the main problem here are the Ewoks, like I do. They are cute little fellas and everything, but they just don't fit into this movie and makes the story too light- hearted while it's actually pretty serious and it is shown in parts with Luke, Vader and the Emperor, and I think that part is a bit underused. Seriousness is what this movie lacks. Not to be completely dark and serious, but more like the previous movie, and the Ewoks don't help. And it's also laughable how easily can Stormtroopers be killed. I mean, like, Ewoks beat them down in a few seconds. What??? Luckily, those were the only bad sides here. Humor works really good for the most of the time, especially with C-3PO and R2-D2. I love them. The action is well done as always and while there are many goofy and light-hearted parts of the movie, it has some very serious parts which I mentioned above that are really well done. Luke Skywalker has really developed as a character and now he's one of the coolest characters in the franchise. Here we also get to see a more human side of Darth Vader and he has never felt so vulnerable, especially with the arrival of the new big bad:The Emperor. The actor who is playing him (I can't remember the name, I'm really sorry) was so awesome. Just the way he moves, the way he speaks, his face expressions, everything was just great and just enough not to be goofy and that's one of the best performances in the series. Overall, this is a satisfying fast-paced finale of the original trilogy, and while not as good ad it's predecessor, and considered by many people to be the weakest in the original trilogy is still a great movie and one more timeless classic.",

I am not sure anyone contemplated that the next 40 years would deliver a series of new and continuous projects around the Star Wars character and properties. This one held up. It is not the best or the worst of the Star Wars films. It has some great moments and some great emotional content. It held up on the big screen, and while there are not many changes or additions the film seems enhanced, rather than aged-so it looks good.

Anyway, back to Episode VI. The SFX, basically unchanged since the first film 6 years earlier, are by now beginning to pale in comparison to other films, yet somehow, they are still adequate for this one. This film also marked the end of our now-familiar characters, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia. Lucas sure left us hanging at the end of this one.

Return of the Jedi did manage to bring a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. It offers an emotional story while still Showing the Craftsmanship and Action that Star Wars Set the bar for a New Age of Sci-fi. In many ways the film does film more streamlined in the sense it doesn't have as many sets. The film does make up for that by having the Scenes stand out. Jabba's Palace with its more somber tone, reminiscences of the cantina in New hope. Endor with the final battle does manage to still mix a fair amount of action. It does have its problems one of the most notable being the Ewoks you either love or hate these things and it does fair of the film given how relevant they are to the final battle. It is a bit lazy for the goal to blow up the death star again. However, the action when it happens it still some of the most entertaining moments put to screen. Same with speeder bike on Endor with John Williams music accompanying it immerses you in this universe. The movie is without the funniest out of the three, and honestly, there's nothing wrong with that.

Anyway, Return of the Jedi is definitely up to par with the first two (not counting Ep. 1). Though it may lack in a FEW places, it still is as great of a movie to have the words Star Wars in the title. My favorite parts are all the ones with Emperor Palpatine, the whole beginning involving Jabba the Hutt, and the fight scene at the end. I don't know why everyone hates the ewoks. They are a great touch to the Star Wars series. Besides, you need some charm in the final chapter in the series, just like you need some charm in the first chapter in the series (hint, hint: don't hate Jar Jar). ROTJ has classic moments in it, just like the others. Take the sarlacc for example, or the rancor. Those scenes have just as much in it for a true classic moment that the space slug did, or the sand people.

To me the worst is ""empire strikes back"" cause it's too much of a bridging movie having a loose start and end. Return of the jedi gives us the most spectacular images filmed on a truly epic scale with some classic moments in it. In the end, the series should be watched as a whole though and not as seperate movies but with this cast it couldn't have gone wrong anyway. Han Solo is simply the most enjoyable character ever to have appeared on the big screen and whenever Darth Vader is once again dispatching another one of his minions it remains ever so funny.",

The special and visual effects were magnificent and like usual the cast were great like before. The duel scenes between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is one of the most memorable and greatest fights I have ever see. The second Star Wars film is my favorite but this comes extremely close and I don't know it might just be tied with The Empire Strikes Back. The movie was just fantastic. I can't wait for the upcoming new Star Wars film The Revenge of the Sith and this old version trilogy is just simply one of the best trilogies ever made. God bless you George Lucas!,

For the second time in a role, George Lucas returns as the film's screenwriter and producer, but turns the directorial duties over to another film-maker - this time Englishman Richard Marquand (who's most notable film up to that date had been 1978's lackluster THE LEGACY). While he lacks the thunderous cliffhanger charm and the somber literate quality that Lucas and Irvin Kershner respectively brought to the previous installments, Marquand proves to be quite proficient in the director's chair. Although the film doesn't re-imagine (or even revitalize) the genre the way the previous films did, it still proves to be a great space opera with plenty of highly memorable scenes and set pieces.",

But I've always enjoyed this film for its subplot featuring Jabba the Hutt, the cool speeder-bike chase, its epic space battle over Endor (which comes very close to being my favorite space battle of all films, second maybe only to the battle of Coruscant in Episode III), and most importantly, for showing the final confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. All of the major conflicts are resolved in this film once and for all, and regardless of how unlikely it is for the Ewoks to overcome the Empire, I find the final fight between Luke and Vader to be very invoking, and the final space battle to be very awesome.",

I've noted this in my other reviews of the original trilogy movies, but there have been many different versions of ""Return of the Jedi"" that have been released through the years, and I believe that it's important to denote which version that I watched. I think that the original ""Star Wars"" has fared the worst through these re-edits, particularly the Mos Eisley scenes. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is left pretty much unscathed, with only a few changes made for continuity's sake. ""Return of the Jedi"" really only contains one change that I can't stand: the over-the-top inclusion of a CGI creature band in Jabba's palace. This fifteen second addition is just so out of place and weird. It doesn't really fit in at all with the rest of the scenes from Jabba's palace. I don't really mind the inclusion of planets introduced in the prequel movies to the ending. Some purists will disagree, but I think that it adds a lot of depth and scale to the universe of ""Star Wars."" I miss the Ewok celebration music, though.",

428,30 May 2008,johnnymacbest,8, Good but a little weak.,"Having enjoyed the first two films in the original trilogy, this one comes out slightly weaker of the bunch. Some plot points feel rushed and some scenes felt unnecessary and a little contrived but that doesn't make the film bad by any means whatsoever but there's no denying that it could've been more fleshed out in execution and style and I don't think I'm alone in my assessment. Some of the feeling of adventure is sorely missing in this film whether it's the script, dialog, or performances or it could be those damn Ewoks!!! The scenes on Endor are somewhat laughable and silly and stunts the film. ROTJ is good but its weakness lies in its storytelling and overall genuine awe.",

It tells the story of Luke Skywalker's final confrontation with the evil Darth Vader. This has the most complicated and darkest plot out of all the Star Wars films besides episode III, which makes it a lot more enjoyable to watch.

But still this is a really good movie and a perfect cap on the series. It resolves everything, and ends on a triumphant note. Some of my favorite parts are the final 3 way fight scenes with Leia and Han fighting on endor, Lando fighting a fleet of star cruisers while trying to blow up the Death Star, and Luke fighting Vader and the emporor on the death star. Another thing that lingers in my mind is the sound of the speeder bikes as they fly past.

I think the main reason why is so looked down is the fact that is not as historic as the New Hope and Empire ,but it just ends with the story nicely. Where is the problem with that? It is at least twenty times better from Spiderman 3 or X-men the Last Stand ,which were the ends of their own trilogies, but we all know how bad and disappointing they were and everyone wants to forget them, where as the previous two are well loved by all.

456,30 November 2003,ecatalan98,8, Decent Ending of Fabulous Saga,"I think most Star Wars fans agree that ""Return Of The Jedi"" could have been a better film. I think the marketing forces involved here had to broaden up the appeal of the film...to kids! Lucas tends to forget that, those of us who were 10 or 12 years old when we first saw the original Star Wars, were 16-18 years old by the time of Jedi. And I'm talking about the die hard fans; those of us that only like Star Wars films more as time passes by. For those fans, we would have liked a bit more depth of characters, a better dialoge. In this movie, Harrison Ford's part felt sort of cut down as was Carrie Fisher's. The Ewoks were ok, but many fans felt they were both: comic relief and a marketing ploy for future toys. Although I've read many comments complaining how Luke's character was never explored fully emotionally, many people tend to forget that Darth Vader also went through some second thoughts of his own, and those feelings could have been explored a bit more towards the end. The final confrontation was good and the complaints I have are mostly with the changing of actors. This would have been David Prowse' shining hour (He played the physical Vader; His voice was James Earl Jones'). Why this happened will always be open to debate. The effects, as always, pushed up the ante and laid the groundwork for contemporary effects. That said, ""Return"" is no let down by any means and should be viewed as a decent ending to a fabulous saga.",

There is also the indigenous people on Endo Star, the panda's body shape, brown fur, so cute. Indigenous traps and jungle terrain also made the imperial soldiers lose more reasonable.

So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective.

We had to watch them worship C-3PO and watch them throw rocks at storm troopers. The rest of the movie was cool. The chase on the speeders in the forest. The sand-pit with Jabba. The final battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The destruction of the new Death Star. Those parts were cool. Forget everything else. Buy the Special Edition and look at the added stuff.

Luke battles his father, Darth Vader. In 1977, Darth Vader was the epitome of evil, the devil himself. We accepted Luke, Leia and Han Solo as the focus of the story. As the story progressed, we see that the story is really about Anakin, that Vader is really a nice guy who made some bad choices. I had a problem with this. I think Anakin/Vader's redemption took something away. I also fail to see where John Williams' music is special.",

Seriously? This slowly begun the downfall of George Lucas. I know that Yoda said in ESB, ""size matters not"" but here its not just the size, its the weapons they possess. The idea of stormtroopers getting whopped by Ewoks is just totally unbelievable. It doesn't make much sense. ",

Return Of The Jedi is the joyous conclusion the original Star Wars trilogy deserved.Sue it has Ewoks,but come on guys,they weren't that bad.People are always banging on about how the Ewoks single handedly took down the mighty Empire but if you actually consider what happens all the little fur balls actually managed to do was to create a diversion so Han Solo and co can get the upper hand on the forest moon allowing the real battle to ensue in space.The Vader/Luke/Emperor face off is also incredibly powerful,i think people have seen it that many times they have just got teddy bear tunnel vision and forget what really makes the film tick.I say Return Of The Jedi is a fitting finale to cinemas best loved trilogy,it complements Empire beautifully and sees our heroes united and victorious.10/10",

469,27 November 2015,samgiannn,8, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983),"I've finally come to the finale of the original trilogy, and although I still can't say I'm a huge fan of the franchise, I've really enjoyed all three of the original Star Wars films, even if there are glaring flaws that no one seems to talk about. Of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi definitely has the most noticeable problems, but it does end the series in a suitably ambitious and entertaining fashion. In Return of the Jedi, the Galactic Empire is building a second Death Star to finally destroy the Rebel Alliance, and Emperor Palpatine is personally overseeing the project. The Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack onto the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill Palpatine. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker attempts to bring Darth Vader out of the Dark Side of the Force. The action scenes in Episode VI are a bit more inconsistent than in the other movies, but I have to mention the speeder bike chase scenes. It's without a doubt my favorite scene in the series so far because it's so fast-paced, well shot and intense. It was definitely the highlight of the movie. One of the weaker action scenes was a bizarre set piece with the Ewoks. The entire scene was just awkward; I find it hard to believe that a primitive race of small hairy creatures armed with sticks could defeat the Imperial stormtroopers. Return of the Jedi also didn't improve on the cheesy father-son plot from The Empire Strikes Back. Watching Luke pitifully try to convince Darth Vader to step away from the Dark Side was groan-inducing. Nevertheless, the strengths of the Star Wars series are still on full display here. The utter imagination and detail put into the universe is incredible, and the film is just as exciting as its predecessors. Return of the Jedi isn't as competent as the previous films, but it is a satisfying and sporadically rousing conclusion.",

It has to wrap up what was, at the time, the most impressive trilogy of films in the history of cinema. It had to follow Empire Strikes Back. All loose ends had to be tied, and be a cathartic conclusion. What's impressive is that it handles such mammoth tasks admirably, and is for the most part let down only by odd choices and vast ambition.",

While not as powerful as the first two, Return of the Jedi does not fail to entertain. The film is imaginative just like all the other Star Wars films with enough new special effects to hold our eyes on the screen. The plot makes sense and delivers the same fun punch as the previous films. Seeing the characters evolve over the three films is a pleasure and the trilogy ends nicely here, we feel resolved by the film's happy energy, which is the best way to end a saga. In chorus with its predecessors, it remains a strong piece of storytelling and special effects.",

473,25 October 2019,MrPupkin,8," It falls short of the first two, but it's still a satisfying end to the classic trilogy.","This is definitely one of my favorites! While not like Empire Strikes Back it's still great! The Emperor is shown in person and even though he is a frail old man he is also very dangerous! Darth Vader also is really good as he is more emotional as he struggles between dark and light! This is the second great one after Empire Strikes Back!

To achieve such a level of special effects under such brief conditions at the time was truly astonishing. But as far as the plot is concerned, the first three films are not very good models.

It's the only one that really never gets boring, while the other ones were. It's the only one that has a really good, emotional sword fight. The only thing that disappointed me was that there was again a Death Star to destroy, and the Ewoks were indeed annoying.

This time the Galactic Empire's forces lead by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse acting with James Earl Jones's voice) has again build a Death Star and is still out to destroy the Rebel Alliance.

True, it's not as inventive or as original as the first two films, but the STAR WARS was just too hokey and hard to enjoy when you watch it today, and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was way too dark and sometimes even boring. This one has the best action and leaves you with a satisfied feeling unlike EMPIRE. This is one of the best sci-fi fantasy films ever made, and extremely enjoyable to watch.",
478,15 August 2015,kirtan99,9, My favourite in the entire series,I gotta admit I never grew up when Star Wars first came out but It has not changed how much I love this Saga. This episode is one of my favourites. I love the ending but do not prefer the beginning. I wish this had the beginning of episode 4 and had this ending. It is a great introduction to jabba the hut and is an awesome sequel Although not a better one to episode 5 the empire strikes back. Honestly many people hate the ewoks but they are cute and deadly. It Is stupid how they do kill storm troopers by throwing stones and arrows. Seriously consider how stupid and useless their armour is I don't believe stormtroopers are useless because they kill many Rebels and took over the ship at the beginning of episode 4.,
479,18 August 2008,gritfrombray-1,8, Good finish,"Liked this movie but it lacked the class of the previous two episodes. The Tatooine rescue was well executed but a wee predictable. I liked the scenes between Luke and Yoda. The way Yoda evades the questions that Luke asks him was well written. The Ewoks were a mistake though. Furballs are Spielberg's department... But the battle in space above Endor was superb and Anakin fulfilling the Chosen One's destiny and completing the legacy of being the one to destroy the Sith was perfectly in line with the story started in the prequels. Was a little taken aback by the 'Skywalker family connection' but the prequels have tied this all up. The celebrations at the end were superb. Listen closely for a Gungan shouting 'Wesa Free!', a brilliant tie to the prequels. The extended Rebel celebrations were brilliant too, and we get to see Luke and Wedge, Lucas's token survivor through the entire trilogy, shaking hands and then embracing, completing the circle from episode IV. In all honesty though, the trilogy went out on a brilliant note and the legacy started had been fulfilled, and Anakin's story came to an end who was what the story was really all about",

Not like in Empire Strikes Back, in this film Dart Vader looks kinda weak, but that wasn't disappointing to me because I really started to care about characters and what's going on to them, so by watching this film, I kinda felt sorry for Darth Vader. Jabba was also different this time, it looked kinda dangerous and was an unlikable character, though in The New Hope he looked like a better person.

488,27 December 1999,Sharkey360,6, More of show than soul.,"The third film of the series unfortunately had less magic in it when compared to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. For instance, there was an obvious drop on both character expression and development along with a huge increase of special effects. The film was more of show than soul most of the time. However, I could not think of a better way for the story to go and maintain the soul The Empire Strikes Back formulated before this film. George Lucas did his best and I accept that. Among the best things I liked here was the Emperor's presence (he is VERY evil), Darth Vader presence until the end, the Ewoks and the special effects. Return of the Jedi's a great film overall, though a step lower from Empire.",

490,6 June 2019,dejongfloris,10, Equally great as its predecessors,I think the movie is just as great as the empire strikes back and Star Wars. People complain about ewoks but there were also rebels fighting the empire and chewie stole an AT-ST so then the rebels and ewoks became stronger. And further it has the greatest space battle of all time. And the music is still great. And the ending is very satisfying and touching.,

492,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,8," ""Obi-Wan has taught you well...""","The final chapter of the Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi has a difficult job: wrap up most story lines, produce one final epic battle sequence, and go much deeper into the mythology that is the force. The movie accomplishes each of those tasks fine, and though unfair, when comparing ""Jedi"" versus the other two films, it's the weakest. That's not to say it's a poor film, to the contrary it is still most entertaining, but the slow pace to the beginning of the movie takes away from the high energy that ""Empire Strikes Back"" ends on. If you'll recall, at the end of ""Empire,"" our heroes Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, and the droids are searching for Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who is being held by the gangster Jabba the Hutt. That's the warm up to the movie, the story line continuing Luke and Darth Vader is much more interesting and leads to the ultimate end of the movie and saga. One of my favorite scenes in all of movies comes at the end of ""Jedi,"" the final battle between Luke and Darth Vader, long-shots, big music, sends chills up my spine. The movie was intended to be directed by George Lucas' friend Steven Spielberg, but a union technicality nixed that idea, and little known Welsh-born director Richard Marquand does the job. We also get to see the sinister Emporer, played by Ian McDiarmid under layers and layers of makeup, he adds another piece to the force puzzle. Then there are the ewoks, those cute little made-for-merchandising furry creatures that occupy the middle of the movie. They're cute, but after the dark, adult themes of ""Empire,"" the ewoks evokes a kiddy charm that takes away from the maturity level of the Star Wars movies. I would have liked to see a planet of wookies over a planet of ewoks, but what do I know? A movie of power scenes, with silly ewoks in the middle, Return of the Jedi is a satisfactory and entertaining end to the Star Wars saga.",

502,5 May 2002,LuboLarsson,7, Not as good as previous two,"While ROTJ is not as good as Star Wars and The Empire strikes back it is however still very enjoyable. It does though in my opinion feel like a lesser remake of the original, but with the added bonus of a fantastic light sabre battle between Luke and his father Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker. This film is heavily centred on Luke so my favourite characer Han Solo seems to fade into the background, stuck in a rediculous battle with the Ewoks on Endor, including I kid you not a ""Tarzan yell"" from Chewbacca! how did that get in there? Still this is Star Wars after all so there is more plus points than minuses, the plus points include a great space battle and an amazing speedbike chase. Also the emperor makes a great baddie, but the unmasking of Darth Vader was a mistake and I hate the way they got rid of Boba Fett. To be hones The Empire Strikes Back was always going to be hard to top and they couldn't quite pull it off ***7/10**",

504,22 January 2020,l-24023,9, Fantastic,"Star Wars Return of the Jedi is the final film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It sums up the series and ties loose ends from the previous two movies. In the final movie of the trilogy we see George Lucas introduce an abundance of new characters throughout the film, such as the monster underneath Jabba the Hutt's lair, the kraken type sand monster, and the Ewoks.
In this final film of the trilogy we see the final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth vader. This battle was inevitable and everybody who had seen the two previous movies would know that this scene was coming. The way that Lucas decided to do this was wonderful and at the end of all of it he reveals the true face of Darth Vader and proves Luke's point earlier in the movie that his father still had good left in him. Throughout the entire film I was just thinking about what could happen next and it kept me locked in the whole time. Lucas found a perfect way to execute the plot of the film and by doing this it made the film that much better for the die hard Star Wars fans. The way that every scene was well thought out and led up to the ending of the film was perfection.
A key scene leading up to the end of the movie was when Luke went to go visit Yoda before he passed on. In this scene Luke gets closure about who his father is and who his sister is. This is one of the scenes from the film that ties loose ends from the previous two movies.
One negative thing I found within the film was that Yoda and Obi Wan Kinobi didn't have bigger roles. I was disappointed by this because of their roles in the previous two movies. In the eyes of die hard Star Wars fan this was seen as a little bit disrespectful and I was very disappointed by this.
The plot of the film leads up perfectly to the defeat of the emperor. It starts with Luke rescuing Princess Leia and Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt and then they go on too the planet where the death star power station where they meet the Ewok's and are nearly roasted to death by them. After this it's an uphill battle against the emperor and the dark side which is very entertaining and the battle scenes are very well played out, such as the battle between Luke and Vader. This scene was beautifully done and the different stages of the battle are amazing. The way that Lucas keeps the battle going and the dialogue throughout is special. It was the perfect way to end the ongoing battle between Vader and Luke. In the previous movie we see Luke have his arm chopped off by his father and he Doesn't end up getting killed by Vader. He had an opportunity to end it all their but since his father still had good in him he didn't. This is where Luke finds out that his father still has good in him and that's why he tries to pursue this relationship with his father because he knows with Vader on his side he will be able to defeat the emperor.
The scenery of the different planets throughout the movie is Beautiful and so well thought out by Lucas. It was as if he had visions of where the scene should be held and they were perfect. Another part of the movie that was executed very well was the music. Without music this movie would be terrible. The effect that music adds is incredible. Every fight seen when something is getting intense or it looks like the battle scene is going a different way the music help portray this.
In conclusion the movie Star Wars: Return of the Jedi was very well executed and was a perfect ending to one of the best trilogies known to humans. The plot sums up the ending perfectly while still maintaining the interesting battles and and cameos to characters throughout the movie.",

It is, unfortunately, rather predictable from about half-way through, and I must say it was almost disappointing to see Vader's conclusion. Though cute and cuddly those ewoks just don't add believability nor remain in consistency with the tone set from episode iv. (They do however add appeal to females thus broadening the viewer spectrum.)

507,8 March 2021,josephinenoennig,10, Star Wars VI: Return of the jedi - May the force be with you!!,"Star Wars Episode 6 is the third feature film to be released on December 12, 1983. However, it is chronologically arranged the sixth part. It is a US American Space Opera movie, which means it takes place in a fictional universe. Famous actors are Carrie Fisher, who plays Lea in the movie. Unfortunately, the actress died early. Mark Hamill plays Luke Skylwalker and Hamson Ford is Han Solo. The Emperor is portrayed by Ian McDiarmind and Dawid Prowe plays Darth Vader. Other important figures are Yoda (Frank Oz), Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The production of the film suffers George Lucas.
In the sixth part, Lea wants to free her friend Han Solo, who is imprisoned by Jabba de Hut (a comic creature). But her rescue mission fails and she becomes a slave herself. Lea's twin brother Luke Skywalker, who is Jedi Master, rescue them with the help of his droids R2D2 and C3PO. After that, Luke goes to Yoda (his master) and learns that he is finished with his training. He's only supposed to face Darth Vader, who's Luke's father. Yoda then dies of old age. The plan now is to destroy the second Death Star. Luke, Lea, Han Solo and their loyal friend Chewbaca set out to save the galaxy from evil. Luke has to face his father. The emperor's goal is to turn Luke to the dark side of force. Will he make it?
Personally, I find the movie very exciting and action-packed. Despite the fact that the movie is ancient, the movie has a lot of good effects. The lightsaber fights are always fascinating again and again. I can only recommend the movie because it is a lot about friendship, love and also family. However, Star Wars is nothing for everyone, because the movies are very imaginative.
All in all, Star Wars 6 is a fantasy movie with lots of action. The three friends Lea, Han and Luke want to save the universe and destroy the Death Star. I won't tell you whether they will succeed. Watch the movie and find out. May the force be with you!",

The opening scenes with Jabba the Hutt were very well played.The scenes are intense and gripping,Michael Carter's cameo as Bib Fortuna is a delight,and sorry anyone not pleased by the site of Carrie Fisher in the Slave costume must be embalmed. Its not the only reason to watch Fisher though, her performance in those scenes is very ,very, good. its a shame that she,along with Harrison Ford are barely utilized for the remainder of the film ! Ian McDiarmid is a joy to watch as Palpatine, this expert actor from London's Almedia Theatre is one of the finest additions to the Star Wars universe.

A lot of people complained about the Ewoks, but I didn't mind that. I love all 3 Star Wars films. They all have groundbreaking effects, great acting, great atmosphere, great stories, great music, everything works. They will be known in cinema as one of if not the greatest trilogy in film history.

The movie still has some great scenes, just like final battle with Luke and Darth Vader. Return of the jedi has some stupid scenes, just like the Jabba Hut scene, the chase between Luke, Leia and some weird clones and -of course- the horrible Ewoks. The Ewoks are what makes this film seem less important than The empire strikes back and more stupid. The way Ewoks destroy an entire squadron is just ridiculous. And even more considering that it is at the same time that we see the great battle with Luke. Has some great things, but some others are horrible. Sad way of finishing a good trilogy.",
521,1 March 2023,mjpiro,8, A Fantastic Ending to a Terrific Opening Trilogy!!,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is a fantastic ending to a terrific opening trilogy. At the time that it was first released, that was all we thought that we were getting, no major book projects were in store for one of the highest grossing if not the highest grossing sci-fi movie franchises of all-time and while a couple cartoon spin-offs did make their way to Saturday morning cartoons that was going to be it for Star Wars fans. And what a way to go out, with a satisfying film that answered some of the most complex questions that the trilogy had brought up. First the question that was raised at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. While fighting Luke in Cloud City at the end of the second original film, Vader famously tells Luke that he is his father and in Return of the Jedi, after conferring with both Yoda and ghost Obi-Wan Kenobi we learn this line to be true. Of course when the prequels were added starting with 1999's The Phantom Menace, this became common knowledge but at the time back in the early 1980's this was ground breaking information and is still apart of the American lexicon today! Secondly we learn that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) are actually brother and sister in the Star Wars universe!! Again leaning on that conversation with ghost Obi-Wan early in Return of the the Jedi, the now deceased Jedi Master spills the beans to Luke about his and Leia's true relationship and how they were split apart to protect them from the Emperor and Vader. Again, groundbreaking information at the time that strengthened the family aspect of the Star Wars films. Once again if you took this simply based on the prequels point of view, this would be common knowledge but was a shocker to the common movie goer back in 1983. Luke's green lightsaber was also something of a surprise as well back then too, so much so that some movie posters and hype magazines painted it blue originally to keep it a surprise to audiences. Another fun fact is the director of the film. Richard Marquand, friend of Star Wars creator George Lucas, admirably directed the film but Steven Spielberg was actually the first choice to do so. It turns out he could not because he was a member of the Director's Guild & Twentieth Century Fox - the company that financed the first three Star Wars films including Return of the Jedi - wasn't willing to pay the fees to have Spielberg direct the film at the time. The action in Return of the Jedi is great & with the addition of a couple lines for the digital copy (this is the one that I reviewed) you really see how two Jedi returned for this film!! In the end scene where Luke is brought to the Emperor, in the very final scene of that part where the Emperor is electrocuting Luke and VADER saves Luke by shouting ""No, no!!!!"" Then dumping the Emperor over a bottomless railing you see TWO Jedi emerge (well I guess one Jedi re-emerge in Anakin/Vader) to save the day and bring the lightsaber dueling part to a very satisfying conclusion!! There's lots of fun with the Ewoks, and great humor how the fury little bears worship C-3PO, who in every other story gets kicked around and is the butt of everybody's joke but is treated like a God in parts of this one. There's even a great coming together and celebration at the end of the film when the Evil Galactic Empire is finally defeated. It's a movie for the ages that has stood the test of time. 8 out of 10 stars!!",
522,1 March 2021,pinksk1es,6, A little disappointing,"After watching Star Wars for the first time, I'm a little disappointed with this ending to the trilogy. The first 30ish minutes was a terrible watch with Jabba the Hutt. It's really just a gross feeling and un-entertaining part of the film. The rest doesn't feel so original or different enough from the first two movies. The Emperor was also a let down. It would've been a lot cooler to just have Darth Vader be the sole villain. But I do understand that they wanted to show Vader's sense of vulnerability throughout the movies in the sense that he wasn't the dominating force. And the whole trying to get Luke to turn to the dark side was very forced and could've been more developed.",

528,19 December 2022,jigsawjoey,8, Great ending to a great trilogy,"This film was amazing and great end to a great trilogy. It made some of the choice that I didn't like in empire strike (expect for Darth Vader telling Luke he is his father) seem tiny. The first half the movie was alright very much guilty pleasure of the trilogy. Only one scene i cringed was the leia slave scenes with her underwear they just went a little too far. It could have made leia look like a damsel in distress or just not a confident person but nope they make her fight even more than begore which is good. But other than that, just was alright guilty pleasure. The rest of this film was so amazing that the first half looked okay but just okay. For example, the space battle was so good that just made me feel good and joyful and then rebels one it was an awesome still though, cool looking at the empire with awesome vehicles and ships and all. Also, the lightsaber battle was so great just felt like you were on your edge of the seat though I already have seen the movie it was still great seeing Vader turning after Luke finally understand why the Sith sometimes win. That the sith are not about love or compassion but evil selfish and angry and so gives vader an opportunity to finally defeat darth sidious once and for all ever since the beginning and really at exegol in the comics but with compassion more so than mercy. I also love the emperor in this and how ruthless he was and of course we know the next part of the story for him, but in the meantime, he will be shaking his fist at the skywalker family like Stalin in the real world. I loved the Ewoks just so cute and cuddly lol they are so cool hope we learn a lot more in canon. I loved everything at the end especially seeing the other planets the vader funerial and the force. Just a great end to part of the story but we have last part which will make this very interesting lol.

Luke Skywalker then confronts Darth Vader in a final battle, with an ominous warning from Obi-Wan to keep his feelings in check lest he be vulnerable to the pull of the dark side of the Force. The fight scenes, acrobatics, visual effects and Princess Leia's outfits all step up their game in this last instalment of the original Star Wars saga. Little furry Eworks native to the moon of Endor steal the show as adorable little fuzzy teddy bear- like creatures that hilariously worship C-3PO and attempt to roast Han Solo & Luke on an open pit.

545,20 January 2008,scott-sw,8, Great ending of the greatest trilogy ever.,"While Return of the Jedi is my least favorite of the original three Star Wars movies, but it still packs a good punch and closes out the best trilogy of motion picture history. It begins with C3PO and R2D2 visiting Jabba the Hutt. They find Captain Solo (Harrison Ford) still in carbonite. Chewabacca (Peter Mayhew) is captured, along with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who was incognito as a renegade bounty hunter. It is up to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to save the day. As a real Jedi, he is able to confound Jabba's men, destroy his barge, and rescue Leia, Han, Lando, and Chewie. The remaining two-thirds of the film deal with the final rebel assault against a new Death Star. Emperor Palpatine himself oversees the project with Darth Vader. As Luke and Han launch an attack to take out the defense shield from the moon of Endor, they meet some strange friends, the Ewoks. This leads to rollicking fun, great space battles, action sequences, awesome special effects, and Luke's temptation to join the dark side. I did have a few gripes with this movie. I know Lucas originally wanted to have the Ewok battle originally done with Wookies. I wished he would have stuck to that because the idea of stone-throwing teddy bears warring against storm troopers strained credibility. The only other strike was not introducing us to Emperor Palpatine sooner. He is only mentioned in the first Star Wars movie, and we do get a holographic image of him in the Empire Strikes Back ... but as the true master of evil he should have been brought in earlier. Nevertheless, Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie overthrow the Empire once and for all, restoring balance to the force and allowing good to triumph over evil. If only more movies could do that better.",

The final fight between Luke and Vader is great and the space battle between the Empire and Rebellion is amazing. There are some flaws, however, that keep it from being equal to the first two. The new Death Star is kind of disappointing. I wish they used their obviously incredible imaginations to come up with a better home base. Some of the coolest bad guys are defeated in stupid ways. Don't even get me started on how Boba Fett gets beaten. And while the Ewoks are cute and cuddly, i would have preferred Wookies or some kind of big warriors for the final battle. ",

The protagonists that we know and love are also dealing with new problems and the antagonist is more lovable and three dimensional than before.The tone is lighter than the previous film,the plot has some problems (there is a big subplot about the second Death Star that is similar to the first Star Wars film) and it doesn't take risks so it feels less mature but it is still very enjoyable.It goes without saying that the practical effects are mind blowing and the music score by John Williams is iconic.The performances are good especially by Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones(fun fact: besides doing the voice for Darth Vader in all of the three films he was only credited in Return of the Jedi)In a nutshell,Return of the Jedi is a great film(rated #75 best film of all time by IMDb) with great characters,amazing visuals,incredible music and unforgivable moments that gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy despite being the worst in it(I don't say that it is a bad film I just say that it is not as good as the other two films in the trilogy).If you haven't seen it you really should but I am sure that you saw it a billion times.",

But I liked the battle scenes on Endor. And I made this film one of my favourites. But there's one thing I never understood. Why is it categorized as Sci-Fi? According to Isaac Asimov, there's two types of Sci Fi. The first one deals with science. And I would say the only real ""Science"" ""Fiction"" movies are Star Trek. And there's a lot of books- Jules Verne, Isaac Asimov himself. It has to do with science. The other type of SF Asimov meant is the one that deals with what could be in the future. There's a lot of these- Total Recall, Terminator, all these. It has nothing to do with science, but with future. But there's no future, there's no science with Star Wars. What is left is Fiction- the best there could be.",

I love the Ewoks, especially Wicket. I'm not really into huge space battles so I preferred that this was set mainly on Endor. I enjoyed the scenes in Jabba's palace too. The blue elephant musician is cool. Jabba himself is a delightful creation. Fortunately Yoda, who I found annoying in Empire, only has minimum involvement. There are humorous moments, romance & valour. The Ewoks have the right blend of cuteness & savagery. You can also watch them in ""Caravan of Courage"" & ""Battle for Endor"". The cartoon is good too. Most of the aliens are fun to view, although I was less than impressed with those accompanying Lando. Still rather them than the CGI overkill in ""Phantom Menace.""

What makes this entry in the series is that it further builds the universe that the other 2 movies have built up and we can see that with the begining of this movie that it picks up straight after empire and Luke,Leia,Lando,Chewie,C3P0 and R2D2 are trying to save Han from Jabba the Hutt the ganster that had Han frozen in carbonite and that for me is really good as it doesn't jump straight away rom whats happend it builds on the story already built which is some perfect film maker.

This one and all of the original trilogy will always resonate with me as growing up these would be the movies i watched it growing up and so when i saw the ewoks in Jedi it would make me happy and make me laugh and yet the serious moments would also be something i would remember and the moments between father and son between Vader and Luke for me have sticked with me and this one with all of it's twists and turns will always for me be one of the best moments of my life watching all these moments in not just Jedi but all of the orginal trilogy.",

This movie had some surprises that add to the story but don't distract or take away from the story that came before.

Very few movies ever touch my emotions even lightly, but the ending -- with Yoda, Kenobi, and Anakin appearing one last time to look at Luke -- did so. It is an even more stunning movie now that Episode I has been released, and we have seen the lovable boy that Darth Vader used to be.

I already got the 2004 version of the dvds, so if George does decide to replace Sebastian in that scene, he can go right ahead. I won't like it, but I won't lose sleep over it. The empire strikes back is a VERY close second, but still second. A new hope is overrated, but still good. This is the 2nd best in the whole saga, the first being revenge of the sith.

ROTJ had always been a mixed bag for me up till recent years where I actually paid attention to the deeper story at hand. The storyline between Luke and Vader is so profound and so powerful that it's conclusion will stand to the rest of time. The low points in this film for me is everything surrounding that plot line. Jabba's Palace is way too long, almost like a short film as the beginning of this film. The Ewoks subplot slows the pacing of the movie but the space battle is highly entertaining.

The presence of the Ewoks never bothered me. I was fond of them from the start, and even more so when I laid eyes on Jar Jar. McDiarmid gives a wonderful performance as the Emperor, the special effects are better than the first two, and the story is told in a grandeur that is apparent in all the Star Wars films. Williams' score outdoes the originals' by a longshot, the ""Luke and Leia"" theme is beautiful. The emotional impact is increased in this one because we need to settle things after the unsettling events of Episode 5. Luke confronts Vader, love blossoms between Leia and Han (now rescued), and Luke becomes a Jedi. The Saga may end with this one, but that sure is a beautiful way to die.",

As much as I can't stand those awful Ewoks, the worst part about this Star Wars is a script that sucks the life out of the main characters..especially Han Solo (you get the sense that being in carbon freeze for who-knows-how- long softened his brain). Luke's no fun anymore either. Hamill tries too hard to sound like Alec Guinness as Obi Wan did in the first one, and it doesn't work. Then there's the emperor, who is not just evil, but obviously a narcissistic a-hole who loves to hear himself talk. In several scenes he says pretty much the same annoying stuff (telling Luke that Luke now serves him, blah blah). I think the audience got the point the first time he said it. ",

Ewoks, bleh, I would have liked to seen the Wookies instead. Han Solo on the ground? It would have been cooler if Luke and Leia were leading the ground battle while Han and Chewie lead the space battle. I loved Jabba's palace and the SE made it better. The Emperor was great, better than the guy on TESB hologram. I think Vader was toned down for this film, since his master was there, he couldn't be the BAD guy he was in Empire. I think that everyone fit in their roles quite well. Hammil actually did a satisfactory job in this film (compare it to ANH and you will notice the difference). Boba Fett becoming lunch wasn't a great move, I think he should have left Jabba's after Chewie was captured. It would have been cool to see him go after Luke on Endor or something like that. I think that this film wasn't all it could have been, Lucas showed himself slowing down and out to make it more family oriented than the previous two. The development of Han and Leia's relationship was cut down to a minimum and it focused more on adventure than a great story telling like TESB had.",

Secondly: remember our cool new villain Boba Fett that's really popular? Let's have a blind man accidentally knock him into a giant hole in the floor 15 minutes in. Third: the Ewoks. Because what Star Wars really needed was a race of space teddy bears that throw rocks at highly trained soldiers and worship C3PO as god.

I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord.",

The acting wasn't the greatest, but acting isn't what made or makes Star Wars movies great. It was much cooler to see Luke with a green lightsaber, rather than a blue one. Not to mention, his own lightsaber. We finally got to see Jabba the Hutt, the infamous gangster who wanted our hero Han Solo so badly. Despite being a disgusting creature. And of coarse, good finally overcame evil when Darth Vader gave his life to save his son and realized how wrong he was. The ewoks were cute. The movie managed to sell big sets like Jabba's throne set, the ewok village, and of coarse, Jabba's sail barge.

595,2 April 2019,charbelelaro,7, It doesn't hold up as well as the previous two,"Star Wars Episode VI: The Return Of The Jedi, is directed by Richard Marquand, and is the last of the original trilogy. This film isn't perfect, and it doesn't hold up as well as the previous two. This is mainly due to the overuse of CGI in certain scenes, which really removes the viewer today. Also the direction doesn't compare to The Empire Strikes Back, which is shown purely by the difference visually between the films. Also certain plot points are quite silly and pointless particularly the Ewoks which seem to be added as a selling point for children. On the other hand there are great moments in The Return Of The Jedi. Some of which include the space action sequences, and also the powerful character foil between Darth Vader and Luke. The climatic moment in the movie builds to be very intense, although it is resolved way too easily. Character decisions and epiphanies happen so abruptly, that it does not feel realistic. All in all as a trilogy, it is one of the best in history. Star Wars: The Return Of The Jedi is not a terrible film, but it is the weakest in the trilogy so therefore I give it a 7.",

Han and Leia are again likable and the Ewoks are hilarious. Darth Vader, the ultimate villain in the series finally reveals his better side and to look his personal dilemma, hidden behind his vile looking skull mask is fascinating. but fans of bad guys, do not worry.

In A New Hope Lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess Leia, the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited Luke Skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister Darth Vadar. In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen.

The emperor with Luke is one of the best things about the movie as one feels the pull in both Luke and Vader. The action is some of the best in the trilogy AT TIMES. The Endor sequence is exciting when focused on our leads and their fantastic chemistry which carries much of the film as well. However, the movie does feel to similar to the movie that came out six years before it in the original in terms of overall plot structure. Also, the troopers losing a battle to teddy bear ewoks is possibly the most unbelievable thing in the saga.

I'm totally okay with that, although I can't say that ""Episode VI"" is as good as its predecessors, which is fine considering how good the previous films are. ""Return of the Jedi"" is one hell of an entertaining experience, but I think it lost some of the genius in the writing to deliver a politically correct ending to an overall family friendly saga. Awkwardly enough in this movie there are some of my favorite scenes in the trilogy (the revelation of how Luke and Leia are connected; the showdown with Jabba's crew; the epic fight between Luke, Vader and the Emperor) and some of the worst (the introduction to Jabba's palace; the Ewoks), and still every scene feels like it needs to be there and (just like its two predecessors) like it is essential sci-fi adventure film. For all the cheesiness and plot-holes that can be there, ""Star Wars"" is one of those cinematic miracles that you love no matter what rationality induces you to think, because art works exactly that way, more on an emotional level that on a cerebral one.

Return Of The Jedi provides those faithful to the films with closure and also a glimpse of a magical film that finished with the brilliance of it predecessors. The special effects of this film are astounding, proving that the movies only improved in this aspect. The beginning of the movie is spellbinding from Luke's attempt to play a mind trick upon Jabba The Hut to their escape from the monster in the desert. The romantic connection between Princess Laie and Han Solo is realized at last, and also adds special meaning to the film. Overall this movie is superb, flawlessly showcasing the genius of George Lucas.",
618,30 June 2016,allyball-63124,8, Not as Good as the First Two but Still a Great Movie,"Most people put this as their least favorite of the original trilogy. Not that it's bad it's just not as good as the other 2. However, there is one group of people who say that this is the best Star Wars movie and I can definitely see why. The best parts of this movie are when Luke is with Darth Vader and the emperor trying to make Vader ""return from the dark side of the force."" It's very deep and emotionally compelling. The climax is also very satisfying. Without giving away too much, it is pleasantly surprising if you consider what happened in Revenge of the Sith. I also like the space battles. They were great and a lot of fun. It's also good to see some continuity with The Empire Strikes Back by making Lando return. While he is kind of minor, it was still nice to see him. I also like the way the Han and Leia thing was resolved. It's still a cute relationship and their interactions are cute and fun. In fact, that's one thing this movie does have over the 2 movies. The interactions between Vader and Luke are the highlights of the film and many of the other characters play off the other characters very well. So taking all of that into account, what makes this movie not as good as the other 2 in the original trilogy? Well there are 2 things that very hard to overlook. This movie is extremely lighthearted compared to the last movie. Well most of the movie is pretty dark but, the ewoks are really cheesy for the Star Wars films. They take out all of the tension in the scenes they appear in. However, it's not that bad since we need something kind of lighthearted to balance out with the overall darkness of the rest of the film. The other problem I have with this movie is that the opening scene in Jabba's palace is way too long and kind of boring when they aren't battling off monsters. Listen, I get that you need to make this movie 2 hours long for your marketing to adults or whatever but this is really pushing. You could've either trimmed the opening A LOT or cut it out entirely and make a change to how they get Han Solo back. Overall, I guess my problems don't hurt this movie that much since I still love it just not much as some of the other films and hey at least we do get that awesome ending in the ewok camp.",
619,27 May 2001,mar9,6, An ultimately disappointing finale,"Until the overblown Episode I made its belated appearance, this film held the dubious honour of being the weakest of the Star Wars films. Which is a pity, because the opening few minutes on Tattooine, with the rescue of Han Solo and the demise of the repulsive Jabba the Hutt are terrific. This initial high standard is not however sustained. Mark Hamill is frankly wooden in what should be the pivotal role. Harrison Ford's instinct that his character should have been killed off in this film is probably correct. Carrie Fisher has fun in a gleeful ripoff of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, although the ewoks are just plain silly, looking far too much like teddy bears to be taken seriously in what is supposed to be a desperate battle for the future of the galaxy.",
620,5 October 2022,passenger70,9, The beginning of the end.,"Everything that fans criticise about the prequel trilogy starts here in Return of the Jedi. The screenplay lacks the humour of the first two films and the characters are serious and barely recognisable from their previous incarnations. Kasdan makes the fatal blunder of keeping our hero's actions mysterious in the first act making Jabba the Hutt the default lead of the film and confusing us as to whose story is really being told. The audience is left cold by Alan Hume's muddy cinematography and Richard Marquand's weak directing - especially in the action sequences which don't come close to those in the first two films. Lucas painted himself into a corner in this respect by quitting the Director's Guild and severely limiting the talent available to him. ILM, Ben Burtt and John Williams acquit them selves admirably as usual and the drama of the Luke/Darth/Emperor confrontation keeps the film afloat despite the rehashed Death Star attack and the goofy Ewok battle. The Ewoks are criticised for being childish and silly even though they are no less silly than say the Jawas in the first film, however the cartoonish alien elements were used as entertainment in the first two stories and didn't factor into the drama of the final battle sequences which is why I think audiences felt something was off in this story. Despite all this it is still our last true journey into the original world of Star Wars, a place we haven't been to since 1983.",

Richard Marquands short career left him with at least one highly recognised and brilliant film. Mark Hammil, Harrisson Ford and Carrie Fisher provide steady performances whilst Ian McDiarmid and David Prowse provide an incredible sense of fear to the film.

624,22 September 2014,orourkec-292-269155,7," Return of the Jedi isn't big, big but it is an arguably rousing episode.","Return of the Jedi was considered the weakest of the entire Star Wars trilogy and people thought that Empire Strikes Back was the best of the trilogy but I personally felt that Return of the Jedi was more rousing than Empire Strikes Back and the best of the trilogy. The good thing about Return of the Jedi is that it's very story-focused and well too. However I strongly felt that storytelling in this movie should have been more deeply focused and colorful than what it is in the film. Another thing is that though Return of the Jedi is better than Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope (according to me) it lacked some or a bit of the cinematic discipline from the previous two Star Wars movies. Also the light saber duel between Luke and Darth Vader is unfortunately and certainly not the best composed light saber duel of the trilogy and should have been much, much better than what it is. Moreover I noticed an editing error in the scene seconds after Luke slices Darth Vader's arm. Despite all of that Return of the Jedi has the Emperor of the evil Galactic Empire who's a memorable villain, a beginning which is heavenly ambitious, it has a haunting atmosphere, has bombastic thrills, has a stunning and rushing score which matches the context of the film incredibly well and gets you emotionally thrilled and enough sudden turns in the movie to satisfy. The movie is overall a deliciously entertaining Star Wars episode which makes you greedy and it is a true welcome back to a galaxy far, far away and a fitting end to the trilogy. My rating: 7.2/10",

The attention span of a movie audience has always been a limiting factor for the movie industry. When taken into consideration with the time and cost constraints that influence audience attendance at the movie theatre, we can well appreciate the fact that the series concept well accepted for television, is not considered bankable for the movies. A potential investment in the continuing adventures of' by production companies would result in the application of financial prudence, meaning that the preference would rather be to concentrate on one story and if box office success warranted it, the production of a sequel to take advantage of a potential cash  cow.

Indeed Return of the Jedi is off to a bit of a bad start because it's intention is to finish off this particular trilogy and saga, and thus we all know the ending will involve the heroes saving the day and destroying the baddies (although it could really have taken us for a ride of confusion by having the bad guys winning instead, but that may have been a bit too dark as closure to the Star Wars saga). Indeed the dark ending to Empire Strikes Back took many by surprise, with the good guys essentially not winning, but that's what many consider to be the winning trump card of that film, the fact that it didn't take the conventional path of stopping the villain and saving the day, but this doesn't make Return of the Jedi a bad movie, in fact it's the exact opposite.",

637,21 May 2019,nirome,9, Very solid ending to the trilogy,"Although this last chapter in the Star Wars original trilogy doesn't have the mastery of the Empire Strikes Back or the novelty of Star Wars; it was clearly, at the time, in many respects, the pinnacle of its technological achievements. Everything from production design to visual and practical effects is, once again, taken up a notch and vastly improved upon. The battle of Endor is a brilliant example of how far the technology had come at the time and after all these years, hasn't aged one bit. The movie begins quite well, with Han Solo's rescue by Luke and Co from the clutches of Intergalactic crime boss Jabba the Hutt, it follows quite nicely with Luke's discovery through Obi-Wan of yet more secrets about his origin and the subsequent laying out of the latest plan by the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Empire's newest Death Star. Unfortunately, once the protagonists land on Endor and we have the first few skirmishes with the Empire's troops, they run into the Ewoks. That's when the movie, for me, takes a bit of a nose dive. It thankfully picks up towards the end with the Final Battle and Luke and Vader's ultimate confrontation. That's my only gripe with the movie. Other than that, it is a very entertaining ride and a more than fitting end to a wonderful saga. Great fun.",

George Lucas is a genius. His films changed the world. But sadly this was the end of the trilogy. But don't get me started on Episode I or Episode II.

647,23 January 2016,bscrivener-50810,7," The most emotional and powerful, but also the weakest and silliest.","Return of the Jedi is a 1983 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and is the third and final film of the original Star Wars trilogy. Return of the Jedi once again takes us back into the amazing world of Star Wars and continues the journey of the franchise's beloved characters. However, unlike the previous two which are considered two of the greatest films of all time, Return of the Jedi has a few flaws which unfortunately hold it back from continuing this impressive trend. While it does have arguably some of the most powerful and emotional moments of the original trilogy it also has both the weakest and at times even silliest, the main target for this are the infamous Ewoks which has divided fans, as a personal preference I find they add little depth too the story and at times are the cause for scenes to feel unimportant, unnecessary and often stall the movie, as well as the far fetched third act battle which adds my disdain for them. Another of Return of the Jedi's flaws is the inclusion of a second Death Star, which never seems to have the same weight, intensity and fear that the first injected in the Rebels and viewers alike, and primarily serves as the Empire's base rather than an actual powered battle station. However, many aspects in Return of the Jedi do succeed for instance the film once again expands the beautiful and fascinating galaxy of Star Wars also the hugely powerful final confrontation between father and son and finally the jaw-dropping battle sequences in the third act. The first act also shines through with a brilliant conclusion to the cliffhanger at the end of Empire. Many of the same brilliant and iconic shots and scores are continued in Return of the Jedi. However, again unlike the original and Empire a few shots and special affects do nowadays seem dated. Overall, Return of the Jedi is a brilliant and emotional end to the original trilogy-but not hugely satisfying due to the more immature nature of the Ewoks and the stalled pacing of the second act as a whole. Certain aspects and exposition of the disappointing future prequels did seem to seep into Return of the Jedi at times, but generally they do not hold back the movie and is still a thrilling adventure to be viewed by all. 7/10",

649,3 May 2005,larson.72,9, Underrated,"* Spoilers * 'Empire' may be the best of the three movies in the original Star Wars trilogy artistically, but ROTJ, in my mind, is and always was unsurpassed by the other two movies in terms of action and sheer scale. There's just so much happening in this movie as Lucas tries to wrap up the trilogy; there's the rescue of Han and ensuing capture and escape from Tatooine, then the resumption and conclusion of Luke's training, the planning for the assault on the second Death Star, the landing of the infiltration party on Endor, and finally the interleaved 3-way finale between the battle on the surface of Endor, the battle in space, and the final confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor. I think one of the main reasons this film is so overlooked in the trilogy is simply because of the Ewoks, which is a shame. That, in my mind, is something that can be overlooked. Yes, they are corny in some scenes, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And the ending is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy - more so than most other sci-fi trilogies these days seem to be able to manage (i.e. Terminator, the Matrix). Who can forget that scene, with Darth Vader dying in Luke's arms...""you were right about me Luke...you were right..."" It's just brilliant, and at the same time, a sad ending to a great epic story of finding one's purpose, not giving up, redemption, and the ultimate triumph of humanity and love over evil. Too bad Lucas hasn't been able to recreate the magic in the new trilogy, though (mainly because the characters suck, in my opinion). ROTJ gets a 9/10 in my book.",

But, I dropped it to 7 because in Jabba's palace the seen with the alien stage performers. When they added the extra animation/soundtrack to the movie, I think it ruined that scene. The new song is so irritating and the alien dancer/singer looks goofy. The little fur ball jumping around singing is plain stupid. In the original scene the song sounded cool and flowing, the alien characters are puppets, but are serious and cool looking. I went and bought the original Star Wars VI on VHS tape because that scene has been ruined. I think adding computer animation can be beneficial...or damaging as well.",

I used to think Revenge of the Sith was the best movie but ROTS is kind of illogical. But Star Wars Return of the Jedi from its beginning to its end, all were just awesome, destroying rich Hut along with his army with really little effort showed how powerful Luke has become. Then make a plan to destroy Death Star II, land on planet Endor, and create new alliances with Ewoks (yeah, honestly would've been better if it was Wookies, but it's fine), then Luke meets his father; Darth Vader (formerly known as Anakin), then confronting Emperor Palpatine (Darth Sidious) and dueling his father and ultimately defeating him down to the ground, really one of the best scenes in cinema. Then he declared himself as true Jedi by refusing Sidious's offer. When Palpatine strikes and almost kills Luke Vader finally redeems himself and kills his old evil master. The best SW movie in my opinion, though.",

669,25 August 2020,jjgreatwhite,10, My Favorite Star Wars Film,"Overall while Return of the Jedi is not the best Star Wars film its always been my personal favorite of the bunch. Yes there are problems like the dance sequence original or special edition is not well done, as well as Boba Fett death is dumb, and while I actually like the Ewoks the scenes in the middle of the movie are slow. But their is a lot to love in Return of the Jedi the scenes with Jabba the Hutt and the criminal underworld of Star Wars adds more to the world and makes it more loved in. It also has the greatest space battle in the history of Star Wars and it still holds up today. Last but least it has the greatest scenes in movie history with Luke, Vader, and the emperor, just everything about from the sets, to the music, and the acting is pitch perfect and it rivals anything in A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Overall Return of the Jedi while not a perfect movie is a perfect ending with all our characters happy and the galaxy is at peace after all this time it's just heartwarming to watch and best of all it feels earned after what everyone went though. Overall that is the why overall it's not best but my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. Overall grade= A-",

The only reason for watching this movie is the very reason I loathe the others:  STORY.  The resolution of the Father-Son conflict comes to a climactic head in this movie.  Maybe it's Freudian, but it's comforting to witness Luke's compassion and love for his father proving wiser than Yoda and Obi-Wan's ""kill him and let God glue back together the pieces of Darth Vader"" mentalities.  In the end, Vader saves Luke's life. Which, really, brings us to a conundrum, doesn't it?  Wouldn't LUKE be the one the prophesies foretold of bringing balance to the force (opposed to Anakin, as believed in Episodes 1 and 2, and stated in interviews with Lucas)?  Think: Darth slaughtered the Jedi and oppressed people for years! Luke, however, followed a path of enlightenment, and saved his father (and, by extension, the universe) from himself and the Emperor's grip!

Now, it is becoming more and more likely that there wil be no sequel trilogy at all, and Episode 6 would mark the End of the SW saga.  I hope this is not so.  This is my least favorite of the original trilogy.  It is still a great film, I gave it an 8, the saber duel between Vader and Luke, the Emperor, the DS2, all provide a great movie.  I didnt partically care for the opening sequence with Jabba's Palace, and Barge, but i did enjoy watching several people including Boba Fett fall to their doom. (dont email me about what the comic book said about him using his rocket pack to get out).  The movie is well done, develops Yoda more, and shows more about the nature of the force, and how easy it is for a young Jedi to turn.

And George Lucas does well on finding a suitable climax for the series. There is a minority that says this was a cheap thing to throw in but I totally disagree. This scene is sad but ultimately touching, which I think will be made all the more so when the six stories are complete. The ending scene in the special edition is far more satisfying than it was originally.",
684,17 August 2022,gary-rogerswhatisup,8, Best of the entire series,"I actually think this is better than them. A large part of why I love this movie so much is how satisfying it is, the entire trilogy has built up to the events in this film, so we're completely invested in the characters and situation, it all came together perfectly. All the characters in this film are different than they were in the last two films and if adds to there characters to see that there are still consequences to every action they take. I thought that The Emperor was a fantastic villain for this film as we truly realise just how powerful he is and it was interesting to see how he controlled Vader. The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series.",

686,1 May 2001,davidking,10, My favorite science fiction film!,"I truly enjoyed Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi.  I thought it was excellently done, and better than either episodes IV or V (and after seeing Episode 1, I still think VI is the best).  Although the story's beginning is in Empire Strikes Back, I felt the characters were well introduced, and the plot well constructed.  My only disappointment were the ewoks, as they were too teddy-bear like, and seemed to detract from the film's overall serious nature.  The story would have done better making the natives of Endor Moon more fearsome and less cuddly.  The highlight of the film, to me, was the battle between Luke and Vader, and the subsequent battle between Luke, Vader and the Emperor.  The setting of the situation, in both the original and the Special Edition, gave me a feeling of satisfaction, and properly influenced a sense of tension, as I fell all good films should do (I still think the Star Wars IV Special Edition Death Star explosion was tops).  Overall, George Lucas pieced together an excellent film, and I wish he'd used some of the concepts utilized in Return of the Jedi in Phantom Menace.

However, to be fully enjoyed, it really must be seen after episodes 4 and 5. Had i seen it before those two, i would have come out thinking it was only slightly above average. But the earlier films have built the characters and the fighting cause to such a climax that in the final scenes of this film with Luke and Vader you are left with sensory overload- because it all means so much to you. Acting as always is a top-knotch performance, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill deliver some fantastic roles, while the short appearance of Ian McDiarmid is a memorably acted. While some of the action scenes may seem a bit dated (such as the chase through the forest and the Rancor pit scene), this does not distract from the overall film and they are still enjoyable. With a great mix of action and plot, humour, and of course the classic good and evil battle, forgive me for saying.... the Force is strong in this one.",

The most recent Star Wars installment - The Phantom Menace - has since become the most anticipated. However, Jedi completed the entire saga with am uplifting twist and did not suffer from the over-stuffing of effects and pointless characters that Episode 1 has.

After Empire Strikes Back the Star Wars saga is at a crossing point, the rebels are showing signs of defeat, but have been strong enough to survive. It's difficult tell how they are going to defeat an empire so big. Like most films it's usually a crack shot chance that is thought up miraculously by the main character.

Still, that is no slight on this movie...it is difficult to equal those two masterpieces-- they stand as quite possibly the best sci-fi action movies ever made. The costumes are great, the opening sequence on Tatooine is tense and exciting, and the final space battle blows away A New Hope in terms of scope and size. In addition, the emotion of the final confrontation between Luke and the Emperor/Vader is both cathartic and saddening, as finally the story comes full circle...as Anakin betrayed his Jedi brethren due to fear for his wife's life, so too did he betray the Emperor out of love and compassion for his son. The major themes and morals of the movie may be simplistic and childish to an extent, but it is honest and innocent in its message of love and trust over hatred, anger and fear; there shouldn't be anything wrong with that. More pluses - Yoda and Obi-Wan are back, confirming that Vader is Luke's father- and that Leia is his twin sister!! Han and Leia's love is fleshed out a bit and firmly established during the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. The Emperor, played by Ian McDiarmid, is deliciously evil as well. This movie is a great transition. The first two movies belonged to Vader, especially Empire Strikes Back. This installment is about Luke's rise and transformation into a Jedi. This is his movie. One could argue that Vader loses this role because he has good in him - because of his inner conflict about his love for his son and his wish to overthrow the Emperor, as stated in the previous movie. Luke's burning of his father's suit is symbolic of this final destruction of Vader. His appearance with Yoda and Obi-Wan at the end is touching. Two negatives - the Ewoks and the ending. The Ewoks are too kiddie, and you can't tell me that the Ewoks and a few rebels could beat imperial troopers and Imperial Walkers in a fight. Also, the ending is a bit too kitschy - rebels and Ewoks partying in the trees? Please. Still these flaws cannot ruin this movie. A great finale to maybe the greatest movie trilogy ever.",

The beginning of the sixth episode finds us back on Tatooine (where the first, I mean, fourth enstallment has it's start) where, when it was released back in May of 1983, audiences saw the first of Jabba the Hutt.  But, for the 1997 audiences such as me, and second, and chubbier look.  As for his fate, let's just say, if Episodes VII, VIII and IX were made, we wouldn't see him again. Also, we finally get a look at the great Emperor Palpatine, leader of the Sith Lords, and master to apprentice Darth Vader, now known as Anakin Skywalker.  And, once again, making his third appearance is my favorite underrated character, Wedge Antillies, leading Rouge Squadron on another faulously shot and fantastically made Kamikaze run.  This time, without the help of Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Princess Leia, who are both preoccupied, one with a rematch, and the taking back of a hand, the other with knocking out the Deflector Sheilds for the second Death Star on the moon planet of Endor, which is inhabited by the all too cute Ewoks.  They look like little Teddy Bears. As I said before, it all rounds out into a nice anticlimax, preparing for the seventh through ninth installments, which Lucas decided wouldn't come.  The series stops at six.  But, all-in-all, with Episode I just released (which is my next review) after 16 years without a new Star Wars movie, fans like me cannot wait until 2002 when Episode II is released. Until then, this is a fine ending.  B+",

But there are some minor details that bugs me more and more for each time I see it. It's in the last half hour, during the battle on forest moon Endor, that the annoying details just keep piling up. Maybe some hardcore Star Wars fans can correct me on these: R2-D2 becomes mysteriously mobile in the rugged forest as it seems he has strolled down to the entrance to the base all on his own. Amazing feat, considering he seems to stumble on minor obstacles anywhere else in the three movies. Oh well. Thats a minor detail, a much bigger, more annoying one is that the Storm Troopers gets knocked out by sticks and small stones thrown at them. Why bother with a helmet if it actually does more harm than good?? And finally, when Chewbacca comes along in the big, what are they called again - walker? He doesn't just blast the entrance open. No, they have to use it to ""lure"" out the hapless guards. Well, the single most annoying ""detail"" is the stormtroopers getting knocked out by small sticks and stones.",
712,17 January 2001,leviathinin,8," ""You've failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me""","Well here we are the final installment in the Star Wars trilogy and to an extent a bit of a disappointment, and some parts in the film are of pure quality. The Special Edition treatment does vastly improve the flow of Return of the Jedi and the ending sequence in the Ewok village after the celebrations of the crumbled Empire on Bespin, Mos Eisley and a nicely generated falling statue of the Emperor on Corruscant (Note that i am not explaining the storyline because you should have watched this film) Anyway back to the end sequence, the music allowed the ending to be very moving and the ethereal images of Obi Wan, Yoda and the now redeemed Annakin Skywalker is a nice piece as well. All i can say is this has many good points that the counteract the presence of the ewoks, and the unconceivable reason why all the main characters suddenly just appear (like house guests) at Jabba's Palace. The rest is good, good, good such as a great performance by Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine",
713,15 May 2002,Sean_Thorniley,9, Best of the Modern Myth that is Star Wars,"Tomorrow night at Midnight I will see the next chapter in the saga that is Star Wars.  Tonight I watched them all again to refresh my memory of what it is all about to give a better viewing of Episode II: Attack of the Clones tomorrow night at 12 am. 	I initially saw Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on its opening weekend in Eureka, CA as a full fledged, but young movie aficionado of sixteen years. Hitchcock flicks were my favorite at that time.  Hitch is still one of my favorite past filmmaker with Hawks and Capra close seconds.  These days my tastes lean to Scorsese, Aronofsky and the Coen Brothers.  Coppola, Speilburg and Lucas are wonderful and very good, but to me are more great craftsman than great artists.  All have had artistic successes (The Godfather, Schindler's List and THX 1138), but I think they are better craftsman than artists over all. 	Lucas is by far one of the greatest producers and craftsman of all time and has done more for true independent film and the medium of film than possibly any director/producer since Chaplin.  I also feel strongly that Jedi is the best Star Wars film thus far. It has tighter pacing, more realistic and fluid dialog and wonderful performances all around.  Richard Marquand probably has a great deal to do with this, but the experience of cast and crew may be the primary reason.  There was a fluidity in Jedi that the first one lacked, and the second one nearly reached, but not quite.  The cinematography was astounding with a mastery of the effects the first two pioneered.  The campy stuff was still there, but it was more natural and the cast was comfortable with it using it as a tool without stumbling over it. The cast and crew had found a chemistry that was remarkable for any film. 	The ""weaknesses"" of any of the Star Wars films as pieces of ""art"", or even craft are dwarfed by their emotional impact and timing of release.  I was ten when I saw Episode IV: A New Hope for the first time (several weeks after it was released) and I had to share a seat in the front row with my younger brother who didn't like me much at the time.  Once the music started and the words rolled up the screen we didn't care and loved every single second!  All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was ""can we see  it again dad, can we see it again dad..."".  I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day.  This is amazing since my town had only one theatre/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I  did.   The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85).  I saw Jedi only for times that summer, I had to work unlike in my younger days. 	My point is that emotional attachment, or detachment to a film is as equally important to what a person may think of it critically as a piece of art, or entertainment.  I have loved all the Star Wars films and have seen them all except for the first one on its opening day and even the first show of that day with the last two!  All that said however, I wouldn't call all of them ""great films"".  Important and amazing films, ""Hell Ya!"".  Some of the best rides I have ever had, ""Hell Ya!"".  Worth watching all in a row every now and again, you bet. 	Episode VI  is the most ""artistic"" of all the films thus far because it has the advantage of tons of rehearsal and chemistry to rely upon and the advantage of a creator/producer who is responsible to no one but himself and to a much lesser extent the fans.  I think part of  why Jedi is the best may be the fact that I knew that the ""Blue Harvest"" film shot near Crescent City (where I lived at the time) was really Star Wars III (episode VI), where they shot all the wonderful ""forest"" scenes.  I didn't watch them do it, but knowing it was happening and that the speeder chases were truly impossible (since I lived and played Star Wars in those woods for years), yet there they were right in front of my eyes in truly believable DeLuxe color (my favorite by the way) . This may be why Jedi still has the strongest hold on my heart!  I don't think that the story of Jedi is vastly superior to that of Empire, but it is more complex and deals with sophisticated things that I enjoy.  	I am more into temptation, redemption and what is and is not destiny and how much control over such a thing do we have.  These things are more deeply explored and acted out in Jedi as is the love aspect of family, friends and romance.  A touch sappy in some spots and simplistic in others, but hey George always tells us that he is trying to reach your average twelve year old more than anyone else and these films do just that! 	Love one, love them all it is tough to chose in some ways, but Jedi has my vote.",

He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).",

The never-ending war of good versus evil, and in this case the dark side versus the light side of the force reveals once again how sometimes it just takes the right moment to make a step in the right direction. Star Wars: Episode VI -Return of The Jedi (1983) directed by Richard Marquand, written by George Lucas, immerses us into a universe of gorgeous realms with new sentient life forms we could only dream of seeing, breathtaking moments between characters, action packed, fantastical sci-fi battles and the all too real-life feelings of being stuck and hopeless. Within this movie a recurring character feared among the galaxy, once a Jedi beaten and conquered by his emotions, has a final moment of light in his conflict of darkness within.",

At least it did have a great message modifying that technology doesn't always win wars again primitive or savages. SPOILER: In the beginning of this movie, Luke Skywalker arrives in Tatooine and defeat Jabba Hutt and rescue Han Solo. After that, we meet the Ewoks and yes we see them doing their cute battle thing. My favorite character, who no one never talks about during an interview or premiere, is the emperor. We see him as his deformed appearance and yes he's cranky, twisted, and sinister as ever. I just like supreme villains. My favorite scene was the conclusion when Darth Vader throws the emperor into the electrical shaft, which was beautiful. The light-sabers are primitive, not like the ones in the prequels so don't take it personal.",

These great moments of the film don't make up for the boring aspects of the first part of the movie, but the final battle scenes and Vader/Palpatines deaths make this movie an absolute must watch.

First the good: the first act with the main heroes saving Han from Jabba the Hutt, the rancor, sarlacc and Boba Fett is absolutely fantastic as it,s a great introduction to the characters we love and features fun action sequences, cool monsters and new memorable characters like Jabba the Hutt. The Final third act confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emporer is also phenomenal and is on par with Empire Strikes Backs finest moments, it's emotional, powerful and effective. However he rest of the film is not quite up to par. Not to say that it's bad but rather just ""there"" thee woks don't bother me as much as everyone else but they do feel more like toy commercials than pivotal characters. The endor subplot does feel rather forced (no pun intended) and just an excuse to give Han and Leia something to do for the films second and third acts. These scenes aren't bad, their fine, but they just don't do much for me personally.

I don't really like this one because the whole thing with the Ewoks was a little stupid. There just a bunch of little bears that for some reason the stormtroopers can't kill. (For some reason they can't kill anything else) The light saber fight was good between Luke and Vader but I thought it was to prolonged. The whole first half of the movie is to prolonged. You have to go through 30 minutes of strange aliens dancing. I just didn't get that. I felt glad when Luke finally came into the movie. The plot to destroy the death star was good. It was cool to see the trap that the Rebels just went into blindly and the action was pretty good as well. Overall, it was an OK star wars movie but it could have been better.",

It's easy to summarize this movie, first they go to Jabba's Palace for about 40 min. then Luke's of to Dagobah, the strike team on Endor,Luke surrenders, Battle of Endor. Now most people say they hate this movie because...then they list some technical comments like they were an avid critic!! Yoy! It's my favorite because of one thing: The Battle of Endor. On the ground, the Empire;s ""best legion of troops"" never had a chance, but in space you see the battle turn once the Executioner goes down. The lightsaber duel revealed a little too much of Vader-not enough fighting compared to ESB (even that didn't have enough)I was surprised how quickley Vader got worned out..oh well. The actual Death Star run was nothing like ANH but it had 2 other things going on and didn't provide that much drama. All in all this is the movie you should watch before you go see Epsiode I this summer-it's the most modern (of Eps. IV-VI) and has the most ties to the prequels. My rating: ***  (3 and a half) out of ****",

After seeing this movie I can't help to wish that an after Episode VI trilogy may come to life. I was hoping to see something of the 20 years that separate this movie from the next, but as there is going to be a TV series maybe we'll see some of it there.

John Williams is an award winning composer and created the score for other famous movies like Jurassic Park, Super Man, Jaws, Close Encounters with the Third Kind, and Indiana Jones. If you want to sample his music you can listen to a compilation by Moosebutter called Star Wars on Youtube. Return of the Jedi is the best Star Wars movie. There are furry creatures called Ewoks that are funny and adorable. There are intense lightsaber duels. There is a major plot twist that will blow your mind. If you like good movies I know that you will like this movie. I have no idea why you wouldn't like Return of the Jedi! The one reason you may not enjoy this movie is because it is a Sci-Fi movie, but it isn't like your typical sci-fi movie with killer aliens trying to take over the world. It is about freedom from an overpowering galactic empire and man's struggle with good versus evil. The movie has a great storyline with good acting and pretty cool special effects. ",

I am a huge Star Wars fan but something kept me from buying the 2004 DVD release...and I am very glad that I didn't. I own both the original edition and special edition of the original trilogy on VHS tapes but have become really annoyed with having to fast forward and rewind through the videos. It is very nice to actually be able to watch both the original and special editions of this ultimate masterpiece in beautiful quality and easy navigation (that is, until they are released in blue ray format of course...). Another reason why I'm glad that my patience has paid off is that the format and color of these DVD cases match up with those of the new trilogy (Episodes I-III) so I can display them on my shelf as a good looking, complete saga. Only true Star Wars fans and those (like me) who appreciate the classic era of film making can appreciate the release of the original theatrical version of the trilogy. Movies such as these were made in a time period without CGI and high end special effects and still remain to be excelling cultural fenominons even today.

Given what we've seen to date in George Lucas' prequel trilogy, ""Jedi"" was a harbinger of what was to come: increasingly hyper-detailed CGI landscapes populated with sketchy characters. Nonetheless, this did bring the original trilogy to a satisfying, if uneven, close. The battles raging on the forest moon of Endor and in the heavens above the new Death Star, spectacular as they are, really take a back seat to a smaller- scale conflict involving Darth Vader, the Emperor, and a young Jedi that both are trying to bring over to the Dark Side of the Force, Luke Skywalker.

755,17 January 2007,MAJORIC,9, Lucas Films Goofs,"When talking about Return of the Jedi, it's impossible to discuss the movie without mentioning its two versions: the original one released in 1983 which was a touch of genius and the digitally restored version released nearly a decade and a half later. Recently, Lucasfilms has launched a DVD release that contains both versions; original and digitally restored. That's one big mistake; you can now compare them at your leisure in the coziness of your home. Digitally restored, my butt. Digitally meddled and messed and demeaning are a list of more proper descriptions of what Mr. Lucas did to its work. Most of the changes in the second version were disruptive at best; a few were interesting to see and they complement and flesh out some details but only proving out that Mr. Lucas was only stupid and/or lazy enough of not doing them from the start, marring one nearly perfect film. Other changes were totally disruptive, showing that he doesn't care of his fans' memories and he's more than willing to alienate any possible new following. At the end of both movies it's a big celebration sequence: The original one was plain though heartwarming; simple yet self-contained. In the digitally restored mess, this same sequence loses the carefully timed rhythm of the first version and adds footage that only rabid Star Wars fans would get and tolerate. The Cloud City and Imperial Coruscant sections are to be understood only by those who have faithfully followed the series from the very start. One final note: with this dual DVD release, Lucas made another terrible mistake. He didn't provide us with nice and clean copies of the originals; they're not restored, they're scratched, dusty and a few frames were distorted by age. The digitizing was lousily done, allowing for some heavy flickering in some scenes.

758,20 December 2001,Samwise10,10, Part of the best movies of all time,In my opinion the six hour plus epic of episode IV through VI of Star Wars are the best movies of all time.  To separate them would not give them justice because it really is one incredible story.  I find the acting to be surprisingly good from mostly relative unknowns and they make the story so much better.  The feeling of depth to this story is what really sets it apart and it is so incredibly entertaining.  The special effects are mind boggling for their time and are still great today.  I love this movie because it made me want to be part of this universe and dream about being there.  The score has to be by the best I have ever had the pleasure to hear and the visuals are amazing.  For  entertainment I can't find any better movie than these.,

All the characters continue to develop correctly as they're face with challenging obstacles that give shape to the overall story. The acting this time was the best out of the entire original trilogy. Every cast member (including Jabba The Hutt if you want) played his or her part professionally and handled their roles profoundly. The third act is pure sci-fi beauty. The space battle remains to this day one of the most iconic. And the whole throne room scene is pure brilliance; the emotional weight surrounding it is what really takes the scene to another level.

The film has aged reasonably well, however. The tone here is again different from either of the first two instalments of the trilogy, becoming a shade more like 'Star Wars' then the darker nuances of 'The Empire Strikes Back.' The wondrous imagination that has been a hallmark of the series remains, as does the beautiful score. There is much here to enjoy.",

After saving not only Han, but everyone from Jabba, Luke returns to Jedi Master Yoda. The film, like Star Wars, starts out a bit slow and gets uninteresting in some parts. Granted, the make-up and costumes were kinda cool, but the lack of anything going on except deals and Jabba getting angry at the guards made the movie quite slow.",

I never saw ""New Hope"", when it first came out, because I was considered by my parents to be too young, which is probably fair enough, as I was only 4 at the time.

They are boring and under-written. The villians were very underwhelming. The dialogues were stupid (I only liked dialogues of yoda and c3po) The acting was weird. The fights were repetitive and long and devoid of any action and adventure. The whole premise of star wars is probably what held it all together.

However, Return of the Jedi often gets labelled ""the weaker one"" in the original film franchise. For the most part, arguments are made that it could've been better: It should've been the Wookies on Kashyyyk, not the Ewoks on Endor; the finale should've have been on the Galactic Capital Coruscant, not a rehashing of the Death Star, etc. It could've been better, but that is saying A LOT, because what we got was terrific in the end.",
785,18 February 2016,TheMarvelousM,10, The Best of the Saga,"This film is what I consider to be the best out of the entire ""Star Wars"" saga, and there are many reasons for this. First, even with another film after this, it still holds up as a conclusive ending to a franchise. Second, it is the most well written film, and yes, there are parts that aren't that good, but everything else makes up for it in the end. This also gave better character development for both Luke Skywalker, and the main villain Darth Vader. The portrayal of the Emperor is very evil and creepy, and no other villain in any other film had been portrayed like this. Even the controversial Special Edition of this is good, although it may still have flaws. The ending score at the end of the Special Edition to me is better than in the original, but the musical number in Jabba's palace would've been better if they had kept ""Lapti Nek"" and not added ""Jedi Rocks"". So on the whole, to me, this is the best film out of the entire Star Wars saga, and I will defiantly watch it right after I send this review.",

791,12 June 2020,Spidey2526,10, A perfecti ending for an era,"The Original Trilogy couldn't have had a better ending. TESB is considered as the best Star Wars and I totally understand (one of my personal favorites as well). But ROTJ has that special epic-ending touch. You can feel the victory, how they're finally free in so many aspects such as literally free from the Empire or reedemed from their actions in the past and fulfilled destiny. Clear example of this is Vader and Luke. We can agree that this trilogy has the cliche plot of a hero about to go into an adventure and fuilfilling his unavoidable destiny. But the way this saga uses is so epic. To watch one of the best villains of all time find his redemption is so satisfying. You cannot see his face, and this makes it even more amazing to understand the character. Just feel the character. See that behind allthat black suit and mask there's a reaaly good person that got his point of view blurred by a bad choice.
All this along with the master John Williams on the score...pffff...EPIC. There are a lot of underestimated pieces in this movie such as the one played during Vader and Luke's final duel. This song is literally tellling you that this is the one scene that will define once and for all the destiny of the Force. But it also tells you all the conflict that is going between father and son. And even though the lightsaber duels in the latest movies have a lot much more of acrobatics and action, I'll keep with this duel as my favorite one. Visually and emotionally is breathtaking. The green and red clashing in the dark backgroundis visually epic.",

The reason I love ""Jedi"" is that within this film you get everything that you saw in the first two within one movie. The amazing opening act at Jabba's palace and the skiff battle. Luke becoming a Jedi master on Degobah. Then the amazing third act. Luke and Vader's final battle, the battle on Endor with Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Ewoks against the storm troopers. And of course in my opinion the greatest space battle of the Star Wars saga. I remember when I was a little kid, watching that space battle and how I was amazed by it. That was one of the first great movie experiences for me as a movie lover. ""Return of the Jedi"" is everything you could ever want in a Star Wars movie, but beyond that everything you could want in a truly great movie.",
793,19 November 1999,Danny-32,9," Very Good, but not great","When I was about 10, I use to think that ROTJ was the best movie of all time, why was that? Cos I thought the last 40 minutes or so was so cool. But 9 year later my option is a lot different. 40 minutes does not make a movie. I still am not 100% sure why I do not like ROTJ as much as the other 2 (not including TPM). There is just something missing. Maybe it's the Ewoks that were just in it for merchandising and I think that did let the film down a bit. Like you go from Empire which is really dark to teddy bears running around killing stormtroopers. Sorry, but it's too unbelievable. Another thing I haven't understood is the Space Battle. When The Rebels come out of Hyperspace I reckon there's probably about 15 capital ships at most. Ok yeah they blew the death star up again (something new would of been good) but Surely the Empires fleet could wipe out the small rebel fleet after the death star was destroyed. Then as the falcon has blown up the death star u see about 30 rebel capital ships flying away from it...sorry if u think I am being picky but there are a lot of flaws here. I can understand if people get bored of the movie for awhile. It starts of slow and after killing jabba too the last 40 minutes it's quite slow. Oh the last one is finding out Luke and Leia are brother and sister. And straight away you think of them sharing a kiss in Empire. Plus there was a more passionate kiss cut out as well (thankgod). The acting wasn't the best, I think Mark Hamill tried too hard, and Harrison Ford seemed really uncomfortable at times and was nowhere near as good as in Empire (maybe it was being around the ewoks) On the positive sides though, there are some extremely good battle scenes. I thing some scenes were well written where Luke told Leia he was her brother and then straight after that with Vader talking to Luke. I guess it's a little bit of a let down from the other 2. You just expect a better ending and justifying. Although the special edition ending was a lot better then the original. With a lot better music to end it then that silly ewok song. In the end I'd give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.",

I'm a bit weird so did not appreciate the desperate and overlydone attempt at the end to redeem Vader.

Like the rest of the previous Star Wars films, Return of the Jedi was an entertaining movie but in my opinion not as good as the previous 2 films in the original trilogy. Return of the Jedi lacked story with it's continuation plot. The whole story in the film was just finishing the conflict that was unsolved in the Empire Strikes Back and also just finishing the original trilogy by solving the conflict in the complete trilogy. Besides the not so strong plot, Return of the Jedi is visually breathtaking with it's beautiful art direction and set designs. Return of the Jedi also is very exciting with the amazing special effects and battle scenes. So in conclusion to my review, Return of the Jedi is a very fun to watch film but it's just not as great as the previous 2 films in the original trilogy.",

I absolutely loved this movie growing up. It's definitely my favorite Star Wars film. Empire is a close second though. The only thing that drives me nuts about the movies is when George Lucas had to ""touch it up"" and he added that horrendous redone band scene in jabbas palace.

801,29 April 2017,xmurri,9," ""A humble ending to the best trilogy of all time.""","Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is simply put a success, and the perfect ending to the greatest trilogy of all time. People complain constantly about how ewoks are a simple marketing campaign, but they are a needed value in this equations masterpiece. Yoda, was a tiny green creature who upon first glance, was nothing but. Yet upon greater inspection, he was the Grand Master of the Jedi. It's the little things that matter, and can overall make a difference. And return of the Jedi shows us this, with its inclusion. Making the presence of ewoks, not so much a scheme, but more essential than anything. And without homage to Yoda and this lesson, it would have been a lesson without anything learned. Without this contrast of something lighter, the movie is grueling with darkness. Luke heads to defeat his Father, and his Fathers master,on a suicide mission. Where he knows might be his final stand. We have the Emperor, a man consumed in evil, who is stopped by his agent of evil, Darth Vader. Showing the audience a great darkness taken down, with both the emperor dead, and the switch to light for Darth Vader.In the end, It sums up the monumental trilogy, and creates a great movie while doing so!",

804,3 June 2002,Jestercard,7, A triumphant conclusion or a crashing disappointment?,"Until the release of the Phantom Menace, Return of the Jedi was widely regarded as the worst Star Wars film. Topping the awesome Empire Strikes back was always going to be difficult but on some levels Jedi suceeds. With all the plot threads left dangling at the climax of the previous film there was always going to be a degree of exposition in this film yet George Lucas and Richard Marquand managed to keep the pace of the movie at a ridiculous level. Mark Hamil by this time has grown into the character of Luke Skywalker and easily walks away with the acting honours, easily outshining a seemingly bored Harrison Ford and strangely enjoying a better chemistry with Carrie Fisher than his costar. The Star Wars movies have always been associated with outstanding special effects and again we are not disappointed - the climactic battle over Endor still holds its own by todays standards. If you can forgive the inclusion of the ewoks then Return of the Jedi stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best space operas around, and makes a satisfying final installment in the original trilogy.",

I think everyone must watch this films very quickly. Second of all, when you watch it, you realized that the other films and PC games were originated from this trilogy. Countless films performed after this trilogy has carried something from this trilogy.

811,9 April 2005,esaborio,10, Final Episode is perfect ending for the Star Wars Trilogy.,"This Episode ties all the loose ends left from ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"", with the best special effects of the Trilogy, and maybe of all Sci-Fi movies. Personally, I love the fact that Darth Vader, my favorite character in motion picture history, turns good, and that his spirit(as Anakin)can be seen at the victory celebration alongside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda. The ending is just perfect. Also, the music is the best from the Trilogy, adding depth to the characters and underscoring their development. Arguably, John Williams did his best work here. Anyway, this should have been the last Star Wars movie, so that people could remember this series as the greatest achievement in cinema history, and the greatest story ever told.",

I have watched this movie many times and every time I watch it, it gets better and better.  The ending is so dark, as you see Luke and Darth Vader in the most intense light saber battle to date.  You can feel the hate and anger building up in Luke as he gets closer and closer to falling into the dark side.  The music in the last light saber battle between Luke and Darth is superb, it just adds to the intensity.  Every time I watch it I think of the first Star Wars, as you see Luke as a regular boy, but he just wanted a little excitement in his life, but he never expected this.  He never expected to be the last of the Jedi, which is what makes this movie so spectacular.",

I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I love all episodes (especially the originals), but somehow it's the 6th episode I enjoy the most. I adore absolutely everything about it. Maybe because it was the first one I watched? Maybe because of Ewoks?

After seeing the movies 4,5,&6 from the 70s and 80s then seeing 1,2,&3 I was confused on why they made them the way they did. Just think of how 4,5,&6 would have came out if they did them in the 2000s. Yes I know that it would not have been the same because the actors that made the 70s and 80s movies made it great. However, I was just thinking that all the electronics that they used then would have been better with the current electronics they have today. No matter what the movies are good no matter when they were made. I do think that Mark Hamilton, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford were the best actors/actress for this movie.",
826,4 December 2006,lord_zeratul86,10, A nice movie.,"A very good movie. A classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a greater number of aliens. We see the Rebel Alliance leaders and much of the Imperial forces. The Emperor is somewhat an original character. I liked the Ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When Vader turns on the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and...his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. I felt there was much more than meets the eye. And as always the John William's music will bring the classicism into Star Wars universe.",
827,17 May 2004,Gulelin,9, The best of the trilogy IMO,*Minor spoilers ahead*,
828,19 July 1999,Erasmus-3,7," A full step behind Empire, even with Star Wars for different reasons","Luke's allegorical phantom confrontation with Vader on Dagobah, the revelatory confrontation between the two on Bespin, and the drama of Solo's being frozen in carbonite set Empire above the other two in the original trilogy.  Empire puts flesh on the mythic bones presented in Star Wars, which is remarkable for the simplicity of its story -- a farm boy, a mercenary and an elder knight rescue a princess from a dark castle and dark lord, then return to disintegrate it!  Return of the Jedi perhaps had the easiest task of the three and did well for the most part.  The great escape from Jabba's sail barge is tremendous fun, if somewhat improbable (specifically, that Luke could foresee where R2 would be in relation to him to propel his new lightsaber to him; but that's the Force -- excuse me, talking bacteria in our blood now, after Episode I).  And the slow, sinister game of cat and mouse in the Emperor's throne room -- between the Emperor, then Vader, and Luke -- elegantly deadly with the iridescent arcs of lightsabers in the darkness, provided a triumphant close.  It was just the Ewoks that brought down an otherwise incredible second sequel.  Cuteness only goes so far when one is trying to portray a struggle for the fate of the galaxy; and unfortunately, Mr. Lucas succumbs again in Phantom Menace. Why, why would one use obviously phony aliens with terrible mock-Asian accents when the stern Englishmen aboard the Death Star in Star Wars performed so well and painted the Empire as a bland, starched, strict entity that -- with the Stormtroopers -- clearly evoked the Nazi regime?  Now we have Jar Jar and his silly tribe and a two-headed pod-racing/basketball analyst; and to make matters worse and as I mentioned before, Mr. Lucas has flayed the flesh from those mythic bones by reducing the Force to something that characters can only feel because of a strain of bacteria in them.  Not the mind, not the soul or will -- bacteria.  Superintelligent bacteria, no doubt, and wise enough to engineer a virgin birth (!?) at just the right time and place in the story's timeline; but still, changing the touchstone of the Force from humanity to bacteria was a poor, poor decision.  Episode I is a visual delight, the lightsaber duels light-years beyond those in the original trilogy; but the original had magic.  And that, I hope Mr. Lucas will understand, is something that all of the digital effects and funny, diverse aliens in the universe cannot replace.  The relevance of this long tangent, then, is that it enables me to say this:  when Return of the Jedi ends, as flames dance before Luke and consume his father's bier, cleansing the black armor and rising into the night, as John Williams' powerful composition presents the Force theme one final, stirring time, there is magic; there is myth and the closing of a cycle.  Treasure it, but keep what comes ""after"" separate -- in a galaxy far, far away. (Of course, it may be that Episodes II and III are able to find the magic again; the great questions remain unanswered:  why did Anakin turn?  how was his body shattered then armored?  I hold out that hope; 5 of 6 would be remarkable. Time will tell.)",
829,27 May 2002,Mr. Brown,10, The best of Star Wars,"This is my favorite Star Wars movie. I know that a lot of fans say that it is the worst of the old movies. But I disagree. As a space opera as Star Wars really is, this movie is perfect. The weird kind of hidden humor in it is fantastic, and the way Mark Hammil portray Luke becomming a Jedi is also great. It also have the best opening scene I've ever seen. The hole thing at Jabba's place is just great. It has nothing special to do with the plot, but it still takes a great deal of time, typically space opera. Anyway, I won't write more because there are probably zounds of other post out there that you want to read.",

832,4 June 2020,b-82246-78377,3, Return of the Jedi,"I'm not sure who should be blamed for this disaster of a movie, it's either the director or the writer...oh wait, they're both Rian Johnson. Maybe it's Disney's fault for hiring him. Or, maybe it's George Lucas for selling his franchise to Disney (hard to blame him though - $4 billion). Rian Johnson either hates Star Wars or just has a complete disregard for the fans. It is so different that it doesn't feel connected to the saga at all. The characters seem different and there is a blatant disregard for the importance of continuity within the star wars universe. This is the second of three new star wars films. The first, the force awakens, set the stage with some exciting new characters and stories. Poe Dameron is a studly x-wing pilot. Rey is a young scavenger on Tatooine with a mysterious past. Finn is a runaway Storm Trooper and potential love interest of Rey. Kylo Ren is the grandson of Darth Vader and has turned to the dark side. Snoke is an evil leader of the First Order and possibly Sith Lord more powerful than the Emperor from the last trilogy. Best of all, the first movie ends with Rey meeting Luke Skywalker and presenting him with his first lightsaber which he lost when his hand was severed by Darth Vader in the Empire Strikes Back. With eager anticipation, we waited for this next movie to see Luke again and discover the answer to many of these new mysteries. During this break between the movies, a fan made a short movie and posted it on youtube called the legend of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber. This short video had me pumped about the Last Jedi. Unfortunately, hopes were dashed. We are taken back to the scene as Rey and Luke meet. He takes the lightsaber from Rey, looks at it, and tosses it over his shoulder like a piece of trash. Don't get me started on how Rian character assassinates Luke Skywalker and turns him into a crotchety old dude who just wants to die and let the entire Jedi Order die with him. As the movie plays out, none of the mysteries from the first film are answered. Who are Rey's parents? What about Snoke? Not only do we not find out if Snoke is a Sith lord, he dies faster and easier than the average stormtrooper. What about Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren? Or for that matter, who are the Knights of Ren? What about the love story between Rey and Finn? They barely have screen time together in this film. Why is the studly Poe Dameron now an insubordinate punk? Are you starting to understand why Rian Johnson received so many death threats? Still, in true Star Wars form, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic. And, the special effects are very well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs. While The Last Jedi doesn't come close to the standard that's been set by previous Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (barely).",

835,18 February 2014,frylock313,10, Superb Film. Excellently made for its time.,"I was watching the Siskel & Ebert special as to why Star Wars is considered so successful, and no one said it right better than these two late critics. What better way to innovate storytelling, along with filmmaking, than to mix the elements of old mythologies with new technologies. This film is a pure example of that blend. To have such large scale planetary visages in shots, the hundreds of ships zigzagging through space, the montage of creatures in the lair of Jabba the Hutt, and the excellently choreographed hand-to-hand fights. While some people claim this film is not as good as the previous two entries, I disagree. This film brought the whole series full circle, and ended it on a note that's not seen with most trilogies.

If, after the funeral pyre scene where Luke is burning Darth Vader's body, and the camera pans up to the stars, if the film finished there, this film would have scored a 10 from me. But unfortunately we get Ewoks playing drums with the empty helmets of stormtroopers, and everybody generally frolicking about. The same with Phantom Menace, end the film after the camera sweeps to Palpatine looking into the fire, a great place to leave everybody wondering what is going to happen next. Instead we get the gungan parade. Ho hum, hopefully George will not have a corny celebration scene at the end of Episode 2, but I doubt it.",

The action is entertaining, and the characters are great; Darth Vader remains possibly the greatest villain in cinematic history, and Luke Skywalker one of the greatest heroes. The cinematography is great - just as great as in the previous two movies.

This movie contains more memorable quotes than probably all other Hollywood movies combined. Too bad not too many filmmakers follow George's formula of action, special effects, dialogue and over all quality. It has at least traces of a forgotten art in movie making that I hope makes a come back -- character development If you haven't seen this movie see it, it is the third best movie ever made of course, behind ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"".

Now before anybody loses their minds based on what I've just said, please allow me to explain. First off, I love four out of the six Star Wars movies made...yes, four. But the reason this one is so close to my heart is because there is so much depth and cinematography in this film. first off, there is very little, but also very much change to characters in this episode. Obviously, Luke Skywalker being the main example of character progression throughout the series. In this film, he finally embraces the way of the Jedi and at the same time, carries many qualities of a Sith as well. He does have anger and hate, and that is what drives him to the conclusion of this movie, and that is what I love about it. Also, the progression of the relationship between Han and Leigha..absolutely amazing. You literally cannot talk about Star Wars without talking about that romantic side of the story. And it is perfectly revealed in this movie. Yes, it may not be the best written of the episodes, or even the best film of the episodes, but the elements within the film are enough to warrant this film a perfect 10/10.",

It's really hard to compare any other movie that can contain action scenes, drama, and unexpected turns better than this movie. I have watched it multiple times to the point where I know every line in the movie (also with episodes IV and V). Can't say the same for Episodes I - III, quite honestly they fall behind any of these 3, and also Episode VII, which felt like a remake of Episode IV for a new generation. Not bad at all, although was expecting a bit more original story.",
845,27 April 2004,thatguymikey2,10, best of the series,"basically, this was the best movie of the series in my opinion. Sure it didn't have character development, but thats because, in general, if you are wrapping up a trilogy the characters were set in the first two, so you don't go and spend time one developing characters. Which leaves for dialogue, which was probably the funniest one-liners of the series. There were some dark moments and yet the ewoks' presence countered that keeping it watchable and not over-bearing. Special effects were also at their best in this movie as well. George Lucas provided a script that was fun for everyone to watch and yet also serious enough for this trilogy to conclude and several years later to begin again. Overall the best in my opinion. -mike",

I mean, they were brave little fighters and all that, but they were - and come on lets admit this - annoying!! As for the plot, yeah, i agree, it was just like the first film. Maybe they could have come up with a bit of a different idea than another Death Star (Yawn!) For Heaven's sake! Didn't they learn their lesson in the first place.

If Vader's life was dependent on his life support system and a few seconds of force lightning messed that up and killed him, then why didn't any of his 'followers' (And I'm sure many wanted to commit regicide on their leader) use the same trick on him. They knew he was on life support (right?), the breathing surely showed some signs, and It wasn't fatigue(Vader doesn't move often) or heavy smoking so they could've killed him if they wanted to, with any source of electrical current? (I'm overdoing it here I know but it's a valid point right?) Your humble opinions (and please make jokes,the subject deserves it';)",

The technology was really developed at the time, and Lucas' imagination is so big! So, what I noticed now... Luke did not bring the balance to the Force. And this is strange to you, huh? He just helped. The real Chosen One was Anakin Skywalker, who was chosen by Qui-Gon Jin. Qui- Gon new that he will defeat the Emperor, and he didn't tell Obi-Wan what he probably knew. Anakin Skywalker was fighting like a real Jedi, until the Revenge of The Sith, when he wanted to save Padme. But, the Emperor killed her, wanting Vader to be alone. But, I think he always thought of her, even in his robotic years. When Luke was tortured, Vader became more humane. So... He killed the Emperor. He is the only Chosen One. He finished the job, the dark side lost. That would be my review!",

852,24 March 2016,jdiego-98567,9, Just a personal opinion from a fan,"I will do this review simple. It had great special effects for the epoch, I must admit. I enjoyed this movie so much when I was little, and until now I remember the emotion I lived when I saw it. The fierce battles, the hope the protagonists had. Their emotions were easy to see, how they reacted against the Empire's attacks. Yet, the young Jedi was able to confront them, and finish all this universal war, thanks to his bond with his father, a bond too hard to break, not even the Emperor could. You can also experience the war with other living thins, like the wookies, something we can out in real life: we as humans, needed the animals for wars and battles, and now, is very helpful for our alimentation. There are many other things we can get from all the franchise, but it is up to you if you want to watch it. Yet, I highly recommend to see this fantastic movie, there will have some feelings and emotions that will go through you. You will love the movies, I can tell you from my personal experience.",

Episodes 4 thru 6 are my favorites, of course, being a child in the late '70s. However, after seeing Episode 3, I have a question regarding a conversation between Luke and Leia in Episode 6. I believe Luke asks Leia about their mother and she replies (misquote) ""she was beautiful, but sad"". Is Leia referring to their real mom, Padme? And if so, is that possible, being that Padme died in childbirth? Again, I am sure that many avid Star Wars fans know distinct details that I may have missed, but this one thing just stuck out to me. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",
