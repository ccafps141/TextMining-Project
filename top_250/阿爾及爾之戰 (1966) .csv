2,27 October 2020,Xstal,9, The Hypocrisy of Occupation...,"You will struggle to find a better argument to dissuade budding and existing occupiers of territory they have no legitimate claim to embarking on, or continuing with their despotic occupations of populations and their lands. The people of Algiers demonstrate as determined a will to overthrow their oppressors as their oppressors had demonstrated just over a decade previously in their fight to regain their freedom from tyranny. It is however, the gripping presentation of a reality into a thoroughly convincing and believable portrayal of that reality that grabs the audiences attention, giving it longevity, linking it to future conflicts, keeping it relevant. It leaves you questioning what you would have done under the same or similar circumstance, while juggling the difference in semantics between freedom fighter and terrorist and considering the situational similarities that currently exist in the world today.",e

4,21 February 2000,ryzzard,10, A savage war of peace.,"An historian writing about the Algerian war against the French colonial authorities entitled his book ""A Savage War of Peace"". ""The Battle of Algiers"" provides many answers to that enigmatic title. It does not attempt to show us the entire war but centers on the city of Algiers. Even though you are told at the beginning that no documentary footage is used it is at times hard to believe as many of the images you see have a stark and often unsettling reality to them. Considering that this was a co production between Algeria and Italy the film is remarkable in that it does not turn itself a political tirade by taking sides. Instead the camera is a sort of neutral observer allowing us to witness events that spiraled from individual demonstrations to a full scale war of savage intensity. French officers who fought the Nazis a few years before degenerated into the mode of their former enemy while Algerians had no problems exploding bombs that would kill their own people. The camera shows no heros or villains but humanity in its darkest forms. This is a powerful film with superb direction and cinematography. It truly is one of a kind and once seen will never be forgotten.",i
5,31 May 2008,claudio_carvalho,10, Powerful and Impressive Masterpiece,"In 1954, the National Liberation Front of Algiers shots many French policemen beginning a movement for the independence of their country; in return, the Chief of Police plants a bomb in the Arab quarter, killing many dwellers. The NLF sends three women with bombs to two bars and the Air France office in the European quarter, killing many people. The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command. In 1962, the Algerians finally achieve their aimed independence.",e
6,4 October 2003,jazzest,8, Masterpiece with Historical Accuracy,"Capturing a historic incident/moment with extraordinary accuracy makes a film truly beautiful, painful, and masterful. With the tradition of Italian Neo Realism and French New Wave - i.e. shooting in location and casting nonprofessional actors, The Battle of Algiers harshly seals the ugly realities of both French Legion and Algerian Guerillas - i.e. indiscriminate bombs, tortures, and scapegoats. Ennio Morricone composed one of his early successful scores.",w

10,21 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,9, Great and important movie,"It's from 1954 onwards in Algeria and there's revolution in the air. This docudrama takes on history from both sides. Col.

On the other side, Ali is an illiterate hustler always in trouble with the cops. He is recruited into the revolutionaries after spending 5 months in prison.",4
11,16 March 2010,Hitchcoc,10, Much Like Today,"As this film unfolds, we have a sense that things are happening before our very eyes. The movie is so documentary-like as to seem like a stationary camera has been set up in the midst of turmoil. The French imperialists are the reason all this is happening. Obviously, years of ""rule"" make the day to day existence hard to change. Do all the Algerians want an overthrow of French rule? Probably not. Maybe not even a majority. As the rebels blow up restaurants and airport waiting rooms, the police are torturing the rebels. It becomes a cesspool of the lowest form of human degradation. And yet, what else can be the answer when a single entity has such a foothold and ultimate military power. As is usually the case, attrition does the job. With our current situation in the Mideast and Afghanistan, will we find ourselves reproducing what happened to the Russians? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers because the fight is against oppression. The kicker is that there is so much human and economic expense involved in these situations that often it takes centuries. We need to ask ourselves what is gained and one cannot put a price on the human soul. This is a masterpiece of movie-making should be seen by any who think revolutions are clean and the enemy is easy to define.",7
12,14 April 2005,The_Void,4," Cold, brutal and hard to connect with","The problem with films like The Battle of Algiers is that while they offer a stark portrait of a true-life event, they also lack any kind of emotion and so connecting with the film is not easy. The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers, but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers, so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me; and through it's lack of emotional connection; I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout, and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film begs a question of it's viewer - namely, why are you watching this? However, while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question - the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry, and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic, as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side; and we have the question; indeed, why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment, that's for sure.",2
13,22 September 2012,Theo Robertson,10, Can A Mere Movie From 1966 Influence The 21st Century ? Maybe,"What everyone forgets nowadays is that the French contribution to counter insurgency warfare was "" The ink spot strategy "" which was very effective against the Viet Minh in the early stages of the French Indo-China conflict 1946-54 . The same strategy was used most effectively by the British in Malaya in the 1950s where it crushed a communist insurrection , though it was painfully ineffective when the Brits used it in Afghanistan 50 years later . We can all remember the hurtful comments about France being shouted from The White House during Dubya's era but didn't stop the irony - if not out and out hypocrisy - of the same politicians watching this film in order to pick up a few tips on counter insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan ",3
14,11 March 2005,rosscinema,9, This film attains a level of importance that has never been achieved before,We all go to the movies because we love to be entertained and it's hard to argue that it's the greatest form of entertainment but when serious viewers talk about film in terms of being important you would have to expect this title to be instantly brought up. This film covers the years from 1954 to 1962 in Algeria when the Arab section of Algiers started an uprising to fight the French and gain their own independence. Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) is a petty thief and hustler and when he gets out of jail he teams up with El-hadi Jaffar (Saadi Yacef) and together they form the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in which they start terrorist attacks.,8
15,7 July 2019,bkoganbing,8, France's illusion,"Told in a brutally realistic style The Battle For Algeria is the ultimate in docudrama. Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo made this film with a bit of distance
between the French-Algerian War post World War II. Pontecorvo skillfully uses
documentary footage to blend in nicely with the story he shot. You think you
are getting an inside look at the war.",2
16,9 May 2005,osteodude,10, learn from the history it conveys,"If one has not seen this film, one cannot begin to imagine Pontecorvo's extraordinary achievement. The acting is so natural and convincing that many viewers and even some critics assumed that the movie was a documentary. Only a master director could have taken this raw acting material and gotten such performances out of it. And despite his leftist viewpoint, Pontecorvo neither ridicules or demonizes the French, as does Michael Moore the Americans in his recent putative documentaries Bowling at Columbine and Farenheit 9-11 - though I do a disservice to Pontecorvo to compare his work to that of Moore.",8
17,29 August 2022,christopher-underwood,8, the two hours go fast,Although most of Gillo Portecorvo's films are usually documentaries and in this fantastic one it is clearly reconstructed and with the grainy newsreel looks as if it is real. The two hours go fast and because the story is so well told that we watch the amazing streets and alleys and steps of the wretched white buildings and the Casbah. There is also the rather brutal French occupiers and their torture methods. The Italian style we know as neorealist and it works so well that we think that even of the thousands of people we can hardly imagine it was not really we have actual seen in the streets. It is all so terrible that we begin that maybe the bombings and shootings by the Muslims have our sympathies and we certain have the wonderful music of Morricone.,/

19,3 June 2006,Quinoa1984,10," as fitting a tip-of-the-hat to Rossellini's post-WW2 work made in the 60's, and them some","A couple of times here and there watching Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, winner of the 1966 Golden Lion at Venice, I thought off-handedly (maybe with a smidgen of sarcasm), 'this is probably one of the top 5 favorite films of like Rage Against the Machine or something'. It's not without saying though that once the film was over, and watching a bit more on the extra features on the DVD (with other directors shining light on their opinions on the film), that most of what I saw sunk in a little deeper. This is one of the best kinds of documentary-style dramas made in its time and place in the world, and goes a bit further in the right direction from Roberto Rossellini's post-war trilogy. While it's not unlikely to see Pontecorvo's own influence from the neorealist maverick, it's also likely to see how Pontecorvo takes this very emotionally charged, as-factual-as-possible story of Algiers versus France in the mid 1950s with an assured balance of pathos and style. It also works tremendously as a kind of 'statement' movie, without at all pushing it down the viewer's throats. It does have a viewpoint, as do most films, and here and there it definitely does drive home the point of the Algiers' need for freedom from the militant oppression of France.",r

21,16 February 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, The Birth of an Algerian Nation.,"The Battle of Algiers is a very unique war film. It is a documentary-style depiction of an uprising in Algiers against the French, and has the rare distinction of being told partly from the point of view of the radicals who, in this case, were terrorists. The film is very informative because, unlike most war films, it is told alternately from multiple points of view. This switching back and forth between several different perspectives provides a unique experience in watching the suffering that went on in Algeria during that nation's struggle for independence. ",f
22,19 November 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""...it's hard enough to start a revolution, even harder to sustain it, and hardest of all to win it.""","Once you become absorbed in this film, there are times when you accept it almost as a documentary. Having no knowledge of this aspect of history, I thought the picture did a good job of setting the table regarding the French-Algerian conflict with a roughly decade long running history of violence and terrorism involved on both sides. What seemed overwhelming was the amount of destruction. Though obviously staged for the film, it looked like the events were real and lent a surreal quality to one's viewing. More than anything, one can't help feeling that what we see in the world today in the Middle East or in terrorist affected locations around the world, that there's nothing new about war and conflict. Violence sparks retaliation in a never ending cycle while the ideologies that drive that violence is never compromised by opposing forces. It doesn't make for a lot of hopefulness for the human condition.",_

This should give you some idea of the picture's startling documentary-realism. It's plain that director Gillo Pontecorvo began his career producing documentaries, and it is thoroughly exciting to see him exploit his knowledge of the medium to achieve incredible resonance through its brutal and frank depiction of an anti-colonial revolution. There are countless moments when you could swear that Pontecorvo made use of historical footage; surely such a passionate rally comprising hundreds of people could not be recreated so flawlessly for the screen. The camera sits amid the protesting civilians, is jostled by the crowd, reacts frantically to the spatter of machine gun fire, and trembles with each horrific street bombing. Accompanying these images booms a suspenseful musical score, composed by both the director and the great Ennio Morricone.",u

30,9 July 2006,planktonrules,8, very good but oddly filmed,"This is a documentary-like film about the Algerian revolution against the French in the 1950s and 60s--though 95% of the movie is set between 1956 and 1957. At first, it appears to be a documentary-like film about a revolutionary named Ali Le Pointe. It follows him episodically from his teenage years, to his joining the FLA (the Algerian Independence group) and follows many of his terrorist exploits as well as those of his compatriots. However, despite this being the focus, the film then diverges towards other characters and even after Ali's death, the film continues--giving spotty accounts all the way up until their independence in 1962. While the film is greatly admired and it does seem to show both sides of the equation, it looks as if the film was made by two or more directors and then pieced together, as the focus and style of the film changed repeatedly. While this doesn't undermine its overall impact, this keeps it from being a truly great film.",
31,16 December 2004,FilmSnobby,7, Scandalously relevant.,"I disagree with the comments here stating that Gillo Pontecorvo's *The Battle of Algiers* is an even-handed account of the Algerian uprising in the Fifties. I had always thought, perhaps simple-mindedly, that the movie was clearly on the side of the denizens of the Kasbah. After all, the script was inspired by the life and activities of a FLN leader who also literally acts in an important role in the movie. Seeing the movie again -- via Criterion's absurdly lavish 3-disc (!) edition -- did nothing to alter my opinion, though it DID provoke some new perspective on why the movie may SEEM even-handed.",

35,30 November 2007,dwpollar,6, Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution...,"1st watched 11/30/2007, 6 out of 10(Dir-Gillo Pontecorvo): Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution in the late 50's and early 60's from France's occupied police-rule. This is one of those movies that takes you places American audiences aren't used to seeing and brings you a perspective that is sometimes hard to swallow. This is a very good recreation of a true story about a country of people who will go to all means to bring about their independence including terrorist bombings on innocent people to get their point across. For us, it's initially hard to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys because both groups use similar methods to try and control the other group. The movie starts in the middle of the conflict(it's really not a typical battle) at a point where a member of the rebellion after being tortured gives away the hiding place of the last leaders in the city of Algiers. It then goes backwards to the beginnings of the rebellion and kind of shows how the main core of the group is formed and where they came from. There is an obvious slant toward the Algerian rebels despite some of their not so kosher cleansing process and terrorism tactics, but their oppression from the French government is shown as needed to be toppled at any means. The movie then continues up through the initial scene until the eventual independence that occurs, but not without many casualties. This realistic, documentary-like movie does not back away from actual violence and it's after-effects, but keeps us interested with a linear American-like story. There is definitely a little lacking in the portrayal of the characters at the expense of the story but overall it keeps your interest. The movie is definitely not like most battles, but instead is a calculated series of incidents done by both sides until someone has to give in. Eventually the French find all the leaders in the rebellion in the city, but the rebellion leaks to the countryside where it wins out in 1962. Again, the interest of this movie for me was learning a new society, it's history and it's ways more so than seeing an action-filled movie experience.",

Though, it may be under the context of which I was watching this film that made me unable to connect with it. 1966 neo-realistic film that had a very specific feel to it. Something I could appreciate was that no actual documentary footage was used in this film, but some scenes sure felt very real in a way that put the viewer right in the middle of the action. Based on the Algerian revolution of 1962. But the grit and grim of this film never brought me to sympathize for the rebel Algerians. I never managed to be won over by the ""others"".

39,17 November 2007,poe426,10, Inside and outside...,"Although in the final analysis there's just a single ""side"" (we're all, like it or not, made of the same stuff- to the very core), it can be- and has been, interminably- argued that there's an inside and an outside (especially if you're a politician or a religious fanatic). ""Place your bets,"" someone says at one point in THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS. That one statement says much (too much, perhaps) about wars like this one. The bottom line is, all too often, the bottom line (and nobody knows that as well as Americans: in this country, money not only Talks, it clearly Walks- especially when one is forced to ante up in the hallowed halls of Justice, which can be an expensive proposition, indeed). The opening sequence with the guillotine lends a Grand Guignol ghoulishness to the proceedings. Evenhanded film-making? Perhaps. As someone posits along the way, ""Men have two faces."" Two men, therefore, have four faces. Some of the carnage here has all the objectiveness of newsreels, and THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS certainly manages to capture the feel of a city (and two Peoples) under siege. (The claustrophobic interior shots involving explosions are truly amazing; it's a miracle no one was killed.) When the soldiers (whose bullying has forced fed-up civilians to strike back) opt to ""make their own opportunities,"" by way of torture no less (""Legality can be inconvenient.""), one can't help but lament- again- the timeliness of this movie. Excellent guerilla film-making.",

An important decolonization war, it was a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare, maquis fighting, and the use of torture by both sides.
The Battle of Algiers remains to this day an important film associated with Italian neo-realism cinema. A failure to win ""hearts and minds"" it was considered as important material by some in the consideration of the outcome of a War on Terror in Iraq and perhaps even highly prescient.
It is a highly dramatic film shot in a documentary reel style with non-actors. While banned for five years in France it now is considered one of the great films of the 20th Century. Its achievement is not only its power of storyline and narrative but the effect of appearing as truth stylistically. No stock news footage is used which is astonishing for the realism it succeeded in depicting. Its value has increased from a historical point of view because those involved with the actual skirmishes and conflict will no doubt have seen the film differently in 1966.",

Following several Algerians as they attempt to pull from beneath French rule, the film wastes little time on character development, instead focusing on the big picture. These people are desperate in their quest to get away from colonialism. Pontecorvo makes no bones about his leftist slant, even inserting a scene of a French police officer blowing up an entire neighborhood, for no real reason other than to let the audience know that the French deserved the death and destruction caused by the constant barrage of bombing, shootings and stabbings that have been plaguing the streets.

After Algerians kill random people in the street, the French retaliate by throwing bombs into random's Algerian's houses and vice versa. The violence just keeps escalating.

48,9 August 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6, Really good historic movie about North Africa and its violently emotional rise to independence,"""La battaglia di Algeri"" is a Italian/Algerian co-production from 1966 mostly in the French language, so this one is already way over half a century old. The director is Italian Gillo Pontecorvo and he is also one of the two writers coming up with the script here. This movie uns for minimally over 2 hours and is in black-and-white, which is not a given for mid-60s, but not too unusual either. I think for most of the people working on this film, it is their most famous career effort no matter if behind the camera or in front of it. I will not go into detail about any of the cast members really because I don't know a lot about them if at all, but you know where and how to check them out anyway. Okay as for the movie. I must admit it took me a little while to really start appreciating it, but when I did I ended up liking it a lot and it got better and better the longer it went. It feels really raw and unpolished most of the time, also a bit like a documentary for sure. I am still surprised to see some of the award srecognition it got. First of all, it managed the unusual feat to be nominated for Oscars not just in two different years, but not even in successive years, now that is really strange, amybe even unique. Anyway, it probably has to do with release dates. I am still glad it got the awards recognition.

49,25 November 2007,Andy-296,10, One of the best political films ever,"One of the best political films ever, about the 1954-1957 uprising of Algiers against French colonial rule. As the film shows, the uprising was brutally crushed, but the seeds of independence had already been sown, and in 1960 a new uprising, covering all Algeria, would rise up, and the country would become independent two years later. The French colonists, who numbered more than a million and who had lived in Algeria for more than a century, would be expelled after wards, marking a complete defeat for France. Made in 1965, with financing by the Algerian independent government, it is nevertheless surprisingly fair in some aspects. It shows the brutal terror tactics employed by the FLN (the main Algerian liberation group) like bombing bars and discos used by the Europeans. It also shows the French colonel in charge of suppressing the revolt (played by the only professional actor in the cast) in a quite positive light: in a film without true heroes, he is probably the most sympathetic character, competent and self-effacing, even if he doesn't flinch in using torture to crush the revolt (torture being in his mind the only method to destroy the FLN's cell structure). And, perhaps inadvertently, by showing the terror tactics used by the FLN, it suggests the oppressive, antidemocratic nature of the future independent government of Algeria. Overall, one of the must-see films in every cinephile list (and in any person interested in the politics of the region or in anti terror tactics).",

51,26 December 2012,Artimidor,10, The price of freedom,"""The Battle of Algiers"" undoubtedly ranks among the most unique, innovative and essential war films to date. Especially because it comes entirely without the pathos, glorification, special effects and artificially created drama that crowds want to see to get some entertainment out of war. Instead the viewer gets a fresh historical scenario - the 1956/57 Algerian insurrection of the National Liberation Front (FLN) against the French colonists. Following the events laid out in the ""Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger"", a book written in prison by of one of the former FLN leaders, Yacef Saadi, it is an unvarnished account of a brutal reality that emerged as a natural consequence of colonial oppression. To add to the realism Yacef Saadi - now an Algerian senator - even plays a key part in the production.",

On the other hand, it is a traditional view of a conflict between a guerrilla movement for the liberation and a colonial superiority.

This is as intimate as any film about warfare is ever able to get.The focus is on guerilla warfare and its practitioners. There are is no glory or machismo involved, these are authentically frightened people driven from political protest to suicide tactics.Rather than being able to confront the enemy face on the N.L.F. spend most of their time hiding in disused buildings, using children as bomb-runners, and fleeing from soldiers disguised as women. When the occupying French forces are fleshed out they are either insouciant and world weary, as with Jean Martin's Colonel, or simply teenagers on their National service and anxious to get home. The political focus of the film is on the science of revolution; propaganda, counter-propaganda, determinism, etc. Therefore the viewer is not stirred or moved by the film but rather hit with the fact that certain conflicts are irreconcilable and there is nothing to be done about it. In this sense it is one of very few films with a Marxist concious that will ever hope to reach a mass audience. One brief technichal difficulty lies in the excessive use of real outdoor photography bleaches the majority of the screen white, and therefore makes the subtitles at times difficult to read. However it remains one of films most implacably well informed films of conflict.",

But I was really mistaken! ""La Battaglia di Algeri"" is a sober but deeply moving film. It portrays the fight of the Algerian people against the french for their freedom. Even if the film tries not to take sides, it is clear from the beginning that the french (short of employing nazi or israeli tactics) were fighting a losing battle, because they were fighting against a rising nation.",

It was interesting to see how many men and women join together to seek revenge against another group. The director cleverly uses imagery to make the viewers see the insight of a terrorist mind. The attacks and battles are insane among one another, accusations towards the innocent. It was an interesting film to watch if you enjoy battle and war films.

Basically, shot in documentary style and commissioned by the Algerian government, this film sees the guerrilla war between the French foreign legion and the Algerians between 1954 and 1962. We see the battle from both sides, as the French were defeated in Vietnam and want to prove their worth, while the Algerians want independence, so the military forces from both sides are sending in weaponry and bombs to claim their victory. We see the bad things that happen to those who were part of, and some innocents that were, until the final conclusion when Algeria won the war and achieved their independence. Starring Yacef Saadi as Saari Kader/Djafar, Jean Martin as Col. Mathieu, Brahim Haggiag as Ali La Pointe, Tommaso Neri as Captain, Samia Kerbash as Fathia, Fusia El Kader as Halima, Ugo Paletti as Captain and Mohamed Ben Kassen as Petit Omar. I will be honest and say that the story, if there was meant to be one, was a bit too complicated for me most of the time, the only scenes I can really remember are the various attack, torture and fighting scenes, so for those I can agree it is a watchable political war drama.

Recognized for the accurate settings, use of everyday people, and realistic scenes and action, the film is highly regarded in the industry. Stars Brahim Hadjadj and Jean Martin as the resisitance and the colonizing force. Because there are so many extras being used in various roles, some of it is over the top. They talk about the casbah, which we know from Algiers, made in 1938, is dangerous, and off limits to most people not born there. Much talk of the FLN, the Front Liberation Nationale, the name of the resistance group, testing new members, and carrying out the actions to free themselves of french rule. Because it was actually filmed in various locations in algeria, we get a great sense of the scenery , even ten years later. It's over two hours long, and gets a bit repetitious. Probably could have been done in a shorter time. A telling moment when the arab women remove their burkas and change their hair and appearance to plant bombs around town, as french women. Up to that point, they had really been following the arabian customs for appearance and propriety. Very well done. The torture scenes get pretty rough, so not for the children!

The film primarily follows FLN leader Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj) as he organises terrorist attacks, initially on French police and later on European civilians, and his nemesis Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), a composite character representing the French military authority. Although clearly sympathetic to the Algerian separatists, the film is surprisingly even-handed, with neither side refraining from targeting non-combatants. The paratroopers use torture to extract the whereabouts of the FLN leadership while the terrorists enlist women and their children to smuggle bombs out of the Muslim controlled Casbah with which to blow-up 'soft targets' such as Cafes in the European quarter. At times the film is almost a didactic documentary on how to set up a resistance movement and how to fight it (at least at the tactical level). Ironically, the back-story of Mathieu includes serving with the French resistance in WW2, as did one of the real-life men on whom he was based (Marcel ""Bruno"" Bigeard)). Other than Martin, the cast are non-professionals and is universally excellent. The footage the paratroopers arriving in Algiers and later riots and street battles with the police is outstanding (the film is so real looking that the U.S. release came with assurances that no 'news-reel' footage was used). The music is excellent, with tradition Algerian music interspersed with a score by Gillo Pontecorvo and Ennio Morricone. One-of-a-kind and highly recommended.",

86,3 March 2006,lebensraum-1,10, An ignored classic,"All I want to add is some more background behind the conflict. Again the main source is Alistair Horne's book ""A savage war of peace"". Alistair Horne wrote a trilogy of books on 20th century French history incorporating Verdun, the fall of France in 1940 and the Algerian war. Although Britain also had an empire it seemed to be able to extricate itself from it in a less bloody manner and those colonies that did see conflict did not see the kind of bloodshed France experienced in Vietnam and Algeria. I think Britain was able to see that the concept of empire was politically, militarily, economically and morally unviable. The French did not seem to see it that way. Alistair Horne wrote that the French seemed to think that if the rebellion was repressed they could carry on ruling Algeria like Ian Smith's Rhodesia or apartheid era South Africa, a totally unrealistic option. I suppose all whites have to accept that attitudes were much more racist in that era which explains a lot. Also I suspect that after the humiliation of 1940 the French military were determined to win a battle. What is not generally known is that most of the Free French troops that fought in Italy and France in 1943/45 were from French north Africa. The brutal battle of Cassino in Italy was brought to a conclusion by these colonial troops making an outflanking manoeuvre over mountainous terraine. Most of the troops liberating Paris were colonial. The natives were liberating the mother country and many of them later led the FLN. French dissatisfaction with the ongoing war led in 1958 to General Charles De Gaulle being called out of 12 years of retirement. Most Frenchmen expected De Gaulle to crush the FLN but De Gaulle was a statesman not a 3rd rate politician and could see that long term France had to let Algeria go. When this became clear the French military in Algeria felt betrayed and astonishly tried to stage a coup d'etat in mainland France. It failed of course and many rebel officers went underground and formed a terrorist group called the OAS which murdered people in both mainland France and Algeria. The coup attempt was a PR disaster and most French people now wanted out of Algeria.",

89,24 January 2005,stephen-357,9, A masterpiece of documentary style film making.,"This film should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand specifically what we're up against in our ""war on terrorism."" Even though Gillo Pontecorvo's film was made in 1966 and documents events that took place in Algiers four years earlier, little has changed in terms of the mindset, structure, strategy and implementation by terrorist organizations, almost as if they've been in a vacuum all these years; indeed, this is the major cause of the ""Arab Predicament"" today. Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, it would seem this film is more documentary than cinematic fiction, and with Marcello Gatti's grainy B&W photography (many scenes filmed with a hand-held camera), this impression is not that far off the mark. Since the struggle for independence from France was so fresh in the minds of most Algerians, the participants in the actual events were used in the film, and once Pontecorvo and his team recreated the atmosphere and visuals, the emotions of the people were ignited again and suddenly they were no longer acting. While THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS does take a position on the conflict, Pontecorvo is remarkably even handed in his approach and does not shy away from difficult questions, but confronts them with brutal clarity and honesty. Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS is an intense, powerful experience, and Ennio Morricone's subdued but emotive score gives the images a resonance that will haunt the viewer long after they've dissolved into closing credits.",

95,15 August 2007,hereontheoutside,10," Brilliant synthesis of historically accurate drama, Italian neo-realism, and cinema verite","Gillo Pontecorvo's 'The Battle of Algiers' is a masterpiece in the finest sense of the word. Few films are as emotionally and intellectually stirring, and complex. The film follows Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj) as he joins and eventually attempts to lead the FLN in the Algerian revolt against French colonial power. Opening with the end we see La Pointe hiding in the wall of a FLN hideout as an FLN member tips off the French army as to where he is hiding. The French Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) is standing on the other side of the wall he is hiding in warning him that he has to come out or he will be forced to blow up the building, killing everyone inside. Then Pontecorvo brings the audience back to before La Pointe joined the FLN. This gives the film a hunting residue of looming failure, a pure sense of hopelessness for the rebels you are pulling for. Or at least the rebels I was pulling for. Part of the beauty of Pontecorvo's portrayal of the rebellion is that it isn't one-sided; it doesn't attempt to say the rebels were right and deserved their independence and the French were occupying dictators. It tends to lean that way, but the portrayal is much more complex than that. Both sides kill innocents in an attempt to seek revenge against those who have injured innocents on their side. The audience relates to, and respects, La Pointe and the FLN, while despising their methods. At the same time you can respect Mathieu and the French for their attempts to end things peacefully and the respect Mathieu shows for the FLN leaders he captures, in private and in the press. Taking in equal parts from the Italian Neo-Realistic tradition and the 60s cinema verite school, the film alternates between gritty footage of the FLN roaming the city streets, plotting and planning their revolt. Humanizing and immortalizing them. Then the footage jarringly rotates to more documentary style footage of Algerians in the streets, striking, protesting or roaming the markets of Algiers. Shot in a, sometimes, grainy black and white the film finds beauty in rawness and jarring, rough shots, finds beauty in the hideous and the luscious. Every bombing, interview, jail, city street or hole in the wall carries a dark, sweeping, beauty that the audience doesn't have to search to find. Easily one of the best films on wartime politics and on revolutionaries ever made. It's haunting, the kind of film that will stick with you for days, leaving you grappling with moral complexities and desiring to determine a more definite sense of self. This is what cinema should be. It can be hard to communicate when a film is this good in an era when criticism lends itself towards the sensational and the linguistically fluid for even the tritest trash film, but this, this is a powerfully moving film. A mix of the raw and harsh eye of Cassavetes, the violently prophetic scenarios of Scorsese and the morally marginalizing notions of Kubrick at his best. An absolute must-see for anyone who considers himself, or herself, a fan, not of film, but of cinema. A film that has never been more apt for America, contemplating the moral complexities of war, and the utter lack of that proverbial line where right and wrong collide.",

This film is really well done about what is essentially a terrorist group in Algiers fighting for their freedom against their French oppressors.

This movie is as impartial and rationally thought-out as every movie should be. Instead in Hollywood we get Pearl Harbor and The Patriot. And soon Black Hawk Down. That one looks like a downer already. Terrorists aren't mere mobs of fanatics who don't have anything better to do. The soldiers fighting them aren't a bunch of patriotic morons who got drafted as they walked out of a war movie. And this movie masterfully reveals both. The direction is superb, and the footage is incredibly convincing--so much that the movie opens with credits emphasizing that news footage wasn't used in the making of the film. But what is even more gripping is the imagery that is used before terrorist acts and military raids--men, women, and children, families, lives about to be destroyed. Don't blink. This movie has nothing to be missed.",

After not watching it for almost 10 years, I tried to stay unbiased and take it for what it is, and to my surprise, I was in trance. it's one of the best movies ever made, why? Because it readapts the truth so meticulously it feels like a documentation of the reality itself. the film doesn't take sides, it doesn't try to give the right to any side on the expense of the other, this movie doesn't play ethics, it just shows the terror that goes on both sides and the story flow to the rhythm of these true events perfectly restaged, to the point it can be considered as a minute by minute reportage of the events. The war of Algiers was so eventful on itself, the Algerian revolutionaries so complex they didn't need writing and it was made 3 years after the Algerian independence so the memories were fresh, the feelings and terror still lived and felt, it's impossible to make such movie nowadays, Every scene is perfect and felt intensely. this movie is cinema witnessing history. perfection",

They can also be visceral and intense in the form of a movie like The Battle of Algiers. This film tells the story of one of the bloodiest revolutions in history. The French occupied Algeria was a desolate and harrowing landscape that became a bloody battleground for the revolutionaries who would stop at nothing to regain control of their country. The film focuses on the leaders of the revolution as they plan violent terrorist attacks against the French to show them they are deathly serious. Parts of the film are also from the French army perspective, following General Mathieu as he hunts down the leaders of the revolution and aims to take them down one by one. These two perspectives create a balanced view of the war, one where we are never quite sure who is in the wrong and it is up to the audience to discern if the shamelessly brutal methods the Algerians use to gain independence are justified or not. It is a difficult film, but one that is executed with visceral beauty and grandeur.",
106,9 August 2009,EijnarAmadeus,8, Majority vs. Minority.,"Paul Greengrass once stated that if he could chose one film that he had directed, he'd chosen 'The Battle of Algiers' (1966), a raw and riveting war-drama by Italian born Gillo Pontecorvo. And you can see Greengrass' influence all the way through; shot like the real deal with a political storyline and an unknown cast, his 'United 93' draws several similarities. Director Pontecorvo was under the influence of Italian masterpiece 'Rome, Open City' while shooting what would become his own grand work; made to feel like a documentary, the film plots around the Algerian revolutionists wanting independence from French government. Using the zoom effect, Pontecorvo aims in on the details of humanity, on the shackled humanity that faces chaos. Adding on emotionally laden music by Pontecorvo himself and master film composer Ennio Morricone, the film certainly finds a beating heart amongst all the smoky ruins and bloody torture. Pontecorvo was by some back in the 60ties declared a ""pro-Marxist"" as he doesn't always steer his motivations objectively, but finely balances the line between propaganda and pure observation. Systematically told in its cinematic narrative and with its journalistic narrator, the film still has a ruthless undertone much because of the importance of the story and the following shackles of war. I warmly recommend this brilliant war-film of 1966 whose influence can be seen in many films - most recently in Steven Soderbergh's 'Che'.",
107,24 November 2009,Joe_Chip_627,9, Superb anti-war drama,"""The Battle of Algiers"" is a film that everyone should see. It presents the historical account of the struggle of Algerian nationalists for independence from French colonists, and in doing so clearly displays the total futility of war. While not as renowned as ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Paths of Glory"", ""The Battle of Algiers"" is a better film in my opinion. Whereas some antiwar films rely on powerful speeches said by great heroes to portray their stance, ""The Battle of Algiers"" has no Paul Baumer or Colonel Dax. Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong. Instead, we have only the shots of bodies, both French and Algerian, being carried away from the locations where bombs have gone off. The style of direction resembles that of a documentary, thus bringing about a more realistic feel. You won't find Kirk Douglas or Lew Ayres here. The result is that the characters don't seem larger than life. This is not a drama made by a Hollywood producer looking for an Oscar; but instead, it is a somber portrait of the futility of war.

There is also a repeat motif which he uses after the bombings of the Kasbah and of the French targets when the carnage of bombs become all too real which is incredibly sad and all the more real for the horrors on screen.

Hundreds of Algerians pack the street in a strike for independence while a huge French tank rolls across the tarmac towards these people, forcing them to the sidewalks.

When three bombs are set off by the terrorists (women who elude the checkpoints), we see their victims, both before and after detonation. Ali, the new recruit to the rebel cause, is hardly sympathetic; he is hatred personified, even if he has plenty to be hateful about. His mentor, Jaffar, is more charismatic, yet even he seems to know things will turn out badly for him. As for Colonel Mathieu, even he is not a conventional villain. Every move he makes is either ordered from Paris or the natural progression from what comes before. What's left, ultimately, are no true good guys or bad guys, no winners, just losers.

Economic and neighborhood segregation between Algerians and French, it made Algerians feel foreign and inferior in their own land. They had all the rights to fight because theirs was a war for independence. French on the other hand, were fighting for their dominance over Algiers. I personally was very surprised by the Algiers women's role in this movie especially during the time they went to place the bombs in the most French frequented public areas. I like those scenes for another very important reason as well. After seeing an Algerian women sacrifice her hair, dressed up like modern French lady and looking at a little boy eyes eating ice-cream and knowing that she will kill that child after a few minutes, it all left me as a viewer without any good or bad opinion about Algerians. Furthermore, that's what this movie is all about; to not point who are the good and the bad characters in this movie, but to show the reality of this war. The involvement of children in the war was very significant and helpful element of the war as well because it is harder to punish or to catch a little child, as we saw in this movie. They were moving through the French military checkpoint transporting weapons then after will be used to kill the French soldiers.

140,15 February 2015,FedRev,10, A controversial film that ultimately sides with those seeking freedom,"The Battle of Algiers is a controversial film about the struggle of Algerian rebels to throw off French occupation. The film depicts the guerrilla tactics of the Algerian insurgency as well as the French counter-insurgency designed to contain and squash the rebellion. Shot in a documentary/newsreel style, the film follows several narrative threads, and takes us inside the command structures on both sides of the conflict. The film ironically points out that the French commander was part of the resistance against the Nazis, and now he's in the role of the occupier, using his knowledge of resistance against those struggling for freedom. Though The Battle of Algiers has a natural back and forth rhythm, showing attacks by one side and then counter attacks by the other, in the end the film's conscience sides with the Algerians struggling for independence and against colonialism. Even though both sides are shown committing acts of violence against civilians, leading some to believe the film is being objective and neutral, the film gives a clear sense of purpose to the Algerians and celebrates their ultimate victory, even though they lose the battle portrayed in the film.

147,23 June 2013,bell-benn,9, Battle of Algiers is relevant today.,"The Battle of Algiers is an Italian film directed by Gillo Pontecorvco, which was produced in 1966. It depicts true events which occurred during the Algerian war of independence from France, which was fought from 1955 – 1962. The events depicted in the movie occurred during the Battle of Algiers which took place from 1954-1957. This film has been ranked in the top 100 films ever made. It was banned in France for five years where it was finally released in 1974. The Battle of Algiers is an important commentary on guerilla warfare. Revolutionary guerilla fighters holed up and grouped together in cells in the Casbah section of Algiers. French paratroopers attempted to wipe them out. The movie is about this struggle and the methods used by both sides. The tactics of the National Liberation Front (FLN) guerilla insurgency and the French counter-insurgency are shown in the film. The French colonial power committed atrocities against the civilian population of their Algerian colony and the colonized insurgents committed atrocities against the civilian population of their oppressors in a spiraling escalation of violence. The FLN engaged in acts of terrorism by placing bombs in public places such as restaurants, nightclubs, and airports, indiscriminately killing civilians in the European Quarter. The French paratroopers tortured, intimidated, and murdered members of the FLN. The use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique is depicted. Algeria eventually won its independence in 1962. Some of the scenes that really struck me were the incidents of waterboarding by the French Paratroopers, the men of the FLN covering themselves in burqas like women to disguise themselves and escape detection, FLN women dressing like European women and carrying bombs in baskets, and in the end the women ululating in victory when Algeria won its independence. The Battle Algiers is as relevant today as it was in 1965.The film was screened by the Pentagon in August 2003 as a field guide to fighting terrorism. Former National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brezezinski, said: ""If you want to understand what is happening right now in Iraq, I recommend The Battle of Algiers."" This film was also used by the Black Panthers as a training film. I am sure there are other terrorists groups that have been influenced by the film as well. The Boson Bombing suspects come immediately to mind. The film, shot in black and white, is a triumph of realistic production values and heavily influence by Italian Neorealism of the 1950's. It was filmed on location in Algiers using the real locations in the European quarters and the Casbah. It was so realistic that Pontecorvo had to issue a disclaimer that not one foot of documentary or newsreel footage was used in his two hours of film. Everything was shot live. The film was nominated for AcademyAwards for Best Foreign Film, Best Screen Play, and Best Director. It was the winner of the Venice Film Festival Golden Lion Award.",

150,11 December 2011,username-taken,8, A film that truly achieves neutrality for an artistic purpose,"In ""Battle of Algiers"", Pontecorvo makes a conscious effort to present an impartial dramatization of the events that took place in Algeria in 1957 by neither demonizing, nor idealizing the Algerian resistance. The film delivers an unapologetic perspective on the injustices faced by the Algerian people, as well as their radical backlash against the French army. ",
151,16 December 2008,eric_mejia,9, A foreign masterpiece unlike any other!,"Gillo Pontecorvos portrayal of the Algerian war against the French paratroopers carefully studies conflict of war and how violence, through escalation, only brings sorrow to those surrounding communities. Pontecorvo's and Franco Salinas' screenplay is very well articulated with memorable quotes and a dramatic structure which that continue to keep the picture tense yet emotionally intriguing. Both Pontecorvo and Salinas chose an interaction of characters from both sides of the war to feel passionate about their stance, thus leaving the picture to sympathize for both peoples, the FLN and the French civilians. Through the deaths of innocents, violence begins to escalate from the beginning, all the way to an explosive ending. Though no protagonist took the film by storm, Pontecorvo weaved a film where all the characters were equally felt for. His structure feels like a race of increasing violent acts, beginning with small gun battles and moving into the direction of time-bombs as acts of terrorism and revenge came soaring. Ennio Morricone's score couldn't help the picture anymore than make it an emotional driven roller-coaster, providing a tear or two in the process. When tension could be felt, Morricone exploded the scene with what sounds like a score of haunting rattling noises that get louder and louder. And finally, when tragedy strikes, like the scene when the Algerians begin looking for their loved ones in the bombs ruffle, Morricone goes into a haunting notion of a score driving one to feel sympathy for the Algerians. Overall, The Battle of Algiers is a foreign right masterpiece telling the horrors of terrorism, without creating a protagonist to sympathize for. It does for what real war does, incorporate a viewpoint from both sides and showcase the peoples pride each side has. It is a haunting story about sacrifices, pride and justice all told to portray freedom as something not so free.",

154,13 June 2011,gutierrez_garrett_an,10, Excellent,"As far as great movies are concerned, this film is the crème de la crème. Its been watched countless times as an example of what to expect when the state or a foreign power is forced into conflict with a civilian population armed with their wits, their intelligence, and what little weapons and technology they can get their hands on. It's not difficult to see how the current conflicts in the Middle East and the American reaction to them relates to this film. In fact, the story of this film relates to any major conflict between an invading force that is more technologically advanced and seemingly more powerful than the population it seeks to control. Both struggling ""freedom fighters"" and the governments that seek to eliminate ""terrorism"" appreciate the film, as it was filmed in a way that creates no sense of hidden variables or any sort of a Manichaean world view. The film is one of the best examples of a world where black and white concepts simply do not exist. At one point, one of the French colonels in charge of stopping the Algerian resistance movement explains that the French government has only two options, and that any concept of right or wrong simply has nothing to do with the task at hand; that if the French want to stay in Algeria, they must accept what must be done, and that entails putting up with brutality and torture as the means to accomplish their end. This film can best be described as ""real."" Nothing about it seems contrived, everything mirrors real life and the gray areas of the world that so much suffering seems to thrive in. Whether you feel that the French are in the right or the Algerians have the moral high ground, Pontecorvo's film will leave you with a better understanding of the other side, despite the fact that you may loathe everything that they stand for. For every act of violence in the film, one cannot find true justification, only explanation, but perhaps that is Pontecorvo's point; that explanation and understanding is enough to get humanity towards whatever sort of peace it tries to attain. Even if you can't appreciate the film for its style, drama, music, or any cinematic aspects, the message is one that all humans can learn from and appreciate.",

This film is so powerful because we see the view of both sides. We see the French side of the army taking over these people and we see the Algerians side and them doing whatever they can to survive. Neither of them is good or bad. They both commit horrible acts on each other and never seem to fins a peace until after the story of the film is over. This film just makes you feel for the Algerians so much that you can't help be on their side but they go about their objective the wrong way sometimes. You attain so much respect for them though for fighting back as they do. In the end their whole purpose was to get their whole community to fight back and they finally did. Instead of bombing and killing they come together and march on the French. The film is all about the power of resistance and how far you can take it.,

Coincidently, we happened to have just discussed in depth France and their past. Battle of Algers is a beautifully crafted film. I especially appreciated the fact that the director Gillo Pontecorvo was neither Algerian nor French because he really humanizes both, rather than favors one over the other. The issue of colonization has been in our history since the beginning and a film like this really opened my eyes to the broad picture. It allow me to see the difficulties of the resistance and their reasoning and the colonizers purposes. My favorite scenes would have to be when the Arab women were walking through town going to plant bombs and while they were there the camera cuts to different people that are in the locations that are about to blow up. This shows the humanity of each of those people and how they all have a story. For a minute or two I thought that possibly the women were not going to go through with their plan, but after realizing what the French had done to their people they didn't think twice. Being that I am a big De Sica fan, I was really satisfied by this film. Neo Realism is my favorite type of films; no professional actors, all on location, no sound stages, real light, and not thoroughly scripted really capture the dignity of the people. I really felt as if it was a documentary but it was all staged. This is a true film and now one of my favorites.",

This movie can also cause the viewer to question their stereotypical view of who is bad and who his not. The passion in the characters cause creates a tensive compassion for the audience. Especially in a time when many people view people from certain countries as evil. The battle fought in this movie is more than for Algiers, it is for oppressed people and societies worldwide.

Many innocent people had to die as each group set out bombs in the Kasbahs and French cafés. No one deserved it and yet it happened because they both wanted to retaliate with each other. After watching this movie, I was appreciative to learn about the history of Algeria and France, but I felt indifferent on who was at fault.

It depicts the conflict between native Algerians and European settlers in which the two sides exchange acts of increasing violence, leading to the introduction of French paratroopers, under the direction of General Massu and then Colonel Bigeard, to root out the National Liberation Front (FLN). The paratroops are depicted as ""winning"" the battle by neutralizing the whole FLN leadership through assassination or capture. However, the film ends with a coda, depicting demonstrations and rioting by native Algerians for independence, in which it suggested that though the French have won the Battle of Algiers, they have lost the war. The movie reminds me of the current situation in Iraq. In May 1, 2003 President Bush announced ""Mission Accomplished""; however, four years after his announcement, the battle has been intensified. Children shoot soldiers, women plant bombs in restaurants and suicide bomber are increasing. This movie is about independence and fighting for belief.

It did pose a strange (yet convincing to some) justification behind people who bomb public areas to make a statement. Side note on the special effects- they were extremely realistic, I can imagine that it would be the equivalent of today's Avatar status CGI. This film had a LOT of thought put into it, acting was convincing especially because it was done with people that indeed participated in the revolution in Algiers. On a historical note, whole thing that was going on with France was extremely hypocritical considering that France had their own revolution against the high ruling class, so it's rather interesting to see them acting like the ruling class over another COUNTRY and find absolutely nothing wrong with it. As far as the ending goes, I can see how it promotes peaceful protest, in the end bombs didn't solve the problem. One of the people I saw this with commented that if it wasn't for the violence beforehand, there wouldn't have been a peaceful revolution in the first place... However I'd reference the Romanian revolution. It was peaceful on our side, yet the communists did not only respond with rifle fire upon the protesting crowds, but also made use of tanks and killed many more that way.

170,13 December 2010,Nbacher,10," The Battle of Algiers focuses on the events of 1957, a key year in Algeria's struggle for independence from France.","This movie is an excellent artifact of the Algerian revolt against their French Colonists in the late 50's early 60's. Many reviews have mentioned how the story of this movie parallels what is going on in Iraq in 2004. It is odd that the policymakers did not notice the slight things that can turn a normal citizen into a terrorist/insurgent. It is how this country was founded There are no faults with this movie. The transfer from Criterion is perfect. It shows how an occupying force wins the battles but loses the war. This film is honest, and balanced, it's so real it's almost like a documentary. As this was made more than 40 years ago, I think a younger audience would benefit greatly from this masterpiece. The movie mentions a relative calm between 1957-1960 before demonstrations and further activism finally forced the French to leave. Though not explicitly stated, I would not be surprised if being aware of other African colonial states gaining their independence in that same time period served as inspirational catalyst to inspire a new leadership to take the place of the individuals primarily the focus of this movie focused mainly in the 1950s. Done in a near newsreel documentary style this film does show the power of struggle for independence on one hand, and the desire to maintain colonial authority on the other. I highly recommend this film.",

I also credit the director and producers for not portraying the Algerians as the most sacred creatures on the planet. The film was well done and seemed to be a fairly accurate portrayal of what it must be like to watch an urban guerrilla war take place.

Gillo Pontecorvo portrayed the Algerian rebels not as cold-hearted individuals, but as individuals who are struggling to keep their culture alive. It doesn't justify their actions, but it can open the viewers mind to why strong actions needed to be taken in order to get their voices heard. Sometimes the political system just isn't enough for an individual to express their outrage of what's going to their culture and country. What makes this film amazing is that story is universal. Several countries have gone through some form of imperialism. What the United States is doing to Iraq is a great example of how this film can bring insight of the ""terrorists"" perspective.",

I enjoyed the time line of the way the movie plays out, with the last few minutes played at the beginning and then the series of events that led up to it after. It really makes you think during the movie about how the characters got to be in the situations that they were in. All in all, I think this movie has an important message about what is going to happen every time you try and hold a certain group of people down. Any minority group restricted in the same way that the Algerians were is going to react in the same way that they did in this movie, and the way the French acted to control the algerians and label them all as terrorists seems to remind me a lot of America.",

This film is based on the events that took place while the French colonial rule in Northern Africa during the Algerian War, most notably the Battle of Algiers. What I really love about this film is that it takes you into the mindset of a normal citizen and you understand why they become a terrorist/insurgent. It's a little terrifying, to be honest, to see what lengths they'll go to in order to insure their freedom. But at the same time, their reason behind the actions is justifiable. True, it leaves you questioning both the French and Algerian for their actions; it's like an unrefined chess match, each move escalating the tension until it just snaps and the violence just reaches an all new high.",
178,13 June 2009,tim-haha,10, Great movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. I would consider it equal with Spielberg's Schlinder's List. The reason why I compare these two films is they are able to take a large conflict and scale it down to size and give faces the the good and the evil. The film follows the resistance of the Algerian people with the French government who has been in power for over 130 years. The basic theme of the movie, (What I took away from it) is eggs must be broken to make an omelet and a whole lot of more eggs need to be broken to win independence from the French. ALI is one of the rebel fighters who joins an organized coalition to kill as many French civilians and ranking French officials. The brains of the rebellion Djafar organizes the killings of many French citizens. Col. Mathieu is part of the French military battling to keep peace among the conquered country. After the Algerian hit squads begin killing French police, innocent Algerians are targeted for the retaliation. After the French civilians retaliate, the Algerians dress their women to look like French women to plant bombs in densely populated clubs and bars. In response to that, the French civilians plant a bomb in a crowded ghetto, destroying houses and many many people. So its a very vicious back and forth with people. After watching the movie for almost two hours I began to get desensitized to the value of life and everyone getting brutally murdered. I don't know if that was the director's plan, but I was definitely feeling psychological strain. Why I think this movie is better than Schlinder's List is the fact we get to see all of the repercussions to every action. Everything that was destroyed had a equivalent disaster that built into a massive chain of events. Schlinder's list is really focused on Oskar Schlinder for the most part. Knowing nothing prior to France's occupation over Algeria, it was a nice history lesson that I would not stumble across unless I took film 7 at Santa Monica with Prof. Carrosco. I recommend him to anyone who enjoys movies and wants to expand their understanding of film as an art-form. Back to the review. In the end, ALI dies and Djafar turns himself in to save his own life. The only criticism I have for great movies that are epic is size is the amount of energy one must invest to get through the movie. Generally I like movies to metaphorically rock my world for the two hours that my eyes are open, but it feels like Godfather long and not more violent in my opinion. Take my advice, watch the movie expecting to see people die and many times.",

This landmark film has the interesting distinction of being at once a propaganda piece and somewhat even-handed. Despite being commissioned by the Algerian FLN government, and certainly ultimately siding with the rebels, it presents the French commander Colonel Mathieu (a stand-in for real paratrooper commander Jacques Massu) in a sympathetic light, and the horror brought on by FLN bombings is in no way minimized. This film achieves a chaotic, tense feel that conveys the essence of the people's war in the Casbah. The characters, almost all of whom display some nobility, commit terrible acts against their enemies, and we see an almost chivalric battle of jaded, duty-bound warriors against fiery nationalist rebels. Above all, the film showcases how the French won the battle of Algiers military but lost the war politically.",

Ennio Morricone did an excellent job, as always.

The film is in black and white instead of color and that is a great thing because it causes the viewer to focus on the Algerians fighting for their freedom in the film instead of the cinematography in the film. This film can be used as a great educational tool to teach others about the history of Algeria.,

The power of the imagery and the music, the complex ethical questions that are posed as a result of the story, the fact that military occupations still occur today, all this left me emotionally devastated. Real-life revolutionary Brahim Haggiag portrays the fictional Ali La Pointe with a subtle intensity. Unfortunately, many of the other non-professional actors fall short in capturing such intensity. But this detracts little from the film, which just produces one memorable scene after another, until the final scenes of revolution. The film actually does an excellent job of taking into account the complexities of the French occupation in Algeria as well. I can't recommend it enough.",

This study of the Algerian guerrilla struggle against the French colonialists in the 50s should be looked at not just as pure cinema but as a warning to those who seek by force to crush independence movements.",
186,21 December 2010,graceism22,8," ""Terrorism is useful as a start. But then, the people themselves must act.""","Battle of Algiers, a film by Gillo Pontecorvo (who is interestingly an Italian director, not Algerian), was originally a controversial film when first released in America due to the negative connections people would draw to Vietnam. What's really amusing is the fact that years afterward, President Bush actually held a screening of this movie in the Pentagon. Bush completely distorted the message of this film and saw it as some sort of manual as to how to defeat the terrorists (oh boy...) I really admired the visual storytelling element of the film, which had a very documentary style to it. All the ""war"" scenes looks like actual footages. I also really liked how Pontecorvo set up the character of Ali La Pointe. The first scene we get of him is this guy running away from the police. He trips on the foot of a wisecrack French guy and Ali has a choice, to keep running to avoid getting caught by the police or to teach the French guy a lesson. Ali punches the French guy in the face. There's no dialogue, no long introduction, just a simple scene and right away we know what kind of guy Ali is. Another interesting point I realized while watching the film was that usually in film where a group of people are conquered by another, the conquered group is usually somehow culturally/socially converted and integrated into society but the Algerians were completely segregated. There wasn't even an attempt to ""moralize"" the ""savages."" I think that's why we get the term of the kasbahs.",

The portrayal of all the characters made the story very interesting with all the guerilla warfare. The overall story was easy to understand and realize that the French were not right in everything they were doing; along with that, the Algerians had the correct concept in getting the French out of their country but their method was a little outrageous. Like most occurrences with two or more countries occupied in one country, similar things happen and the native country tends to take more drastic measures that sometimes end up working to their advantage, but unnecessary measures were took. As all war or fighting, people become greedy and it happened in the instance with Algerians and the French.",

The FLN arose during the war of Algeria against France. The FLN organizes terrorist attacks in restaurants, on the streets, and the airport; which lead to the French police fighting back with bombings and shooting in the streets. It depicted true events of what would have happened, but to me the actors weren't so convincing. The movie seemed to be realistic and catchy, but it left me with a hazy view on the Algerians fight for Independence. Its interesting to watch after the terrorist attacks we've received here in the U.S, to see that problems like this arise anywhere.",

From Col. Mathieu's interview with the press to Ali's encounter with the police officer when attempting an assassination everything seems so real and by the end of the movie both sides are pulling at you for your support.

192,14 December 2011,osilva2010,8, Contemporary Matter,"In ""Battle of Algiers"" (1967) nothing in the film is documentary footage but an actual film with non-professional actors. The events cover from 1950-1962 in Algeria. Before 1962 Algerians had been under French Colonial rule but after years of fighting in 1962 they received their independence. This was the birth of fundamentalism. The French tried to make Algeria there own and input their beliefs into the whole Algerian nation. However, the Algerians weren't any bi standers but did anything possible to get rid of these invaders. A big concept found in this movie is Neo-Realism where it captured the reality of oppression. We discovered how the Algerians were living in somewhat all right houses but compared to the French they were the ones on top. The French personally did care too much about them but as soon as things got rough, they too action. The Algerians only wanted their independence where they can practice their religion, express their culture and pass on their beliefs to future generations. Wouldn't you be angry with a group of people taking possession of one's homeland and fighting over what originally was yours?",

In ""The Battle of Algiers"", the Algerians are resisting colonization because they have enough confidence in their own abilities to make positive changes in their country for themselves and their posterity.

195,15 December 2011,helloroseeee,9, The story of Algerian rebels during the colonization of Algeria by France,"After watching this brilliantly filmed movie you can understand why filmmakers such as Spike Lee and Oliver Stone were influenced by it. Although Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" and Oliver Stone's ""Salvador"" are not about colonization, the human conditions and issues that ""The Battle Of Algiers"" addresses is relevant enough to inspire filmmakers who want to make a movie about human oppression, which exists in many different forms. The way in which Pontecorvo utilizes his skills and cinematic elements available to him to address not a single protagonist, but tell the story from multiple perspectives is one of the reasons I believe this film is successful. The film is able to effectively illustrate the socio-economical problems of colonization and is not biased in faulting either side. The fact that the movie did not fall into the traps that previous movies about colonization had is also something to be praised. The colonizers were not seen as single dimensional killing machines, but rather people with sense and a consciousness as we see in Col. Mathieu. The film also shines a light on terrorism showing the reason, thought, and purpose behind public bombings. The film justifies the realist genre it falls under, and it is hard to believe that every scene was completely staged and scripted instead of documented. It is hard to watch this film and not be left with compelling thoughts or lingering emotions, which, in my opinion, should be the goal of every good filmmaker.",

I'm sure the actors didn't even care about the paycheck. They knew they were a part of something special and wanted to make it great. It's a shame it was banned in the United States, for it could have taught us a lot and maybe we wouldn't even have had so much support for the War in Iraq or Afghanistan.

206,15 December 2011,kaliteyart,9, Interesting point of veiw,"I enjoyed this film because I finally was able to witness the other side to our never ending battle on terrorism. Although this depicts Algiers revolt from the French it's similar to the what's being played out in the Middle East. Living in America, the word terrorist is now associated with people who want to destroy American freedom. I've never been a fan of this idea and always was interested to learn more about the other side, the people who never get a voice. Although I didn't agree with either side in this film, it was interesting to see a more objective stance that almost felt like a documentary. There are shots that feel so real, it's a little uncomfortable, which I guess is how it should be. This film isn't for everyone; it doesn't have an obvious bad or good guy and also doesn't have a set protagonist. Although Ali La Pointe is supposed to be the protagonist, it's more about the people as a whole and their struggle for freedom. It's an interesting film that definitely sheds light on present matters as well as historical ones.",
207,20 December 2010,itzpencil,8, Great movie,"Battle of Algiers was a great movie that portrayed the struggles of the Algerians for their freedom. The way the movie was filmed made it so that I couldn't tell who the bad guy and the victim was. The movie equally showed the destructions that each side caused without much bias on each side.The scenes where each side were bombed by the opposition, they were both filmed in a way that you would sympathize who ever was on the receiving side. This made it even harder to pick a side, which let me really question the justice of the uses violence in those circumstances on either side. Even so, I sympathized with the Algerians because, I am an Korean-American, and because Korea went through similar oppression by the Japanese. Another great aspect about this movie was how realistic the shots of the attacks were. For example the scene where the racing track was blown up it was so realistic that it made people think that the movie was a documentary. A scene that caught my eyes the most was the scene where Ali is tripped by a Caucasian man and they exchange a very intriguing stare. Even though Ali was on the floor, his did not waiver as he stare into the Caucasian man's eyes. I thought that this scene was a great metaphor of the relations between the Algerian and the Americans as a whole. Because even though the Algerians (Ali) is oppressed by the Americans (Caucasian man), the Algerians don't lose their pride and fight on to regain their freedom.",

210,10 June 2011,bigblu-77-926509,7, Review of Battle of Algiers,"Watching this movie, I felt an emotional disconnect. I had no empathy for the plight of the Algerians because the movie made very little attempt to show their plight. You are thrown some facts about Algerians being unhappy with French rule, given a flavor of their mistreatment at the checkpoints, but beyond that, one sees little of what is causing the unrest and cannot make an emotional connection with the characters. In fact, for me, the main character was not likable. At the end of the movie when it states that the Algerians won their independence, it is a purely intellectual process where you think, ""that's good,"" and have zero emotional response. On the other hand, you wonder why the Algerians chose violence as the first resort instead of a peaceful strike, and you are left with a feeling of disdain at the barbaric nature of their resistance. Violence should always be the last resort and should only be in self defense. Of course, one could argue that the French placed the first bomb, but that was a rogue bomb placed for the sole purpose of inciting the Algerians to violence so that the French would respond in kind. For me, the takeaway is the age old message that two wrongs do not make a right.",

If you think of the french as Americans and the Algiers as the citizens of Iraq, one can't help but to realize that we're doing the exact same thing as the French and that the terrorism being brought upon our soldiers is nothing more than retaliation from a people that refused to be conquered. If Bush had watched this movie from beginning to end, he might have revised his invasion of Iraq. This film does a brilliant job of telling us what happens when you try to dominate people. The Battle of Algiers doesn't favor either side in the film, as both are doing some deplorable things, but the message that reached me in the end was that people can't be conquered. The film doesn't shy away from its realism as it confronts the conflict with brutal honesty. None can say that either side is truly good, when you see the evils they both commit, but you can at least realize that there's a reason for every action and to not label things as good or evil. The movie is an intense experience that will make you question what's right and wrong.",

What makes the film so powerful is the city and the people itself, you can sense the anger and the hope. And strangely the film can even make you empathize with the most diabolical acts of terrorism. Now, is it as unbiased as everyone makes it out to be? I don't think so. I think it is pretty favorable to the revolutionaries.

To be afraid of god is if one do something wrong he/she looses the god's compassion and consent . The earth born people are not the subject of to be afraid of so you don't have to lie or do wrong on a purpose of being threatened feelings. how these people kill the french then? because it is permissible to kill to defend your country in Islam.

This year's Arab Spring and Occupy protests make the themes which were presented in the film just as relevant today. An aspect of the film that I really appreciated was its unbiased presentation of the conflict between the French colonizers and the Algerians that they were going to great extents to oppress. Another aspect which I found astounding was that there was not any documentary footage that was used. The unbiased presentation of the issue led me to have an unbiased opinion on the matter as well; sure, the French were definitely wrong for colonizing Algeria, but I also feel that Algeria was going about things the wrong way. Viewing the film can be beneficial in the sense that it would help others in their pursuit of revolution.",

The visceral nature of the film showing the atrocities committed by the French Military and the FLN can be quite difficult to watch.

Its director Gillo Pontecorvo uses Neo-Italian Realism and a monochromatic setting to show the racial tension between the French and the Algerians. The actors are mostly Algerians, and the film is spoken 95% of the time in French. It maybe fair to say that this movie is another Conquest movie of how people of a different belief are ruled under European Ideology. This movie shows the tactics the Gorillas used to slowly one by one take down French officers. However, there is on thing that will impact you is the involvement of children throughout the film. We see children from the Gorilla side being used by their mothers as a decoyed to smuggle bombs to French own/run places. We also see the children in the places where the Gorillas bombed, and also where the French set gun fire or bombed. The Director did this to show the innocent people that lost their lives for independence. This is a movie that makes you think about the price of Freedom and who really does suffer. It's sad once you think of it.",

A fact I have learned from my film professor is, in 2003 months before the U.S. went to Iraq the Pentagon showed this very film as a training video to high ranking generals, and President Bush. Pentagon officials were actually looking at the film so they can see what the French did wrong in Algeria. This is a great film because it relates to the war in Iraq, and the U.S. military is doing the same things that the French military was doing in Algeria.

It is an unbiased film about a revolution that is started by the Algerians against the French who've occupied the country of Algeria and captures how quickly physical revolutionary tactics can turn into horrific terrorist acts, but nothing that we haven't seen already in the US and around the world. The revolution started by the NLF organization, which is doomed to become the 'terrorist' organization fairly quickly, kicks off the uprising by killing French police, then innocent French people on the streets and escalating to bombing entire innocent French hangouts.

But the fact that the Algerians would leave bombs at actual public places sucked!Sure a couple of French people left a bomb at the apartment building was horrible, but they were not military people. they were just two stupid fools.

They then went on to develop them in Indochina (see ""The 317th Platoon""); and after Algiers was ""lost"" a few of the veterans provided ""the inspiration, the training, and some of the intelligence that enabled Latin American dictators to torture and kill thousands of their own citizens"" as documented in the film ""Death Squadrons: The French School.""

My ignorance of the Algerian War was brought to my attention when I was first introduced to the film. Is it a story of a revolution? Or a story about fighting for one's right? The Battle of Algiers draws a fine line between the hero and the villain, in this case the French army against the national Liberation Front. But who truly deserves the titles - protagonist and antagonist? Gilo Pontecorvo transports us into a time of desperation in Algeria, without any bias view; however, as a spectator we always tend to root for the home team, which in this case for me were the people of Algiers. This film is entirely scripted, from a secret wedding scene, to riots in the claustrophobic alleyways of the city. Pontecorvo delivers a respectably deep and enticing, documentary-stylistic film only some can pull off. What better time to use this technique, then re-enacting the Algerian independence movement (1954-1962). As a South American, I know what its like to fight against an unjust and corrupt government, this film conveys truth from beginning to end. After my journey to 1954 Algeria I understood that everyone has the right to fight for what you believe in. There is no good and bad in war.",
244,29 May 2010,Flabeaud,8, Review for Film Class 2010 (Santa Monica College),"I have to admit I had vague knowledge of the occurrences in the capital city of French Algeria between November 1954 and December 1960, during the Algerian War of Independence. The two opposing forces were the Casbah and the National Liberation Front. I had never heard of this film until my film teacher introduced it in class. It was interesting that the director Pontecorvo had several protagonists, based on historical war figures. I found it interesting how the story begins and ends from the perspective of Ali la Pointe -- a petty criminal who is politically radicalized while in prison, and is then recruited to the FLN by the military commander El-hadi Jafer. Jafer is played by Saadi Yacef, playing a character based on himself. The French colonialists resort to lynch mobs and indiscriminate,racist violence against the natives. It was difficult to watch when the women hid bombs on their bodies to kill the Europeans. ""The Battle of Algiers,"" made me realize that I am going to continue to research topics I discovered in my film class.",
245,3 June 2010,aplacecalled_Home,7, Altruism or Theft?,"The film is brilliant, in telling the story of a culture; the Algerian culture that has been forcefully lost amidst the French colonization Italian director Pontecorvo shows the strength of unity within a culture. The loss of ones own cultural identity is something I have trouble relating to as I am an American born citizen. However, the film spoke numbers to audience members of the time in relation to what COULD be the possible outcome of the happenings in Vietnam and what eventually transpired. I respected Pontecorvo's efforts in remaining neutral to the French and Algerian side in his film making process. However, as an audience member I felt compassion for the Algiers alone. The altruistic ""behavior"" of the French were seen as a facade in my eyes. The French overtook Algeria as their own 130 years prior to the story in the film of the Algiers rebellion. They pushed the Algiers into a ghetto where they were surveyed and treated with diminishing respect. Shooting in natural locations and with non-actors made my experience of watching this film a memorable one. When drinking alcohol was prohibited in the country, there is a scene where an old man is taunted by the little children, they chorus ""wino"" and attack him. I felt remorse for the old man, and in the scheme of things his tiny flaw of alcoholism in the eyes of the colonized government was illustrated to me as the beginnings of a dictatorship. A ruling in which a man may not choose his drink or where he treads. The film resonates to cultures all around the world in its message of the examination of a repressed culture that rebels. Pontecorvo does not justify the actions of the Algiers or the French, but rather, he allows the viewer to come to their own conclusion on what is truly altruistic. Consistently throughout the film my conscience chorused ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.""",
246,5 June 2010,helenwithane,9, Film Review for Class,"This film was absolutely spectacular. While watching this movie you feel as if you are watching an actual documentary. The movie shows the french occupation in Algeria and the struggle of the Algerians to win their independence from them. While trying to separate themselves from the French, a group of terrorists begin shooting French officers and even blowing up diners. These Terrorists are not just displayed in the French perspective. You get to know the terrorists in a way, and see their reasoning behind what they are doing. That does not mean this film justifies terrorism by any means, but you feel like you are actually being told their story and not just the stories of the victims of their violent acts. One of the most disturbing parts of the film for me was watching the three women sneak past the French checkpoint and plant bombs in all the public places. You get to see all the different types of people that are in these places, from old men and women in casual conversation to toddlers just enjoying an ice cream. Saying that, it makes the viewer really feel for the many victims in a Terrorist attack and you begin to compare the ordinary people to yourself. This film was dramatic, emotional, and an extreme nail biter. I recommend this movie to anyone looking to see Terrorism from another angle.",

I did not enjoy it to much because the acting was terrible but then, it was created in 1966. It was useful though and it talked about both side and what happened during this time where Algeria wanted its independence.",
248,6 June 2010,rrreginald90,8, Shades of Gray,"This film was incredibly haunting in terms of just how unbiased both factions were portrayed and in the documentary style it was shot in. On one side you have the Algerians who are comparable to modern day terrorists with their bombing tactics and on the other, the French regime who themselves aren't completely opposed to resorting to in-discriminant acts of violence against the Algerian civilians. What I appreciated about this movie was the fact that it was directed in a way that there was no definitive ""good"" or ""bad"" side, that there are various shades of gray and that both sides were merely following the path that they felt was right. By being directed this way, it provides a more human approach to the situation because it symbolizes the fact that there are two sides to each story and that we as the audience are free to pick and choose which side was doing the right thing, if any side was justified at all. Should we as the audience support the Algerians, the oppressed citizens who were subjected to racial profiling that disturbingly mirrors current issues in Arizona and their immigration laws? Or should we side with the French regime who were only doing what their duties demanded of them and in response to the radical Algerians who bombed shops and, in one instance in the film, drove around rampaging and shooting anything that moved?",
249,7 June 2010,liorbraude,10, Remarkable,"As an Israeli I found this 1966 movie to be more relevant to today's global issues than any of the movies that are released these days. Without glorifying any side Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo manages to present an unbiased and neutral portrayal of the conflict between the Algerians and the French – which could easily symbolize any of today's conflicts. But the movie's greatness should not be measured by its neutrality, but rather by its ability to create empathy among its viewers to both sides. The use of Italian neorealism (use of real location, non professional actors, etc) adds to the authenticity of events and thus also to the emotional stages we go through. Perhaps the most important point this movie clarifies is that for every coin there are two sides, and for every war there are two perspectives – none however justifies acts of violence.",
250,7 June 2010,mliu9395,9, Modern day applications,"It's hard to really sympathize with either side in this movie. The resistance fighters have a right to their independence yet are attacking through terrorist acts against civilians. The French military is trying to protect themselves and their people but are doing so through inhumane tactics, such as torture, and are executing their strategy in a methodical, almost machine-like manner. What this film does well is try to show both sides without bias and let the audience decide who the good guys and bad guys are. The plot is applicable to modern day wars and raises the question, ""how do you fight against this kind of terrorism?"" It made me realize how little is known about the motivations behind modern day terrorists, and how the word ""terrorist"" should not be completely synonymous with the word ""evil.""",
251,8 June 2010,thenmikeysaid,7, just some input,"this is almost a timeless movie just like with the writings of Nostradamus different people can interpret this movie in anyway that they want too which i think is a ""double sided"" sword to speak. the biggest conclusion one could draw upon first watching this film is that there may bee a connection with September 11th and even though this film was recorded almost a half century before that however it seems to create a sympathy for FLN guerrilla insurgency even though they clearly are ""terrorists"" (according to todays standards) the audience seems to develop a connection with them and seems to almost want them to beat the french paratroopers. i have always been a fan of the star wars movies but in particular the opening scene in which the FLN are about to be blown up by the french col. Mathieu reminds me of when Darth Vader is about to blow up princesses Leia's home planet in exchange for information which would end the rebellion but the plan fails. however in the battle of Algiers the plan ""fails"" when the leadership of the FLN is killed yet the young boy steals the microphone and declares that the resistance is not dead sparks the flame that will continue to grow until ""justice"" is achieved. something i really liked about this film is that every incident could be argued as being necessary for a previous action and causes all the violence in the film is due to retaliation. there seems to be a method to the madness of this film and it makes the audience think of whether or not there is a good or bad side which is what i enjoyed.",
252,9 June 2010,LilaSays,10, I Wish More Movies Were Like This,"Not since Elim Klimov's ""Come and See"" has a film had such a lasting and emotional effect of me. There's a reason why it ranks as one of the most influential films of all times. It literally blew my mind, and there's no other way for me to say it. From the beautiful, sincere acting to the realistic staging, Pontecorvo did nothing to shy away from authenticity. Several times throughout viewing the film I had to remind myself that what I was seeing on the screen wasn't real, though the scenes depicted in the film are in fact as real as the emotions I felt while viewing it. One of my favorite scenes is one in which three Algerian woman transform themselves into ""attractive"" French women in order to sneak bombs undetected into the popular French quarter. The music that plays serves as a kind of elevated heartbeat, and you can't help but feel what they must be feeling as you look into their beautiful faces and see the fear and determination in their eyes. A scene made even more inspiring knowing that all three women are non-professional actors. I'd love to see the likes of Julia Roberts or Sharon Stone (Ha!) attempt to convey such strong emotions, using just the eyes no less! As the movie went on it became more and more difficult for me to determine where my sympathies lay. Who was right and who was wrong...it's hard to decide when you can relate to the denizens of both sides. But I do know one thing for sure, ""La battaglia di Algeri"" is a powerful, thought-provoking film that that holds just as much strength and relevancy today as it did over 40 years ago, and it begs to be seen again and again.",

It is the story of the road to Algeria's independence from the French. Gillo Pontecorvo delivers the story in Documentary style from the School of Neo-realism. This benefits the story tremendously. The film does a great job of not siding with the French or FLN but at the same time brings the audience extremely close to the characters. The film is timeless because it depicts a conflict that exists even today. It's so relevant to the way we function on a personal as well as on a global level.

It is a true account of the Algerian revolution in 1962. It is my understanding that Saadi Yacef, who played Djafar, was a major player in the revolution, and it was his account that the film is based off of. If anyone is interested in the history of Algeria, I definitely recommend this film. Its grainy, raw appearance, and audio, make you feel as though you're right in the middle of the action, which needless to say, can really stir up some emotions and make you empathize with the rebel Algerians.",
264,12 April 2009,e010987,10, (Excellent),"Most films lately are becoming stale, over-theatrical, and oh so predictable, mostly due to an increasing public obsession with action and sex. More films are dumb down today than ever before in my humble opinion. Maybe it's because we're all getting dumber, or maybe it's because capitalism has entwined itself in American film culture and utterly corrupted it. Needless to say, the sense of realism in films like Ladri di Biciclette, and this film, La battaglia di Algeri, seems otherwise extinct. I come from a documentary photography background and I cringe at most movies for how plastic they all are. I admire a sense of truth in everything. But from cliché romances with overpaid A-List celebrities, to absurd, fictional epics featuring talentless actors like Nick Cage and Brendon Frazier, we rarely see truth in film. The Battle of Algiers is so pure and captivating it restored faith in cinema completely for me. It is an epic of realism and emits startling truths about war and insurgency. All the while it accomplishes this reenactment of a time in history without the slightest sense of fabrication. Rarely do I applaud a movie at the credits, but at the end of Algiers, I wanted a standing ovation. Summary: A masterpiece.",

I enjoyed seeing the women displaying intelligence and following the plans to attack the French with extreme precision. At times it was hard to feel for the Algerians, as they seemed like mindless rebels attacking the more civilized, intelligent French. However, one must keep in mind when watching the film that these people were fighting for their independence, which requires some barbaric behavior.

The right sovereignty of a state and the right of freedom are the themes of this movie. Even in this movie we see many connections to the Italian NE realism, like for instance the choice to use non professional actors, and to shoot the movie on actual location where the real events took place. Overall I found this movie very violent but also very thought full. We could compare the issue of Frnace colonialism over Aljerie with many other current events. The use of non professional actors made this movie even more realistic.",
267,25 April 2005,thanh_nguyen01,6, Analysis of Film for History 110B,"Conflict, torture, and rebellion are just a few of the actions seen in the film the Battle of Algiers. This film depicts the struggles of the Algerians against the French who have occupied Algiers for many decades. The focus of the film is on the start of a rebellion and the pivotal characters in the rebellion, it follows the rebellion through riots, torture, and needless killings until the leaders of the rebellion are killed themselves. However even though the leaders of the rebellion have died, the rebellion is reborn a few years later and the Algerians successfully gain their independence. The film contains a high emotional and intellectual impact. It depicts the cruelty and inhumanness of both the leaders of the rebellion who gun down innocent French citizens, the French soldiers who watch emotionless as an Algiers is tortured and then later blame the Algier for not giving in sooner. In addition, the Algier is treated almost with camaraderie as the Algier is given coffee and clothes and patted on the back for him to lead the way to the rebel hideout. The film reveals the deadened almost blank expression the French soldiers depict as someone is tortured. It contrasts with the passionate, almost zealous rebels who gun down and try to run over French citizens. It is a stark contrast and yet it shows that no one is free from the devastation and destruction of the rebellion. Although the French soldiers target the rebellions, little harm was done to other Algerians initially and the French soldier Mathias appeals to a woman whose home has been occupied by the rebels to ask the rebels to give themselves up. This can be compared to the rebels who are willing to gun down and run over any one they feel are not native which includes French citizens who are attempting to make lives in Algiers. There is a sense of horrified fascination as the rebels use an ambulance to gun down French citizens who are minding their business and one of the rebels attempt to run over the French citizens. This will also share a resemblance at the end of the film where Algerians demanding their independence are gunned down by French soldiers, have bombs thrown at them, and chased by armored tanks.",
268,11 September 2013,llothar,8, It not a substitute for a text book,"I still don't know what to make out of ""Battle of Algiers"". It focus to much on the few terrorists in the beginning and that the french military was just protecting the europeans (maybe with an iron fist, but it isn't shown). ",
269,15 March 2019,qinyangq,7, Review,"We watched this film on social studies class during the decolonisation unit. The film was helpful for educational purpose, since it introduced the outline of basic events happened during the battle of Algiers. However, some factual details were left out, such as how many death were there. It is a fair film that shows problems on both side and not only towards one side. The visual representation was not very pleasing since it is an old film, so I wouldn't watch it again by my own.",
