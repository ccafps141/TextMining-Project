0,10 July 2005,planktonrules,9, exceptionally well made,"Although I'm not the biggest Ingmar Bergman fan, I have really enjoyed some of his movies--especially the one that are not so pessimistic. Although the underlying theme of this movie is aging and impending death, the movie is NOT all pessimism. If it had been, it would have lost my interest early on. Instead, I really enjoyed the film--particularly the fine acting by Victor Sjöström as Professor Borg.",/

2,20 September 2006,evanston_dad,10, Stunning Bergman Masterpiece -- Maybe His Best?,"""Wild Strawberries"" profoundly moved me. The theme -- an old man coming up fast on death and wondering if his life has had any meaning -- is an old one for Bergman, and one which he explored ad nauseum throughout the subsequent decades. But here Bergman approaches the question with an uncharacteristic optimism and sense of hope. For once, he seems to come close to finding some peace with the unknowns of life that obviously preoccupied him as an artist, and the movie he gives us is sad but immensely warm; resigned but calm and reflective.",e

6,24 December 2006,Vincentiu,10, The only reality,"A gorgeous movie about memory and hope. A trip and a form of catharsis. It is not a story of an old man who discovers images of his past, about a marital crisis or some teenagers. It is not a confession. It is a mirror. The same crisis is the ""gift"" of everybody. The same silence, fear and desire are the refuge of a man, a woman, a n American or Irakian. At a moment, at a single moment, you discover your past like only reality. Like your real skin, your only voice, your essential eye. It is not strange. We are the fruits of some experiences. Some books, some people, a family, a child or a wife are the Ganymedes of our hours, our evolution, our death. Our freedom, our gestures, our smile are the trees of their presence. Isak Borg is the image of a age. Our age who grow-up in the noise of every day. The isolation is only way to be yourself. The way to Lund, the relation with Agda, the empty attitude, the projection in Evald, the words are the symbols of a clock who is seed of our conscience. Childhood is only reality of our life.",w

8,24 January 2000,iam-1,8, Bergman knows how to make you think.,"Bergman has been seen by many as being a depressing film makes, who speaks above the heads of most people.  Thank God someone does! In this piece of genius, we are asked to consider who God is; what makes a life worthwhile; and whether human nature alters through the generations, or is it just the costumes that change?  As usual, the answers are to be provided by the audience.  We must chose for ourselves what we think is 'right' or 'just'. Bergman uses the usual pattern for him - a man is on a journey (life) and meets people who are going along the same road (friends and family), and they all head toward the end of their trip (death).  They stop in for obligatory visits with relatives and for food (as we all do), receive an honourary degree (fame & success?), and then send the children off to a party held in our honour that we do not attend (funeral).  What happens along the way is important, but we always end up in the same place - the end. Wonderful editing techniques, good story, good images, fantastic acting, and more ideas and questions to ponder than one film can hold - or so you thought.  It's only after the film ends that these ponderings come to you. During the film, you simply watch a man travel from his home to another city, but this is far from what the film is about. See this film once, think about the questions it poses, then rewind and see it again.  You will be rewarded for doing so.",r
9,28 August 2006,thxrvg,9, A Magnificent Film,"There are moments in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries where you become so enthralled by an image that you want to dwell on it, until you realize that there are so many such moments that to do so would be to stop at practically every scene in the film. The sheer technical and visual skill that Bergman shows here is unsurprising, insofar as we ought to expect this from him, but it is dazzling, even when it is displayed in a film that, on the surface, has a rather tame premise. An old man, Professor Isak Borg (played to perfection by Victor Sjöström), is driving to Lund, where he is to be honoured. His son's wife, and three spirited young people, two men and a woman, accompany him. They also pick up an utterly depressed couple along the way, only to drop them off when they begin to fight. Interspersed with the present actions are the old man's dreams, and flashbacks to his youth.",w
10,1 September 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Another one of Bergman's best,"Ever since I first saw Wild Strawberries, like with The Seventh Seal, Fanny and Alexander and Cries and Whispers, I was blown away by how well made and thought provoking it was(it is one of his more accessible films too). Ingmar Bergman's direction as ever is superb, there is a certain warmth to how he composes and conveys everything. Wild Strawberries looks gorgeous, it is beautifully shot with atmospheric lighting and scenery. It isn't a Bergman film either without memorable images, and Wild Strawberries has those certainly. Some people may find the symbolism of the nightmares with the handless clocks and runaway hearses somewhat overpowering, I didn't think so, I found them very haunting and even fascinating to watch. It is the more beautiful images where Wild Strawberries really drew me in, the memories of the idyllic summers are among Bergman's most beautiful and finest moments. The score fits perfectly, while the script is incredibly thought-provoking, and the story contrasts innocence with the expectancy of youth with bitterness with the regrets of old age very movingly. Victor Sjöström is on magisterial form being both frosty and vain as his character seizes the chance for redemption. Overall, one of Bergman's finest, a wonderful film in all regards. 10/10 Bethany Cox",2

Saw it recently for the second time, some 15 to 20 years after seeing it for the first time.  First time round I was the age and stage of the traveling youngsters and saw the world through their eyes.  This time I could identify more with the son and daughter-in-law characters with just as much conviction.  The subtlety and sophistication of this movie defy description.

Actually, he does not seem so bad. He is friendly enough with other people, and he appears to be content with his relatively solitary existence. Anyway, Sara, the woman he loved when he was young, married his brother, and somehow that was Isak's fault, because he was cold and aloof. And Karin, the woman he ended up being married to, cuckolded him, but that was also Isak's fault, because he was cold and aloof. He visits his mother, who is cold and aloof. His son Evald is cold and aloof.",3

16,7 February 2003,Quinoa1984,9, The dream sequences had chills running up my spine...,"...and having said that I can say this might be one of Bergman's critically over-rated pictures. Of course there is much to look for, admire, and saturate with his tale of an old professor/doctor on his way to get a degree who looks back on his life, but the road trip scenes, while somewhat fascinating, can't hold a candle to the work that is displayed in the first dream. We see clocks with no hands (no time left for the old timer), a man with a very tightened face, and a coffin that falls right in front of the old man with himself inside of it, reflecting him. That this is one of Bergman's most evocative and powerful scenes goes to show why the film is so praised, and with the other dreams we see much insight into his fears and doubts on his life and what it's meant. But a number of the scenes go nowhere or ponder on events that slow the film down. Wild Strawberries is a film that can be judged as a display of perfect sorrow or longish observation, you decide. Plenty of beautiful outdoor scenery shots though; Max Von Sydow has a cameo as a gas station attendant. Grade: A.",1
17,31 October 2008,fred3f,4, A Contrarian View,"As I look at all the 10 star reviews that others have given this film I wonder if I am being foolhardy in daring to say something to the contrary. I am and have been for many years a Bergman fan. I eagerly saw most of his films as they were released. I love nearly all of them - this one being an exception. Certainly the film is worth seeing - any Bergman film is. But this one is often cited as his best, and there I would strongly disagree. It is about an academic and although professor Borg has to face some of his demons, he comes out on top in then end. I understand why this film is so popular. Academics see themselves in professor Borg and academics have a lot of influence on what is considered art and what isn't. Borg ends up looking good at the end of the film, and academics, although they have their faults like anyone else, like to think that they are worthy of the respect that their position commands. In many, many cases they are - and this is not a diatribe against academics. I just think that Bergman let this character off too easily, particularly when you compare the way he treats his other characters in movies like ""The Hour of the Wolf"", ""The Silence"", ""Shame"" and so on. He plumbs the depths of the soul and takes no prisoners. ""Wild Strawberries"" starts out that way, when the professor flashes back to the key points in his life where he turned away from love, life and reality in favor of academic honor. But ultimately Bergman backs down. The professor, having seen the errors of a lifetime in a few short hours, is shown to be wiser and a better man now as he receives his honorary award. Bergman does not do this in his other films. For me this gives a certain falsity to ""Wild Strawberries"" that I don't see in ""Persona"" for example. Well, everyone will probably disagree with me, - this is such an acclaimed film - but sometimes it is valuable to hear a contrarian opinion even when you don't agree with it.",/

19,9 May 2002,Agent10,10, An almost mythical-style film,"I watched this film for a class, and virtually everyone groaned over the development. I was the only one with an open mind, and I was thankful for such a condition of spirit. While this film was at times slow, the morphing of different worlds created quite an experience, one which was spiritual and eerie. The dream sequences were amazing, examining the doctor's state of mind through the use of imagery and allegorical conventions. A good film for anyone to experience, and you get to Max von Sydow as a young man.",r
20,11 July 2005,vitaleralphlouis,10, Quietly spellbinding -- The Best Movie Ever Made,"The film summary missed the point altogether. The professor (doctor) made no ""bad choices"" in his life; no, the ""choice"" that cast a shadow on the professor's entire life was Sara's choice in loving the professor's brother and rejecting the professor. Sara was/is the girl He loved, the girl he will always love; with that light taken out of his life everything remaining is coldness; the quiet hell of living life in the absence of love; an infection that effects his wife, his son, but oddly not the people he served as a doctor. As the story progresses, the professor witnesses a much younger Sara and her two rival young men, an exact reflection of his own situation decades ago. As the loneliness generated the coldness in his life, the one radiant light was his quiet and close-guarded memory of the love he had for Sara, and in the final scene we watch the old man view paradise as he looks back on the time when Sara was still with him, with his family at a country get-together. What adds to the emotional wallop is the realization that the old man is Ingmar Bergman's projection of himself some 40 years hence, Bergman, a man loved by many beautiful women, yet he can see (and fear) the devastation which can destroy even a strong person if such person loses the spark of irreplaceable love. Immediately following this movie, I evaluated my own life; resolving drastic action to avoid (if possible) the pitfall Bergman warned us about with this powerful movie.",e
21,20 October 2009,Hitchcoc,10, A Film About Redemption,"About thirty years ago I was totally into art films. I went to college film festivals and art theaters. It was an experience. Unfortunately, I was a little too wet behind the ears to have the proper appreciation. I am now retracing my steps and watching these films again, and now I'm seeing why they've withstood the test of time. This is a tremendous film with so much humanity and so much sadness. It's about all of us who have lived out lives a bit thoughtlessly. I think of Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" as an example of the ultimate in that category. The good doctor has all he can do to make his way to receive an honorary degree. He brings along his daughter-in-law who really doesn't like him mostly because of what he has done to make his son a cynical, harsh man. He has been beset by dreams with faceless men and handless clocks, where time stands still. He is terrified. As we go along we realize that time often does heal and when we repress what really bothers, we flatten out the rough edges. On the long drive, human beings do what they often do. They begin to forgive and understand. If the doctor is an old inflexible being, it becomes obvious that he has had enough when his daughter-in-law levels with him. He begins to draw up his past for review. He sees that his basic sterility was as destructive as if he had been cruel. ",f

27,21 August 2007,Bunuel1976,10," WILD STRAWBERRIES (Ingmar Bergman, 1957) ****","This is still one of Bergman’s finest and, actually, it seems to me that the film improves with each viewing. It was certainly an inspired choice to cast elderly ex-director Victor Sjostrom in the lead, while the main female roles are filled by the luscious Ingrid Thulin (here in one of her best showcases) and a radiant Bibi Andersson (in two roles no less, both named Sara!). Other important members of Bergman’s stock company of actors appear in bit-parts: even Gunnar Bjornstrand in the pivotal role of Sjostrom’s son and Thulin’s husband is only in a couple of scenes; a blonde Gunnel Lindblom plays Andersson’s sister (during Sjostrom’s recollections); and, most incongruously, Max von Sydow turns up as a gas-station owner grateful to doctor Sjostrom for services rendered in the past!",u
28,26 November 2005,sol-,8, My brief review of the film,"A metaphoric road film full of symbolism, this film has gained the status as one of Ingmar Bergman's best films. It is uneven, with gaps between the most spectacular and meaningful sequences, however the film certainly has enough in it to rate as a great film. Victor Sjöström is excellent as the old man reflecting on his past and trying to sort out his emotions, and the camera-work is simply beautiful. The (too few) nightmarish dream segments are very well done: surreal and quite frightening to a degree. The film pushes the boundaries with some aspects though, such as how the protagonist is able to remember events that he never witnessed himself, and a time factor that can only be discussed in light of events that happen towards the end of the film. There a small number of things that one can quibble about here, but the overall film stands up strong. It is relatively pleasant, quite well acted, and the bits that are done well are done very well.",r

32,15 August 2002,blue-7,10, Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES Stunning on DVD,"Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, on the Criterion DVD version, is nothing short of stunning. Picture, sound and English Subtitles have never been as fine as seen here. Having viewed this 1957 film during its first U.S. release in 1959, when I was 21 years-old, it was quite involving to return to it 43 years later. Like the Professor of the story, I too often reflect upon choice made along lifes path and wonder what might have been if different choices had been made. Victor Sjostron as Proffesor Isak Borg gives the performance of a life-time! What a magnificent face this man had! Bergman films can be quite dark and depressing, but his THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES are marvelous, thought-provoking dramas that lift the spirit. BEWARE: There are two other DVD releases, one from Asia and one from Brazil -- but neither of these have been cleaned up like the Criterion version. The sound for instance -- I have seen the dream sequence at the beginning of the film when the Professor walks through empty streets, sees handless clocks, a carriage carrying a casket with his body -- a scene with almost complete silence,BUT prints on 16mm, VHS and even Laser Disc all contain a great deal of surface noise. In the Criterion version, the silence is almost complete. And the picture is perfection -- blacks & whites that sparkle and no film blemishes or dirt-- a picture that is a wonder to behold. Peter Cowie's Commentary is outstanding and very worth while. The 90 Documentary from Swedish Television, INGMAR BERGMAN ON LIFE AND WORK is quite fascinating. Bergman, then in his early 80's, is very articulate and thoughtful in his discussion. Over the years Bergman has come to the conclusion that when we die we are no more -- and he has stated that conclusion gives him great peace. BUT his conversation in this documentary puts a wrinkle in his conclusion. He speaks of his final marriage to a woman for over 20 years and of her passing. He can not believe that SHE does not exist anymore. He often has the feeling that she is near him and that she still influences decisions he makes. He can accept not being for himself but not for her. Bergman is getting closer to the truth then he realizes. . . death is not the end -- but only the beginning. When he finally passes from this early life and finds that he still ""is"" -- I wonder if he'll wish he could change the focus of his later film work. Be that as it may -- WILD STRAWBERRIES and THE SEVENTH SEAL are two of the finest films of the last century -- in my humble opinion.",
33,26 September 2015,aciessi,7, The Sweet Smell of Sorrow,"Ingmar Bergman is the quintessential, existential filmmaker. To me, he is the black angel of cinematic death, and please, I mean that in the best way possible. He's most famous for attempting to answer the questions that all of us want answered. What is the meaning of life? What happens when we die? Is there a god? Is there a heaven or a hell? Bergman is always asking these questions in his film, and always, does he find interesting answers and hypothesis formed by these questions. He uses his actors and his framing abilities to help drive home the main idea of these films, and thus, his movies are notoriously not very hard to understand. Most importantly, he has an ability to make us understand the answers, and to help us understand ourselves. Bergman is an introspective filmmaker by definition, and because of that, his films have become so cherished and remembered for being so. In a period slightly before his heyday, no film makes a better example of his unique cinematic mission than ""Wild Strawberries""",

39,16 December 2016,classicsoncall,9," ""You know so much, and you don't know anything.""","For us seasoned film viewers, a film like ""Wild Strawberries"" carries some resonance. It invites both a retrospective and introspective look into one's own life with all it's triumphs along with the disappointments, lost loves and unfinished business that are a part of that sometimes undisciplined thing called life. If done honestly, as in the case of Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom), the look back may dredge up moments of recrimination and a wish that things had been done differently. Borg's memories are further haunted by strange dreams that summon up things like empty streets, ruined buildings and faceless men; the horse drawn hearse spilling it's coffin to reveal his own corpse is a precursor to a later dream in which a judge pronounces him guilty of incompetence, callous behavior, selfishness and a ruthlessness as cold as ice. Borg begins to see and understand that his behavior throughout life has also infected those very close to him, including a distant son who lives to carry on his father's traits. Through chance encounters with hitchhikers on the way to picking up an honorary degree, and an unplanned reconciliation with his daughter-in-law, Borg seeks redemption for some of those inadequacies before he's called upon to meet his Maker. Though the film closes on an optimistic note with Borg's dream of his father and mother waving to him on a sunlit beach, it's really up to the viewer to decide if the good Doctor has attained peace with his past. His reflective journey may have planted a seed of humanity in the man's heart, just as the picture challenges the viewer to contemplate one's own life and legacy.",

I was a wild boy about campus who's taste for films was more action/adventure, western and mystery/suspense.

Even in the most common situations  a close-up of Dr. Isak Borg's face, for example  the images on the screen seem to exude beauty; we see the character's aging, withered features and a sense of irreconcilable sadness lurking behind his eyes, and we, too, are crestfallen.",

46,23 November 2018,chaswe-28402,9, Sensing his time will soon be up,"Victor Sjöström acts a 78 year old man in this 1957 film, and he was actually 78 himself. He died in January 1960, aged 80. Given his long experience as a director, and actor, first in silent films and later on the stage, it's as if he was directing himself in an equivalent account of his own personal life in this car journey south through Sweden down to Lund. The absence of hands on the clocks, and his own hand pulling him into the ghostly coffin indicate his anticipation that the end is near. The viewer is exceptionally powerfully drawn into the reality of what is taking place, as the aging man revisits the scenes of his past. Ingmar Bergman described himself as allowing his actors increasing freedom in self-direction, in terms of both action and dialogue. This attitude seems almost to have been initiated with this performance by Sjöström. It is an immensely effective film, but I've docked one star, as the hitchhikers struck me as irritating and unconvincing; besides wearing silly-looking shorts.",

The film is full of bitterness and unhappiness - Marianne has left her emotionally congealed husband because he refuses to inflict a baby on the world (that old chestnut); they crash into and give a lift to a married couple who seem like refugees from a latter Bergman movie, lacerating in a sado-masochistic relationship.  Isak Borg has a series of dreams and memories pointing out the emotional failures of his life.  And yet the movie ends on a note of tranquillity and tentative reconciliation.  all the old doom and gloom stuff that riddled earlier Bergman movies - God, death etc. - is wonderfully parodied in the figures of two male hitch-hikers whose metaphysical boxing matches sublimate frustrated desire for the third.",

I could ramble on and on about it, spouting adjectives like ""warm"", ""funny"", ""honest"", ""chilling"", ""captivating"", ""intelligent"" and ""poignant"", but what would be the point of that? Other, more eloquent reviewers have already said it better than me. I'd just like to say that it's a shame many dismiss Bergman's work as the epitome of pretentious, incomprehensible, depressing foreign cinema for art-house snobs, when it really is anything but. Unlike the stereotypical Bergman film, Smultronstället is all at once terrifyingly honest and beautifully uplifting. The performances by Victor Sjöström, Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Björnstrand are beyond description, and the script by Bergman himself has to rank among the best ever written. Not to mention the direction, which is by turns spine-tingling and heartbreaking, and the unforgettable cinematography by Gunnar Fischer. Smultronstället manages to combine flawless and impressive technical aspects with an understandable story that is timeless and easy to relate to. No other film does this as well as this one, which is why I don't hesitate to call it the greatest film ever made.",

57,23 December 2014,ofpsmith,10, The tragic personal life of a man who seems to have gotten lost in his career.,Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) is a complex character that many of us can probably relate to. He is a successful scientist who has made a career for himself and has stayed in it ever since. Isak is a successful man on the outside but he has a cold personality that interfered with the relationship between him and his wife Karin Borg(Gertrud Fridh) and his son Dr. Evald Borg (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Now an elderly man Isak gets up one day to attend an award ceremony in his honor. But as his daughter in law Marianne Borg (Ingrid Thulin) drives him to his destination they make many stops along the way. In each way Isak is reminded of his life. From his childhood to him as an adult. he learns from each stop what his life has meant to people in positive and negative ways. He sees what he has done for science and progress but at the same time is reminded of his own bitterness and coldness. Ingmar Bergman I know has made some really great films but this is by far his best. Dare I say it but it's even better then The Seventh Seal. Bergman shows us a man who has achieved much success but in the process has shut himself outside of his own life. I highly recommend this movie. The acting and story are fantastic.,
58,23 December 2018,arthur_tafero,8, Wild Strawberries: One of Bergman's Best,"During the 1960s, it was quite fashionable to overanalyze Bergman films. Some of his films were good, others were boring, and a few are really gems of cinema. Not every film from any director is good; they all have ones they would like to forget. This film is actually quite simple; if you are arrogant and self-righteous, you have a good chance of being lonely when you enter old age. This is really a cautionary tale; a bit like A Christmas Carol, but without the Future. I can identify with the professor, because I am one as well. I have been arrogant and self-righteous in the past as well. And I have suffered the consequences of my poor behavior as a result. Luckily, I am a half dozen years younger than the professor in the film, which gives me a little time to recover, but not a lot. Bibi Anderson is excellent as well as Skostrom in the lead role. Bergman films always have an excellent supporting cast; especially the housekeeper. Honors like an honorary doctoral degree mean very little in comparison to fostering your personal relationships with other people; particularly family. That is the cautionary aspect of this film.",

It may sound too sedate to hold one's interest, but it does. Through dream sequences filled with symbolism and dialog with people he meets along the way, we get a picture painted of his life, its key moments, and how he evolved over time. We see the common thread – his serious, intelligent, considerate, yet cool and judgmental personality – and how that made him a very successful doctor, but created difficulties in his personal life. We see how he lost the real love of his life when she was picking wild strawberries and his own more passionate brother pursued her, and how his subsequent marriage to another was plagued with strife and his wife's infidelity. We see how this carried down to his son, his unhappy childhood, his depression, and the difficulty he has in his own marriage. We also see the perils of old age, seeing death coming, being sentimental, and fearing becoming obsolete. We see that despite his brilliant career and the very prestigious award he's just been given, the most meaningful, happy moment in his life was simply fishing on a peaceful day with his father, a sentiment which has a 'Rosebud' feel to it.",

The themes are universal, death, family, the generations, even technology. I think it helps a viewer to realize the care with which a Bergman, or a Kubrick, or any film maker of the first rank approaches the script, shoot, edit, release sequence. Because Bergman had his hands in all of that he had a chance to look at every scene from all angles. Any seeming clunkiness or absract reality presented has a reason for being there. I found it best to sit without concerning myself with why anything happened and let the movie roll forward trusting the people to be who they were and go where they would.

68,31 December 2006,apmahd,10, A magnificent film,"In ""Smultronstallet"", the elderly professor Isak Borg, on his way to receive an honorary degree, uses the journey to discover and understand himself and the effect he has had on others. The action converts past and present, reality and fantasy, the present harshly and starkly lit, the earlier memories more relaxed and lyrical as if, for an old man, the past - that other country - was better than the time and place he inhabits now. Each new character, each reminiscence as it springs up in the mind of professor reveals something new about him - his failings, his shortcomings, the reasons why, in his apparently successful and honored old age, he is alone and lonely. This is, admittedly, an uneven film, verbally over explicit, but it is packed with vivid imagery - an early dream sequence, both mysterious and yet significant; a disenchanted couple squabbling fiercely in a car; the sad beauty of Marianne, unhappy daughter-in-law; the words, memories and gestures of professor's mother; the distancing effect produced by the device of having the professor visiting his own past unseen by those who shared it with him; the meeting with Akerman. It is a sombre, striking work, uncompromising in its examination of the protagonist and Victor Sjostrom, in his last screen role, is splendid. For me, this film is the proof for to believe Ingmar Bergman the best best European director of the last century.",

From the place of wild strawberries, he starts to mix real life (with his daughter-in-law and other people) and memories of past loves and pains. The result is a life lived with levels intricate, with mix of present and past and as a collection of singular moments that can be touched individually as minutes out of flux of time: it is like if the main character can explore materially the immaterial corner of his past life. Through this strange journey, between dream and reality, he understand that love and kindness are solutions to the two biggest fears for man, death and solitude.

71,29 December 2005,iamkilgoretrout,9, One of Bergman's finest,"Although I have only seen it once, I can safely say that I was taken aback by this film. Ingmar Bergman is a master of self-exploration and takes a beautiful, sometimes haunting, look at the emptiness in an elderly man's life. Professor Isak Borg is on his way to Lund to receive and honorary award from the college at which he used to teach. Now seventy-eight years old, Borg is cantankerous, cold and arrogant to the people around him. The film begins with some narration, Borg is setting the story up for us, filling us in quickly before we begin to follow him. He has a dream at the beginning of the film that sets the tone for the rest of the film. He is on a street that is devoid of any signs of life. The clocks have no hands and he is all alone. He knows what this all means; death is near. A solitary man is seen standing on the sidewalk and Borg goes to speak to him. When he turns, we discover a shriveled and disgusting face staring back at him. A cart comes carrying a casket and catches itself on a lamp post, losing it's wheel and dropping the casket into the street. Borg goes to examine the body and finds that it his own. When he tries to move away, his dead self grabs him, refusing to let go.",

This motion picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is better than Bergman's other masterwork, The Seventh Seal.  I say this because although Seventh Seal's plot is more ominous and the ending is a little more well done, Wild Strawberries could actually make you change your outlook on life.  Great films do this.  Just look at ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Platoon"", ""Natural Born Killers"", and ""JFK"", among others.

Three, having always known of Bergman from the films of American filmmaker Woody Allen, I was struck at just how much Allen steals from Bergman in many of his films- from camera angles and techniques, to outright theft of scenes. Not that I am accusing Allen of wrongdoing, for T.S.

It reminds us that the family should always be a major factor in our lives and if create distance to the family, our lives will get cold. It is the mastery of Bergman who brings this questions to life, to visualize the fears of the protagonist. Even the old professor, who lived his live in emotional isolation seems to find his peace by exploring the memories about his family and resolving existing conflicts. Well I always thought that memories will vanish like ""tears in rain"", but no, since this movie I know that my memories about my family are there to bring me peace and joy.

Although Borg is supposed to be something of a misanthropist, he doesn't really come across as one in the film; in fact he comes across as quite a pleasant old chap. This could be because of a dream he recently had in which he wanders deserted city streets before coming across a clock with no hands and a carriage containing a coffin within which lies his own body.

It is a story about an aging man and his journey spiced with the memories and the dreams he witnesses about himself. Ingmar Bergman creates the tension and the feelings from minimum amount of events, from which non remain unnecessary and from a small amount of characters that all have their own personality and place in the movie. The gorgeous Swedish summer gives a life full background and a great contrast to the old professor preparing for his end.",

He started to build his reputation with The Naked Night (1953) and Summer with Monika (1953). In 1957 Bergman's two films The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries got released.

I prefer this to Bergman's Seventh Seal (1957), because for me the images and themes are more immediate and relevant. From the Freudian to the postmodern, you will find it in this film. It is not a cute pseudo intellectual movie that rewards with cheap plot twists and predictable fates, but rather a deep and intense journey into the soul of a man with a cold and dark heart. For the aging, for the lonely, for the misguided, this film is confrontational in its challenges to our beliefs of time, social relationships, and ethics.",

Professor Isak Borg (Sjostrom) has been living alone for years with only his housekeeper to keep him company, as he has alienated his grown son and his daughter in law. His cold demeanor and brusque mannerisms don't help to win him many friends, so on the advent of the award ceremony, while his daughter in law drives him there he reflects on his past and things that happened/decisions he made that led him to become the man he has, and led to the life he is living. Whether they are nightmarish dreams about death, or bona fide memories he experiences while they visit his childhood home along the way, each occurrence makes him more introspective (and a bit frightened) about his life and the lives of those around him.",

I'd heard a lot about Bergman, about how he was one of the all-time greats, so I decided to watch ""The Seventh Seal"". Frankly, I wasn't overly impressed. I've seen it again since then, and I liked it a lot better the second time, but my first impression was disappointment.

He goes on the trip and along the way meets some interesting characters. This film has some surreal dream sequences in them about death and the professor's lost love. There are also some funny moments and some great dialogue. Bergman is a master of human behaviour. You are not sure at times in the film what are dreams and what is reality. It is true auteur filmmaking. I highly recommend this film for film lovers.,
108,17 September 2010,jboothmillard,8, Wild Strawberries,"From writer/director Ingmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night, Persona), this was the film that apparently cemented his career overseas, I would have thought The Seventh Seal did that, oh well. Basically seventy-eight year old physician and professor of medicine Dr. Isak Borg (BAFTA nominated Victor Sjöström) is travelling from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary award for fifty years in medical practice. He is joined on the journey by his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), and along the way he tells how he has been having strange dreams, nightmares and hallucinations, and this returns again. These nightmares include clocks with faces but no hands, runaway hearses, an open coffin with his own body coming out, and of course the meaningful summers he spent with cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson) and stuff. Slipping back and forth, in and out of these questionable places, he realises choices he made int he past involving him, his love life and ultimately his family have created a lonely life. He finds he has no real purpose for living without his children and love in his life (family and passionate together), thankfully he achieves redemption, and the forgiveness and love from his children. Also starring Gunnar Björnstrand as Dr. Evald Borg, Jullan Kindahl as Agda, Folke Sundquist as Anders, Björn Bjelfvenstam as Viktor, Naima Wifstrand as Isak's Mother and a brief Max Von Sydow as Henrik Åkerman. This Swedish film has many weird and wonderful moments, especially during the dream sequences, Sjöström is a good choice for the leading character, and even though it was hard to keep up with the dream and reality placings, it is certainly a must see foreign drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Very good!",

Some of the techniques, both in story telling and in visual stimuli are very dated. Although I can appreciate the care and attention to detail utilized in the making of the film it does not deliver anything that I have not seen before. Mostly it conveys a familiar message in an time and tradition that may have been ground breaking in it's day but is not now. The photography is beautiful. The characters are not singular in their originality or their behavior. I recognize many of the actors from other Bergman films such as the Magician, The Seventh Seal and the Virgin Spring. This is a nice little movie about an old man reflecting on his past on an important date in his life. Good but not necessarily a classic. Classic in the sense that it is from a classic era of film making and by a heralded director no less but it does not reside in my top 100 movies of all time. Perhaps that opinion is a byproduct of my era? Perhaps it's not. There are other films made before this one that I regard much more highly. Gone with the wind, Double Indemnity, Spellbound, Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Sunrise, Pride of the Yankees, Key Largo and 12 Angry Men are all old films yet they suit my sensibilities better.",

Bergman is great and this is his best movie in my opinion maybe besides the seventh seal.

And the atmosphere in which our oldest and most cherished memories are wrapped. Probably the most 'atmospheric' movie I've ever seen. I concur with the reviewer who called it the very, very best.

Both acting and formal arrangement of the story are fantastic in my opinion. Opposed to the majority of films that I have seen that piece by Bergman really touched me even though I have not understood many of the underlying conflicts. In spite of the difficulty and seriousness of the topics dealt with in this film one does not feel depressed or empty towards the end of the film. I guess this is because of the artistic brilliance evoked by the actors and the camera. I am not familiar with film analysis and I won't go into formal details for that reason. I am grateful to Bergman for the film because it makes you realize that all the hardship and heaviness of love and facing oneself is in a way natural and a universal task that everyone seeking for these things has to accept. I am still quite young and naive but I believe that love in one form or the other might be that one idea that can sort of tame that inner longing or drive for other things or beings, which could not be stopped otherwise. Thanks to people like Bergman I realize that misery and all the other negative feelings one can think are more part of the process than something one has to avoid as good as possible. I enjoy beauty and that film was just that. My favorite shot was the close up of Isak's face staring at the moon after he saw Sara, the love of his life and his brother Sigfrid happily in their share living room.

The guy playing Isak had a lilting, singsong voice that held one's attention. I managed to understand most of the movie, which is a direct one despite its symbolism, or rather because of the symbolism. The thing about Isak is that he doesn't seem very much sophisticated. His fear is visceral but there's no raw insight to back it up. Maybe he was a simpleton in a gentleman's clothing. I didn't understand the reason for the title though. Regardless, Wild Strawberries didn't come even close to dislodging 12 Angry Men as my favorite movie of 1957, let alone the best film of all time. Ingmar Bergman, I must say, had something new to show, but he didn't show it, he said it. That's his sin. Hope you've found this review useful.",

Unlike his previous effort, The Seventh Seal, made the same year as this, Bergman unfolds more of a Charles Dickens-esque story, more centered on the modern world rather than the Middle Ages, and a one about how a man can see his childhood memories with piercing clarity, yet can not fathom or even begin to be piece together his present life.",

The elder Isak wasn't cold, wasn't harsh, and didn't deserve the loneliness which had crept over him. And, as such, I felt like his character didn't really grow over the course of the narrative, as I didn't think he was that distant to begin with. There's some redemption to be found with his son, of course, but why was that redemption required? I just thought Isak's character didn't fit within the context of the flashbacks.",

Instead, we are treated to the man's journeys through his past, both inner (his dreams and fantasies) and outer (interacting with the hitchhikers and married couple). Throughout these scenes, small revelations unfold that show the key emotional points in the man's life which affects the way he sees the people he has met in real life.

Thulin is also fine as his daughter-in-law. Andersson is lovely as the cousin he loved as a young man and regrets not marrying. Apparently in Sweden it is socially acceptable to marry one's cousin.

148,11 February 2014,phobonnika,10, The 8th greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence during a journey across Sweden to receive his honorary degree, filled with flashbacks and dream sequences. The market throughout the dead centre years of the 20th century offered the world a considerably large collection of epic-style films orientating around the subjects of introspection, recollection of past lives and regret from all corners of the atlas. As you'd expect it just so happened to become the case that Bergman's finest hour is the gold standard of such an exploit: its sombre tone from the word go mixed with the melodic Swedish-language screenplay make for a truly moving, thought provoking and memorable feature film which explores the aforementioned facets of seasoned-to-misery ageing protagonist Dr Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström). Laced with flashbacks that remain deeper, more beautiful and more poetic throughout than those of its rivals, Bergman guides Smultronstället with his steady and knowledgeable hand through a Viennese waltz of charming and calming rhetoric and retrospect of dear thought and organisation. When writing about Smultronstället, one has to mention the famous dream sequence, where Borg travels through an empty city: with broken clocks, paper thin faces and a chilling atmosphere that really establishes Smultronstället as not solely a homely film of no distress. The flashbacks provide an insight into the exquisitely crafted life of the many-faced protagonist, funnel towards a cumulative emotional impact of this simple, powerful story and its probing revelation of human character, desire, and chagrin. My grandmother, an immigrant from Sweden, translated a version of Smultronstället and it has remained her personal jewel throughout the years for a fraction of the reasons I've mentioned. On top of its emotional amicability and the journey it shows us into the reminiscent mind of a fascinating character, it shows us moreover an equally brilliant journey through Southern Sweden in its aesthetic glory, with the black and white lens never subtracting from it, until we reach Borg's 'smultronstället', literally translated as wild strawberry patch or 'a place of sentimental meaning'.

Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström) is a bitter old man who lost the twinkle in his eye and love of people during 78 years of a hard, but successful life. A domineering stern mother and an unhappy marriage have left him without apparent emotional attachments. A strange dream shakes him out of his routine and he makes a sudden decision to drive to the town (Luund) where he is to receive a high honor. His daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), joins him on the journey, but he is totally uninterested in hearing about her problems. On the way to Luund, he decides to stop at an old house where he spent his youth with his 9 siblings. A patch of wild strawberries takes him on a journey in time to his youth when he was madly in love with his cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson). All of a sudden the memories awaken in him the pain of losing Sara and the failed relationship with his wife. The latter memory finds echo in the relationship of a couple that they pick up on the road, but he also meets an old patient Henrik (Max Van Sydow) who thanks Isak for some unspecified kindness in the past. The road crew becomes decidedly interesting when they pick up hitchhikers, a lovely and lively young girl named Sara (Bibi Andersson again) and her two boyfriends. Little by little and in often imperceptible ways we see Dr. Borg soften and become more human. By the journey's end, Isak has come a full circle. He has reconciled with his own past and achieved a kind of peace few are lucky enough to acquire.",

From recollection's and comments from his traveling group he realizes he has become a mean, old b***ard.  There were touches of cruelty the movie.  Isak, his son Evald, their mother and the couple they were in a car accident with, all show signs of cruelty.  They were mean, cold and bitter.  Marianne seems to notice and comment on the behavior as if she were the conscience of the movie.  She was played by a young Ingrid Thulin and was gorgeous.  She was also memorable as Karin in ""Cries and Whispers"". Bibi Andersson played an almost Sandra Dee type character.  It seems only the young people were happy in this movie and as they grew older they became mean and bitter.  It wasn't a real happy movie.  The ending was a bit more uplifting.  Overall a good movie and a nice introduction to Bergman movies.",

Or, is it a mirror for us to reach inside and grab by the throat a future that seems inevitable? No artist since Bernini has depicted pain as Bergman has. In Wild Strawberries Bergman has a given a man, frail, worn of by Christian in-action (in the Niezschean sense). It is arguably the most positive, this-life-enforcing movie that can viewed. I have refrained from quoting any specifics. I would hate to ruin the movie for someone who is harping on whether to spend 90 minutes on it. My suggestion, do it; thrice over; every year.",
