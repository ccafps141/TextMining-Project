1,12 August 2014,CMTiago,9, Thank You Captain,"It was with a sad reason that I re watched Dead Poets Society, as we lose yet another talent and an all round good person in Robin Williams. This being my favorite Williams film, I took it upon myself to honor his memory by remembering his best body of work, in my opinion. Mr. Keating is the teacher that I wish I had, and granted this might be a mixed opinion within the film's context, but the matter of the fact is that he was no ordinary teacher, and that's something you don't see very often.",r

I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I'd be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.",e

6,20 January 2003,ijtfalcon,10, Excellent,"I have no need to summarize this movie seeing as how most people tend to do that anyway so, therefore, any addition of such would simply be frivilous. However, I am somewhat disappointed to see how people tend to misinterprate this film by proclaiming that the movie's message of carpe deium is derailed by the fact that those who apply it end up losing.  This could not be further from the truth.  In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous.  The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove.  Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority.  Some may not like it but his story serves to prove just how important it is to stand one's ground no matter how hard it may be.  It's not only his character, but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth.

After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.",/
8,12 August 2014,connie-baldini-427-561037,10, Make Your Lives Extraordinary,"So today is August 12th and news has broken of Robin Williams' untimely death. I just felt compelled to review my favourite movie of his. On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day: O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It's not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams' performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it's hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It's almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he's most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin's death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly ""moved"" in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won't be sorry.",r

19,17 June 2001,kbmoshea,10, extraordinary,"Dead Poets Society is a thoroughly moving, and inspiring film from Peter Weir, who is definitely one of the most under rated directors around. This movie is in the same vein as ""A Separate Peace"", in the sense of setting, and in the general coming of age story line. The basic message is to ""suck the marrow out of life"", as the passage for the society reads, or to live every moment to the fullest. It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion. This is a must see.",r
20,30 December 2007,ackstasis,7," ""Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.""","Australian director Peter Weir's third picture in Hollywood, 'Dead Poets Society (1989),' doesn't really explore any territory that has not been covered before. For most of the film, we can pretty much predict exactly where Tom Schulman's screenplay is heading, and so there are few surprises to set it apart from other movies of its kind. However, despite his film's hint of unoriginality, Weir hardly puts a foot wrong, and 'Dead Poets Society' proves a thoughtful, funny, haunting and inspirational drama that'll certainly stay with you once you've seen it. Accompanying a cast of bright, young actors {some of whom you'll recognise from their later successes, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard} is comedy veteran Robin Williams, whose warmth and passion forms the emotional core of the story.",e

I did which made me appreciate Dead Poets Society even more. This movie is about the love of teaching and how the great teachers resonate with their students and get them to fall in love with subjects they despise. What John Keating was to these students was like how my geometry teacher was with me. More than a decade after graduation, we still communicate over our shared interests. Admittedly a bit one-sided, the film nonetheless has a place in my heart. Robin Williams delivers a committed performance. The young cast is impressive (looking at you, Ethan Hawke.) The drama delivers the emotions (even if you can accuse the film of manipulation). By the end, I was choking up with emotion. I did not care that I saw the ending from miles away. The ""O Captain, O Captain"" scene tugs me every time I see it. When Robin Williams passed in 2014, this scene was used in memorium for the beloved actor.",=

25,7 August 2015,willcundallreview,9, An incredible story of poetic freedom,"I watched this movie near one year after the tragic death of Robin Williams, and only for the first time. I had heard about the ""O Captain! My Captain!"" thing and knew it was a very popular film, but what I wasn't prepared for was how deeply emotional it is, and how much it resonates with the passing of Williams. This is a movie that although could be described as trying too hard for emotion, still just makes you want to smile, you want these boys to break out of their closed off traditional world and do what they want to do in life.",t

28,19 March 2001,jchckid,10," this movie is the greatest movie, with excellent cinematic techniques.","The film Dead Poets Society is a film that explores the idea of ""Carpe Diem"" (seize the day) from the viewpoint of a classroom of young men at an all boys boarding school. Their teacher Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams)helps them stretch their minds, and exercise their right to defiant acts of love for life and poetry, rebuttlng society. The director Peter Weir treats you with eye candy by using various camera shots of beautiful scenary, and neat techniques. Weir takes you on a roller coaster that leaves you gripping your seat, enjoying life, and thinking ""Carpe Diem"" in your own life. There are some very depressing scenes, but they are very artful, and teach you of appreciation for those brave members of society that dare stand up for their beliefs, and rights to wrestling around with life. I thought Ethan Hawke (Todd Anderson) gave a true life twist to the film, Robin Williams (Mr. Keating or also known as Captain my captain) added an element of excitement, and Robert Sean Leonard (Neil Perry)added passion that leaves you mesmerized. I just saw this film in English class, but I immediatly fell in love with it, as I know you will.",r

I guess their pedagogic value didn't leave them indifferent, nor the inspirational message about learning to think by ourselves, and to forge well-made rather than well-filled heads. Now I'm almost thirty, I saw the film several times, I read Roger Ebert's infamous review, I went to prep school, then a prestigious business school, I had my share of dreams and conflicts with my father, enough to build a second and more constructive opinion.",

I loved that the teacher was trying to teach the kids what believed was good even when the school tried to make him be quite. I highly recommend everyone watch this movie at least once in there life.",
32,25 April 2006,paul2001sw-1,5, Dead Portents Society,"Any film about any sort of greatness faces one particular challenge: how to depict that greatness. For example, to write a great film about a great poet, would you also need to be able to write great poetry? In fact, 'Dead Poets Society ' is a film about not a great poet, but an (allegedly) great teacher (Keating, played by Robin Williams), but the problem is still the same: can you convince the viewer that your character is truly inspiring, and not just irritating? But the fact that I am unimpressed with the teaching methods of the film's hero is only the first of a number of problems I have with this movie. Another is that the hero urges his students to seize the day, and to make the most of their lives, but all he seems to have done with his own life is to become a teacher to some of America's most privileged schoolboys. The generally unfair phrase, ""those who can, do; those who can't, teach"" actually seems apt in this case. And why should the audience care so much whether these boys, already blessed with every advantage, are inspired to achieve even more than than they would be otherwise? Then there's the issue about how they are actually inspired. All we see happen is a group of exceptionally docile teenagers acquire one quarter the rebelliousness, but ten times the pretentiousness, of any normal adolescent: yet we're apparently supposed to take this as an event of great import. Then one of the boys commits suicide for reasons that bear no relationship to anything that is consistent with modern psychological theories of suicide (that suicide is a symptom of mental illness: but here the character kills himself while of completely sound mind). Finally, the end of the film has echoes of Spartacus but in ludicrously less significant circumstances: are we really meant to be so upset that (however unjustly) a teacher has been sacked from his job? And it maybe doesn't even seem so unjust, not that he is really responsible for the death, but because the film has never shown him teach his classes anything but attitude; and moreover, we see him teaching only a single class in the entire movie, so there's never any sense of his wider life in the school. Director Peter Wier manages the whole piece with the same sort of stylised, refined sensibility also present in his 'Picnic At Hanging Rock'; but at times this seems ludicrous, such as when the class watches a pretty amateur performance of 'A Midsummers Nights Dream' with something close to rapture. In conclusion, this is an irksome film, whose unsubtle message is ""think for yourself"", but which doesn't actually leave the audience much freedom to do this for themselves.",

Berry had a set of very old buildings that were designed to look like the buildings at Oxford College in England. These buildings had attracted many filmmakers before.

42,8 October 2007,ExpendableMan,7, Robin Williams invents a string of school movie clichés,"Best known for it's (in)famous 'oh Captain my Captain' sequence, Dead Poets Society's biggest problem is the clichés it invented for the high school movie drama. Today's jaded audiences might smirk at such examples as the shy boy finding the confidence to express himself through the help of a rebellious teacher, or the purity of youthful romance, but to the film's eternal credit, this was fresh ground after a decade of teen sex comedies. Dead Poets Society's teenagers aren't simply lust crazed hormone bags that wander into embarrassing social accidents every fifteen minutes, they're a tad more realistic...for most of the film at least. When the movie ventures into darker territory in the closing quarter it falters, becoming an awkward attempt at manipulating emotions that jars against the promising story told in the beginning.",

44,22 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9, Excellent Robin Williams film,"DEAD POETS SOCIETY, in my opinion, is an excellent Robin Williams film. Despite the fact that Keating (Robin Williams) was funny, his antics were a little unorthodox. The first time I ever saw this was in English class during my senior year of high school. After seeing it then, I decided I liked it. However, I didn't buy it on VHS until a year or so later. If you ask me, the most memorable quote is, ""Carpe Diem!"" In case you're wondering, that's a Latin phrase. Before I wrap this up, I must say that the performances were top grade. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Robin Williams or Ethan Hawke, you're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so see this movie today.",

This film was ingrained in our culture before I entered the world (I know, I'm so young!), so I've never known a world without the ideas presented by so brilliantly and succinctly by John Keating (Robin Williams, ""The Fisher King""). If I had seen this film probably ten years ago, during the days of my youth when I was still searching for authors who could better put into words how I felt about the world, this film probably would've been a five star movie for me, but now, in the post-#Me Too era there are a few issues that come to light, and I also found there was a bit too much melodrama in the third act for my taste.",

49,6 February 2009,JamesHitchcock,10, Make your life extraordinary!,"To celebrate my 600th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. ""Dead Poets Society"" is an ""inspirational teacher"" film set at Welton Academy, Vermont, a boarding school organised on the lines of an English public school and based around ""Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence"". John Keating, a newly appointed English teacher, has a deep love of literature, especially poetry, and aims to inspire a similar love in his pupils. (His name was presumably chosen in homage to the poet John Keats). His aims as a teacher, however, go further; he also introduces the boys to his philosophy of life, summed up by the Latin phrase carpe diem (seize the day). Be true to yourself, think for yourself and make your life extraordinary. Rather than ""Sir"", he likes his class to call him ""Captain, my Captain"", as in Walt Whitman's poem. In one memorable scene he encourages his class to rip out of their textbooks a ridiculous essay which claims that the ""greatness"" of a poem can be calculated according to the mathematical formula PxI=G.",
50,28 January 2008,whpratt1,8, Great Robin Williams Film,"Did not think that I would enjoy this film because I am not a big fan of Robin Williams who plays the role as John Keating, an English Professor who loves poetry and teaches this subject quite different than anyone else. Professor Keating gets down to basic facts about poetry and turns this subject into a very enjoyable experience which relates to how you can live in this world and have a great experience in doing whatever you really want to do and it also draws out young men's mental feelings about themselves and other people. This story also dwells with a young man named Todd Anderson, (Ethan Hawke) who is a very shy student and also had an older brother who attended this same college and was valedictorian, which are hard shoes to step into. Todd's room-mate is Neil Perry, ( Robert Sean Leonard) who has a very overbearing father and wants him to go to medical school and does not want him to waste his time on any social activities at the college. This story becomes very interesting with some of the students falling madly in love with pretty gals which makes this film a great all around treat to watch and enjoy.",

54,17 September 2008,kyle-cruse,8," Sad, though quite inspirational","I generally find great inspiration in films like this, and ""Dead Poets Society"" is no exception. Robin Williams stars as a professor who encourages his students to ""make your lives extraordinary."" This ends up causing some of the students to go too far in this direction, resulting in the ""sad"" elements of this film. I did, however, feel a sense of encouragement in what Williams says, realizing that we've only got one life in this world and should make it something great. The scenes with Williams are superb, some of the best dialogue you will ever hear, in this film that won an Oscar for its screenplay. Williams was robbed of an Oscar here, though he later won one for the similar film he appeared in ""Good Will Hunting."" Though I like ""Good Will Hunting"" even better, I truly enjoyed this film. The one thing I felt it lacked was enough scenes with Williams and his students. Too many scenes feature the students off on their own in their club, or getting in trouble with other students or their parents, scenes that can get depressing when there are so many of them. Fortunately, Robin Williams comes around often enough the lighten things up a bit, though this is considered one of the first of his more serious roles. The ending scene is great, as is the one with Williams telling the students to rip out part of their textbook. A nicely-done, inspiring film. Not perfect, though it is still quite good.",
55,20 April 2006,VoyagerSamfan87,10, one of the most amazing and uplifting movie experiences that I had ever had,"Dead Poets Society is hands down one of the most powerful and upfliting movies that I have seen-and trust me I have seen many powerful movies. This is one of Robin Williams finest performances-I do believe he should have been at least nominated for best actor and either the guy who plays Neil or Ethan Hawk should have been nominated for best supporting actor.The frindships that are forged in the school are genuine and believable and the people are those that you can relate to. I myself can relate to Todd, shy and a bit insecure of who he is. John Keating-played by Robin Williams-is a teacher who believes in more then just teaching about whats in the books, he believes in teaching about *life* and seazing the day. This movie shows how important it is to live each day to your fullest and to follow your dreams. I have seen many powerful films, and Dead Poets Society is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It captures the essance of what a film should to do a person. It shows a different view of life and makes you question things. It brings tears in your eyes as well as laughter. Even though I get emotional during films very rarly do I cry in them, but I did cry during the end of the movie with what happened to Neil and Keating. The ending to this day had a powerful effect on me and not many movies has an effect on you to the point where you get emotional and uplifted just thinking about the movie. It is a movie where you would watch many times and each time find something new with it. It is by far one of the most amazing and uplifting movie experiences that I have ever had.",

57,16 October 2015,Geeky Randy,9, Geeky Randy's summary,"Film set in 1959 (based on screenwriter Schulman's own experiences at academy) about liberal English teacher Williams influencing his students who attend all-boys Welton Academy. Focuses more on the group of boys, but Williams is able to work his off-the-cuff dialogue enough to keep you reminded that it's still him. Absolutely beautiful Northeastern setting, with excellent enough pacing to keep you entertained the entire way through. The boys are surprisingly less dorky than you'd think. The film never takes the easy way out, with Weir and Schulman seeming perfectly content with impending gloom. Kudos also for developing how important teachers can be to their students and vice versa.

Of the five, I like Born on the Fourth of July a lot. Or at least I used to like it. I haven't seen it in years and I'm not sure it would hold up that well. The other four are quite mediocre, with one of the most mediocre winners of all time, Driving Miss Daisy. If you can extrapolate the general IMDb voter's opinion, Dead Poets Society should have won. It's the highest rated of the five, and has about 140,000 more votes than the next most voted on title. That's pretty amazing, really. I don't get it, frankly. Dead Poets Society to me was probably the worst of the five, just complete sludge. The film is about a group of rich white boys at a boarding school who become enamored of their free-spirited teacher, Robin Williams, who teaches them to ""carpe diem,"" or ""sieze the day."" The boys (who include Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) form the Dead Poets Society, where they meet at night in a cave to read poetry. This is, for no reason in particular, highly looked down upon. And woe unto you if you ever want to act in a Shakespeare play, as Leonard eventually does. His father, Kurtwood Smith, does not approve of such frivolities. The final act of this film is pretty ridiculous, with Robin Williams incurring blame for something that clearly had nothing to do with him. The ending, which is supposed to be uplifting, just feels extremely unsatisfying. The performances are actually quite fine. Williams certainly didn't deserve a Best Actor nomination, though. This is clearly category fraud. There is no clear lead, but both Leonard and Hawke probably have more screen time than Williams, who seems like he's barely in the film for it being such a well loved performance.",

As a teacher who put his heart and soul into what I did, I tried to make impressions help them master life skills. The sad reality is that one does one's best to crack the numbers game. Every year we have a few of those students who we try to embrace and find the right direction for them, but we are so hamstrung. The first thing I thought when evaluating this film is the little group of kids that he dealt with. He got to know each of them intimately. Of course, it's a prep school, but even then he should have had a couple other full classrooms. What he does is admirable and exciting. That he throws himself into his work to such an extent is amazing. But let's face it. This is a formulaic film that has been done many times before. It is monument building and flying in the face of establishment whose soul purpose is to ruin these kids' lives. There's a kind of narcissism to think that in this group we have bunch of directionless idiots who could never think for themselves.

First of all, I cannot recall another film made by artists I admire so much(Peter Weir, Robin Williams) that I detest this much. The moment this film tries to find a plot-- when Kurtwood Smith's character(Neil's father) argues with his son and asks, ""Why are you defying me, Neil? Is it this new man? This Mr. Keating?""-- it sounds completely fake. Why would the father assume his teenage son is challenging him because of a teacher? How would he know which teacher to blame? This movie careens through manipulative scenes without ever stopping to really learn about its characters-- Knox's romance with a local girl is given so little screen time, it's absolutely pointless. John Keating's scenes in the classroom use literature as a source for empty sloganeering. That's a concert, not a classroom.",

With a subtle performance from Robin Williams and equally as down-to-earth turns by its young cast (which includes a fresh-faced Ethan Hawke), the picture crafts a gentle, grounded and emotive experience that achieves its desired effect. The first act is a little slow, as the flick sets up its central concept and characters, and it takes a while for the thing to start affecting as it should, but the overall result is entertaining and, when it needs to be, rather powerful. It takes you through a bevy of emotions and certainly makes its point. It's quite unique, in a way. It mightn't be the most outwardly enjoyable picture, but it's an engaging effort. 7/10",

Brief Review -",
80,26 February 2021,ironhorse_iv,8, Carpe diem! Seize the day! Make your lives extraordinary! Watch Dead Poets Society!,"Set at a fictional uptight authoritarian American elite boarding school in the 1950s, the motion picture directed by Peter Weir tells the story of an unorthodox English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) inspiring his students to think for themselves through the power of poetry. Without spoiling the film too much, the movie was nominated for four Academy Awards and won best screenplay. I love that Tom Schulman semi-autobiographical script doesn't use a few poetic lines as one-time throwaways inspiration quotes. He really did work it out to fit what the characters were indeed going throughout the movie. There is no better example of this than Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) gaining the stage part of Puck in William Shakespeare's fantasy masterpiece 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In these few sequences with this character, we see the glimpses of happiness, dreams and death that Keating has been divulging. Triumph and tribulation. A small slice of life. Even if the youthfulness of most of the students visually doesn't really come across that well due to most of the performers looking older than they seems. Yet Ethan Hawke does look the part. His acting as Todd Anderson outshines everybody even Robin. Such heavy emotional powerful delivery. So, it was a shock to hear that Williams would often tease Hawke for his style of acting. I guess he was jealous of Ethan and angry that his career might dry up after his recent ugly divorce. Thank God, Robin matured enough to patched things up after this film and help the young actor find future roles. Talk about being nearly hypocritical. Anyways Hawke's performance brought out some really great visually beautiful shot moments in the film. Yawping and the tossing the work desk scenes are great, but the sequence that stood out to me is one take wonder where Todd cries in the snow. Glad that they got it before the frost started to fade. Can't believe that was originally going to be an interior shot. The director and crew made the right decision with that wide shot as it shows how lonely, lost and overwhelm the character can be. Along with that, the impressive low angle camera angle of nearly all the Dead Poet Society members standing tall and looking at things from a different perspective makes the downer ending a little more pleasure to watch. In truth, cinematographer John Sela really deserved an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. These visuals shots are remarkable. Along with that, composer Maurice Jarre should had been nod for Best Original Score. Astonishing music to the ears. Even if his use of bagpipes ""The Fields of Athenry"" wasn't historical accurate, as the piece was composed in the 1970s. Other historical inaccuracies nitpick that came with this was poem misquotes and people reading books that have yet to published in the 1950s. Nevertheless, if there are any real flaws that comes with this picture, it would have to be the fact that part of the movie hasn't aged well and would unlikely get through modern day sensitivity. One such example is the disturbing ways that Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) tries to win the heart of a girl he only met once. Seeing him grope her when she's asleep and excessive lust for her to the point that she got angry; didn't really made me want to root for him. He come across as an aggressive creep that fit the definition of sexual predator. I found the love story not really charming. It's perhaps the weakest part. Then there is the character of Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen) making an excuse to act like a trouble maker by using what come across as a made-up African lampoon name despite the context of the words referring to the Slavic people of eastern Germany. Having him act like a stereotypical minstrel show clown pimp without the blackface is a bit cringeworthy. Another thing that might stop modern audiences from watching this movie is how on the surface level, it is a generic WASP coming to age story. A context that isn't really appealing these days with most Millennials going to public school full of a variety of melting pot students. This movie certainly failed the Bechdel test and diversity index. There wouldn't be many young viewers that can related to these boys. However, I think there might be some Millennials & Zoomers that can find something about themselves in these characters; either with the universal educational themes toward mental health. Particularly when it comes to trying to rise up from depression and suicidal thoughts. I like that the film still tries to promote an idealistic viewpoint even though a lot of situations in the film are firmly on the cynical end. Unfortunate that religious aspect isn't one of them. Faith in the school is made out to look like an authoritarian system of control rather than a normal way of dealing with guilt and learning to heal. I have mixed feeling about how that was portrayal. Along with the idea that it's ok to vandalize school property like censoring ideas that go against his teachings by ripping out pages from a textbook. Some of Keating's actions can seem polarizing. Nevertheless, Williams gives out a performance that really spoke to the struggles and dilemma of balancing free will when it comes to youth; with the actors playing the students all roomed together to help build up a believable bond. The film's final scene farewell salute to him is very reminiscent of The Twilight Zone (1959) episode ""The Changing of the Guard"" with their teacher. Along with many future parodies. Now that scene is almost impossible to watch without feeling like a send-off for Williams rather than his character. The suicidal themes of the film are now harsher in hindsight after that actor passing. Despite that, o' captain, my captain this movie is still worth the watch. A near poetry in motion masterpiece.",

This film may have tried, but it just really didn't do much for this particular viewer. The plot is good, and the story is one that should be told. The way it's told here works OK, but the film never grabbed me. I never stopped watching or particularly felt like it... the film isn't bad, just somewhat bland. The acting ranges, but is rarely magnificent. The cast has a nice hand-full of people who have done better, given much more convincing performances. The writing ranges. There are a few scenes that work well, maybe even one or two that are downright memorable and good, but then there are the(admittedly only few) underdeveloped sub-plots, and scenes that just don't come off as dramatic as it seems like they were meant to. There are a few technical issues; the editing is at times strange, cutting away or on to the next shot too soon or too late. The cinematography mostly at least works, but there are a few shots that are oddly framed. In the end, this is a decent enough film, it just seems like it could have been considerably better, given the people in front of and behind the cameras(Weir went on to direct The Truman Show).

91,2 January 2010,yris2002,10, No more words: just see and love it,"I saw ""The dead poets society"" on TV for the umpteenth time, after at least ten years. And I felt like writing something about this awesome picture and I am happy to write the first review of the year with a movie full of faith, inspiration and courage. It is certainly one of my ten favourite pictures, each time capable of arousing such a strong emotional impact, that words seem to be insufficient, as too limited and limiting. In this sense, I think it is very difficult to say something new, or vaguely original about such a masterpiece that can speak and appeal naturally to the public without needing any praising words. However, after seeing it I couldn't but compare the impact it exerted on me the first time I saw it, being in my teens, and now, being a young woman. The first time represented a revelation, Joyce would call it an epiphany, I was totally absorbed and completely overwhelmed and, although not being able to get subtle and more mature hints, it was from the moment I saw it that I could clearly distinguish between teachers who meant teaching as a vocation, and those who just taught to make a living. I never had the fortune of enjoying a teacher of such a sort, but could feel those who really felt the responsibility of educating, and growing children and not only passing information to them. This time I still felt deeply emotionally involved, and still in the last scene I wanted to enter and stand on that desk, and join the students shouting ""Oh Captain, My captain"". Let's admit, that even though the student's years are far away, I still look forward to meeting a man like him, as endowed with a sensitivity and a human depth that would make him an ideal friend, or a perfect soul-mate.

One kid kills himself, a teacher loses his job, and the system remains the same.  Why does the kid shoot himself?  Because he has a stock character of a dad that doesn't understand his son's desire to wear tights and spout poetry.  What is a lad to do?  Try and really stand up to dad?  No.  Try and talk to mom or another sympathetic ear that might be able to sway dad?  No. Run away from home until dad realizes he made a mistake?  No... wait, I got it: Blow your own skull off!   And what about the lad's mentor?  The teacher who dared to defy the system and take the fall?  All the desk stomping and Shakespearean one-liners didn't save his job or reputation in the end.  He leaves and the system wins again.  So did anything really change in this movie?  Doesn't really seem that way.   A couple kids were more ""enlightened"" I guess.  But how?

Coming from a lower middle class family and completing twenty years of formal education entirely in the public system with virtually no connections anywhere, I decided that I didn't want to teach or pursue the law profession, and the world decided that I didn't have the talent to earn a living as a writer or even as an editor of actual, able writers.

Todd, my favorite and a Fencer, isn't sure whether he wants to go along with what everybody is doing instead of following his heart and he is jealous of his friend Neil because he has trouble speaking in front of people and has a low self esteem. Yes, Cameron is a Follower who goes by the rules no matter what. The ruler he used to tear off the pages of his book is an example that he only goes by the rules and never bends them only if someone asks him to. Mr. Keening is my favorite character because he interacts with his students in such an effective way that gets them interested in the class. And the comments he says sometimes are just plain hilarious. I just like the overall message about Siezing the Day and that we are all worm food so why live our life according to how others want us to live them? We all like different passions and dislikes and shouldn't feel afraid to get out of our little fence of protection, safety, isolation, fear, or security.

I fell in love with the poetry, I fell in love with the characters, the story, the beautiful music and pictures. I always wish I had such an inspiring teacher like Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams) And I always wish I found such nice boys out there. The ending is so powerful. This movie gave me so often the strenght to carry on when I'm down. All actors did a great, great job. Don't believe the critics! The movie is not perfect, OK. But I don't know a perfect movie anyway. This movie was wrong interpreted so often. Especially the suicide of one of the boys. But if you look carefully you see there is an answer against all the points which are criticized. For example: It's not true that there are only bad adults in this movie. I divide into the opinion that Neil's father is the reason why he kills himself. Neil's father want the best education and the best job for his son. He couldn't show his love - and he loves his son - in a better way. He never wanted that this happened. The way he treat his son make Neil so desperate that he thinks his only way out is to kill himself. Maybe it's the fact that I hate authority for me conformity is a very bad thing. Therefore for me it's not intolerant that they have to rip out the meaning of Mr. Dr. of Philosophy because it is true, you couldn't judge poetry and art in general like charts. Everybody who believe this deserves to be ripped out of a book, because a person thinking in such small boxes is the one person which is really intolerant. Keating tell the boys that it's good to be a lawyer, doctor or something like this. He don't't want them to be romantics. But he also told them that beauty and love gave a meaning to this life. So if you haven't seen this movie until yet go and get it and make up your mind, follow your own thoughts, even if the others think you are a jerk, but also be open for a different view and that's really the message Keating wants to taught the kids and more important than the beautiful poetry which is a bigger part of the movie than some people say.",

A new English teacher at an elite boys' boarding school brings a maverick sense of teaching to the stuffy institution, injecting vitality into the life of some of the boys, while putting himself on a collision course with the school authorities. Great scenes abound: the walk in the courtyard to teach about the dangers of conformity, Tom's blindfolded poetry read, and the climactic tribute of the boys to their fallen captain, one of the greatest tear-jerkers in cinema. Look at Weir's angle and camera placement - absolutely perfect. His extreme wide shot of a grieving Tom in a snow landscape, and his silent depiction of Neil's demise, all attest to poetry in both script and mise-en-scene. Very few films are faultless, but there is not one word, shot, casting decision or any other element of this film that one would change. Outstanding cinema.",

This movie really made me understand the importance of living by the phrase ""carpe diem."" I think all of the guys in Dead Poets Society are relatable to many in their own way, which I think is one of the reasons why this is such a widely adored film; people can see how someone can struggle to live life to the fullest, but they wish to do so anyway. Todd Anderson was my favorite character. I really related to him in terms of his anxious personality, but in the end, learning to be comfortable in himself and his own decisions. I think Neil Perry is extremely relatable to the masses due to his ""unrealistic"" dreams. I've known so many people, and have also myself, wanted unrealistic realities. I think that both these characters are really important to both myself and for so many people, especially adolescents. I think it's important to learn how to embrace yourself, the draw backs to doing it, and the drawbacks to not doing it.

Tood who I could relate to more, was the shy one in the group. But with the help of Neil, the rest of the group and Mr. Keating, Todd learns to step out of his comfort zone and at the end of the movie does the right thing. It was wonderfully acted and cast.

133,17 August 2020,Hussain-AL-Naseer,8, William's Class Act,"One of the finest film I've come a crossed recently. Although watching it in 2020 makes its plot very familiar with Unorthodox teacher inspiring his students to make their lives extraordinary by the phrase Carpe Diem i.e. seize the day and on the contrary parents having different plans and ambitions for their children's, yet the brilliant narration and picturization makes it different from other movies still in 2020 with same idea which you'll definitely agree after watching this movie . Peter Weir's storytelling is very engaging followed by some catchy background score which ignites the emotions instantly especially in the climax scene. Robin Williams as John Keating, the Teacher narrating poetries and making it relevant to the common life struggles etc. is just brilliant, by the end of the movie you'll definitely sympathize for the character and chances are you might actually end up with tears just as I did and that defines the sheer class of Late Robin Williams.
Supporting cast i.e. the young group of students at that time not so young today were very convincing, they nailed it with their own stories and things happening around them and their connection with their teacher who once freaked them out.
Despite of some hell of the performances and smart direction, film's strongest part is indeed its writing and credit should've been given to Tom Schulman, actually credit has already been given to him as he secured Academy Award for this movie, Although the plot is familiar in 2020 but imagine 1989 when film got released pitching this kind of story for the first time ........

For people who delve too deep into the meaning of the film, you might find yourself rather cheated or disappointed because of its radical nature. However, if you take it for what it is.. A film that wants to incite the senses to accept change; you will end up getting that warm feeling one gets when having a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly December morning. It works itself up from a simple saying ~ Carpe diem, which is Latin for 'Seize the day'. It is what the new English teacher asks his new 17 year old batch of students to do (in quite a bizarre manner). Together with The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it is one of Peter Weir's best films. The football match with Beethoven in the background, and the climax with bagpipes are the two best sequences in the film. I found Robin Williams' impersonation of Marlon Brando and John Wayne hilarious! Dead Poets Society is a film that has been widely criticized for its ending. You will know why once you've see it. As far as film-making goes, the ending is done perfectly. However, it could mean different things to different people. To challenge your views, to look at things differently, give Dead Poets Society a go. It is based in 1959, so don't give it as hard a time as some critics have given it.",

Basically Todd Anderson (young Ethan Hawke) is one of the new students to attend the new semester at Welton Academy for boys, along with Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) - always under pressure by his father Mr. Perry (Kurtwood Smith), Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero) and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston). All classes appear boring and not to the boys interests, and then they have their first English class with replacement teacher John Keating (Robin Williams), and they all bond with him and his unusual teaching methods. As they get to know Keating, or ""Oh Captain, My Captain"", they also come across his old year book, with mention of a club called the ""Dead Poets Society"", a hang out for student boys to read and write poems to each other, and they decide to restart it in the same cave. As well as their ""learning"" of English (poetry), Dalton causes trouble with a letter to the Headmaster saying that girls should attend, Knox tries his luck with local girl Chris Noel (Alexandra Powers), and Perry has the ambition to be an actor. After starring as the lead in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Perry's father is still controlling, and he decides to make him leave the school for military academy, this is when Neil can't stand it, and commits suicide. In the end, Keating is told to leave the school on the grounds of encouraging the boys, and possibly having some involvement of Niel's suicide, and the final scene, which was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, has all his students stand on their desk shouting ""Oh Captain, My Captain"" in support. Also starring Norman Lloyd as Mr. Nolan and Carla Belver as Mrs. Perry. Williams is a wonderful teacher character, teaching the boys to be free thinkers, and stand up for what they want, it is no wonder he received an Oscar nomination. All the young boys have their moments too, with some funny moments from Williams (especially with impressions, like Marlon Brando and John Wayne), it is a very warm and touching film. It won the Oscar for Won Oscar Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Original Film Score for Maurice Jarre, and it was nominated for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 95 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Carpe diem. Seize the days, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.""), it was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 51 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",

151,16 December 2013,StevePulaski,8, The good and the bad fight to create a mixed bag,"I can look at Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society from two different lenses and come to two different conclusions based on them. The first lens sees a mawkish production, one looking to inflate its emotional climax by ways of theatrics and erect a film largely founded off of vague characters, common clichés, and quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets. I'd assign that film two stars. However, my opposite view sees the film as a production tackling themes of self-discovery and enrichment along with aspirations over obligations, utilizing quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets to its advantage. I'd assign that film four stars. The issue is I can't see one lens at a time, without the other covering it, as everything I've stated exists in this film to some degree. I'm compromising at three stars and going from there.",

Using unconventional methods and a sense of self-confidence, Dead Poets Society/Mr. Keating aims to rouse us into being non-conformist and achieving our true selves. The problem is that it becomes endlessly preachy and repetitive, turning the characters into ready-made roles instead of real human beings. Mr. Keating is too good for this earth, the students are impressionable and roused to action, one student is shy but has his potential unlocked, another student falls into the trap of conformism and the school administration exists just to be villainous. On a scene-to-scene basis, the characters seem fleshed out and compelling, which made the story quite enjoyable to watch, but overall they just fit into standard storytelling slots, so by the end it didn't feel genuine.

This is one of Robin Williams finest performances-I do believe he should have been at least nominated for best actor and either the guy who plays Neil or Ethan Hawk should have been nominated for best supporting actor. The frindships that are forged in the school are genuine and believable and the people are those that you can relate to. I myself can relate to Todd, shy and a bit insecure of who he is. John Keating-played by Robin Williams-is a teacher who believes in more then just teaching about whats in the books, he believes in teaching about *life* and seazing the day. This movie shows how important it is to live each day to your fullest and to follow your dreams. I have seen many powerful films, and Dead Poets Society is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It captures the essance of what a film should to do a person. It shows a different view of life and makes you question things. It brings tears in your eyes as well as laughter. Even though I get emotional during films very rarly do I cry in them, but I did cry during the end of the movie with what happened to Neil and Keating. The ending to this day had a powerful effect on me and not many movies has an effect on you to the point where you get emotional and uplifted just thinking about the movie.

No other film has inspired me, challenged me, or changed me as much as this film! It takes a simple idea of making the most out of everyday and expands it to the nth degree, all the while reaching across to audiences of many kinds, from film critics to moviegoers to high school students to even Academy members! It talks about seizing the day, your life, and getting the most out of it, which is what you would expect. But it delves much deeper, revealing the challenges of seizing your life, especially growing up, the pressure on how you should live and on how you should follow, and the potential consequences of doing so. Yet at the same time, it shows you the benefits and how those benefits greatly outweigh those negative traits. And it does so in such an intriguing way. Each kid is different and well-developed yet all have some similarity. Robin Williams plays an amazing role as Mr. Keating (I always saw him as a more talented dramatic actor than a comedic one). Some have said that the story is unrealistic and a rehash of other student- teacher movies. But like the poetry in this movie, this is not about realism, this is about the message of seizing the day and making your world extraordinary. The way the movie does this is so unforgettable with the believable and grade-A acting from the students and Williams, the great camera shots, and the amazing theme and atmosphere, so much so that I can watch the entire movie just for those select scenes. All of this and more is why Dead Poets Society is my number 1 favorite movie of all time!",

It makes you think about the way you are being treated by the people around you, and about how you are currently treating the people around you. It has an especially heart-wrenching ending since the death of Robin Williams. Everyday should be seized as if it is the last to be lived, and no one should live thinking otherwise.

So does that make Keating's work ultimately, a failure? Or does the freedom of half a dozen students preponderate the death of one? When looked from an outside perpective, as objectively as possible, 6 free souls are of much more value than 7 trapped souls. So in that sense, Keating has accomplished his goal, even though he did get fired (he wouldn't mind). But reality, isn't that simple. The death of Neil has wide and continuing consequences. The burden of his death is something Keating will have to carry with for the rest of his life. It will have long lasting results on the school, and in his friends, though perhaps the latter will be able to learn and better themselves from the situation. And what about the parents? Ok, they were horrible parents; and should've been shown the right way. But the death of a child is very difficult for anyone to deal with. However, they didn't even seem to learn them anything from the most blatant way of conveying the message. The list of problems go on. Ultimately, Neil's parents, are the villains in this story. Keating freed his students, and Neil's parents didn't allow him to be freed, and confined him in a space he did not want to be. They are the ones who caused their son's death, not Keating.",

The first time I saw the film ""Dead Poets Society"" was as a school project, and I became rather interested in the concept, nothing more at the time. I delivered my paper and thought nothing of the film until it was on television 2 years later. Now, during these years, I had practically done nothing with my life and was kind of depressed but as I saw this movie again, I was astonished. I cried at the end etc. etc. and really went into a big think. The next couple of weeks, I did some ""wild"" things to just feel that I was living, and I actually began acting, got a tattoo on my arm that says ""Carpe Diem"" to remember me of my duty to get the best of life, and to get that today, and every day. To never count on tomorrow. Since I saw that movie, I have had nightmares of me lying as a 85 year old man, ready to die, thinking ""man, what have i actually done with my life. It's too late to do something about it now"". Anyway, no matter how you live your lives, I respect it, as long as you do, just what you really want to do :) Carpe Diem everyone",

The plot: In the 50s,new student Tood Anderson is sent to the same school where his brother did fantastically.While he is trying to play things down about his brother,he starts getting on with people at the school and gets a friend(Neil.)The thing that changes them is the new English teacher Mr Keating,who Tells them they should ""be themselves"" and not ""act like sheep"".Tood and Neil find out that Mr Keating used to be in a club called The Dead Poets society.After hearing about this,Tood and Neil decide to re-open the club to get themselves ""Free"",this will sadly end with one of them tacking there own life.... View on the film: The screenplay:written by Tom Schulman,while the film has a bit of a thin plot,Schulman makes the film feel like a really great European-type character driven film.The other things that is done very well is the change halfway into the film,where it takes on a very dark turn.While most movies would find it hard to change gears like that,this movie does it really well. The cast:The cast do a really good job at making the people feel very real.You can feel Williams moving away from his (very good)comedies,to giving really great performances for dramas.But,the main stand outs are Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leondas as Tood and Neil.They both give really great performances that make you feel they really are friends,and that when Neil dies,Hawke does a great job at showing the sadness he has,for losing a friend in such a sad way. Direction:Peter Weire does a fantastic job,at showing how the film (over the films time-line)changes.From something that looks really picture-perfect,that could be from an old faded photo album,to some very dark and disturbing images.(With very strong religious overtones-aseptically in the suicide scene.)But Weire always makes sure that the characters are the centre piece of the film.The other thing Weir did great and was very different (at the time) for getting a really good,serious performance out of Robin Williams.

His unorthodox teaching methods inspire most of the students to carpe diem- seize the day. Dead Poets Society (1989) is a drama classic directed by the Australian master Peter Weir. Tom Schulman is behind the great script. The actors are all extraordinary. Robin Williams gives a memorable performance as Keating. This actor, who was mostly known as a comedian, proves here he could master drama as well. It is sad we haven't had Robin on this Earth for three years since he took his own life.

An extremely young Ethan Hawke is the focus, and he shines, but I found more versatility in Robert Sean Leonard's tragic turn as his brash, social, get- things-done roommate. A setting in the conservative 1950s excuses many of the film's indulgences, grounding it as a period piece with flashes of the cultural revolution that was already on the way, but also adds a certain sense of natural charm and classic Americana to the mix. It can be quite dark, but also very optimistic, and expertly handles that difficult range of emotion through a vast array of concurrent story lines.

To achieve his political goals, the teacher encourages his students, all impressionable adolescents, to break the rules of the school, under the guise of promoting academic and personal freedom, and a group of his students respond by forming a secret society. These students have no idea that Mr. Keating is using them to promote strife between the faculty and student body, embarrass the school administration and thereby force change. As a result the students are placed in impossible conflictual situations that they are utterly incapable of resolving. Mr. Keating's manipulativeness is so blatantly reckless that it leads to one student committing suicide.

Robin Williams downplays his trademark mugging style to actually offer a credible performance, despite being miscast (or at least misrepresented) in the pivotal lead role.

There have been many movies about teacher's who relate to their students in greater ways than what normally is expected but this one is more about the students than the teacher.  Robin Williams plays a new English teacher for a very high-brow preparatory school and doesn't follow the book to teach his kids.  He emphasizes that they ""Sieze"" every day because it may be their last and teaches them how poetry is about passion of life rather than just a subject in school.  Some of the students grab a-hold of his teaching and form a secret soceity that reads poetry in a scary cave near the school. The philosophy bleeds into their lives and starts to reek havic on their normal everyday lives but they for once are truly learning about themselves and learning from their life experiences. A tragedy occurs with one of the students and this is where the story takes a turn and life starts to be the judge as to whether the students really believe what they think they do.

Keating's support to all his students and exasperate way of teaching is entertaining and inspiring. And as is the whole point of the film, the phrase ""carpe diem - seize the day"" is a beautiful and and poetic. The sadness the film portrays in the last half hour is real and raw, and never fails to make me, as a huge fan of it, tear up. It's a film I would always recommend to anyone.

He wants the students to think for themselves although other teachers disagree with this vision. They think a boy that is 17 years old is not able to think for himself. You can imagine how the story develops; the students like Mr. Keating, the other teachers don't.",

266,9 August 1999,Spleen,7, Why this movie is NOT another bad Robin Williams showcase,"Robin Williams has played a doctor, another doctor, a disk jockey, a toymaker, a loony scientist, and so on through a long list - each character somehow different from everyone else in his profession, each with a certain something that makes everyone else adore him, each obviously in possession of a huge ego, each given an opportunity to do some Robin Williams schtick, each determined to steal the movie at all costs.  He's like that here, too. So what's the difference?",
267,29 July 2014,Seraphion,7, Nice movie on defying conformity,"The movie digs deep about the very foundational idea of conforming whether to the general idea of well being, which may not be in line with one's own choice, or to live and let live the very desires that makes one feels very much alive. The premise is inserted well in the theme of artistic literature and the philosophical paradigm it comes with. There is less twists in the steady build up and flow of the story. But the dramatization is superb. It's able to grasp most, if not all, the essential issues concerning the period of the younger adulthood. The movie is then capped by a great sequence of finale events that question the idea of loyalty, not just to the friends beside you, but also to yourself and your belief. Robin Williams acted out good here, although I have to say that this is not his best performance. It's nice to see Ethan Hawke's earlier works in this movie. And it's quite a loss that most of the other actors of this class don't really make a long career.",

I have to say that this movie really taught myself a few life lessons with, ""suck the marrow out of life."" The ending really leaves a mark on your heart and a tear in your eye.

274,13 November 2014,brchthethird,8, A marvelously inspiring story with one of Robin Williams' best performances,"DEAD POETS SOCIETY is an incredibly moving film by Peter Weir about life at a boys prep school. It stars Robin Williams as John Keating, an English teacher, with Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke as two of the core group of students. I went into this film knowing a little about the plot from various clips on the internet, e.g., the famous ""Oh captain, my captain"" line. I was also aware about the fate of a character, although I didn't know which one until watching it. I was generally very impressed with the film, and Robin Williams' performance in particular. The story is one that had the potential to be very clichéd and overly sentimental, but the themes discussed within were approached earnestly and backed up with some great performances. Robin Williams is especially great as the English teacher, whose unique worldview (at least in the stodgy prep school environment) and unconventional teaching methods inspire the boys to make the most of their lives and dare to break the mold. The film follows several of these boys who are inspired to ""seize the day"" in various ways. Robert Sean Leonard's character pursues his dream of acting and another character, Knox Overstreet, pursues a girl that he loves despite the threat of her boyfriend finding out. Together, the boys bring back a poetry reading group originally started by Keating, called the ""Dead Poets Society"" (hence, the title of the film). This wasn't actually the point of the film, but more of a jumping-off point. The wonder of the film is to see how the boys develop and change for the better under Keating's influence. I can't say enough how much I loved the message. That being said, there are a couple of areas worth talking about which aren't as great. One of them is that given the large cast of characters, more time could have been spent developing them, although what's there was adequate. There is also a climactic scene which, while still handled tastefully, felt a little emotionally manipulative. Overall, this has to be the best of Robin Williams' dramatic roles that I've seen so far. It's an engaging, thought-provoking and moving film about making the most of your life, even if the setting is a bit overused. Highly recommended.",
275,5 January 2007,pyrocitor,9, Sucking the marrow out of life,"Every once in a while, a film comes along which stands the test of time. A film which, ten years later or more can still hold the same emotional resonance and merit as it did when it was first released, and still be renowned as a genuinely quality piece. Dead Poets Society is one of those films which has withstood the ages, becoming somewhat iconic as a charming, but never cheesy sentimental tearjerker and uplifting tale of passion and hope all the same. When one watches it, it's really no wonder why the movie has lasted - there is simply so much to appreciate here, and never once does the film seem fake, as if the ideals are being beaten over our heads - they are simply presented in an optimistic light, attempting to sweep us up in their sense of enthusiasm and passion as well.

It's about truly teaching, truly learning, overcoming your fears, standing up for yourself, standing up for what you stand for, it's about ""sounding your barbaric roar over the rooftops of the world""!

A beautifully groomed private prep school with lots of visual attention to all those little details that make the place and this film so visually inviting and rich. The main message it extolls is to 'fight/resist conformity and be yourself'. All of which I can get behind. Unfortunately, this story has been told countless times, and while this film may look better than many of the others with the same story, it doesn't really bring anything new, except of course for looking very, very good. It knows all the cliched touching points to push at exactly the right times throughout.

So, I had high hopes for this movie and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. It seems in almost every dramatic or semi-dramatic film that Robin Williams stars in, he plays a victim. I kept waiting for him to be picked on and it sure came. John Seating is a new teacher at a very strict school called Welton. His styles and teaching methods are not what the students are used to and his love for poetry inspires them to reopen an old school club called the Dead Poets Society. At this point, the movie falls downhill. I think the problem is the characters. The director tries to make us love and connect with them, oh how hard he tries. But, oh how much I didn't care by the end. We needed to know more about John Seating's personal life and not just his job. Besides a few good themes scattered throughout, there is not a lot to gain by watching this film.",

It achieves showing an interesting story about certain prep school teenagers and the art of teaching. The film is sad but a great drama, and highly enjoyable. I found the performances very convincing and liked the direction of Peter Weir here. The screenplay was written very well, an emotionally charged film. Williams is his best here, its this role that helps shape another great performance of his in 98's Good Will Hunting. I liked this film a lot though, not even comparable to crap films like School Ties or even better than the recent powerful Swedish film Evil, which was brutally violent and got its point across but did not leave as great as impression as this film did, without the violence.

296,21 November 2020,jayjaycee,10, Carpe Diem in its bittersweetest form,"""Dead Poets Society"" is a 1989 drama directed by Peter Weir starring Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard.
⚪
All in all, this extraordinary Peter Weir film heart-warmingly teaches about the most important aspects in life and what really makes it special, such as individualism, true love, real beauty and poetry as a means to immortality in this world, and thanks to Robin Williams's masterful performance as John Keating, a marvellously written script and an utterly sensitive narration it becomes an inspiring masterpiece that touched me tremendously, changed my life forever and made me the poet I am today, and no other film has ever had such an indescribable impact on me.
⚪
I thought that it was time to start this weekend by revisiting my third favourite film of all time, since the ambience and the time during which it is set resembles the beauty of autumn that currently prevails where I live. Since the first time I have watched it on Robin Williams' birthday two years ago, I have stored this masterpiece in the deepest depths of my heart, simply because it means the world to me. Seriously, there are other films out there that might be technically better crafted and probably critically more acclaimed, but none of them has touched me in the same way this one did. For the record, I choose my favourites not simply by how they are conceptualised, but also by how much of a personal importance they have. Of course, I think that my top four are flawless features, but they all have had an impact on me that only few titles manage to have as well. This one is probably the one that affected me in the most powerful way possible. Peter Weir's late eighties drama is a downright masterpiece that never ceases to amaze me. Every single line of dialogue, every second of acting and every single shot is simply beautiful. In a bittersweet manner, it depicts the story of John Keating, a young teacher who teaches his students at an elite boarding school about the true and most important values of life and encourages them to live it to the fullest. However, his unconventional teaching methods make quite a splash and entail a lot of problems. What fascinates me the most about this film is how it conveys what it has to say. Keating encourages his students to think out of the box and find themselves, but the way he lectures about beauty, poetry, romance, love and what really makes life worthwhile transcends the lens of the camera and hits the viewer right in the feelings. Seriously, every single thing he says stirs my heart directly, and it always feels like as if I am sitting in his classroom, listening to his brilliance. As some of you may know, I am writer and primarily a poet. I have been one before I have seen this moving film, but after the credits have rolled, it felt like my eyes have been opened, and on this lovely day in summer of two-thousand eighteen, I have found my true calling. Yes, this movie defined my person and made me the man I am today. Isn't this crazy? I mean, how many films have this astonishing power to change your life forever? It is just awe-inspiring. Aside from how moving it is, it is also a drama per excellence that knows to convince with its practical features. In all this talk about beauty and love, there it also expresses sharp criticism to so many things: the extreme strictness at elite schools, the oppression of individualism and parental expectations. This film is a heated debate of ""uniqueness vs. conformity"", and it displays this never-ending fight in a raw and extremely emotional way. The boys of Mr. Keating's English class (who share an extremely genuine chemistry) expound the famous Latin phrase ""carpe diem"" in completely differently way, and thus the consequences for each and everyone differ drastically. It is undeniable that he encourages them to be free thinkers and follow their own path, but the extent of how far they go isn't his fault at all. As he himself says, seizing the day is about daring and defying but no about being dumb and ignorant. Hence, the final act has something very Shakespearean to it, and not only because the protagonist see a play of the bard's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". Knox Overstreet manages to break free from the Petrarchan lover concept and experience true love, Charlie ""Nuwanda"" Dalton is expelled from school for his haughtiness and Neil Perry's tragic suicide highly resembles the catastrophic demise of Romeo & Juliet who, just like him, consider felo de se as the only way to remain true to themselves and be happy in a twisted and perverse way. The remaining members of the society are the mourners that learn from the devastating events in a radical manner, and the tragedy is perfect. What makes this symbolic ending so even more shattering is that the people pin it all on John Keating and his methods, and that is the peak of the social criticism. Instead of asking themselves what they might have done wrong (and trust me, Neil's father is the true culprit here), they scapegoat the man that inspired the kids to be greater than ordinary. The scene when they all stand upon their desks and shout ""Oh captain, my captain!"" shows that they, after all that has happened, understood what it really is what we stay alive for, and I cry every single time I see this scene. In the end, this film is a true masterpiece and a love letter to the entire experience we call life, tragedies and moments of joy all the same, and never fails to shake me in my very foundations, but in a positive way. It is inspiring, encouraging, bittersweet and beautiful, instructive and intelligent, and in general a touching film that made me who I am today. Words and ideas can change the world, even if others tell you it isn't so. I understood that. So, I ask you one last thing: What will your verse be?",

One the students had a father who did not have a clue about understanding his son's emotional needs causes the kid to commit suicide. Not taking responsibility for his own actions, the father incites the school head master to get rid of the professor. That was the sad part to me because in other boarding school movies such as: Circle of Friends, Scent of a Woman (at least partially a boarding school movie) the good wins, while in the Dead Poets the teacher gets fired. I did not like that unfair side of it. The kids do make a statement against the firing but primarily the bad guys win, at least that is my perception.

The character who so masterfully represents Robin Williams, offers us the guidelines and the keys to a full development and a vision of life, where there always reigns optimism, joy, good humor and honorability. Take advantage of the moment, do not get tired of repeating the teacher protagonist and that is what we should do at all times, stay with the good and discard the bad, not give up, fight for the ideals and at the end of everything, when the days are we can exhaust ourselves, be able to look back and think calmly, that truly, our passage through this world left some trace, since we took the opportunity to live.

The great American poet Wallace Stevens (who thankfully does not join the list of other great poets bastardised by this movie) wrote many aphorisms in his journals which were published posthumously; in one of those aphorisms he poignantly claimed that ""sentimentality is the failure of feeling."" Dead Poet's Society is cloyingly sentimental. I wince at so many moments: references made to poems that the writers evidently had no deep connection with, scenes contrived for the sole purpose of providing Robin Williams with a stage for his stand-up comedy jokes and impressions, and a suicide motivated by formulaic and totally un-compelling issues.

I later served in the real military -- remember, this is when there was still a Draft. Military school was nothing like the ""real thing"". While I found this film to be too slow-paced at times, it is still well worth watching. Some of the most chilling performances are by the the ""bad guys"", specifically those portrayed by Norman Lloyd and Kurtwood Smith.

Now the chief issue with Dead Poets Society is that the message of the film seems to be non conformism, thinking for yourself and being an individual the final 3rd seems to tell us that going down that route is a road that will deliver nothing but failure and rejection.
Our hero Robin Williams is fired, one of the boys commits suicide and the fraternal club of non conformists known as The Dead Poets Society are crushed and disbanded by the school hierarchy because they dare to non conform.
Sure there's that happy clappy final scene tacked on at the end but just a little thought would suggest that the boys who escaped expulsion earlier by becoming rats would almost certainly have been expelled for what they did in that final scene.

My guess is the later, as he is an artist himself (Cinematic art). The film stays buoyant from the starting to the end, typical of a high school setting and all characters feel natural. The teacher who inspires everyone seems to breathe life into all his fans (students) and increasingly dwells in our hearts as a hero who lets us ""live"" in this ever-competitive, heartless, unequal world.",

The story is one of the best stories that appeared on the silver screen. Robin Williams did a fantastic performance as Mr. Keating, a teacher at a boarding school who gives inspiration to his classmates to have a mind of their own and to love poetry and other forms of creativity. The kids in his class think he's more than a teacher, and as the movie goes on it shows how the kids need his help with their own problems, and how Keating has a problem of his own that is a major tragedy to the kids. The kids also discover that he was part of a group called the Dead Poets Society where they sneaked out of the High School Boarding School and go to a cave where they read poetry to each other and let it drip from their tongues, like honey. The kids decide to start the group up again themselves, so they go out to the cave, where they read poetry. That's when one of the kids does a very stupid thing which gives away their secret to the school. Not only does this effect their lives, but Mr. Keating's as well. Don't think that this movie is all inspiration. It has many tragedies involving the kids' personal problems. The whole movie fits so well together with all the different stories in it, I have to respect director Peter Weir A LOT! Although Robin Williams does a fantastic performance, Ethan Hawke's character, Todd, was my favorite in this masterpiece.

His unorthodox teaching methods, designed to make his pupils more aware of the topics and to encourage them to open up to each other more, are viewed with apprehension and derision by his work colleagues but begin to leave an impression on each of his pupils.

Ironically, our lives are somewhat similar. There are teachers who will give us the knowledge about the stuff explained on the text books, but a few will dare to show us the real lessons of life. Thus, dead poets society acts as a mirror to our consumerist society. The liberation should be started from schools, and they should provide sane citizens instead of ATM machines.

374,21 February 2023,steinfeldhenning,9, Discovering Yourself and Living Life to the Fullest: A Review of 'Dead Poets Society',"""Dead Poets Society"" is a drama film from 1989 and was directed by Peter Weir. Its main characters are played by Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Josh Charles. The movie tells the story of an unusual English teacher, John Keating, who teaches his students to think for themselves. The movie is visually pleasing, and the actors deliver great portrayals of their characters. The characters in ""Dead Poets Society"" have great character development and are all different to each other, each character has their own unique personalities and problems to overcome. Robin Williams plays his character, John Keating, very good. He teaches, like mentioned above, his students to think for themselves and to do what fulfils them. Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Josh Charles perform great as Keating's students. All of them have issues they have to deal with and have a lot of pressure on them. The supporting cast is also great, adding depth and more emotion to the film. What makes ""Dead Poets Society"" truly great is its message of embracing individuality and taking risks to fulfil yourself. Its catchphrase ""carpe diem"" translates roughly to ""seize the day"". It means you should take risks to fulfil yourself, before it is too late. The film shows how important education is, because it is able to change a person completely, and the importance of seizing them when given opportunities. You can tell that that is a good message, since most people, us included, think that ""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary."", said by John Keating is the best quote from the movie. If you love great storytelling, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a must-see film that will leave a lasting impact.",

Encouraging his pupils to ""seize the day"", he stirs them to look beyond the confinements of whom they are told they should be, to that which they could and truly wish to become. Thriving under Keating's tutelage are Neil Perry (exceptionally well portrayed by Leonard), who discovers a passion for acting, and, as my friend Laura puts it, ""the painfully shy"", Todd Hamilton (Ethan Hawke could not have been better as the agonizing Todd).

One overcomes shyness (well, sort of); one succumbs to parental pressure (in an eerie, overwrought, somewhat awkward scene); one gets his girl; one gets TWO girls; all participate in nocturnal cave meetings whose purpose I can't easily seem to relate to that of a poets' society (the dead ones would certainly turn in their graves methinks). Overall the story seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, and the final effect is one of dramatic indigestion. A better recommendation (and yet more Robin Williams) would be Good Will Hunting (1997).

It's hard to say what it is that makes it such a good film - most people focus on Robin William's performance as the main ingredient. I have to disagree. There are many aspects of this film that make it worth seeing and all play their part just enough and without blatancy. If any performance had to be singled out for praise I would put Robert Sean Leonard's portrayal of Neil at the front. Neil is clearly the focus for the audience and the one boy in the class who is affected most by their new teacher. He carries the viewer through the events of the film and becomes the reason for its climax. I suppose Williams was the only known actor in the movie at time of its release and so his performance is highlighted.

417,8 January 2014,LSTHNSTMAN,10, Dr. Laura Schlesenger was motivated to write a book because of this film,"Yes, imagine that! A former well known radio hostess, wrote a self help book because she was so impressed/disturbed by the action or should I say lack of action by a minor (perhaps as the story plays out) major player in the story. Please note; Dr. Laura's book does not critique the film per se, but nonetheless as the author herself states it was the motivating factor and driving force for her authorship of the aforementioned tome. Now to my observations of the film itself. I truly enjoyed the film, I also note that the character of Mr. Keating is that of an idealist as well as that of a cock-eyed optimist in an overly realist and conservative academic setting. He wants the boys to grow up as men and not as robots programmed by their wealthy parents as well as the aura and tradition of the school during this chronological time. Of course he is betrayed by some of his students (in particular Cameron a weasel and rat if ever there was one) as well as the School Administration and parents of the DPS club members. The School wants a ""scapegoat"" to survive ( ah the power of $$$$$$$ again) the parents wants a ""scapegoat"" (to hide the type of ""people"" they truly are even though they would denounce publicly such ""people"") The villain in the movie is Neil Perry's dad who is trying to live his life vicariously through both his son's lives. He sounds more Jewish than Waspy in the ""my son the Dr. attitude"". Truth be told I cannot watch anything portrayed by the actor who plays the father as it has poisoned my feelings based on watching this movie. While it may be wrong I am a victim of my feelings in this case. Neil Perry's mom is also to blame as she knows her son's POV is correct, but she is loathe to confront her husband tyrant dare I call him a Jack Boot Gestapo type ""I am the law"" father. Well they both paid as did Neil the ultimate price for their actions. The mother sits there even shares her bed with the ""old man"" and never attempts to stop the emotional bleeding of her son. Boy do I know how that feels. I had a mom just like that and her lack of direct action vs. my ""father"" has forever scarred my life Dr. Laura you hit this point right on the head. Of course after he sees his dead son on the floor he laments, ""my poor son, my poor son."" Hey you dumb SOB you are the cause of your son's actions but of course the old man would never admit to that. Boy does that attitude mirror my dad the fool. The other disturbing scene is when the headmaster attempts to gain knowledge about the DPS with the corporal punishment of one its members. The Headmaster is an old ""dog"" of a man who sadistically relishes the abusive punishment he is inflicting on the youngster, and as he can not ""break him"" he (the Headmaster) is so frustrated and infuriated that he beats him similar to Captain Blye with greater gusto and zeal. I know this is 1959 but it would have been great to see the student (Mr. Dalton) turn around to the ""old fart"" and kick the living daylights out of him saying"" no one assaults me you old fool"" I think a remake of the film fast forwarding 50 years with Todd reminiscing about his time at Welton would be well received. Finally, rent/buy or somehow get your mits on the flick, especially if you are an educator!!!!! Finally, the student (Mr. Hopkins) who perhaps is the most cynical member of the class pays tribute to Keating in the last scene by joining his classmates and stands on his desk too. A cynic with guts, my kind of Mensch!!!!",

It was so good but really sad at some parts but all the cast was amazing all of them knew how to play there parts very well. It was sad when Neil killed himself.,
420,17 June 2016,garth-mailman,10, Private School Heaven or Hell,If I'd taken note of it at the time I'd forgotten this was a Disney Joint. Along with School Ties three years later it proved to be a masterclass in acting for an entire classroom of 18-year-olds. Interesting to view this movie in light of more recent events in Robin Williams' life. Would Mr. Keating have chosen to end his own life? What the movie makes clear is the fact that most schooling is a plot to train students for a 9-5 assembly line. Creativity and independent thought are to be discouraged or spanked out of kids though canings and paddlings as such are looked down on today. Private schools are seen as an opportunity to meet up with and make associations with the right kind of people from the right backgrounds to become the corporate movers and shakers their parents expect them to become. Any attempt to deviate from this path is strongly discouraged. The miss-guided control parents attempt to exercise over their children's lives is shown to tragic degree in this movie. My dislike of Kurtwood Smith probably stems from watching this film.,

422,30 April 2018,kaustavmajumdar,8, You must live before you die. You must be an individual above that will bring you down.,"Dead Poets Society is absolute success in the portrayal of the truth of the individual, their individuality and the society that was formed on the back of it. The Western and every other First World Country is based in that idealism and through that achievement, pioneers and true champions have been born again and again.
The thing about DPS that I do appreciate is also want deeply haunts me that despite it's idealism, very rarely does anything slip by the realists - very much like reality. That truth is so debilitating messed up that it is almost akin to the realization that according to the stats and surveys produced, no matter what you have chosen to believe, most of us would have ended up as the accomplice to the oppression in the Holocaust than be the Hero whose list would be topic of an Oscar winning Biopic. I don't care that you think I may have overstretched my analogy because it is very much the truth in both counts. But getting back to the story, the realism wins out in those moments when Robert Sean Leonard's character chooses quicker incumbency of the inevitable grasp of death than rather face the futility and frustration of living his parents' dreams. This is also a recurrence when Robin William's (RIP, you brilliant and magnificent legend; I have no idea what you thought in the last moments of your days but if I could, I would tell you that every breath that you ever took was completely worth it and you left the world a better world than when you came into it and it was no so because it was inevitable but because you chose to make it better for those whose lives were touched by yours. So, thank you in addendum to anybody who ever made your life better and brought a smile to you) Keating is fired and students are left helpless to do anything about it till the last when they defy their necessary conformity to the school. But even then, the movie ends out an melancholic breezy high which could only be managed by the ambiguity of shot being cut then and there with a final display of approval. That is what is impressive about this movie that there is a definite parallel established in the story because of the world that exists and the world that should exist. It is beautiful in an haunting re-imposition of reality and its dread that we must fight everyday. 
It will also be close to my heart because of:
1) How close I feel to Neil Perry (RSL) because I could identify with the frustration he fought and lost. It makes me want to face the rough hands I have had in my life a little bit harder. I want to live and be happy in the way of Keating, but should I fail and can't get back up, let this be my self-implicated obituary - I have loved living. I have had good times and I have cherished each one of those, so much so that you could say I sucked the 'marrow out of those bones' whenever and however I could. Unfortunately, I must have more bad shit happen that I couldn't fight or became too cowardly against. I would like to apologize for that, I didn't mean to hurt anybody anymore. Perhaps, most of all, myself was the top of the list. I may have hated quite a few people because my Idealism and weaknesses and loved a lot more because of how much love I felt I had to give and also, of my perpetual, ever-lingering loneliness. I don't know if I feel those anymore, I don't if I want or want to give forgiveness and lastly, if there is even a beyond. I sincerely hope not, one life is all we have and it should all we get; peace and unknowing in the everlasting is all that I seek anymore if I have chosen this path. Take care, be well and value life while you have it and can still make good on its promises, honestly. Only a dead man can tell you the truth of that.
2) It contradicts on almost every story in Indian Film Industry that has been made on this topic (it might be slightly poetic that I am obsessed that I am so obsessed with pain, living in The City of Joy; Then again, Pain is a binary of Joy - Each the more building itself where the other chooses frequent). Indian movies are more emotional, more optimistic and dramatic in their flair that people will actually make the choices that Perry couldn't and people like the Perry parents and the Headmaster will actually take a chance on him and forgive him. This movie shows another very possible side of that scenario and I can appreciate that. Overall, I still do prefer movies with hopeful portrayals because if there is one thing we need some more almost everyday, it is hope. The hope that the unlikely, harder choice which may lead to a positive outcome after toil should still be fought for no matter how hard it is; which, I honestly know, easier said than done but I really wanted Perry to fight one more day even if it was and not have gone quietly into night - Rage, Rage against the dying light (I am paraphrasing Dylan Thomas's poem about this subject which was dedicated to his father).

I think that's the best film of 1989, over another masterpiece ""Driving Miss Daisy"", but i prefer this. It had a lot of sensitive moments and it makes you think. Robin Williams gives his best performance, doing the role of a poetry teacher (John Keating), that shows poetry with a fabulous point of view. Also the film has the first performance of Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and more people. The Screenplay is absolutely wonderful and the soundtrack relaxing and beautiful. The recreation of the college is so credible. Peter Weir one of the best directors of the moment, in my own opinion. He makes good films, originals, amazing... The sensitive in this film has a very important role, it makes you cry, because is a magical story about a group of friends and the relations with another the people, the poetry, the love...

443,1 June 2021,camillaelmstrom,10, Carpe diem!,"I absolutely adored this movie. Not just because I'm an english nerd, but also because of the importance of the films messages. For one, the movie criticises conformity, especially when it comes to school, which is such an important message. So many people are encompassed by societal pressure and thoughts of 'sticking to the norm', however this movie points out the flaws of the conformity that has consumed the creativity and thoughts of those affected by it, through enforcing a specific method of teaching or making sure that they follow 'societal rules' regarding future work. This is primarily highlighted in the life of Neil Perry, an outgoing star student burdened by the pressure of following expectations from his father. However, unorthodox teacher John Keating (played by Robin Williams) teaches Neil along with the rest of the students that conformity is not the only option. Neil, along with the whole class are immensely affected by the teachings of Keating in a good way as Keating allows the students see a different perspective on literature and poetry. Neil's roommate, Todd Anderson is a good example of the Keating's unorthodox teaching. Todd is a very shy character in the beginning of the film, but with the help of Keating and Neil, Todd learns to open up and express his feelings and thoughts through poetry, showing an immense amount of character development, especially following the tragic ending of the film. This movie is such an inspirational movie followed by such an important message. The energy and life that the film depicts in the boys is amazing and makes you feel inspired to defy the norms and follow your dreams!",

That was the best mistake of my life.  I went through a box and a half of kleenex from Neil's suicide on.

The script is dripping with insightful dialog and dramatic nuance, and director Peter Weir drew out distinctly emotional performances from his entire cast, particularly Robin Williams, who has never given a finer performance. That's all easy to observe. What's less apparent but definitely there is the importance of this film with respect to our daily lives. This picture does not exist solely for the purpose to entertain (which it does manage to do fantastically), but also to stress the influence of both conformity and individuality on one's life.",

He teaches that this is the formula for a well-enjoyed life: you gotta seize the day - CARPE DIEM. And this message is the most important thing you can ever acquire. I think that when you understand and practice CARPE DIEM, you find the real meaning of life. And this is a wonderful movie to open your eyes.

He known what 'captain 'was talking about, his heart was full of passion to life, to art, to freedom. But how can a little bird against the stubborn system?
I commented this movie was a tragedy not only Neil, but other's fates. I really loved the character Todd, who was much like most of us, not much colorful. When I heard of his poem about truth, I paused it, and read loudly it. I had to admit it was such a pottery one that I was shocked at that time. but who had inspired him might never appear in his life.
What happened to other students? I remembered at the end of this movie, one of them said: they just wanted a victim, why let Keating ruin our life?' yes, after all these happinesses, life would always back to peaceful desperation.

But now, after being a teacher for many years and studying postgraduate education courses, I think the film is more about opposing education theories confrontation with less positive communication. Mr. Keating's idea about ""learn to think for yourself"" is a valuable limited resource in many classrooms. But it became the only learning content, deviating from society and reality, it is also problematic. In the film, Mr. Keating asked the students to tear up all the poems related to realism, which is avoiding further discussion between reality and human nature. If these conflicts of ideas cannot be considered in the curriculum to develop more profound and complex understandings, then these conflicts will be reflected in the real lives of students and teachers.

507,26 September 2019,omarabdelalim,9," Oh Captain, my Captain Indeed!!!","Whether its a teacher or a parent, gaps in communications with those who are supposed to teach and mentor us, can render the whole learning process meaningless. so having a teacher knowing exactly the hardships students of Welton Academy go through, who tries to bridge this gap can really affect these students' way of thinking.
Dr. Keating -portrayed by the brilliant Robin Williams- decided to discard the creativity-depriving teaching methods used in literature that are aiming at making it into a science that can be translated to rules and equations, and to plant a seed of individuality and opinion based thoughts in the minds of his students, and to teach them to seize the day and give their lives meaning or 'Carpe Diem'.
I loved watching the enthusiastic teacher interact with his students, where every lesson was one that you learn from experiencing life with everything it has to offer, and every lesson can change the way you live your life. But they weren't just words these lessons,every single one of them was given with the utmost care and delivered in a creative manner.
I also loved how the students started living their lives after that, how realizing their own mortality gave more value to the time they had on earth, a thought that should never leave any of our heads, displayed by these young boys in a very daring and entertaining manner.
Of course this display of character growth was allowed due to the amazing performances of Robert Sean, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles and Gale Hansen. All of which of course pale in comparison to Robin Williams' inspiring performance that can inspire even the viewers of the movie let alone the students.
And of course many of the scenes of the movie are heart-warming from the teacher providing guidance to his students, to students seizing the day, to a memorable movie ending. I was surprised by the dark and realistic turn of events that happened but it gave the movie and the ideals it inspires a link to the real world.
the soundtrack however is barely noticeable with the exception of a few scenes like the ending, and the fact that the death of Neil was due to his own lack of will to communicate with his father, of course the harshness of his father was a major cause but at that night that was his chance to finally communicate with his father but he didn't, so at least he died after finishing his master piece to immortalize something that he loved into this world.

That was a stupid way to end the movie. But other than that, the movie is deep and moving and it's hilarious at times and really upsetting at others. For an older film, it looks a lot better than most at its time. It doesn't have that old feeling to it and the acting is wonderful, other than a couple of lines.

So instead I'm going to briefly touch on the impact this film had on me as an individual.  Carpe Diem (sieze the day).

It made me realize that there are more important things in life than just following ""tradition"" and doing what is expected of you.  It showed me that I must follow my own path in life, with what makes me truly happy, rather than conform with what is expected of me.  Also, I don't think I have ever been so touched by a single scene in a movie like I was with the final scene in this movie.  When you could see the guilt in the eyes of the Ethan Hawke character, knowing that he was partially responsible for Mr. Keating's dismissal.  You could tell he just wanted to tell Mr Keating how much he meant to all of his friends and him.  And you could also see the forgivness in the eyes of Robin Williams, knowing that the boys were not to blame, but rather the ""establishment"".  And when Mr. Keating was just about to leave the classroom for the last time, and Ethan Hawke jumped up on his desk and addressed Mr Keating ""Captain, My Captain!""... I literally wept out loud.  I have never cried during a movie like I did with this one.  I literally bawled that entire scene (when the students stood up on their desks), and didn't stop until half-way through the final credits.

However, if you wish to see a film that shows us to never underestimate ourselves and to always strive for the best, this is the film for you. Robin Williams delivers one his best dramatic performances in a film where he teaches his students that nothing is impossible if they ""Carpe Diam."" If you wish to view an intellectual film that inspires you to achieve, then do yourself a favor and go see this film.",
528,13 September 2017,yaquidrl,10, Great Movie,"There is a lot to like about the movie. Cinematography, characterizations, actors, etc. I really liked how it leaves you feeling for Keating's character at the end, while also in many ways arguing against his actions. The Latin teacher and principal are respectful and cordial. Their positions are more level headed. After all, Keating's student kills himself, when he could have waited a year and become an actor. He would have been an ""adult"" in no time. He couldn't wait. I have to be an actor now or die. I can understand feeling that way if your parents are telling you you can't be who you want to be. But suicide? The other students are reckless too. They're young. They're not as capable of thinking long term. They're doing stuff that's risking expulsion... stupid stuff, that could negatively impact the rest of their lives. They don't have as much experience. Anyway, that's why i liked the movie. Did really well developing that central question of how much freedom and responsibility 17 years can handle. How much critical reasoning can they do and should it be encouraged? Hard to say, I think.",
529,13 February 2003,Lady_Gwen,10, Seize the Day!,"Dead Poet's is one of my favorite movies..okay, my most favorite.  I was first introduced to it as a freshman in high school when my drama teacher made us watch it.  This same teacher was forced to retire because of conflicts with the administration.  So, the story of Neil, Todd and the rest of the Society became very close to our own.  We also were big drama people, so the Midsummer Night's Dream scene was pretty cool, too.  My favorite character was poor Knox, who is in love with the wrong girl.  His antics, and those of Nuwanda, are the funniest in the movie.  And I've seen this movie at least a couple dozen times and I still cry when Neil commits suicide and when Mr. Keating is ushered out of Wellton with an ovation of ""O Captain, my Captain!"" I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to Seize the Day!",

The writing is great and the acting is equally astounding but the message lies no lower on the scale. To know what a materialistic and judgmental society we live in, this is such an important message to tell. I recommend this highly for any high school student. In one of the essays that I recently wrote I began it like this: ""We are hypocrites in our own nature. We tell our children to be themselves and not to give into peer pressure. We tell them to make a caricature of themselves and emphasize and celebrate what makes them different. All the while, we let society judge who we are and where we stand. We let it compare us to its definition of the ""perfect"" human being and define us. "" I wrote that before I saw the movie and while I was watching, I kept thinking of my last essay. This is the message that this movie is trying to emphasize.",

541,10 November 2018,malcolmfloors,9, Dead Poet Society Review,"This brilliant, award winning, masterpiece teaches you how to think for yourself, which new English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) does for us. The movie is great all the way through and doesn't have any slopes or plot holes. The director (Peter Weir) does a great job at playing with your emotions; at one point you'd be smiling and happy for John Keating's students, and other times the movie will leave you in tears.
Not only does John Keating teach you about looking at poetry from different perspectives, but he also teaches you too look at life in a whole other perspective.
This movie shows how even the rich don't have it easy. Their parents choose their life for them and those parents don't let their children have a say in what they want to do. You can see this with everyone but especially with Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) and his father Mr. Perry (Kurtwood Smith). Neil wants to act, and his father already knows what he wants to Neil to do, and he ruins Neil's life.
If you're looking for an inspirational movie, Dead Poets Society is the one for you.",

It was funny when it had to be and hit hard with the drama. I give this a 9/10 I thought that the role of John Keating was a perfect fit for Robin Willems. Dead Poet's Society was a great movie for young adults teaching them about the imported of reading /writing poems, some of the poets are Walt Whitman, Shakespeare, Robert Herrick and Lord Byron. Ethan Hawke played Todd Anderson amazing, he played a boy who starts shy then slowly becoming an loud good reader. I think they should have told us more about the history of the Dead Poet's Society and what will happen to it, also I thought that Mr. Keating should have stud up for himself at the end. I liked the way he showed the class poems. He taught in a new way and it worked. He should that you don't have to be in a new in a class and with text books all you have to do is open your mind.",

The movie poignantly shows how youthful rebellion is actually the only way that teenagers have of asserting their individuality. Thankfully the young students in this story have an empathic teacher who teaches them not to accept a clichéd world. Some other teacher might have taught them to rebel with violence - which is so easy for misguided youth to learn and do, but not this teacher! The strongest expressions of rebellion he teaches them are tearing up books and standing on the class bench. Beautiful performances by Robin Williams and the bunch of boys - especially the one who commits suicide. A must-see for all teenage students and teachers, and parents who have adolescent children.",

558,14 April 2006,GoddessDweia97,10, The Best Ever,"This has to be one of my favorite movies ever. I think that it is the most classic example of an English Major movie. Robin Williams is phenomenal in this movie. He portrays the quintessential English teacher, quirky and eccentric. His character Mr. Keating, is one of those teachers who everyone loves, he's the teacher that you go to with anything, even if you don't' have him for a class. As an English Major I feel that this movie helps to show the beauty and the wonder that is English literature. The way that it is presented just seems to open the world of literature into mainstream. It invites people to go read Byron, Shelley, and Wordsworth. For me, it makes people want to read the classics, it is one of the things in this world that I think helps me to remember why, when I'm down having to read and dissect obscure literature, I chose to be an English major. It helps you to as Keating says ""think for your self"". Its a movie for everyone despite what I've said, because you take the message and it translates into anything, ""think for your self"". If I had to say anything about that I would say it was the moral of the story. Its helping to show people that they don't' have to be sheep, that they can think with out following the paved road. Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, for me this movie represents everything that I, as an English Major want to help show the world.",

The movie takes place in a strict college prep school in the 1950's, where discipline and academics are brainwashed into every student.  From the stern headmaster to the scapegoating of John Keating (Robin Williams), this movie provided a great conflict.

More importantly the attitude of the boys is right on in Peter Weir's film.  I go to a New England prep school and the way the kids act is dead on, from their pranks to exhibiting their intelligence in other ways such as quoting Whitman as their own stuff to impress some not so smart girls from the town.  ""Dead Poets"" also nails down the fact that prep school kids work their butts off at school, and the amounts of pressure put on some kids is astronomical.

That's my movie, my one, my favorite... and it is not because of the handsome guys our the romance, our even because of the poetry, but because the guys a age near of mine, they have dreams like me, I every time I watch this film I want to do more I need to BE MORE! I start to seyse the day like I never did it before, I start to love like I never love before and to fight for what I really want... I think this movie is perfect: even Neil's suicide, because it shows us that we have to be strong. My favorite guy is Charlie Dalton, the unic and the handsome Nuwanda, because we got the attitude and a great personality! And the end... so perfect... I cry 3 times, and I wanted to cry to much more... maybe 6... I love this film with all the words in my blood. This film is my inspiration of life, and I show it to everyone I love and everybody like the film. It's and old film but with great success in 2006... he deserved to with the Oscar of best movie. He didn't, but in my heart, he did win all the Oscars=)",
590,21 November 2019,bhaskarteja-53617,10, Dead poets Scociety,"Dead Poets Society is a film that is intended to inspire, provoke thought, and bring a combination of humor and drama to the audience while pushing a non-conformist ideology at the core of the story. it tells the story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.
Robin Williams gives one of his most convincing and restrained film performances to date by effectively muting his compulsion to jump from one shtick to another and playing a single character instead of his usual compilation of personalities. While his screen time is actually quite limited, he does a credible job at making the viewer believe that he is the unconventional teacher who motivates the students to actually think for themselves rather than have their knowledge, beliefs, and personal philosophies spoon-fed to them via textbooks and professorial rhetoric. One of Williams' most endearing personality traits, overwhelming compassion, is found in this character beneath the anarchistic persona that is Robin Williams the entertainer.
The Dead Poets Society is an exquisite episode with a wonderful cast and an attractive and persuasive story from beginning to end. The movie was run by Robin Williams who was nominated for Oscar. The Dead Poets Association is one of the rare movies that tell the story with a wonderful script. This is the most exciting movie by director Peter Weil, which uses a simple element to tell an unforgettable story. The direction of the weir is incredible, and he communicates something truly unique here.
Like most movies, after all, we did not see many dead poets. We announced that various discs of the Dead Poets Society have a glimpse of the material, never finished the final editing of the movie. In other scenes, it is difficult to decide to delete it with Weir. For example, when discovering Neil 's body, the first plan was to block suicide accumulation and outcomes through a happy and instant meeting of the Death Poets' Association.",
591,20 June 2006,esvloring,8, Entertaining but Flawed,"First the flaws: 1) The Headmaster is too broad a character. When he mounts the podium at the beginning of the school year, the stern and set expression on his face sets him off as a hidebound traditionalist and curmudgeon. He is the obvious villain here. No free spirit - like Mr. Keating - will last long under him. 2) We viewers are not prepared for Neil's suicide. Through most of the movie he comes across as a well-adjusted seventeen year old. He gets along well with the other boys. He is a natural leader. His penchant for acting appears to stem from serendipity, young male exuberance, and fun. Despite his martinet of a father he does not lie in bed long hours brooding, nor does he ever come across as depressed or manic. So when his father threatens to withdraw him from Welton after his successful debut in a Midsummer Night's Dream, he might argue with his father or turn sullen, but it strains credulity that he would go to directly to suicide. Now the qualities: 3) The production values are excellent. The location is idyllic - New Castle, Delaware is as elegant in reality as it looks in the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, at times lyrical. And the period details are right - like the boys smoking whenever grownups are out of the room - without being forced. 4) I particularly appreciated the acting of Neil's father. He has probably grown up under humble circumstances, and through enormous self-discipline, long hours and weekends of hard work, and seizing the rare opportunities that have come his way, has achieved modest financial success and comfort. At least once he tells Neil how much he has sacrificed for Neil's education at Welton. Neil's a good kid; he's getting straight A's. Like so many fathers in real life this father can't understand his adolescent son. His threat to withdraw Neil from Welton and send him to military school is so extreme it borders on the implausible. I fault the script, not the acting.",

594,30 September 2006,sunhollow,10, One of my all time favorite movies,"My sixteen year old daughter and I just finished watching Dead Poets Society (me for the thousandth time), and I've also read some of the comments left. For me, this movie was not about poetry or life in private schools, it is a lesson on standing up (sometimes on a desk) in the face of conformity. From the moment we enter school, we are are taught to sit in a row, be quiet, do not ask questions, do not interrupt the class and on and on. This proves wonderful training for when the young minds leave formal education behind and enter the work world, where you are encouraged to sit quietly, not ask questions and do not interrupt. To have the opportunity to learn from someone who believes that education is more than rot memory and regurgitating facts is indeed spectacular, potentially life-altering and unfortunately rare. What I hold so dear about this movie, is that Keating does this; he teaches the value of individual thought, life, and beauty, and his students in return show their understanding, love and respect in the desk scene in the end.",

597,8 November 2020,khankhitab,8, Dead poet society Movie's review by Khitab Wazir,"Dead poet society movie depicts the gruesome face of society and the traditional poor system of academic institutions. These two things play a major role in ruining the life of a creative student. Their creative ability cannot thrive in the presence of these two factors. It has shown in the movie how lots of fathers decide the fate of his son and then how dreadful consequences it might bring. They do not let their sons to decide their own choice. And most importantly how art is considered an absurdity been also shown. The character named ""Neil Perry"" wants to become an actor but his father does not like it, because art has no value for him. Despite of the reluctance he comes onto the stage and performs the play, in the meantime his father comes and eliminates his son from this school. Neil Perry then commits suicide and embraces death.
To be more precise dead poet society movie interprets some bad factors of a society by which a creative boy or girl's life gets ruined. These factors are
1poor school system
2authoritative/Dictator type guardian
3devaluation of art
4restrictions to think openly.",
598,21 May 2022,pqgkhzs,10, I'd Seize the Day with the Dead Poets,"Super inspiring movie with great characters and easy to hate antagonists. As a younger inspired youth I really feel for this movie, and the time you must give to you dreams and passions even if people aren't supportive. This films lightly follows what it can be like to be trapped by the horrible, and for some unbearable control freak parents. Watch these boarding school brothers fight adversity, find their passion for all art, and the urge to seek names etched in history.",

600,1 December 2006,lucaxy,9," Captain, my captain","A good movie moves people and makes them want to watch it twice. Though the translation isn't perfect so that I didn't understand it fully, but which didn't prevent me from flooding inside. 　　 　　For the teacher, John Keating 　　A teacher, who asked his students to rip the preface of the book, who taught every lesson in a unique way, named Keating. You may discover his ambition as well as his misgivings at his first appearing in the opening ceremony of a new term. And I found him a great teacher who made students realize "" Carpe Diem "" which means "" to seize the day "" in his first lesson, who asked his boys to stand on the desk "" to view the world in an new way "", who inspired Todd Anderson whose huge inner talent broke out then, who guided Neal to negotiate with his father and comforted him and assured him not being trapped, who cried badly while discovering the poetry anthology, five centuries of verse, which he had read before and wrote inspiring words on, in Neal's desk, who left at last with his thanks and smile, who is respectable. You may consider Keating had ended with a failure, for his students died or dispelled, for the Dead Society Society broke up and the school turned back to its original tradition at last. But you can't ignore the significant influence he made on his students, on Todd, on Neal, on each member in the Society (though he didn't encourage his students to found it at all), on everyone including us, the spectators. You also can't deny what the boys behaved in the last scene is exactly Keating's triumph. 　　 　　For Neil Perry 　　The excellent guy who owns a virtue of optimism, kind-heart, responsibility, persistence, passion and leadership. And he is also the new founder of Dead Poets Society, an age later. With Neal's encouragement and organization, the Society made its sense. A friend told me that he realized someone would die in the first scene, the picture of former members of the Society, together with the heavy melody in the movie. However, I didn't sense it until Neal took on the coronal and off, in the moon light, naked. Anyway, it's beyond my expectation that he had chosen death as the way to fight against his father's arrangement, order and reproach. Are dreams so gentle in front of the facts? While, just as most poets did, he didn't find a hope in the very verge of despair. 　　How could fate so cruel to such a good boy? I was perplexed, though I didn't burst into tears, a tough stir meant more, and the anguish must be much easier than Todd and Keating. 　　 　　For Todd Anderson 　　Neal's roommate, the boy who is a definitely good student, with all the merits called for in the traditional and principled high school, who turned downed down to go to the carve at first, who wrote and revised his own poem again and again by himself, whose face turned red and anxious in the class while Keating asking students to read their own poems on the platform. And he refused the offer as usual. Nevertheless, he's talent was discovered by Mr. Keating, his captain. He shouted ""his teeth is sweating"" by the inspiration of Keating, and his marvelous inner talent shook everyone, ""Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold. You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. Kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying, to the movement we leave dying, it'll just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream"", weren't you? And his significant change proved Keating's success fully. He dare expressed his redemption and regret and miser and thanks in such a courageous way, such an extra ordinate way and such a proper way, to stand on the desk, just as what Keating taught them, and to call ""Captain, my captain"", the greatest name we can call a teacher. 　　 　　To some extent, he is the one with whom I shared most common points, especially at the same age, 3 or 4 years ago, sensitive, introverted, dares not to express his inner heart, self-abased, scholastic. But the difference lies in that he's inspired by Mr. Keating; he's helped by his roommate, Neal. But, who's my Mr. Keating, who's my Neal? And, where are my passions, my dreams now? Have they all gone? I fell so cold, but I decide to find them out. ",

602,7 March 2007,RickHappy,10," Be poets! a.k.a. Thank You, Mr. Keating!","Again, excuse me for my English... For me, this film isn't just life-changing - it's life itself. Cause you see - there are those who write the long and complex novels, and those who burn themselves in poetry. What I mean is POETRY IS LIFE. And to be a poet means being alive, being free, being able to see the wonders of the world - and I'll quote Mr. Keating - beauty, romance, love. And even if I choke on the bone, I'll always be a dead poet, I'll let them think I'm dead. Cause they can't see life. And life isn't a writing set. So stop wasting your time, go out, find love and most of all BE POETS! Dare to dream - I'll give that to Paris. Hear your own barbaric YAWPs, step up the desks of ignorance and enjoy yourselves. Don't thank me, John Keating - I want to thank you!",

He's retired now but every time I see the movie it reminds me of him.

Some of the best performances of the movie are Robin Williams role as John Keating and Ethan Hawke's role as Todd Anderson. Director Peter Weir fabulously directs this film, and it's his best movie in my opinion. The movie also has a very powerful message, (which I will not go into in this review because it will take too long). The movie also has many great quotes like, ""Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinarily."" I also really love the setting of the movie, like the landscape and how it goes throughout different seasons over the length of the film. The ending of the film is also extraordinary, in my opinion it's the greatest film ending. The movie is also well paced and doesn't feel like it drags at any point. All in all this is a masterpiece and if you haven't seen it, you need to watch it.",
