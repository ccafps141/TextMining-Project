0,7 November 1999,zetes,10, one of the best films i've ever had the chance to see,"Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke! America: SEE IT!",/
1,15 April 2003,TanjBennett,10, Allegory on the balance between humans and nature,"This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.",r
2,4 August 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Absolutely breathtaking!,"Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time, and is up there with Studio Ghibli's best along with Spirited Away. I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",e
3,20 March 2005,JTurner82,10," Breathtaking. Watch with ""eyes unclouded.""","In its theatrical Japanese release of 1997, PRINCESS MONONOKE was the hugest box office grossing movie of all time in the land of the Rising Sun until it was overtaken by James Cameron's TITANIC, and, four years later, director Hayao Miyazaki's own SPIRITED AWAY. No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real ""hero"" or ""villain"") trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.",v
4,14 August 2004,misty6767,10, Very touching movie!,"The first time I saw Princess Mononoke I was completely moved and surprised. Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn't a ""they all lived naively ever after"" film. There were no complete ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki's films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka's romance and Moro's views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.",i
5,7 January 2006,morphion2,10, Enthralling and Artistic,"Studio Ghibli has been Japan's leading anime Production Company since the 1980's, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic ""Princess Mononoke"".",e
6,22 October 2020,Xstal,9, Palm Oil Forest Demons...,"... and arable desert dust bowl aliens. It seems our intent to unbalance, upset, bias, distort and thoroughly irritate Mother Nature knows no bounds. I'm curious of the curses and phantasms this great animator would conjure against Homo Ignorantia in todays world, spectral beasts perhaps, to unite alongside the current pandemic sent to warn us off the path we're so resolutely set on taking.",w
7,1 February 2000,alvaradj,10, A true work of art that takes animation to an entirely new level,"I saw Mononoke Hime on its USA release back in late December 1999 under its U.S. title Princess Mononoke.  I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie.  The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well.  It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today.  Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.  This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.  Even my wife who holds a strong prejudice against Japanese animation enjoyed this movie.",/
8,12 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,10, A masterpiece,"Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by animation, I watched way too many cartoons and would often drawn them myself. I never thought of animation as ""real art"" or anything fancy, just one of life's simple pleasures. Sure Disney had made some ground-breaking animated features, and technology was allowing for more and more detailed and intricate animation techniques, but no animated film had ever moved me as much as a Godfather or Unforgiven or Dr. Strangelove, that is until one fine day in 1999. I was in high school, and Princess Mononoke was premiering at the Coolidge Theater in Brookline, I was pumped as I really enjoyed Castle in the Sky and Totoro, so I went to the theater with a few friends and was absolutely clown away for this. This film is so spectacular in almost every way and every piece comes together perfectly. The animation is top-notch, not that shoddy 1980's anime style, but the mind-blowing animation techniques that made Miyazaki the maestro his is today. The score by Joe Hisaishi is tremendous, though at times it may seem a bit overly dramatic (I mean this is an animated feature, not Lawrence of Arabia), but this is the ultimate animated epic, so it fits in well. The plot is dense and the characters are well-developed, there are no true ""good"" or ""bad"" guys in this film...and Miyazaki includes his favorite underlying theme of Man vs. Nature throughout. Some may argue that Spirited Away was Miyazaki's crowning achievement, but I believe that Mononoke Hime is his true Masterpiece.",r
9,4 April 2019,baumhenrik,10, One of the best in history,"When I first saw 'Princess Mononoke' on Christmas eve back in 2006 I was 10 years old and couldn't really follow the story since I was quite disturbed from the explicit graphic content. Especially the giant pig suffering of a demonic disease scared the hell out of me back than. But never less is knew that this movie is something special, something I have never seen before. Since then I became a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and watched nearly everything they have produced. But still 'Princess Mononoke' stands out to me as their best work and to me is Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece. The topic of this movie is just as simple as complex. It's the fight between human culture coming with the technologic industry versus the nature and its variety of animals living in it and to this day it's a pretty relevant topic. The way both sides are portraied in this movie is just beautiful. Miyazaki manages to show both sides with all their strength and weaknesses. There's no good side or bad side. Instead every side can be understood by the viewer and even if you don't agree with their opinions you still are able to see why each side acts like they do. The visual work is top notch like always with Studio Ghibli. I love how they create a feeling for nature as one whole organism. I really recommend everyone to go watch this movie. To me this is one of the best movies ever created.",w

11,3 July 2012,Boba_Fett1138,9, A beautiful blend of an adventure and fairytale.,"You really don't have to be into anime to appreciate some of the movies that the genre has to offer. Some of them are being simply so good and captivating that basically everybody should be able to get grabbed by it. And I feel that this is one of those movies, that is being a great blend of adventure and fairytale elements.",5
12,22 July 2018,Gresh854,9, Studio Ghibli Fest 2018,"I'm so thrilled that I decided to watch Princess Mononoke for the first time ever on the big screen. Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today. (Verdict: A)",1

14,27 February 2021,auuwws,7, princess mononoke,"Not the best studio Ghibli films, but it is a wonderful film. I enjoyed watching the film very much, but the duration of the film was a great negative. The film was sometimes very fast in showing some events and very slow in showing other events. This matter made me feel a little bored, the story of the film was talking about the relationship of man to nature This is an excellent thing, especially since the film is directed to children. This was shown to them. It was an excellent choice by the Ghibli studio. I could not love any character in the film despite my understanding of their goals until I could not get attached to them, the drawing of natural scenes in this film was impressive, I enjoyed very much Watching the movie and I recommend watching it",5
15,11 June 2006,Quinoa1984,10, mind-shattering anime; my favorite of Miyazaki's films,"Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. ",0
16,11 January 1999,seamas,10, Stunning and sharp (in any language),"I saw this film in Japan, in Japanese with no sub-titles, I don't speak a word of the language and I was still enthralled!  It is Miyazaki most visually intense (surpassing, at long last, Nausicaa) and is alive with color and movement the like not yet seen in anime.",1
17,28 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,10, Princess Mononoke is Miyazaki's masterpiece.,"I've found it, I've finally found it. Studio Ghibli's magnum opus. The greatest anime feature film I've ever seen. Possibly the best fantasy film I've seen as well. This, this is absolutely incredible. Flawless. The story involves a young warrior who is injured with a supernatural curse. He leaves his remote village in search of a remedy but is caught in the midst of a battle between humans and divine beasts. Depicting the clash between the natural ecological system and the modern urbanisation of mankind. Two opposing ideals and environments that struggle to cohabit in unison. An important environmental statement: be good to nature and nature will be good to you. A fundamental statement that doesn't at all feel preachy, but yet it's ever so present throughout every artistic scene. Strip away the fantasy elements and you are still left with a poignant plot that consistently engages throughout its runtime. Every scene matters, every scene builds upon each other like a stack of bricks to then culminate for an epic third act. The animation is stunning. A work of art. The imagination and creativity that is portrayed on screen is a wonder to behold, and will appeal to everyone. The English dub was well done, all the voice actors suited their roles. San's voice did take some time for me to warm to, but by the end I was on board. Surprisingly, this is an emotional journey. Towards the end where there are a few deaths, I actually felt saddened. The biggest impact of them all was actually the destruction of the environment, Miyazaki somehow creates a personality out of the forest to which I connected to it on an emotional level. Masterful work, it really is. Also, the musical score was mesmerising. Slight warning, its rated a PG but I think it will too much for younger viewers. Lots of severed limbs and bloody imagery that I'm sure will invoke nightmares. Princess Mononoke is the best Studio Ghibli animation I've seen, it's an epic masterpiece that everyone should watch. For that reason it gets the perfect rating.",/
18,24 September 2006,jzappa,9, A Film Animal Lovers Will Love: Respect Nature For It Can Destroy You.,"Princess Mononoke is a grand, beautifully animated, heartfelt epic. It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.",?
19,12 January 2015,classicsoncall,8," ""The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away"".","A difficult story to follow and decidedly scary animation at times makes this more an adult film than one for younger fans. It's not too hard to follow in the early going but when the hero Ashitaki makes his way East to the land of the Forest Spirit he's faced with choices that put him on questionable sides of relationships already formed. While trying to save his own life endangered by a poisonous encounter with the boar demon Nago, his overriding mission is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hate'. For this he must valiantly strive to understand the motivations and prerogatives of those he meets, including monk Jigo, Lady Eboshi of Irontown and the wolf princess San, a human raised by wolves. In turn, each of these individuals comes to understand that good and evil are not mutually exclusive character traits, but exist in all to varying degrees. The way this all plays out can be confusing and is not made easier by the depiction of characters like Moro, the large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider a male, but in actuality is the mother of San. It's an intricately woven tale and loyal fans of anime will find it spellbinding, though I must admit, for myself it took a concerted effort to follow and understand.",r

21,21 November 2014,Red-Barracuda,7, A beautifully executed film from Studio Ghibli,"Animals, their gods and humans clash in this fantasy adventure from famed Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Consequently, nature vs humanity is a strong theme throughout Princess Mononoke, meaning that this is an animated movie with a definite message. Most of the humans, after all, are from a mining village who rape the earth, while the sympathetic people are Ashitaka, a boy who fights to bring peaceful co-existence between the opposing forces and Princess Mononoke who actively sides with the animal world and lives amongst them. It's quite clear, therefore, where the film's sympathies lie, although the ecological message is never delivered in a trite obvious manner and there are many shades of grey throughout.",f

Ashitaka is captivating (what a strength, what a heart, what a soul!); San (the Princess Mononoke herself) is intriguing; and Lady Eboshi is ambiguous -is she the villain? I don't think so. After all, who can blame her? Don't let the over exploration of themes related to ecology discourage you. Go ahead and watch Mononoke.

36,14 June 2001,Spleen,6," I'm sure you're very good at what you do, Doctor Fell","Disney animation has linear detail, economical drawing, and extremely sophisticated motion.  In a word, it's classical.  Japanese animation has vertical detail, heavily etched backdrops that verge on being overdesigned, but rudimentary motion.  Japanese animation is baroque.  (Disney cartoons tend to have better draftsmanship, but this is inessential to the difference in style.)  The styles could hardly be more fundamentally opposed, and you like either one or the other.  It's hard to have a strong taste for both. To lay my cards on the table, I like the Disney style: I consider it more subtle and versatile, and at its best it lives and breathes like no other kind of animated image.  Still, the Japanese style has its strengths.",
37,21 April 2007,beardyfriesen,8, An extremely good movie that superseded my preconceptions about the animation style it is presented in.,"A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection of movies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I have forced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at the entire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the world be like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?",

45,24 May 2016,danbranan,7," NOT the ""Star Wars of animated features""","No matter what the New York Post said about it (as is recorded on many of the DVD editions of the film), this is definitely not the pinnacle of animated films, nor even of Miyazaki's own work. I really, really wanted to like this film more than I did. I am a big fan of Miyazaki and this is supposed to be his masterpiece, but I'm just not able to go that far in my own assessment of it. It was complex, and beautifully animated (as you expect from Miyazaki), but it left me a bit hollow. Part of it was the incredible violence in the film (NOT for children under 13, IMO), and part of it was hearing Billy Bob Thornton's drawl as the voice of Jigo, but a big part of my reluctance to rate this film more highly is that it felt a bit like Miyazaki was reaching for something that he had already grasped. I think he addressed almost identical themes in a much better way in Nausicaa. Princess Mononoke seemed uncharacteristically ""preachy"" and heavy-handed, in contrast with Miyazaki's generally subtle style. I know it's super popular and has a stellar reputation, but I just can't recommend it when there are so many other great works available from this true Artist of Anime.",

47,27 June 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6, She speaks for the trees (and the animals),"""Mononoke-hime"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" is a Japanese animated film from 1997, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. I think this was not or at least not primarily the reason why it was shown again here at a local movie theater, but it was part of a film series with focus on anime. No big surprise because this is (considered) one of the classics. Writer and director is Hayao Miyazaki who is probably associated with anime movies more than anybody else. He was in his mid50s when he made this film and is over 80 now. I see there are quite a few talented American actors attached to this project and they were part of the English-language voice cast of course. This includes talented folks like Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup and Gillian Anderson, but also less talented performers like Claire Danes or the absolutely unbearable Jada Pinkett Smith. Sad to see her as part of this project. I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, so I cannot elaborate in-depth on the international voice cast here, but the Japanese did fine overall. No more details there either because I am simply not familiar with their names. Most likely my loss. At almost two hours and fifteen minutes, this is a very long film for the genre. It could almost have been turned into a miniseries as well with this duration I guess and could have worked as well, no matter if there had been three or six episodes. You will not really find an equally long Studio Ghibli film. The awards recognition for this film was there, but surely less spectacular than it would have been nowadays where without a doubt it would have been one of the big animation players at the Oscars as well as at the Annies. The English-language version did not change anything about that either.",

Basically a possessed boar tries to attack a small village, and as the one who defeated him, the creature infects young Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) with an incurable disease. The only way eh may be able to cure his curse is to travel far east and find either the deer God, who makes all plant life grow, or Princess Mononoke, aka San (Claire Danes), raised by wolf Gods and leading the forest animals in the war. Ashitaka is also trying to intervene with the war between the forest and mining colony Tataraba, as they fight for freedom and resources, with all sorts of weird and wonderful characters, creatures, spirits and Gods getting involved. Also starring Gillian Anderson as Moro, Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi, Jada Pinkett Smith as Toki, Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo, Keith David as Okkoto and Futurama's John Di Maggio as Gonza. The story is a little strange, but bare in mind it is Japanese, but with good dubbing voices and aspiring animation, you'll enjoy the experience.

Here the world is full of strange creatures, giant boars, deer with the face of god knows what and weird demon monkeys. This film descends into some pretty trippy stuff.

55,11 December 2005,ace-150,10, How does one act in the face of unsolvable problems?,"This is a sophisticated film with complex cultural, political and personal themes which just happens to be animated. As in real life, each character has parts that you love and parts that you hate. Ashitaka's impassivity in the face of his fate seems beautiful and noble at the beginning of the film but becomes frustrating, even enraging at the end. Eboshi destroys nature to rescue humans on the brink of destruction. Nobody apologizes for their bias, just like in life. Some critics have accused the plot of being driven by the stupidity of the characters, but this critique holds them to the standards of current US society. Nineteenth century Japan was a society strictly regulated by traditions, traditions that were being threatened by Western incursions into Japan. The characters act the only way that they can act - they do their best in an incomprehensible, unsolvable situation. Personally, I sided with Mononoke, but Ashitaka acts with honor in every situation that he faces. I hope that I would have his inner strength in the face of such problems. Things are not neatly wrapped up at the end. This is only one battle in the war between burgeoning Japanese industry and the ancient gods. The war still rages on in Japan as it does in the United States. Oh, the animation is superb. And, for goodness sake, watch it in Japanese with subtitles. If you watch the English version, you won't see the movie the way that it's intended.",
56,9 April 2019,caseyt-48511,10, Possibly the best film by Hayao Miyazaki,"I have a long history with this movie. When I was about 7 I caught it on tv late at night and was interested but didn't know what was happening. I was traumatized by the violence and scary images. I legitimately had nightmares! So I avoided this movie for years. But, nearly 15 years later and I am a big Studio Ghibli fan. I knew I had to watch it. I was not disappointed.
The story of the movie has the feel of a Tolkien epic. A prince goes on a journey to lift a curse off of him. He meets spirits, gods, a town of outcasts and more. The plot is brilliantly put together and tight. There is no wasted moment. The characters are all well written and developed. There's a lot of ambiguity in the film. No character is a stock character and their motives could be easily commended or condemned. I think this leaves the viewer to interpret how they feel.
The animation is so beautiful. Over 100,000 drawings were used in the film. It's colorful, vibrant and feels alive. It screams animated masterpiece.
There's something about Ghibli films that give you a certain feeling. Kinda like what you get when you watch a great classic Disney film. I can't quite put my finger on what the feeling is. Not quite nostalgic, but it's a good feeling nonetheless.
There's so much to talk about. If you love Japanese animation, or just animation in general, then this is a must see! Be warned though! This can be a very violent movie. If you want your younger kids to see a Ghibli film then try My Neighbor Totoro or Ponyo. But once their older, show them this film. Believe me, it's worth every moment.",

Pokemon is silly. Sailor Moon turned stupid. And so far, the only show that looks decent is Escaflowne. And Pokemon the Movie was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I didn't even bother seeing the sequel. I was also slightly disappointed by Grave of the Fireflies. But this. This is something else. This is something magical. It's probably the only anime movie worth watching, although I could be wrong. First the positives. The characters are realistic and well developed. There are no true ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"". The story is also great, sometimes sophisticated. Although the premise has been done to death, this is more than just your average environment movie. Finally, there's the animation. It's beautiful and breathtaking, especially with the backgrounds. The Nightwalker sequence is probably the one of the better animated pieces in history. Now the negatives. While the movie is wonderful to look at, the animation technique is still anime, which drives me crazy to no end. Those used to Disney's fluid style of drawing and animating will find the hyperactivity and shortcuts of anime a tad unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish. The movie also tries to do too many things at once, and as a result, certain parts look unfinished, rushed, or unpolished. Some parts even seem unnecessary. Finally there's the ending. Do all animes end in a wimpy, ambiguous note? Because I'm not used to it. These flaws aren't enough to make it a bad movie. On the contrary, this is a fantastic movie. However, this won't receive a perfect 10 from me, just a 9.",

For the protection of his kin and in order to revert this process, he leaves on a journey. He finds a young woman running a lead mill crafting rifles, with ambitions of rule and no care for the damage she does to nature(and he is suffering some of the consequences). And thus we get the not-so-subtle message(hint: she represents mankind). ""Can't we all just get along"" is the idea, but it does actually take the problem more seriously(with a mature sensibility) than other of these, such as Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas, and most recently, Avatar. This also gets into the theme of anger and hate being self-destructive, not only harmful to one's surroundings. There are a lot of concepts in this, and fully comprehending and following it may require several viewings, time devoted to piecing it all together, and prior knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture. This is not for children, or even teens, but adults, setting it apart from every other Miyazaki production I've seen, which is nearly all of them. The acting is very good, and I urge you to watch this with subtitles, not dubbed. I do wonder why they did not sync up the animals, unlike the humans. The animation is excellent, with memorable designs, and mood expertly built by, among other things, the right amount(and tone, nuance) of light and dark(it also knows when and how to use sound, as well as silence). There is a bit of action, and it's intense, visually appealing and well-choreographed. Sans credits, this is 124 minutes long. The DVD comes with trailers for Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Porco Rosso, Ponyo, this and Howl's Moving Castle, 2 Promos(coming to a running time of 8 minutes), 3 teasers(2 minutes put together) and 6 TV spots(totaling at 2 minutes).

67,24 March 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, A tree falls in the woods...,"'Princess Mononoke (1997)' is a story about humans vs nature, an age-old struggle here categorised by a literal war, that tries to implore a balance between the two intrinsically linked elements but never feels as though it's 'preaching'. The piece works as an epic adventure regardless of its real-life relevancy, chock-full of Studio Ghibli's signature strangeness and odd underlying charm. It's much more serious than the studio's usual stuff, though. Its beautiful animation is as often used to evoke fear as wonder, the piece being surprisingly heavy - and violent - for a 'PG' animated piece. This isn't a bad thing, depending on who you are, because it allows for a mature yet enjoyable tale. The thing is rich and exciting, building towards a genuinely tense finale. Its characters are also rather multi-faceted, never quite conforming to the expectation of their role. It's a really solid story with some great action, resonant themes and interesting animation. It's probably Miyazaki's finest work. 8/10",
68,25 April 2021,gbill-74877,8, Beautiful and nuanced,"There's so much to love about this Studio Ghibli production, with its beautiful animation and messages of environmentalism and co-existence. It starts off seeming like it will be another fantasy involving a young man going off to fight essentially as good vs. Evil, but we soon see it's not as simple as that. In fact, the character is more often a mediator, so much in the middle that others wonder whose side he's on, which I thought was a nice touch. There are two strong female characters on each side of the conflict, and I loved the nuance in that of Lady Eboshi, the leader of an iron works. She rescues girls from slavery and gives lepers jobs, seemingly a virtuous character defending her operation from the animals which threaten it, but we find that she's also ambitious and her campaign of deforestation is done with ultimate goal of power. She's doing what people do but it's destroying the ecosystem, which is then reacting. Meanwhile there are conflicts within both sides, e.g. Samurai vs. Ironworkers, and apes vs. Wolves vs. Boars. That makes the plot probably a little messier than it should have been, and a film with more action scenes (and associated carnage) than necessary, but it underscores the message that conflict is inevitable, and that mediation is critical to allow both sides to live in harmony. It's all wrapped up in creative visuals done with a wonderful aesthetic, making for an appealing film.",

Although a clear message is sent about valuing the Earth and recognising the dangers of exploitation, the story is complex and ambiguous (especially compared to the simplistic morality plays usually pawned off as 'educational'). The look is typical of Ghibli anime (except Lady Eboshi, who looks a bit out of place) and, although the voices in the English version I watched were a bit bland, I found the characters engaging and interesting (although always secondary to the imagery).

84,10 June 2021,guisreis,8, Epic about the struggle between progress and nature,"This epic film has the signature of the Studio Ghibli: beautifully animated, carefully working in each minor detail, with well developped characters and immersing spectator in that bright world. It is impressive how each Ghibli film has a deep and encompassing universe from its own. This one, different from others of their films, takes place in a fantastic Japan, not in a place ressembling Europe. In my opinion, this is not among the best Ghibli films (their average level is extremely high), as it is perhaps too long and sometimes seems unfocused, but it is still a quite good movie. What is its greatest merit, brilliant and unique, is its approach about the core issue: there is a metaphoric war between the modern/progress/industry/development and nature. Off course a balance between both is desirable but it is always hard to be measured and achieved. Exploiting nature is recurrently seen as evil, because of all evironmental problems we face. Indeed, greed and irresponsability are common traits of humans and they drove us to this situation. On the other hand, progress is not compatible not to change environment, and reactionary views on that usually do not care about poverty and inequality among people and countries. Nature is not only what gives us our resources, but is also brutal, dangerous, and challenges our survival when we are exposed. All that complexity appears in the movie in the shape of two opposite sides: humans want to destroy the forest motivated by greed but also by keeping their beloved community safe; the savage forces of nature led by Princess Mononoke and some entities want to preserve it untouched and to kill invading civilization. There is no manichaeism. Both sides commit mistakes, have good reasons, do not see the other side as an interlocutor, and may be ruthless. Indeed this is the most violent film by Studio Ghibli I have watched. To resume, this animated film establishes a wonderful ""mithology"" about the layered clash between progress and nature, in which the most they fight, the most both lose.",

86,30 March 2009,pc95,7, Another Good Miyazaki Entry,"Although not among my favorite Miyazaki films, Princess Mononoke must be given high praise for what is the standard for classical animation - Miyazaki. It's story is intriguing, but perhaps the most violent of any Miyazaki film - maybe too much. Despite that, it conjures up an interesting more historically leaning movie pitting man against nature. My favorite ideas in the movie were the kodama or forest sprites living in abundance to mark the health of the natural growth of plants, flowers, and animals as well as the kami-shika (deer god). Both were fantastically creative. The characters in the movie were fairly well done and the lack of romance was appealing. Perhaps more than other Miyazaki movies the hues of green in this movie jump out of the screen in colors as striking as any Miyazaki film. What I found a bit lacking (only in comparison) was some of the wonder and fantasy in other Miyazaki films which carry them to truly magical heights. Nonetheless, Mononoke-hime is a violent cautionary tale maybe meant to be so to jolt his usual audiences.",

In addition to the longest run-time compared to the previous Ghibli movies, the animation was also much more impressive and breathtaking. I was hooked from the opening, which showed an intense chase and fight scene. The story was intricate and made me want to see how it would all unveil. Unexpectedly, there were a lot of gore, which made the action even more thrilling. The theme about man versus nature and how nature can strike back were adamantly clear and impactful not only in 1997, but also now.

Whether due to misogynism, gratuitous violence, or tentacles, I walk away wondering what is going on in Japanese culture. Princess Mononoke, like Miyazaki's other works, is not a vehicle for shameless fan-service, nor does it rely on the tired and implausible concept of mecha as its selling point, unlike so much anime I have seen. Instead, it deals with the age-old tension between human attempts to shape the environment for its own ends and the life-and-death power of nature.",

Ashitaka, a perceptive and valiant young man and peacemaker who is wise beyond his years, recognizes that this demon is blinded by its own agony. He attempts to quiet its rage and direct the sinister power away from the village. Despite his efforts and care to avoid the demon, and his success at saving the village, Ashitaka is touched by the curse. The village oracle encourages him to journey with unclouded eyes and open mind to the source of the demon's rage - a distant forest - where Ashitaka may be able to find a way to lift the curse. The journey takes Ashitaka to an ironworks encroaching on the forest, where people, animals and demons are at war with each other, and with themselves. As Ashitaka looks for a way to lift the curse and keep from harm, he uncovers secrets of the place and characters. This includes a mysterious and beautiful young princess allied with the wolves; Mononoke.",
94,11 June 2007,planktonrules,6, One of the only Miyazaki films that disappointed me,"Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun.",
95,31 March 2021,EdwardtheBlackPrince,9, Nature always wins,"Princess Mononoke was directed by Hayao Miyazaki and is the 11th film. It tells the story of a prince named ashitaka who after a cursed boar spirit attacks his village is cursed. Traveling east to find the source of the boar hatred. Ashitaka comes upon a town of outcasts and leapers lead by a woman name Eboshi. We learn that the humans of this village are at war with the spirits of the forests, humans are digging up iron ore and Desecrating the forest. As a result, it's weakening the spirits Resulting in many being turned into demons. Amongst these spirits is a human girl name San known throughout the forest as princess Mononoke raised by wolf spirits she aids them against the humans. The most notable aspect of this film is the amount of blood and gore as well the action. This is hands-down the studio's most graphic film with dismemberment, bloody wounds, and piles of corpses. It's rather serious essentially a war movie between men and nature. The overall tone of this movie is that there's not a de facto villain. It would be easy to pin Lady Eboshi as the villain that not entirely true. She's destroying the forest, she has a motive driven out by the Emperor. Caring for the lives of her people. She sees the forest as a new potential for them, willing to sacrifice to prosper. She's more interested in the money not knowing the consequences of her actions. Ashitaka is the Voice of reason stoic and Courageous he's trying to prevent conflict between the spirits and the humans so it doesn't lead to more suffering for others. You believe he's not afraid to die but he still fights to protect everything. Course the last major character is princess Mononoke how design is creative, her stories similar to Mowgli from the jungle book being raised by wolves. Similar to Nausicaa of the valley of the wind she's a warrior and she knows how to fight. Moving swift in the fight offers adrenaline. One of the small downsides is that you don't get much time to know her. The choice in scenery is an excellent choice before the tale of Princess Kaguya this was the only film set in ancient Japan so I always gave it a distinct personality. Playing off of the concept of nature and spirits the Settings are beautiful tons of landscapes panned over there show off the scale and effort put into this world. Huge amount of detail are put into the forest and the water. The design of the forest spirit & Kodama is creative. Princess Mononoke is action-packed and remains one of the best works in animation.",

Hayao Miyazaki's best film still manages to put many modern anime movies to shame with its amazing visuals, action packed scenes and wonderful soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi. Mononoke Hime avoids the classic black or white morality issue and deals with more powerful themes than other Ghibli movies, turning this film from something that could've easily been a children's book into a fantastic tale for people of all ages.

The word Mononoke is a Japanese word for specter or spirit. The film was received positively by critics and won 4 awards in Japan. A central theme of the movie is the environment and humanity's fear of the unknown. Industrialization is also a key factor as iron town wants to expand mining for iron into the forest. The forest gods do not agree with this and that is how the whole conflict starts. The story revolves around a boy Ashitaka who became cursed by a demon and must rid his curse or die. He travels to the west in search of the forest god to lift his curse. Meanwhile a group of villagers are traveling home and are attacked by the wolf clan. Ashitaka meets the wolf clan along the way and befriends them. Princess Mononoke is the adoptive daughter of the wolf god. He travels to iron town events transpire and the humans and beasts battle for the forest. Ashitaka and San (Princess Mononoke) must save the beasts and humans or suffer the destruction of both.,

Yes, it is beautiful to look at and has great characters and artistry, but it's so hard to follow!  It suffers the same deadfall that many, perhaps MOST anime films do.. The plot is just too confusing.  It starts out ok, even the middle of the film is engaging, but by the end of it there is utter confusion:  Too many characters fighting for too many different reasons.  I am even a science major, an adult, and an animation connoisseur, and this film stumps me.  There are all of these different parties going after the forest spirit, but also fighting eachother.  The forest spirit is ambiguous itself, friendly one moment, and then dangerous when its head is cut off. Warriors want to keep the head as a trophy, so they're stirring up trouble for everyone. There are the metal workers who are doing their own thing but inadvertently creating demons when animals get shot.  Sometimes.  Depending on the species of animal which is infected with the bullet. I think.  Then you have the boar people who are fighting everybody and trying to protect the forest.. And the princess and the wolves, who are really aloof and not on anybody's side.  And then there's Ashitaka, who is mixed up with all of them and has the demon infection himself and wants to find a cure.

Also, the dubbing of the American voices doesn't help at all. The only one who works is Billy Cudup who voices the young hero--his voice fits perfectly. Billy Bob Thornton is horrible--his Texas accent sounds a little out of place in ancient Japan! (Also his character makes no sense and disappears completely in the middle of the movie). Claire Danes makes the princess sound like a spoiled brat and Minnie Driver's English accent sound uproarious on an evil(?) Japanese queen. That's the problem, she reads her lines so unsurely I didn't know how to take them! This is definitely a movie that lost A LOT in the translation.

For me this film represents life with its ambivalence, like true life seen on a microscopic level there's no good or bad, no final Victim or offender since everything is a matter of perception. And princess mononoke shows this perfectly by not setting any true antagonists. Since all the sides of this film are doing what they're doing for a convincing reason, for their survival and ishitaka serves as the mediator in the middle of this storm trying to find harmony. It's also more relevant then ever because the way it addressed industrialization and its desastrous effect on earth, the human thrust for more resources will lead to his end, and our stiving to survive might be, ironically the reason of our extinction. The film is very savage, brutal and dark, it's definitely not a kids film because i don't see a kid comprehending it.

And not just because it's absolutely beautiful; but more because it has a level of moral ambiguity not normally seen in either of its two genres. The story features a protagonist who spends most of the story watching events he can't control; a town inhabited by vigorous ex-prostitutes, lepers, and useless men, led by a fearless warrior queen but whose future depends on environmental destruction; awesome, but vengeful and frequently misguided gods; a girl raised by wolves who hates humans; and various squabbling animals. Even the villain of the piece (and this is surely an obvious parable for own own world) is less a figure of evil but rather a buccaneering adventurer who puts his own self interest above the greater good. At first, watching a version dubbed into English, I was put off by the non-Japanese voices; but in time, I fell into the world portrayed anyway. And when, near the end, with their fates hanging in the balance, the hero puts his arm around the heroine, I found it strangely moving in a way that I didn't expect to feel about what is, after all, just a drawing.",

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm not that in tune with the Japanese culture, but I just have to call things as how I see them and this animated movie by famed director Miyazaki didn't cut it for me. I think the main problem is that he didn't make us care for the characters involved and any movie that misses this part, I usually don't recommend. Miyazaki definitely winds an inventive story with unique animation and interesting demons and creatures as he usually does but the heart comes across missing. The story is about a group of humans who want to take the forest back from the animal gods who currently inhabit it and sometimes cause havoc with they turn into demons. This situation occurred early on and the prince of the story becomes infected to the point of having a curse on him that will eventually cause him to die. He's sent west to a forest area to hopefully get cured by the Deer God. He then meets up with Princess Mononoke, who is a half-human, half-wolf protector of the forest and tries to combine with her to help the cause, eventually. Battles ensue, and we do end up getting a happy ending – which we knew we'd see eventually, but two hours of the preparation for it was too much for me. I think the purpose of the story was to get us to see how we need to protect the forest, which I think we know, but the slow moving narrative ruins the purpose.

Well, I want to march up to the teacher who made me watch it, slam a copy of ""Princess Mononoke"" on her desk and tell her, ""Get rid of that other movie and start showing your classes this!"" Seriously, this is a fantastic environmental movie! Why? Because instead of saying, ""People are evil, nature is good!"" it says that people and nature can live in harmony. They never say which side is good, it's up for the audience to decide, while never shoving the message down your throat like other environmental films at the time. Granted, I wouldn't show it to younger audiences, there are multiple bloody scenes of people getting body parts ripped off, and I found the Spirit of the Forest to be really creepy.

152,30 April 2005,stamper,5," Japanese anime: bigger, longer and uncut","Generally I am a real fan of animated films and since Hayao Miyazaki's films seem to be of very high quality I recently felt to give one of his films a try despite not being too keen on Asian anime. The only film I really liked was Vampire Hunter D to be honest and I can assure you that I've seen my share of Manga 'classics' (Akira and Ghost in the shell). I had a feeling though that Miyazaki's films would be more mainstream Hollywood style, since he has become something of a trade name since making this film and the academy award winning Spirited Away. After seeing this film, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the fact that the film had some of the makings of a great adventure film, I just could not get used to the many fantasy; god/demon elements. From the start I felt that the films core the film had a dangerous equilibrium, which it managed to maintain during the first hour. The first hour was pretty exciting and interesting but in the second hour the weight on the 'boring' scale just got bigger and bigger. It was not as if Miyazaki did a bad job directing, but I felt that he put too much weight on the whole moral/mystical part of the film where more emphasis on the action would have made the film tighter. Maybe though it wasn't the emphasis alone, I also felt that some of the scenes were excruciatingly long. Or maybe it is safe to say that I'm not into the whole Asian 'spirit thing'. I mean I didn't like The Ring or Ju-On one bit and I didn't care much for this one either. The only thing I actually can appreciate in Asian (specifically Japanese) films is the amount of violence they use and the way in which it is often comic. There were a couple of instances in this film as well where I felt the violence was so over the top that it became funny. Too bad that isn't enough to keep a film interesting for 128 minutes. Miyazaki should have kept this one standard Disney-length (with a maximum of 85 minutes).",

155,12 April 2010,blackmamba99971,10, Beautiful Movie,"This is a great example of how the earth is so important. What we see is a land in Japan going industrial in the Shogun era. People under the tutelage of a woman who runs iron town. Basically a business woman who oversees her workers mining and smelting the iron to make fire arms or other forms of artillery. In the middle are two would be hero's, one is called San and the other Ashitaku, a lone man who was exiled from his village for being poisoned by a god turned demon. In his investigations he learns that the iron town was responsible for cutting down the trees and mining ore. But never gave back to the forest which made the gods angry. Seeing as the gods were going to battle, one lone schemer among the chaos only wanted the head of the forest spirit, to give his life a reprieve from the emperors sentence. Through it all San and Ashitaku try to achieve a goal of coexistence between the forest gods and humans, but all for not. Both sides went to war and the humans were winning their place in history. To see such grand scale imagery as well as a well thought out story I have to admit, this was a great teaching tool of ecological disasters. It was sad to see the forest spirit die to let the humans take their place alone in the world. To never again rely on the gods which had protected them for thousands of years or for that matter before time. But gods know that humans can endure the most riddled hardships handed to them, and must step aside to allow the human race to make mistakes themselves and to recover. I liked the way how the animals began to forget their own comprehension's and began to DE-evolve to ordinary animals of the wild. Brilliant picture, and brilliant cast.",

And there is nothing more to be said about it. Some will precisely say it's annoying to watch a movie (almost) everyone loves, but nevermind. More than ever the message of it all is so strong, so deep no one could forget it: The spirit of Nature lies way above our comprehension, but we despise and keep on killing it slowly. Period.

So, Japanime isn't always popular with me, but I really like this movie. I relate to the main character because he cares about others and does what he can to help. And the movie showcases cooperation between animals and humans well... think horses. Yakul, Ashitaka's red elk, which looks like a Tauntaun from Star Wars, carries him from place to place. At the beginning of the film, actually, he is riding Yakul when Nago, a wild boar covered with a horrible spirit, attacks a small village. Ashitaka helps a small group of villagers escape from Nago, who looks like he is covered in a heavy, thick, amorphous black oil, but upon closer inspection, it looks more like a pool of worms. These worms shoot out of him like tentacles. A piece of the black spirit shoots out from Nago and strongly twirls, lightly grabbing Ashitaka's right arm. He pulls away. While a small amount of the sludge is on his arm, he is able to release an arrow into the monster's eye, killing him. After his first fight, as his arm rots, this wound glows and he needs help to heal it or else he will die. Find out how iron is killing the animals and see how Ashitaka helps save the forest while preventing his own death.",

169,19 October 2010,toqtaqiya2,10, Princess Mononoke preserves the director's spirit of humanism while succeeding as a daring action-adventure.,"Director Hayao Miyazaki spent twenty years considering the story that would eventually become Princess Mononoke, transforming it from something more obviously linked to fairytale and folklore into a passionate plea for us to learn from history instead of simply repeating it. It's an uncomfortable film, full of ambiguity. Ashitaka is the perfect hero, brave, strong, unpretentious, and kind, yet he kills when he has to. San - vicious, unreasoning, and utterly focused - ought to be a villain, but Miyazaki refuses to allow that simplistic label, insisting through each of his characters and their relationships that instead of name-calling we should be cooperating, because the only alternative is destruction. Princess Mononoke is a primitive film in many ways, both violent and pessimistic. The woodlands in which it is set are full of strange spirits and gods, beautiful, but threatening. The score by Joe Hisaishi supports this sense of threat, with a closing theme that's an eerie counter tenor solo that sends chills down the spine. It's also the first Studio Ghibli film to make extensive use of computer animation, a decision taken by producer Toshio Suzuki to meet an otherwise impossible deadline at the end of the three-year production process. Unlike other Miyazaki films this one is not for small children - there's too much violence, bloodshed and death for that. It's a complex, legendary tale, but one that is easy to follow, thrillingly exciting, and never less than beautiful to look at - like a detailed painting brought to life. Though it was Miyazaki's subsequent effort, Spirited Away (2001), that won the Oscar, Princess Mononoke is probably more worthy of it.",

It has two separate sets of subtitles, one also called ""captions"" that matches the dubbed English translation, and the other also called ""subtitles"" that are apparently the original transliteration from Japanese to English. (Be careful though that although both original and dubbed soundtracks are on this particular DVD, this is not necessarily true of other DVDs.

The visuals are simply stunning, I will go and say: the best the 90's anime have seen.

You know,having seen ""Howl's moving castle"",""my neighbour totoro"" and ""spirited away"" beforehand made it seem intense. but you know that's the only way they would've been able to illustrate how senseless human atrocities are. The first time I saw it,I didn't make much of it,but it kept playing in the background of my mind. And that's where the genius of it lies,in my opinion. I mean,any movie that keeps you thinking afterwards is a successful movie. My takeaway from it was,other than the obvious ""humans,stop messing with mother nature"",it was most importantly the terribleness -if I may - of hatred and anger. What I learned from it is that when people feel hurt,they can become toxic if they choose not to forgive and hold on to their grudges. Like, that boar literally turned to a demon and was infecting whoever came close to him because he let hate get the best of him. Also,it made me realize that,indeed,like the movie pointed out,hate does feed on anger and fear. Also,it highlights the idea that each story has two sides,and we should really drop our prejudices in order to make room for understanding.

202,2 September 2017,sol-,7, Humans and Wildlife,"Attacked by a wild boar and infected by the madness that drove the boar insane, a young warrior stumbles upon a war between human villagers and intelligent wildlife in this animated drama from the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. The film benefits from having no clear-cut villains or heroes; both the humans and the wildlife merely want to use the same territory for their own means and the project as such comes with some positive ecological messages in terms of trying to be sustainable and live in harmony. The most fascinating character is the title one though - a human raised by wolves as one of their own. Oddly enough, considering that the film is named after her, the Princess is only ever a supporting character in the proceedings. Furthermore, the film only ever lightly touches on the intriguing personal identity issues that come with being raised as something that one is not. Fortunately, the infected warrior is a curious enough character with his resilience in the face of impending death that the film still chugs along well. It is also refreshing to see an animated fantasy film that dares to show graphic carnage in order further the story-line. If not quite as dark and impressively nightmarish as 'Watership Down', this Japanese offering certainly comes close to it. In short, this is a relatively engrossing tale if not nearly the best thing that Miyazaki has ever done.",

Ashitaka got the same curse from him and now he's supposed to find a way to lift it. He meets princess Mononoke, lady Eboshi and so on. Then the plot gets rushed, boring and uncompelling.

204,20 July 2018,matthewssilverhammer,9, The Near-Perfect Synergy of Style and Substance,"Don't be fooled by the outward appearances of Princess Mononoke. Don't be fooled by the Studio Ghibli tag, or the Disney distribution, or its princess-fantasy genre, or the animated format. This is far from a kid-friendly film. It's intentionally paced (aka ""slow), jarringly violent (decapitation, ripped-off limbs, intense physical transformations), and almost oppressively heavy in tone. It's also one of the most lush, colorful, and beautiful creations of Miyazaki's astounding career, combining his undeniable animation skill and boundless imagination with overwhelming success.
Oddly enough, Mononoke isn't our protagonist here. Instead we follow Ashitaka, a recently cursed Prince who, in his search for a cure, finds himself mixed up in a battle for the future of the forest and its inhabitants, both animal and spiritual. Its effortless mixture of compelling story, well-placed humor, naturalism and fantasy is like great literature, only told with unspeakably perfect hand-drawn animation. Each cartoon cel and 2D creation is given its own character, style and care. Possessed-like apes with blurry skin. Cute but unsettling forest nymphs with Picasso-inspired faces. Snake-like demons drowning giant boars, personified wolves and blood-covered humans with chaotic precision. 
Not that its all style and no substance. Miyazaki and writer Neil Gaiman are running the gamut on thematic presence here, much of which will be familiar specifically in the bible belt. Fate versus chance, the relentless power of hatred, the danger of false prophets, the difficult power of choosing good, life springing up from death, the frustration inherent in being an ephemeral creature. It's all presented with a wonderous mystery, only suffering from moments of over-explanation. Princess Mononoke represents an entirely imaginative spirit rarely surpassed in storytelling.",

There is a general tendency among adult audience to not take animation seriously, but I would be shocked if this movie did not leave a huge impact on anyone. This is one of my first reviews on IMDb, this movie has to be watched and internalized by everyone who is concerned about her future. If anything can move humanity to not inflict further harm and damage against mother Nature, it is this movie. If mother Nature had a form,it would closely resemble what Miyazaki has created in this movie. Even the thought of this movie chokes me, the stark unending sadness truly captures what Nature's wildlife is going through because of human activities. If humans ruin the planet in the near future to the extent that it becomes unlivable for all, this movie has the exact elements which can guide us all.",

The Japanese probably like their young male characters to be all mopey, melancholic, effeminate, Emo's, and the young female characters to be clingy, whiny, immature brats! However, Princess Mononoke isn't quite as bad Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Ponyo, Tales of Earthsea etc, but it's still pretty bad.

While previous efforts like Castle in the Sky and My Neighbor Totoro contained mythical elements - sleepy deities, spritely spirits, magic-tinged talents - the influence of god-level beings often feels secondary, relegated to a few enchanting (yet fleeting) glimpses. In Princess Mononoke, such divine creatures are essential, active participants. They speak, argue, swing their weight around. We aren't left to guess about their opinions or motivations, because their words and actions carry such a resonant influence. It's mesmerizingly effective, a contrast between the seemingly petty concerns of human tribes and the mass and muscle of a much heavier entity.",

It has an epic scope: political strife, eco-messages, natural and human violence, romance, deception, misguided philanthropy. Where to begin? First, I'd issue a warning that about the violence, unfortunate word choices and uncomfortable life situations for consumption by young audiences. This was unexpected, so I spent quite a bit of time surreptitiously observing my 9 year old viewing companion for adverse reactions. We also had a good debriefing conversation on the way home from the movies. I feel confident that I did not return her to her parents scarred for life (once again >phew<). Apart from those concerns, both she and I really enjoyed the movie. The artwork was superb, the characters were well drawn, the action was fast paced, the suspense was compelling, the voice talent was superb.

I was instantly taken away from reality and was delved into this beautiful world. The chemistry between San and Ashitaka are perhaps the biggest of interests in the film. The artwork is meticulous. Studio Ghibli is employed with wizards of anime who always seem to blow us away with their style. Strong characters and dialogue.(all languages voiced excellently, by the way)And an intelligent, emotional story.(yet confusing for some)All together make in my opinion one of the greatest animated films of all time.

The film has been called the Star Wars of the east, but surely it is more than simply that, with a confidence and fluidity in its action-driven world building that immediately signals to us that these clans have existed for a very long time, and want to desperately continue that tradition. Then one day man discovered that iron ore could be forged into new and powerful tools, and the earth was broken to excavate it, and lines were drawn in the sand. ",
223,22 October 1998,Squidd,10, What Disney lacks...,"The king of Japanese animation displays his (as of yet) most carefully crafted work.  As in all his movies, the audience must be prepared to enter into a magical world, where the background scenes are beautifully painted in a realistic manner, but are imaginary and fantastic...  To be taken to a mythical Japan where wolves have two tails, where forests are inhabited by head-ticking spirits, and where boars can be cursed with hatred, seems at first to be an exciting adventure.  But we find that this world is all too real.  At the center of this epic is a battle between man and nature. People kill animals and trees... as well as each other.  Trees are burned for iron, iron is used for guns, and the guns are used for war.  People die, animals die, and spirits die.  But Miyazaki is a messenger of hope.  He claims to want to show children not how the world is, but how it could be. His characters are neither evil nor good, and so they allow for change. Disney could learn from this.  The magic of Disney lies in its abiltiy to tell happy tales of good people vs. evil people.  The magic of Miyazaki lies in his philosophy.  His love for craft, and his relentless passion for animation and story-telling allows him to produce movies that are original and breathtaking.  The effort that he places in the creation of his art guarantees that his work is worth watching, at least once.  And for that effort, we as an audience should put in the proper effort to try and understand what this director is getting at, as well as the effort of appreciating the animation itself.  There are scenes in this movie that Disney cannot do (at least not yet) simply because of the technique. Miyazaki deserves a place with the masters.  He has shown that animation is no child's play.",

It is fantasy fiction at its finest, and magnificently realized.",

I understand that Miramax's distribution and marketing of the film up to this point has been rather low-key, but I hope somehow this film will reach enough people to make a change in the mindset of the American public. A note to parents, this is not ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service."" There is some violence in ""Princess Mononoke"" which may startle younger audiences.",

It ranks among Fantasia and Pinocchio as the greatest animated films ever made.  The story line is beautiful and complex.  It's not your normal, boring, conventional, and predictable Hollywood plot that everyone seems to want nowadays.  Some people had trouble with Princess Mononoke, I think, because there are no real good guys and bad guys.  You can't really take sides, every character has different motives with good and bad intentions. But that's one of the things I liked about Mononoke.  It's not the good old simplistic Disney tale where there is a definite good and evil.  Princess Mononoke is not about good vs. evil, or even man vs. nature, but about how we should all reach a certain compromise and try to work together and help each other.  You won't find too many themes like that in movies, especially animated features.  Princess Mononoke is not for small children, not just because of the violence, but because it will probably go way over their heads.  It is geared toward adults and older audiences.  The love story between San and Ashitaka is very subtle, moving, and even profound.  It's not conventional Hollywood.  Princess Mononoke is #1 on my ten best films of the year list because I believe it is a landmark feat in the animation genre.  I think it will eventually change the way Americans look at animation; that it's not just limited to the family and small children, but can be for adults and only for adults.  Mononoke shows that animation is just another form of expressive filmmaking, it can show things on film that could not possibly be filmed in live action.",
228,7 April 2008,El_Rey_De_Movies,8," A major achievement, unfortunately marginalized in the States","Disney has always dominated the animation market here in the States with their popular, streamlined, well-crafted series of films aimed at children with a little extra thrown in to keep the parents interested. But it's a different story in Japan, and one look at ""Princess Mononoke"" will show you the exact reasons why. Whatever you may think about Japanese animation (or ""anime"", as it's popularly known), one thing you have to understand is that it's definitely NOT aimed at children, and that the level of animation is far superior to anything the House of Mouse has ever produced. This film, which I consider one of the greatest ever made, is the story of young Prince Ashitaka. While defending his tribe from a rampaging demon, he is infected with its' venomous hate. The infection is lethal, and the only hope for Ashitaka is to leave his ancestral lands, venture into the west, see what caused the entity that attacked his people to turn into a demon, and ""to see with eyes unclouded by hate"". His journey takes him to Irontown, a village of miners and metalworkers, and their struggle with the Great Forest Spirit. At that point, it becomes a moral fable about how humans coexist (or more often, fail to) with the natural environment and the price that they pay for trying to control the elements of nature. It's a tremendously fast-paced and exciting story, full of strong and well-rounded characters voiced convincingly by the likes of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Billy Bob Thornton. The animation can only be described as jaw-droppingly beautiful. If you've never heard of director Miyazaki or have never seen anime, this is the place to start.",

If Disney had been smart enough to release this film subtitled, with a real advertising campaign, it could have been more successful than Crouching Tiger.  There's a reason why this is the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, and if its distributors had handled it better it could have won Best Foreign Film.  Hell, it should have won Best Picture for 1997, and Jo Hisaishi ABSOLUTELY deserved the Best Original Score award. ",

Ashitaka, the main protagonist serves as the negotiator between both sides and tries to make peace. His character resembles everything that is pure and good in humanity.

In England we grow up on an unappealing diet of Disney tripe, but we don't realise it is so shoddy because it's all we have. This is because we don't have a strong animation industry of our own really, with the possible exception of Aardman Animations, and we are gripped by America's commercial stranglehold. The lower classes in this country love America and anything it produces, because they are ignorant, pure and simple. The sad fact is that the average person in the street has not heard of Studio Ghibli or Miyazaki. Consequently they think that Disney films are the acme of animation, and show their children Disney films and take them on holidays to Disneyland. It was such a revelation for me to see my first Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away) and when I watched more of Miyazaki's masterpieces, most notably Mononoke-Hime, I realised what animation can and should be. There still persists in this country the idea that animation is somehow a lower art form than live-action films, but the more people see this film, the more things will change. Using animation allows a director to fly effortlessly into the realms of fantasy, and Miyazaki is masterful at it. It amazes me that although western animation has been commercially successful for so much longer, the greatest imaginative leap the directors seem to able to make is talking animals. Brilliant. The Studio Ghibli films, however, are not afraid to make films where almost all of the characters are people (Kiki's Delivery Service) because they are not afraid to take on live-action films on their own territory - they don't feel the need to retreat to the safety of talking animals, where live-action will not usually follow.

The hero is a near-perfect character, kind and brave (he risked his life to save his family), strong and calm (he ran back and forth between forces at the last minute), big-hearted and big-hearted (the one in dadara). But only in this way can the tragic feelings be reflected. He said to sang, ""we have done our best,"" and held her in his arms, accepting the unknown ending, living or dying, all came like a verdict in that brilliant light. Yes, even if we open our hearts, sympathize with each other, and try our best, we will not be able to balance the conflicts in this world, because it is no longer the so-called desire and contradiction, but the most basic helplessness of life in this world -- heaven and earth are not benevolence, and all things are the dog.
The favorite character is actually the female Lord who represents human reason and desire. In fact, she is by no means avarice or a surrogate for industrial civilization. The film is definitely not an indictment of industrial civilization. She was not cutting mountains and trees for her own greed, but for something very basic: survival. Happiness or pain, even like a ghost in the sickbed to breathe, but also want to live, and live with a little more dignity. On this woman, reflected a lot of human noble character, not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses, there is no romance of the moan, only resolute, indomitable adhere to. There is no wrong, people alive, is the acquisition of nature. As the population grows, human needs become a bottomless pit that cannot be filled, but that is no reason for the uncaring to die without a sound. If being alive means having power, then she's determined to do it. In the end, she did not collapse like the post-modern people in the face of the tragic outcome, but calmly ""start from scratch"". There is no wrong, people, like those weeds, also have tenacious vitality.
Sang, the strength of the portrayal, in fact, not as profound as the former two. But because she is behind, have white Wolf, wild boar, unicorn god and so on, so the strength of this aspect is also very strong. The difference between a Wolf and a wild boar is also intriguing. Just as humans have many different attitudes towards nature, so does the other side of the mirror. Impressive such as the dialogue between the white Wolf and the bird, accompanied by the bleak and distant music (long stone! , such a simple scene, actually absentminded between like an epic feeling.",
256,9 July 2012,manendra-lodhi,9, Completing its Purpose.,In animation films I always like the ideas which are purely imaginative like in the full metal alchemist or complete original ideas like the ratatouille. However in this film the imagination was not that much but there is a humble attempt to give original ideas and a very important message. The animation is good. The cast is very nice. But the fact which has made the film somewhat confused for me is that there is no protagonist or antagonist in the film. The film explores the nature of all the people fighting for their own causes and that is what is beautiful in the film. But I could not attach myself with the film because of this thing may be. The ending is however superb and flawless. The message is given in very much plausible manner.,

259,29 April 2020,sudhakaranakhilan,8, For the serious anime viewers,"For the persons, not about the kids loving animation, Princess Mononoke will be a better treat for them. The era now ongoing flourished with a lot of 3D colorful and lively animated works, Princess Mononoke went back us to the late decades of 2D animation. We are all familiar with Disney as the king of animation and along with Dreamworks, Pixar, etc but this is from the 'manga' place that is called Japan. The place, setting, and the subject set back us the historical background of Japan. The movie points out the question regarding humans and nature. We are confused about the above question because we don't know what should consider important in the context. Whether we have to fix human above nature or vice-versa. The film smoothly approaches to that question and finds a mid to mid answer through the characterization of Ashitaka. Ashitaka stood along with both nature and humans. It's about the human greed for nature for the development of their society and culture at the same time the animals thriving to set their place. So, Princess Mononoke is for all kinds of film lovers who don't consider animation works as mere a simple kid watching process rather than an important film genre.",

There is a reason that Miyazaki is a god among animators, but I honestly think this is one of his weaker films. The characters are one of the most important thing for a movie for me and this movie did not have the strongest characters. I enjoyed them and I enjoyed the fact that Ashitaka was consistent when it came to his moral compass, but the arcs of any of the characters are almost non-existent. There are both scare and suspenseful moments followed by sweet moments that are really enjoyable. I guess the visuals and the universe Miyazaki created is what makes this movie so special. Unfortunately I did not every connect with any of the characters. I think he does a better job with delivering his message with other movies without it being so in your face. It is a great movie, but I do not think it deserves classic status. The middle of the movie was slow because of the characters, but it was really book ended with some truly great and memorable moments. The last big action set piece is one of a kind and I would have thought he would have never topped it if I had not seen Ponyo.",

It is legitimately a gorgeous movie throughout and it's also very original, I think in the way things are drawn, but also in the way the story is presented. At first, this seems kind of like a simple hero's journey in the way Joseph Campbell described it. And the movie is that, but it starts getting more complicated and there are messages in here about nature and about feminism that to me in 2020, feel a little heavy-handed, but at the same time, I think in 1997 these weren't messages or themes that you saw all over the place, at least not in the way that they are now. Because if this movie came out in 2020, I think the animation would have still gotten all of the praise it got back then, because it is that good. But I think the way some of the messages the movie is trying to convey do feel a little much nowadays, at least for me. This is still a very good movie and very much worth watching. If you're not interested in the story, then it's at least watching for the beautiful animation and soundtrack.",

I used to watch it when I was very young (born 1999), and couldn't remember the least about it until a friend brought up a bunch of movies he used to watch when he was younger. After having my memory jogged I tracked it down, not the least bit surprised to find it in the top 30 of a bunch of lists. Perhaps a portion of my affection for this movie is the nostalgic trip I went on through watching it recently. Regardless, I was only more awe-struck to watch it. It was everything I hoped it to be, an absolutely amazing story of good vs evil, man against nature and values clashing against values.

This film totally lived up to what people said it was. The emotions I got while watching this film made it definitely worth watching. I would recommend watching the Japanese version with English subtitles though, I tried watching the English version and it didn't really have good voice acting for certain characters, because of this I didn't get the same feelings I always got when watching the Japanese version. The soundtrack is the most perfect soundtrack I have ever heard, there was not one song I didn't like. The film is beautiful, the visuals have aged well too. Everything felt on point, as I said the film gave very good emotions as I said, but it was after the film that it completely hit me with emotions, and it changed my worldview, in a good way. Never has a film hit me with emotions as much as this one. The film sends off a very good message about hate and what it does to people. I swear if you watch this film you are going to have an extremely hard time finding a better one, it's just that good, the film is unique. ",

The backgrounds are beautiful, the character designs fantastic and the action takes full advantage of the fact that this is animated, creating action that wouldn't work nearly as well in live action. It manages to work as both an enjoyable fantasy/action film and work as a film about environmentalism. The characters are so striking and enjoyable to watch, each serving their roles within the story perfectly. The music is just phenomenal - Lord of the Rings seriously ripped this off music wise. The pacing is pretty much pitch-perfect throughout, knowing when to go into all-out-action and when to let the characters have moments to themselves. my only major criticism is the ending, which felt a bit rushed in my opinion.

The Nightwalker is particularly magical. Unfortunately, that's the best part. The moral carried throughout the storyline focuses on the battle between the natural environment and human's development of the environment; good enough so far. However, some of the English-version voice talent is lacking to awful. Billy Bob Thornton, to put it flatly, sucks. His voice doesn't fit the character and his delivery is annoying from the get-go. Every time is character appears, I cringe. Almost as bad are the anonymous voice characterizations of evil creatures. Its as if the talent were taken off the street, paid $50, then in post-production some cheesy sound effects were added to make the voice sound ""scary"". Simply awful! The voice talent is nearly saved by Jada Pinkett Smith's London-inflected, accurate characterization (I hope I got the correct actress).

The English voice cast boasts Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, Gillan Anderson and Keith David - a considerable volume of talent for an animation back in 1997 (Toy Story was 1995), arguably marking the beginning of another trend - for big names to be heard and not seen. There are familiar anime tropes here, but all handled with such sensitivity and style that they still feel fresh on viewing today. The theme of environmentalism is strong, but not stereotyped - character motivations going far beyond cardboard cut-out in their complexity, and it is refreshing and enjoyable that Miyazaki finds room for nobility and honour in his protagonists given the present penchant for anti-heroism. Cinema is the poorer for the recent news that Miyazaki has retired at the age of 73. Here's hoping that the art of animation and of film-making properly acknowledge the debt that it owes him.",

The familiar generic characters typical of this genre are here, but I found that the weight of the story and the beauty of the presentation immediately negated this distraction for me. This is a beautiful film!!! This is a great story - never dull. The accolades poured on this movie by other reviewers are well-deserved. Though I harbored reluctance to see this film compounded by my son's infatuation with the likes of Pokemon and such ilk, I found myself sitting up and applauding the gorgeous attention to visual nuance right from the outset. I can't say anything more that hasn't already been said. I can say that I loved the movie the first time I saw it, loved it even more the second time, and found that it was just as good the third time! Many have made comparisons to Disney here. Disney Studios have never had an animated story that was this good. Many have also noted that this movie is better than most non-animated films. I second and third that motion. So well loved by me that I did not hesitate to purchase it for my library---and I don't take lightly my purchases. I won't own just any film. This is truly a cut way above.

Some movies have 5-10 minute parts that drag on and bore you as you wait for something to happen. Even in the timid parts of this movie you do not loose your focus on the story. The movie is not overly complex-it's easy to follow and you don't get lost. I recently saw ""Crash"" and although it is a great movie, I mixed up a few characters and didn't always understand what was happening.

The climax of the film may freak some viewers out because of how, well bizarre it is.

A lot of this film will go over well with children and the intense violence well scare them out of their seats. The girls in Iron town were rescued from the brothels and they do mention that in the film but they don't say what they did other then men bother them. The film runtime is 135 minutes; children are use to films that run for only 80-90 minutes, as the result children will have trouble following the film. Adult anime fans will love this movie unless they just watch anime for animated nudity. When Ashitaka defeats a boar that had turned into a demon he is left with a mark on his arm that will spread across his body and kill him. Ashitaka leaves his village to find the Sprit of the forest in the forest from which no man has returned. Ashitaka makes to it a town called Iron Town where they make Iron. The town is run by Lady Eboshi who wants to tame the forest to gain profit; she is destroying the forest. Lady Eboshi has very good aspects to her she did rescue women from the brothels and gave Lepers a chance to work. A relationship develops between Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolf gods and Ashitaka when Ashitaka rescues Mononoke from Iron Town. The story is struggle between good and evil but simplistic one like in the case of Disney films. Japanese films have more freedom when it comes to creating their stories since they don't have to worry about over sensitive editors. Hayao Miyazaki gives us a story about how humans, animals and nature gods constantly fight over share of emerging order. The ending isn't better then life happy like in Disney its just practical and realistic. This movie is very well directed, the story is enchanting and involving, it grabs the audience attention and never lets it go.

Though on first impressions a children's movie its characters have a depth that transcend the works of comparable Disney films and even on occasion is shockingly violent with no distaste. What really makes this film beautiful though is the intricate story interweaving with the stories of the war between the people of Iron Townand the animals, the struggle to comprehend life and death and the impossible romance of Ashitaka and San.

Ashitaka fights bravely but is touched by the beast and falls to a curse that will consume his body unless he finds the Spirit of the Forest (which is like a 100 point buck). During his travels ends up staying at a village that minds iron. Hence the name Iron Town. Ashitaka soon finds that Iron Town and the forest are at war. During his stay Princess Mononoke, her name throughout the movie is mainly San, attacks. Ashitaka breaks up the fight between M'lady (leader of Iron Town) and San. Soon Ashitaka finds himself caught up in the battle. The story is magnificent and makes for a great D&D scenario for you geeks out there (long live D&D). I have absolutely no complaints about this movie. I love the ending, which is something I'm VERY picky with. I recommend this to anyone who loves anime, adventure, and/or Record of Lodoss War.",

The visuals and ideas which were born inside of Mijazaki's head are insanely interesting and nuanced and I loved it very much because we just don't see these kinds of movies these days. I like this movie a lot, it's just I couldn't connect emotionally to the characters, that's why my rating just isn't that high. For sure it's an extremely solid movie with likable characters and beautiful visuals, but I wanted a bit more of the story, I don't know particularly what, but these movies lack something I don't know how to describe. Maybe I just have to adjust to this way of storytelling and just enjoy it more, but you know it isn't that easy and I don't want to overrate something just because it's a classic. So that's that, I finally watched it and I decided to watch some more arty films so yeah. If you read this, please comment something to this review, I'm interested.",

The animation is beautifully creative but I felt the story line was disjointed; it felt written on the spot.  Maybe some of that roughness is because of translation or cultural differences.  It definitely worked hard at resolving a LOT of conflict.,
306,11 July 2000,Dark Eye,10, Incredible Beyond Words,"Rarely I go to see a film and left the theatre stunned with such awe.  Many of the audiences even sat silently throughout the end credit with the aura of respect, and it's understandable.  It's breathtakingly beautiful, emotionally complex, and epic in scale.  I mean, this movie is just so absorbing.  Once in a lifetime, I am grateful that someone like Mr. Miyazaki fully awakened my inner child and totally had me absorbed throughout the movie with a world so rich in mythical wonder.  How many animated movies out there can make a fully grown adult fight back tears without any sentimentality?  The characters are all so down-to-earth and realistically portrayed, throw in a plot that is full of heart, and thank goodness for the top-notch dubbing done by top Hollywood actors. I can just go on ranting and raving about this movie until the cows come home.  In my opinion, it's SO good that no other animated films can ever hope to compare with Princess Mononoke.  Bottom word, it is a flawless masterpiece; a pure work of genius that deserves to be seen by many generations to come, both adults and children alike.  So see this film, because it will be one of the best ride to another world anyone could ever experience. I personally guarantee it.",

Even though he defeated the demon, he was cursed. To try and save himself, he decided to travel west, to try and lift the curse, so he wouldn't die. And that is the beginning of Hayao's biggest masterpiece, Mononoke-Hime is about. Though it also has tons of other themes as well. It's a movie with a very strong point and very solid believable characters. You will truly want to care about, what happens to them.",

309,10 November 2020,SebMoz,10, It's amazing,"Hayao Miyazaki proves himself once again as the best animated movie director with this movie, which I'll definitely put in my Top 5 animated movies list. There are basically no weak links in this movie. San and Ashitaka are both great characters with a nice amount of depth and strong moral beliefs, and their relationship progresses pretty naturally I think. The side characters are also strong, and the villain gets their usual redemption at the end, which I like. The plot starts quickly, and you're immediately introduced to the action. The pacing for the rest of the movie is equally well handled, and there is not a single scene or character that feels wasted. The animation and score are both fantastic, as per usual for a Ghibly movie, and the movie utilizes a lot of overview shots to establish the beautiful locations we visit. The environmental themes fit perfectly into the movie, it isn't shoved in our face with awkward dialogue, but rather shown subtely through striking metaphors and symbols. The worldbuilding feels dreamlike and is very enchanting, as is the case with all Miyazaki's films. The climax is satisfying and tensionfilled and the ending is heartwarming and leaves a great feeling in your heart. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with this movie, and it will remain one of my favorites for a long time.",
310,6 April 2020,Velocyus,10, Simply put Legendary,"This is truly breathtaking. Kept me focused from the beginning to the very end. Humans were terrible and should have been wiped out by the God of the Forest. Too bad Ashitaka was still focused on the humans, but after all this I bet he took Mononoke with him back to his peaceful village to be prince and princess of the Emishi clan, which in my book is CANON.
At this moment it's probably pretty late for this and they have zero interest in it, but Ghibli could continue this story with their children growing along with the cubs of the wolves, fighting for survival once again, because Jigo knew who Ashitaka was because of his red Yaku and stone arrows. He definitely told the emperor all the story including the part where the survivor of the clan he genocided prevented him to deliver the head of the Forest God. This, plus the fact that he wanted all of their clan to be annihilated makes it quite plausible he then wanted to send a small army to completely wipe them out. Lady Eboshi and the people of the ironworks could be his allies, or they could not, who knows? There's so many possibilities because Miyakaze made the story so complex. It's almost like he meant to continue it.",

312,5 March 2006,ozzyme,10, Maybe the Best Animated Film,"I have always loved animated film and cartons, but this film truly blew me away. To me this film is the animated film version equivalent of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'. The film creates a world in such detail than the viewer feels as if he/she has been there. The film is beautifully drawn from characters to backgrounds. The characters are not as simplistic as one-dimensional cartoon characters, i.e. the hero is all-good and the villain is pure evil. The two main combatants, Princess Mononoke and Lady Eboshi are shades of gray, thought personally I love the character of Lady Eboshi. The ending also is not cartoonish in that everything is not tried up into a neat little package at the end. See this picture with an open mind and hopefully you will find it as enjoyable as I did.",

324,10 June 2005,mirza241612,6, Viewer Review,"I heard about this movie when Channel 4 (in the UK) did 100 greatest cartoons. Princess Mononoke nearly made it to the top 20 (21 it reached). I watched Spirited Away first but I decided to watch one of Miyazaki's earlier works. Boy, was Spirited Away 10x better than this. Though the opening was good but at some points the film tends to get boring. The intro of Ashitaka was visually great same with all the other characters except Lady Eboshi where she was introduced straight away. The reasons that Princess Mononoke could not be televised for kids was that it had 2 'B' words & 1 'P' words. Yes, swearing. Also the part where Ashitaka lets his arrow fly to stop someone where the victim loses his arms and one where he loses his head!!! Blood & Gore to top it off. However the animation was good to watch but the story was weak. Music by Joe Hisaishi is suited at all parts of the film and well deserved music. I like the Legend of Ashitaka which is brilliantly instrumented. Off course if the film didn't have gore and swearing then this would have been a great family program but otherwise don't let your kids watch this and learn bad words. Overall- Average",

327,2 June 2018,adam-may-bower,8, Legendary,"'Princess Mononoke' is a beautifully animated and epic fantasy film by legendary Japanese filmmaker and animator Hayao Miyazaki.
This was the first film I got to view at the Celebrate Studio Ghibli film festival in Melbourne and I thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of this film.
The clear standout for the film is the breathtaking hand-drawn animation by Miyazaki. Everything from the painted forest, the Great Forest Spirit, and even the characters themselves are visually striking and shows that these films were well ahead of their time. There's a very good reason as to why Miyazaki is considered one of the best animators of this century.
The soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is everything a good soundtrack should be, with epic numbers for the action sequences and then beautiful pieces for the emotional scenes.
The storyline of this film is epic and gripping, from the very first opening scene. What made it unique though, was its underlying themes of environmentalism that were quite powerful. The characters in this film were also very complex; the villains weren't really villains and the heroes weren't really heroes. Each character, even the supporting ones, had a depth in them that is absent in too many movies these days.
However, it's in the pacing where this movie fails to be a masterpiece. There are many scenes that a very drawn-out and difficult to maintain attention. With a running time over two hours, this film definitely has it's moments that seem to drag on. The main issue with these scenes is the fact that they're not particularly part of the main storyline, so there's no real need for them to be as long as they are. Fortunately, Miyazaki redeems himself with a fantastic ending that left me in awe and overall I was very pleased with this movie.",

That's maybe because she was raised by wolves,and that humans especially one B*tch in particular has been destroying the forest and animals just so she can make iron.Anyway this movie will definitely p*ss you off,and if that was it's intent it succeeded.Oh,but the ending SUCKED.

I watched the movie a second time and ignored the subtitles, and the movie's impact was just as great. 	The film explores the theme of nature vs. technology much like many of Miyazaki's films.  There are definitely similarities between this and Nausicaa, but Mononoke Hime is much more serious and occasionally dark. Although the film does have moments of graphic violence, I would think that it would be very safe to bring an intelligent child of twelve or so.  The hero's attitudes towards violence are made very clear.  His most repeated phrase is ""calm yourself,"" usually yelled in an attempt to avoid bloodshed. ",

Hayao Miyazaki has created a true work of art in this film, and its questions will stay with you long after its viewing. Please do not dismiss its power on the basis of it being Japanese animation, long a realm merely championed of geeks and fanboys...",
359,30 November 1999,Jimmy Jimmereeno,10, It's not Disney or Pokemon,"See it while it's still in theatres!! This came out around the same time as Pokemon. Both are animated and Japanese. The similarities end there. Princess Mononoke is not a kids movie. Kids could see it if they wanted to but it's not the sachrine-sweet that disney usually churns out. This is an amazing anime film. The art is beautiful and brilliant, there were times I forgot I was looking at animation. This is a medium that allows the filmmaker to do so much more than you could with live-action. Anime is not new or anything but this is the first time I ever got to see one on the big screen. The story is about an epic battle between the animals and humans. It is so so good. See it at the theatre while you still can!",
360,5 November 2008,jeethjohnp,10, Brilliante!!!!,"I just don't have to write much because all the other reviews tell a lot about the brilliant masterpiece that is ""MONONOKE HIME"". The complexity of the story is simply too complex. The animation: breath-taking. The characters: so real. All in all this is an animation that should never be missed. I was a person who used to think that Disney was something mammoth-sized monster that could never be defeated. But after watching all the Hayao Miyazaki animations, I am simply awestruck by his imagination and his brilliance in their execution. Hats off to such a brilliant artiste!!!!! And I just hope that he won't stop with ""PONYO ON THE CLIFF BY THE SEA"". He should make many more brilliant features..........",

VERY relevant to modern days. It is different
from Mr. Hayao Miyazaki's other films and deals with nature-centred themes like mankind's war
with the forces of nature, the exploitation of
natural resources due to personal interests and greed, etc. It's totally unique and creative with good animation and background score. The characterization is properly done and the

The combination of fantastic animation, artwork, and storytelling makes this movie stand out even among other superb Ghibli classics. The story of humans vs. Nature is an old one and not very unique, but Princess Mononoke tells this tale in such an enthralling way that I can't help but adore it. The interactions between the various animal tribes, the stunning visuals as well as the gory action are just a few aspects that make Mononoke especially memorable. Speaking of gory action, you shouldn't show this film to very young children. If you have kids or young relatives, I'd say wait until they're 10 or older, then watch it with them. Although I wouldn't suggest this film for those who are squeamish.",

370,13 February 2000,Cindy-39,8, a terrifyingly mystical film,"The real miracle of Princess Mononoke is the design of the creatures. From the giant oozing demon in the beginning to the gray blind boar and the Spirit of the Forest (which looks like an antelope with a smiling human face), Miyazaki was able to tap into something very deep and provoking. The creatures are at the same time beautiful and terribly ugly. Like the race of the little white ghosts that inhabit the forest. They are some of the most achingly cute characters ever made (in fact, I saw dolls of these characters at a gift shop in Little Tokyo), but at the same time a little disturbing once you realize that their heads are like skulls and their bodies like Pillsbury Dough Boys. I found myself flinching in terror at the sight of the blind boar with blood gushing out of his eyes. On that note, I think that the violence of this movie really propels it to another level. It was the one thing that really got reactions from the audience. And I'm not talking the kind of gratuitous violence in action movies. The violence in Princess Mononoke is quite extreme, but it does so to portray the brutality of human (and animal) conflict.",

But, I stuck it out, knowing that it was acclaimed.  What a mistake.  It only got worse. The plot was stupid, the voices/sound were aweful, and the animation graphics (much raved about) were nothing better than a Disney movie.  I really like most asian movies, and anime as well.  This movie, however, really sucked.  I am completely confused at its extremely high voter rating. Don't waste your time.  I'm still bitter that I did.",

(with the exeption of Ranma 1/2 and Dominion Tank Police) The more recent Miyazaki releases have been considerably butchered. How should I say it....this movie encompassed all of the emotion, and sublime beauty of Nausicaa and Tonari no Totoro!! The scenery is lush with detail. The animation is astounding. And the acting was suprisingly good. If you're worried about seeing an english dubbed anime and are waiting for the dvd, please see this on the big screen before it's too late!

The story is also far more complicated than anything American animation has imagined, illustrating the true nature of conflict and its resolution better than any of them.  It also features a truly great character in Eboshi, whose motives aren't as black and white as western animation might have made it.  ",

The characters can be a little bland at times but WHO CARES the whole setting and dynamics are so incredibly fascinating and the moral grayness of the factory town is so engaging and cool and it is such timeless subject matter. Visually it is absolutely bonkers and blends history and fantasy/folklore seamlessly. The designs for everything are marvelous WOWOWOW <3 It is an INCREDIBLE epic take but also very emotional and really instills such indescribable emotions.

383,20 July 2013,LLinus,7, Blessed with a curse,"The story was well built, i felt like it had a good purpose. It was about strength, peace, war and love for other creatures and as well hate. The main character has a goal and a journey in front of him and we get to witness the obstacles he faces throughout the path. The main character is a brave and honest young man, who is struggling to keep his strength up most of the time, but is burden by his curse. As we progress further in to the movie you come to realize the rivalry between the different kinds of races we witness, they just won't get along. But still this movie had these moment of greatness were you felt an big urge to pay even more attention to it and you forget how uncomfortable you lie in your bed. There are a few fight scenes that i thought were very well done, it was these sound effects other than the usual that made it spark a bit (not literally) and the fight were not too long or made you bored in any way. The music had a bit classic feeling, or kind of typical music in movies made by Asians, don't get me wrong i loved it, they made the music match well in to the movie. Of all the anime/Manga iv watched one thing always catch my interest is that the animation and sound effects is always astonishing, in one way i really can't explain so good, the voices don't fit it but it still works well, I'm not sure why.

This seemed to be reinforced by the dialogue that sounded too contemporary. To me, this is a strong case against dubbed movies. I also didn't realize until after I read some other comments that the spirit of the story was better served by the English (not hearing impaired) captions. I had tried to watch part of the movie with those but it was too distracting that the spoken & written didn't match - a problem I don't have when the spoken language is not English.

391,5 June 2021,LadyKanerasoka,10, Miyazaki's Absolute Best Work,"I've been wanting to see this film for many years after hearing that numerous elements in this film served as the inspiration for other numerous elements in Star Wars, particularly the famous character Ahsoka Tano from the animated series and The Mandalorian and the Loth-wolves in the final season of Star Wars Rebels. But when I finally saw this film through HBO Max, I was TOTALLY unprepared for just how epic and extraordinary this film was. This film covers over the endless issue of mankind struggling to get along with nature, but is presented in a way that will DEFINITELY make you think twice before littering or doing something disrespectful to a nearby forest. Not only that, it takes hand-drawn animation to a WHOLE new level. The backgrounds and environments, even for an animated film, are absolutely beautiful and breathtaking, especially if you're a nature lover. Many of the forest spirits presented in the film are based on actual Japanese mythology (you can look it up through videos on YouTube). The English dub has a great all-star cast including Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith, John DiMaggio, and more. It's also one of the longest films in the Studio Ghibli collection, so be sure to find a good pausing point. Also, since it's the ONLY Studio Ghibli film that is rated PG-13, you better think twice before letting young kids watch it. There's an EXTENSIVE amount of animated blood, and some scenes presenting it are pretty disturbing (even for me, a 29-year-old woman). There's also quite a lot of violence involving samurai techniques, using cannons and guns at the heroes, and in the battle scenes numerous characters on both sides are dismembered and even beheaded, but they're not presented in a terribly gruesome way, otherwise the film would've been rated R. But like I said, I'd advise extreme caution when it comes to letting kids watch it. Other than that, it's an absolute work of art that will take your breath away and keep your eyes glued to the screen. An absolute must watch!",

415,4 August 2011,LordDynamo,8, Powerful and magical!,"Princess Mononoke was the first, Studio Ghibli film I have seen, and I saw it before it was dubbed into English! It suffices to say that I was ENTHRALLED! It was after watching this that Hayao Miyazaki, the director of Studio Ghibli, has become my favourite director and Princess Mononoke has become one of my top favourite films. The film tells of young Prince Ashitaka and his epic quest to find a cure for a wound made by a demon which has bitten him. During his journey, he finds himself in the midst of a war between humans and gods (in animal form). Fighting alongside the Wolf tribe is a warrior girl called San, also known as Mononoke-Hime. In my opinion, this film is better even than Disney classics, it has more magic and imagination. You really feel as though you're in the imaginary world that the story is set in. What's more, there is no actual villain in the film. The supposed antagonist is Lady Eboshi, given that she is doing the most damage to the forest, though she accepts lepers and even apologizes for Ashtitaka's wound. That's the beauty of Miyazaki's films, it isn't the usual ""good vs evil"" story where the villain is completely bad and gets killed in the end. Additionally, this film gives a message: care for nature and the environment! I feel Miyazaki has portrayed the destruction of nature brilliantly! I don't think the message could have been given in a better way. As a conclusion: I highly recommend this film. It is a marvel to watch, with the type of magical sensation found in a book! Watch it! You will not regret it.",

The animation, as with all of Miyazaki's films, is simply superb; the way that these drawings portray every aspect of nature is just breathtaking. An excellent feature of the storyline, I believe, is that there is no one character that represents evil; Lady Eboshi seeks to destroy the forest, but only because she thinks it will save her people; Jigo may be greedy and seeks glory, but not to deliberately hurt others. The environmental/social commentary throughout (particularly invention vs. nature) gives the story a depth that is almost non-existent in modern animated films. Overall, a truly great movie.",

418,28 October 2000,laserwiz,10, Another reason to watch anime!,"""Princess Mononoke"" is among one of the best examples of prime Japanese Anime.  Along with ""Macross Plus"", I hold ""Princess Mononoke"" as one of the best of all animated films ever produced, period.  For those who think this movie is another ""Pokemon"", go rent and watch this movie!  ""Princess Mononoke"" is an excellent example of the exotic beauty of the art of Japanese animation.  Not for the kids, though, as the films' storyline has some mature dramatic elements.  Hopefully, this movie is an indication of where anime will be going in the country I live in.  Anime should be released in theatres all over the country and all over the world, and I think that ""Princess Mononoke"" will be the catalyst for this realisation.

I don't dislike Japan. I don't dislike any of the voice overs. I don't think I had ever heard of it until I saw it in the top 250 list the other day. I thought it was going to be mind blowing given all the accolades and rating. In the great words of Ron White: ""I was wrong!"". It was the most pathetically average thing ever. Boooring story. Waay to long. Average animation. It has all the stereotypical characters one would expect to find in a much older American cartoon making fun of Japanese stories... right down to Japanese sambo. Completely predictable. Not something you'd want your kids to see, and something your adult friends would scoff at. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. A 30 minute Family Guy remake would put this to shame. I would have given it a 3; but feel it is my civic duty to make the rating less misleading.",

It is an interesting movie which offers much tensity through its story progression but doesn't lack relaxing moments either, thanks to its beautiful landscapes and music. Miyazaki, once again, doesn't cease to surprise with his detailed characterization. The story itself is, compared to Spirited Away, very easy to follow, as it doesn't contain so much symbolism and is interesting to watch all the way.

Combining all of these features turns this movie into a Classic hit that will forever go down in the Anime books as a masterpiece.",

It's story in very compelling in emphasizing on human nature. Each character had a clear goal and motive in their lives. It was clear that each character was true to their nature; even down to Toki, worker of the bellows in Irontown and husband to Kohroku. Most of the action scenes were animated so fluidly. It's always amazing to see the amount of detail incorporated into every character's gestures and movements. You never know what will happen next, from beginning to end. If I was to quickly jump from the first 15 minutes to the last 30 minutes, I'd think that I'm watching a completely different movie. The creativity involved in the story's setting still gets to me. Unlike most of Hayao Miyazaki's other films, this film certainly keeps to a more serious and darker tone which suites the subject but we still get that classic Miyazaki style with the Kodamas and the Forest Spirit. This will forever be one of Hayao Miyazaki's greatest films and should continue to be screened till the ends of time as it offers entertaining joy and very relevant subject matter.",

Far more complex and real than Disney outings, it is definitely not for kids younger than, say, nine or ten. For the rest of us, this film affords a rare look into Japanese culture and sensibility.

In comparison to many animated motion pictures this movie contains violent scenes. Although, these scenes are partnered with the voice of nonviolence and its aim is to achieve peace through understanding each other's perspective.

I perfectly agree with whoever it was that said that it does not do the movie justice to describe it in words. You really have to see it to experience it. Aside form the phenomenal animation (equal if not better than Tarzan), amazing action sequences, the plot is just so amazing. I didn't even try to analyze it, I just absorbed the movie's message instinctively, and I cried during the scene where San fed Ashitaka (I almost never cry during movies). In many ways this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, certainly the best anime film I've ever seen. I seriously wish I knew Japanese, because I also got a feeling that they tuned down the dialog in the English version. The music was also great, especially the theme, very haunting but peaceful score. For me the movie was just incredibly emotional, I cried during the movie, and I cried after the movie.

The characters looked childish, stiff and jittery most of the time. From the limited ones I have seen they were quirky and too much ""in your face"". But Princess Mononoke, WOW! I was channel surfing and saw it on the Cartoon Network and I could not stop watching it. I even kept bugging my wife (NOT a cartoon fan) saying, ""Honey, you have to see this, just watch a little more!"" even when she was trying to make dinner. I won't take the time to repeat what others have said about this film (yes, I said film, not cartoon) but please read them as they are all very accurate. What I want to add is the ""feel"" of this movie. It takes its time very well. There are pauses that are very natural to human beings which allow you to feel the essence of the story. And the mystical moments of the film, and there are many, made you ""feel"" what the characters felt. It was purely enjoyable. The closest movie I can relate it too was the feel of some of the eerie yet mesmerizing moments in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It has that tempo, that timing of a good Spielberg movie. I don't know how Miyazake did it. Nothing was rushed but it didn't feel slow, it felt perfectly timed. Well, that's all I wanted to add. Again, I agree with all of the reviews I read, even the criticisms of voice choices. Enjoy this movie!",

And a glorious purpose at that. Though slightly violent, Princess Mononoke teaches a valuable lesson to all children who watch it, and should be placed on a pedestal with other films like Requiem for a Dream. While some may scoff that films can't teach life lessons, Princess Mononoke stands out with its healthy, wholesome, and beautifully crafted message to our next generation. However, while the message deserves to be heard by all, and should be required viewing at schools, the film still has some imperfections. Though I am not usually a stickler, the love aspect and lack of solid good/evil is both a strength and a weakness. Too many decisions are left unexplained, and too many characters experience too many changes too fast. Regardless of its faults, Princess Mononoke is a beautifully constructed film, and should be required to be shown to all children.",

456,1 February 2000,deepcheck,10," a fantastic ride, Miyazaki's best to date","Miyazaki has had a long history of amazingly deep and thought-provoking movies with, nonetheless, very simple themes.  ""Tonari no Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" are prime examples.  His characters are often tastefully understated and normal human beings, in terms of their character. Unlike the typical US-ported anime movie, Miyazaki's films contain none of the stereotypes of anime, such as the big-breasted, small-brained woman, the enormous weapons, and the bad guys who are always Americans.  Instead, his films are dignified by the relentless observation to the rich detail of the animation and fullness of the soundtrack. ""Mononoke Hime"" is no exception.  Or rather, it is the exception in that it surpasses entirely all of Miyazaki's movies to become his finest.  The animation, the music, and the voice-acting were all masterfully done.  Even the American-dubbed version was very well adapted.  The plot was convoluted in content but simple in nature, which successfully emphasized the individuality of each of the major characters. This is the movie to see, however you see it.  I've always judged a movie by whether I could forget I was watching a movie and let myself fall into the story.  With Mononoke Hime, I fell in by the end of the first five minutes.",

461,17 February 2003,delta3002,10, Touching,"(May contain spoilers) This is not one of your typical cartoons. This is a movie about a young man named Ashitaka. In the early parts of the movie a demon boar attacks his village. He fights off the demon but is touched by it causing him to have a curse. He finds that the curse will spread like a disease and kill him. At the same time the curse gives him superhuman strength and agility. (Shown by him pushing open a huge door, that would take ten men to open normally, Inspite of a bullet wound) He tries to find a way to cure himself or at least do some good before he dies. Now that is one of the plots. The others include a man looking for a God's head in order to gain eternal life, a woman running an iron making town who is constantly being opposed by other men and the very forces of nature, and a girl raised by a wolf god who tries to protect the forest from the miners. Put Ashitaka in the middle to try and make peace and you've got one of the most excellent animated films ever made. Although the fantasy and bloody violence the movie has a background message that everyone deserves to live no matter how intent they are on destroying their antagonists. The film has an excellent score, incredible animation (especially considering the scenery), very rounded characters, and a wonderful theme to top it off. The only part that is disappointing is the dialogue in the last few minutes of the film is cheesy. Inspite of the small flaw near the end i give this movie an 8.5 /10.",

The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to coneal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan.  Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however.  For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener.

It explores how humanity's seemingly harmless sins, greed most prominent among them, can snowball into atrocious acts of shockingly great magnitudes.  I advise anyone and everyone to see this.

""Mononoke"" is a visually-impressive film, with smooth animation, superb attention to lifelike movement and detail, and sympathetic characters who are never reduced to chest-beating heroes or cackling villains, but three-dimensional people with both good and bad qualities and believable motivations.  Like much of Miyazaki's better-known works, it's an engaging story about Man's struggle against Nature, with a poignant message that shines through the plot rather than becoming preachy.  This movie has all the technical excellence of movies such as ""Akira"" and ""Ghost In The Shell,"" but also has the soul that those two movies lack.  While the original Japanese-language version is excellent on its own, the English dub is one of the best treatments I've heard in translated anime.  All of the big-name voice actors do wonderful jobs - even Billy Bob Thornton's rendition of the monk, while completely different from the tone of the original Japanese casting, is well-done and fitting for the character.  This is a movie to own on DVD; it deserves the best treatment!",

I expected a more western plot line considering Disney was involved.  It was not.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  But the story was strange.  No more stranger than any other anime but still strange.  The art was pretty, but the four part Macross Plus series is still the best animated Japanese toon I have seen to date.  I liked Mononoke, but didn't think it was a wonderful movie.  The story was a bit lacking, and and the art work was not what everyone is making it out to be.  I have seen better.  I did find it funny though that Disney doesn't want to associate themselves with this cartoon here in America.  Apparently they are afraid it will hurt their image.

Frankly, I'll choose the latter viewpoint, as I find most anime to be petty, and meaninglessly cerebral. Hayao Miyazaki has truly inherited Disney's talent with the art of animated film, but his style is his own, and his technique, different, but just as good as the deceased master. Mononoke Hime stands not only as a masterpiece of animation, but a masterpiece of Japanese film...a grand, enticing epic which does its own thing, standing up to the epic films of Kurosawa and David Lean. This goes beyond simple anime, and tells a simple story with mind-blowing, beautiful technique. The only anime that tops it is Grave of the Fireflies, Isao Takahata's masterpiece...the only anime I'd consider in my Top Five of Japanese cinema (Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Sansho the Bailiff, Tokyo Story, Rashomon).",

Although this is not Miazakis best movie (comes close, beaten by spirited away and castle in the sky, just above totoro, and soars above kiki, which i didnt like) it is still quite good. It is well paced, and the music is pretty good, though compared to laputa, it falls on it's face. Some people say that the plot is complex, but whats so complex? I mean, some guy goes out of the village after getting cursed by a boar to look for a cure from the forest spirit, and gets caught in this war between the forest gods and the humans. Ooohh, it's too complex. That cleared out, it's a very nice movie, with a powerful message to the world.

The story develops slowly, and I find the movie mildly depressing, but there is nothing that seriously detracts from the experience.

517,7 April 2011,bfprower,10, A Masterpiece of Animation,"Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's equivalent of Walt Disney, has given us some of the best animated films in history; including Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Princess Mononoke, in my opinion, is his finest creation. Princess Mononoke centers around the young and noble hearted Ashitaka, whom after being cursed by a demon, must journey to the sacred forest to be exorcised before the curse ultimately destroys him. On his journey, he encounters several forest spirits, a group of iron workers, and a mysterious girl raised by the forest's wolves. The story focuses on the constant clash of man and nature, and how both must make sacrifices in order to coexist. There are no heroes, and no villains. All shareholders have motivations that can be sympathized with, and some that cannot. The story is deep, compelling and flows very well. I will admit at times it can become moderately confusing, especially when elements of mysticism are introduced. However it's presented so well, I feel that the confusion is my fault, not the film's;. It's as if my insufficient mind isn't capable of grasping the magnitude of the plot. The characters: human, animal and otherwise are all well developed, multi-layered and interesting. The animation is the Miyazaki standard: very bright, very vibrant and always carrying energy and emotion. The action scenes are some of the best in all of animation and the entire film carries with it a sense of awe and wonder. The film even manages to take several actions that we would otherwise consider disgusting, and make them appear beautiful. The music corresponds to the scenes perfectly and moves the story almost as much the animation and dialogue. I recommend you watch the film in Japanese as the English dub is very good in places, but downright annoying in others. Once I realized that Toki was voiced by Jada Smith, I switched over to the subtitles. But watching the film in English won't take much from the experience. I could praise the film for hours and it's truly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's gripping, creative, intelligent and correctly delivers one of the most difficult to execute themes in all of film. Absolutely watch Princess Mononoke.",

It's a story about love, loss, and most of all, being alive!

The film is set in medieval Japan and tells the story of a young prince who kills a doomed boar and is know doomed himself. So he goes to an old forest in which the god of the forest lives, so the god can save him. But there is a war between nature and mankind with his technology and machines. Of course he has to join in and gets to know princess Mononoke. But if you think this is only a lame ""save the nature"" flick, you are wrong. No one in this movie is entirely good or bad, even the ""bad lady"" has her reasons and also are the ""good ones"" sometimes really selfish. Although they are all likable. And this is the point of the movie: You always have to find a compromise before it is too late.

I look forward to watching it in the original language on DVD.  The pace of the film is rather slow and repeated viewings is a must if you really desire to appreciate all that the movie has to offer.  In my opinion, it's not for the kiddies as the gore and blood may be too much for them.  Don't let the cover of the dvd fool you. I wouldn't call it ""Star Wars"" of animated features.  It may be ""Star Wars"" because some consider this film the best of animation.  I would consider it good, not great.  I only gave it a 6 out of 10.  See it for yourself and judge for yourself.

I had liked a couple forms of anime before hand, but was never totally interested in the subject until I saw the Princess Mononoke.  After that, I dropped all the anime I had liked before.  This movie is nothing like what Americans classify as anime. The movie isn't choppy, loaded with neon colors, and doesn't involve weird hybrid midget animals or gigantic robots (sorry guys, but Pokemon and all those kiddie shows ruined Japanese animation's rep).  Instead it involves a piece of history, and true-to-life characters that nearly everyone can relate to.  What interested me was that there were no black-and-white characters involved with the story: no truly evil or good people, unlike the popular Disney movies over here in the states.  And the characters don't break out in song every five minutes either.  On the contrary, this is a very serious film (something like ages 11 and up), and it isn't one of those stories where the most evil people on Earth are mowing through the forest of the cuddly, dewy-eyed animals.",

The animation is an amazing, the music is beautiful, the characters are very interesting, but the story is by far the best feature of this film. I won't give anything away, because I just wouldn't be able to do it justice. It does deal with a lot of Japanese mythology, and that might turn some people off, but it didn't bother me, or take anything away from the movie. It's also a bit violent, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children. Another great aspect of this movie is that they got the voice's perfect.

His movies hold sentimental value to those who watch them, highlighting inspiring concepts and issues of the world. Princess Mononoke is a magnificent fantasy tale of the ever battling dynamic between nature and industrialisation, man vs man, and man vs self; packed with spiritual ideas, demons, Gods, and curses. The main protagonist (Ashitaka) Is a prince who fights for neither side, only for the greater good. To him there is no evil, both sides fight for what's right for themselves, and fit together to create this world. This is the traditional idea of Ying and Yang; the good and the evil come hand in hand. There is a certain quote which resonates with me; ""To see with eyes unclouded by hate"" which I'll let you decipher yourself. To round off, this film has beautiful illustrations, a strong and inspiring message, and characters to entertain every aspect of your attention. Worth more than just a watch; worth being your favourite too.",
531,16 April 2000,Charlie_Waters,10, Superb,"I have never been a fan of anime.  I have friends who are really into it, but I just could never see the attraction.  So when this film played on my campus this weekend, I went only because it was something to do on a slow day.  I was blown away (and went back to see it again the next day).  The animation is incredible.  The voice acting is well done.  The story is beautiful, brutal, and brilliant.  It was a joy, after all these years of American cartoons to see talking animals portrayed in such a natural, non-comic relief way.  The characters were all very human and ambiguous, very shades of grey.  You could feel for all of them (even the nature-killing Lady Eboshi) at times during the movie.  I have never seen a better piece of animation, and have very rarely seen a better film.  My eternal thanks to Miyazaki for creating this, and to studio Ghobi, for making sure that it wasn't torn apart by Disney to fit ""traditional American"" tastes.  See this as soon as possible (video release June 13th), you will not regret it.",

533,28 August 2001,hrwoodruff,10, Best Animated Film Ever,"I have always loved animated film and cartons, but this film truly blew me away.  To me this film is the animated film version equivalent of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'.  The film creates a world in such detail than the viewer feels as if he/she has been there.  The film is beautifully drawn from characters to backgrounds.  The characters are not as simplistic as one-dimensional cartoon characters, i.e. the hero is all-good and the villain is pure evil.  The two main combatants, Princess Mononoke and Lady Eboshi are shades of gray, thought personally I love the character of Lady Eboshi.  The ending also is not cartoonish in that everything is not tried up into a neat little package at the end.  See this picture with an open mind and hopefully you will find it as enjoyable as I did.",

When I told a guy that owns the local anime store I disliked it, he looked at me like I was spewing sacrilegious statements in a holy place or something. :D lol, I still love anime, but I won't bend my opinion just to make it match what experts and fans say. zzzZZZZZZzzzzz it's a total sleeper! You want pretty with good plot? Watch Mushi-Shi. And, uh, for you ""purists"" who like the American cast, Why are you not watching with subtitles?

There was not one part I didn't understand.

One of the best in this genre, Akira, has tons of 'huh's. Come on, It gets really annoying after a while. I sometimes wonder if it's actually translated, for all we know it could be something else. And that is where Mononoke surpasses other 'animes.' The dubbing is qued, it's meaningful. I really couldn't care less who did the voices, but the dubbing was done well, making it seem like I wasn't watching an Americanized version of a Japanese movie, but I was watching an American movie.

The cartoon series broke the classic notions about the characters of famous monsters and was a kind of satire on our troubled world.

I don't know if ""silence"" is shown in any other movie,like it is shown in that ancient wood. Watching the film, you f e e l this silence. - I also liked the details - the plants, for example! Or the stones getting wet when the rain starts to fall. It is one of those few movies which can change the people who watch it. You can enjoy being in a wood in a new way, after watching this film. - By the way - The ""Emishi""- people really existed, and they were not the ""Ainu"". I heard, they lived in Hokkaido, too.

564,23 May 2011,larsson-879-705964,8, Impressiv but Flawed,I love Hayao Miyazaki and this movie stand well together with his other works. The films environmental commentary is subtle but very effective. the story is rich on unexpected turns & twists that keeps your intress awake. The character animation is great & many of the backgrounds are beautifully animated. The film is also not afraid to break the usual movie clichés to be more dramatic & original. As for flawes. I found Ashitaka to be a rather uninteresting protagonist (nothing more than a stereotypical hero). Some scenes are also less visually impressive than others. The thing I love most about this movie is that non of the characters are truly evil but has reason to do what other characters call evil.,

The characters are very well formed; I love that nobody's perfect here. Everybody is overwhelmed by their emotions at least once. The dubbing is good too, and in a way you can relate to all the characters, even the ones who aren't desirable to be. The ""evil"" Eboshi isn't that much evil as she just doesn't realize what she is doing, and San is only trying to find her place. The quotes are memorable, as well as the strong themes that exist here. I am telling you, I have seen people in shock of the beauty and color of the morals in this movie. It will just astound you.

The towns and villages are filthy, hazardous places, while the forests are clean, fresh and beautiful. Everything is a treat to the eye. The dialog is great. The story is original. I enjoyed it very much, and it remains one of my all-time favorites.

Anywhoo for those who don't know what the heck I'm talking about I'm mean how Miyazaki always focuses on saving nature or how people are destroying nature and forests. (See Grave of the Fire Flies to really get me) If you like a Miyazaki movie that has good action and a sort of romance this is your movie. I give it an 8.5 of 10.

Sure, I had problems with some of the voices, and humor was a little overemphasized, but it could have been a lot worse. I thought Minnie Driver as Eboshi was the only voice that really fit. Ashitaka and San came across as timid at times, lacking in intensity. Jigo's twang actually worked for the most part, with the exception of some out of place one-liners.  I'm very glad the fantastic soundtrack was kept, although two songs were redone in English.  The bgm played during the first fight with the tatarigami was oddly muted in the English dub, detracting from urgency of the scene, which was important to set the pace for the remainder of the film.  But despite minor quirks I still loved it. Mononoke Hime on the big screen is a wonder to behold.

The first time I saw it, I saw it in Japanese without someone to translate, and the art kept my attention.  The colors are amazing, but even more amazing is the attention to detail.  It is not too often that background animations are done, and even less often complex background animation.  And I've never seen many workers all completely animated in full detail in the background for a few minutes like I did in this movie.  This was the amazing part to me. Perhaps Miyazake's best film so far, it definitely lives up to his name. Not only is the art amazing, but the plot is as good as mythical creature plots come.

Go to the one theater in 100 miles showing it and show them you support theatrical anime in the US! The only bad thing that can be said about this movie is that Miramax is doing a horrible marketing job. ONE theater in the Washington DC area? Is that a sad joke? See this now!

It's one of two major reasons why this film is so great.  The other reason is simply the animation in itself.  The Layouts, backgrounds, motions, and characters of this animation is so beautifully made, I could watch it all day.  As many of my friends would know, I don't give ""10"" rating to just any film.

620,11 November 2011,pjjeppson993,10," A mature, intelligent animated film","Hayao Miyazaki (sorry if i spelt the name wrong) is a master film maker. I was first introduced to him through a Cartoon Network airing of 'Howl's Moving Chastle'. I loved the magic of the film and wanted to share it with everyone I knew. My mom in particular enjoyed its whimsical and fantastical world. Although it was made in Japan it felt like it equally garnered to the western audience. Yesterday I bought 'Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime')' and was brought back to a world of fantasy. The film starts out with Ashitaka defending his village from a possessed boar. He ends being struck by the demon and receives a curse on his arm. He then starts a travel to the west to find a cure and hopefully retain his life. Along the way he encounters many interesting and complex characters. I say complex because no one is really evil (or good for that matter) in this movie. When you look at it from the character's perspective they all want something that they deem is correct. The story deals with many themes such as enviormentalism, spirituality, and even what makes your identity. The art here is top of the line. When you watch this movie you feel like you've been in the mind of a genius (and you would be correct with that assumption). The animation is smooth and expressive throughout. The visuals for the spirit of the forest are immaculate. The English dub is hailed as one of the best ever done with Billy Bob Thortan, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, and Claire Danes. Billy Crudup in particular gave the performance a nice touch. The score is also excellent. I'm under the impression that score is the most important facet of a motion picture and it doesn't disappoint. 'Journey to the West' the main theme of the picture is very well done and will literally take your breath away when you hear it for the first time. For those with kids you may want to preview it first before you let children under the age of eleven or so watch. It is quite gory at times. But if your progeny are mature enough to watch this film please give them the gift of seeing what animation is capable of. This movie has a fair chance of putting 'Ben-Hur' at number two on my list.",

It is a complex story to sum up in a paragraph, but let's just say that it strongly parallels Japaneese mythology. It is a story involving an epic struggle between the gods (animals) of the forest and the humans who are encroaching on their territory. There is no easy answers in this movie and the question - ""Where does man fit in the grand scheme of things on this planet?"" comes to mind on several occasions. A terrific movie with a terrific message. Long viewing time (around 2hr 20 min) so not for kids, but high schoolers and up should be quite enthralled.",

It's outstanding both in animation and story and has soul and meaning in it, with great soundtrack. I'm a little sad when think of it, because it brings childhood memories. It has so special meaning for me, my life wouldn't be the same without this movie. Thanks to Miyazaki for masterpiece, there is no thing more powerful than this, I can't describe what meaning it has for me.",
626,1 December 2014,TheBitingMovieJunkie,10, A great masterpiece for The Master,"This film is a project that comes from far away. Designed by Miyazaki already at the end of the Seventies, he prefer to it the also wonderful The Castle in the Sky. It returns in his hands at the beginning of the Nineties and he decides to make it, also facing a period of writer's block caused by too many similarities to films released in the twenty years in the middle, finally he decides to give the story an almost mythological cut, while inserted in a historical setting. Miyazaki starts the production, for the most part of it in traditional 2D animation with computer use in only two occasions: for five minutes of scenes particularly complex and 10% in the making of the color, the rest is all strictly made by hand. The Master has approved personally each of the 144,000 frames in the film, as well as he made the storyboard and the character design. Therefore from this great job it follows an impressive fantastic tale, one of the most ambitious works of the director, of strong moral rigor, that touches all of his big issues, all dear and always present in his filmography, lowered into the fascinating backdrop of medieval Japan (The Muromachi Period, ranging from 1336 to 1573 approximately). The film features the usual magical and indescribable aura that hovers over every work of The Master of Japan animation, capable like no one else to excite with a genre unfairly undervalued and often mistreated. Focuses on the struggle between humans and spirits of the forest, is the symbolic fantastic expression through which to pass a wanted ecologist message, so fundamental in every works of Miyazaki, in a fairy tale instructive, not boring or verbose despite the length, strongly influenced by Shintoism. The message, however, is not its only strength, as always also the backgrounds are of an unparalleled beauty, the characters have complex and multifaceted personality, there is no clear distinction between good and evil, the one is reflected in the other and vice versa, no one is innocent, nor among humans or among animals. All are fighting for a cause, right or wrong. Everyone has weaknesses. Are vital characters, some of the most beautiful characters in the filmography of Miyazaki. And the film is a very wonderful masterpiece for the animation, but for the cinema in general.",

635,28 November 1999,823543,10," Alas, a movie of higher quality than can sell to Americans.","The film that I most anticipated this year was Star Wars- Episode I. As some of you may have noticed, that movie was intensely disappointing. Perhaps Lucas got greedy, but I was turned off of movies for a time, until I learned that the best movies are frequently not made by big Hollywood studios. Do animated films from Disney seem simplistic? There's the strong, individual protagonist; the totally vilified enemy; the small, cute, funny sidekick; and the formulaic plot; not to mention the irritating versions of the songs that you will never avoid for the rest of the year. Or, do the romantic comedies leave you embarrassed for the characters and annoyed at the writers? Do action films leave you disgusted at the glorified violence? Predictability is a staple of big studio American films, and personally, I am no longer surprised that my two favorite movies this year came from overseas, Lola Rennt from Germany, and Mononoke Hime from Japan. We begin with a spectacular blend of detail and simplicity in the animation style, and we are drawn into the film with a village attacked by a demon, defeated at a cost for our hero, who is sent to find the evil's source-- and then good and evil fade in to shades of grey that are rarely seen in American films. Characters have too many dimensions for our country's movie viewers, and we are disturbed by the frustratingly unpredictable sequence of events. And yet one scene seems to follow naturally from the last. Virtually every aspect of the movie was astonishing, and almost all of those were pleasantly so. If only Hollywood would give us some credit.",

It was a piece, out of a saga that had been going on for years before, and will continue on for years to come.  The characters were wonderful, and they took your emotions on a rollercoaster from excitement, to sadness, and deep feeling.

641,21 December 1999,A2Louie,10, An amazing movie,"Normally, when someone recommends an anime film to me, I'm a bit leery. After all, there are a lot of anime fans out there who LOVE the style, and will tell me to see films which, honestly, are pretty mediocre.  Add on to that the fact that Mononoke was dubbed, not subtitled, and I was a little bit sceptical. Well, this movie blew my mind.  To call it anime, I feel, demeans it in a way.  Many films may be great anime without being great art.  This was both. Visually, it was stunning, and for once the dubbing was not a liability. When a foreign film is badly dubbed (or badly subtitled, for that matter), it distracts me from many good qualities, and I have to temper my praise for the movie.  The voice actors here were truly quality, and it showed.  I thought that they all did well for themselves, and made the movie a bit more comfortable for me, an english speaker, than had Japanese voices alone been offered. To address plot, I felt that this was where the movie shone.  The film portrayed many characters in many lights... just when you want to hate someone, they have a noble side that brings you up short.  I was initially let down by where the movie went, but upon seeing it again, love it even more.  For me, one of the best aspects of this movie was its feminist quality, something not exactly common in medieval Japan.  If you haven't seen Princess Mononoke, do yourself a favor and make it a point to do so.",

Comparing this movie to some of the other masterpiece that Miyazaki has made it s in my opinion THE absolute best. In the beginning Miyazaki had made the story of a young girl that was forced to marry the wolf god (thus become the Mononoke Hime) as a children's book, but it was rejected at the publisher (a few copies still exists). Later on he used the story as a follow up to Nausicaä (the manga is probably the best ever written), a story about human courage and the pollution of the earth. Most of the production crew of this movie was volunteers working for nothing, and when you know Miyazaki, you understand why. Over all a really great film with beautiful scenery and music, great character designs and high powered action.",

The animation is of the highest quality and the characters and locations are rendered with stunning beauty.

650,9 September 2000,luzvision,10, The willpower.,"I´m actually in love with this picture, and when a movie awakes a very strong feeling, like this one does to me, it´s hard to explain. But certanly one of the main things is the will of the caracters. Fight without doubt, face the enemy looking right to his eyes, and look inside hiding nothing to yourself. The duty is there to be follow, but not as simple as that, in this movie, you can undrestand the enemy like you´v never done before, and when you do this, How to follow fighting? How to choose a path and go throug?. And I´m very sorry if this comments are a bit bouring, but I´m not a poet, and that is what ""Mononoke Hime"" is all about, the battel, the way, the powers of nature, the magic and the love.",

If anyone has ever played ""Jade Cocoon"" for PSX you'd have an idea of what the environment is like in this movie. Very ""ancient Japanese"" in the ways that the people dress, and how they fight. I was suprised that MIRAMAX/Disney included the Japanese dub in 5.1 Dolby as well as English and French. I'm glad Disney took the extra effort to do that. Thats about all I have to say, if you haven't seen it, its worth a rental at the VERY LEAST, but you'd probably buy it anyways.",

My friends are big anime fans and they have always said that I should watch stuff like ""JoJo's"" and ""Your Name."" and others as well. But after seeing some of their recommendations, I found that Studio Ghibli really has the best material out there. And out of all the ones I've seen, this one's the one which I've liked the most. It really is a great story and experience from the characters, the way the movie explores and shows us different perspectives and means of one big issue, the cinematography and animation itself, the great soundtrack and the way they perfectly utilized it throughout the movie, etc. My only issues are in the end and it's mainly a character's change which felt a bit cheesy and rushed or unsatisfactory. But other than that, this is a true masterpiece in my opinion (and I feel like people agree). So 9/10.",

This is definitely one of studio ghiblis more violent movies, but this balances perfectly with the story line.

So i decided to buy the DVD when it came out. WOW nothing could prepare me for realising just how good this film was, this was my first Hayao Miyazaki film. Boy have i been missing the mother load of anime. The first thing i will say about princess mononoke because i like it so much is the best music i have ever heard in a anime, forget that ANY film live or animated i have ever heard in princess mononoke. Joe Hisagi (spelled wrong) is amazing i love Japanese composers. The next thing is the amazing attention to detail in the animation, the only other time i have seen this much detail was in Akira. But i reckon this is better than Akira mainly because it has more moral meaning than Akira. I think is good with professional actors doing the voices.",
671,20 October 2008,grace_carroll,10, Its so good,"This film is good simply because it is one of the only film that lives up to the grandiose it carries itself with. What i mean by this is that there are so many big budget action Hollywood films that pretend that they are more influential and better made then they are. Which use ""clever"" camera shots stolen from a much better movie and in which the main character holds an intensely false serious look on his/her face throughout the entire movie. I can't name any specifically, but everyone knows the ones i mean, they churn out about five a year and they're fine, if you like that sort of thing. Me personally, in the cinema when the main cop American guy says something like ""you're stepping way out of line there man"" i can't help but scoff and think ""calm down,for gods sake this is such an average three star movie, why you getting in such a huff?"". I can't take them seriously, i prefer my cheeky little romps were not much happens but there is plenty of jokes and soul searching and tings. The ones that offers themselves to you with a shrug and say ""here dude i made this movie, it's kind of cool"" and don't try to suggest they will change your life or deeply move you. ",

I think that Asitaka is the person who is strong mentally. This movie made me think about environmental. The human being must take good care of nature. The voice of the voice actor matches a movie very much, too. I want various people to watch this movie. I want you to watch other works of Ghibli. Hyao Miyazaki is a genius.

674,28 May 2003,wishmastr,10," Terrific, Among the best of its kind.","The first thing that struck me was the amount of violence, although i was prepared to see quite a lot of just this seeing as this is an anime movie. But disregarding the violence (and not seeing the dubbed version *shudder*) the movie was to me exciting from the very beginning. The idea of the movie is great and original as i was stunned when i saw how the creators compared the strength of humanity against that of the gods in the movie. Of course when you sit down to watch the movie it can be a bit long, but every moment of it is enjoyable as long as you're into these kind of movies. At the first look it might raise a few questions, especially regarding those cute little buggars in the forest. The characters in the movie is well made and we are introduced to each characters personality as the move progresses (if you pay enough attention). Combining the characters with the story i will rate this movie a sure 10 and i hope every one of you will give this movie a fair shot. It might just be the movie that makes you an anime fan ;)",

The journey of Ashitaka is a journey of free will to create, to help and not to destroy, journey of Utopian ideal which will face the human progress destroying the ""old"" world.

For the longest time I had Star Wars as my number one movie, but Princess Mononoke instantly bumped it out of first place. The plot line was amazing, and the acting was superb. The voice actors, both the Japanese and the English dub did an amazing job of getting the emotion that needed to be portrayed felt by the audience. You could hear the subtleties in their voices that let you know there was a change in how the person felt. I great example was when Ashitaka was leaving his village his sister came up to say goodbye. She joked around with Ashitaka, but quickly became sad, and you could feel the mood change when it did. If you listen to how she talked her voice had a minimal change in sound, but it was just enough that you felt the pain in your heart of how sad it was that she was never going to see Ashitaka again.

Apart from the invariantly message entwined throughout, there are images in this movie that will stay with you forever (for example, the main character, Ashitaka, parting two women who are fighting, as blood drips from his recently inflicted mortal wound and concentrated evil writhes around the three of them). i promise that the end (which i won't disclose) will leave you shivering.",
