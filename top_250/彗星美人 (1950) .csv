0,17 October 2005,claudio_carvalho,10," A Magnificent Timeless Tale of Ambition, Manipulation and Betrayal - Certainly One of the Best Classics Ever","The ambitious Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing (Bette Davis) and her friends Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe); her boyfriend and director Bill Sampson (Gary Marrow); and the producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), believe that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business.",/
1,4 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Wow, an 11 if possible!","All About Eve is my idea of a perfect film,(and I am 17) beautiful and brooding at the same time. People consider this as one of the finest films ever made, and I cannot disagree. This and Shawshank Redemption are actually films that deserve to be in the top 250. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is sharp and focused with great lines such as ""Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night"". The direction is excellent, and this is further advantaged by a terrific cast, a very good subject matter and sumptuous costumes. I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",r
2,30 August 2017,JohnHowardReid,10, Just Brilliant!,"Brilliantly acted and cleverly characterized, with sparkling dialogue that mercilessly parries the gloss from the New York theater world's highly sophisticated veneer, ""All About Eve"" is a scintillating comedy of manners that compels rapt attention for the whole of its 2¼ hours. We like George Sanders, pointing out Gregory Ratoff to his escort, Marilyn Monroe (whom the script describes as ""a member of the Copacabana school of acting""), with the words: ""There's a real live producer, honey! Go and do yourself some good!"" And the final scene, in which Sanders asks Barbara Bates, ""Do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?"" — ""More than anything else in the world!"" she answers. ""Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one"", he replies. ""Miss Harrington knows all about it!""",e
3,20 February 2010,Lechuguilla,9, Superb Acting And Dialogue,"What a movie! It's the cinematic ideal, the standard by which subsequent films are judged, at least in terms of acting and dialogue. Maybe the camera, which does nothing but sit there as the actors act, could have been made a little less static. But the story screams stage play, which implies lots of talk and not much ""action"".

4,20 March 1999,Don-102,10, All About Great Writing and Great Acting...,"In show business, there is probably an Eve Harrington born every day. Someone who butters up to a performer of note, acting innocently, revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have.  Anne Baxter plays this type of person to a tee.  She looks like a baby-faced fan, but little do we know, there is a fame machine at work in her mind.  Bette Davis, as Margo Channing, star of the stage, is a veteran who has seen it all.  She is quite the egotist.  Margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it.  Eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm.  This is the premise of ALL ABOUT EVE, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation.  Mankiewicz also wrote the picture (winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1950) with such skill, the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.",i

Bette Davis's Margo Channing is a film icon of major proportions. A point of reference. Her fear of the abyss is as human as it is at the center of this selfish, insecure, sacred cow. She is surrounded by some other sensational women. Thelma Ritter, Celeste Holm, Anne Baxter and in a tiny but telling part, Marilyn Monroe - a graduate from the Copacabana school of dramatic art. Wittily prophetic. George Sanders is another piece of extraordinary casting and writing. ""I'm essential to the theater"" Indeed.

The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on.  It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted.  The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to ""act"" too much) only enhances it that much more.

15,8 August 2007,MOscarbradley,10, Possibly the smartest comedy ever to have come out of Hollywood,"They say that talk is cheap but you wouldn't believe it listening to the pearls that drip from the mouths of the characters in this, the greatest of all the dialogue-driven comedies to have come out of Hollywood, (at the time it was nominated for a then record 14 Oscar nominations and won 6). It opens with a monologue that introduces all the leading players that is at once literate and cinematic at the same time and you know instantly that his is, above all, a movie to listen to. (What film-buff doesn't quote its screenplay ad-nauseum; gay men, at least according to ""The Boys in the Band"", are said to know the script by heart). And while drag queens the world over have always based their Bette Davis imitations on the character of Margo Channing, (Davis' greatest role and her greatest performance), the film is never merely camp. The acerbic wit that runs through the film always has a ring of truth to it; the characters, overblown as they are, are always recognizably human.",1

The theatre setting also underscores the reality that the world is a stage, and all its people, players.",5
17,10 July 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""You have every reason for happiness""","When I first discovered this movie, I didn't think I was going to be impressed by it. I thought that a movie with a predominantly female cast would be a recipe for disaster, since there would be no fighting, conflicts, or betrayals. As it turns out though, women are often more cruel and punishing than men when it comes to getting back at their enemies. It seems obvious now that it's a good movie, since it got 14 Oscar nominations, a record at the time, and won 6. It's also the only movie in history to have four actresses nominated for an academy award. With so many awards and positive reviews to its credit, it might seem like a stupid question, but does the movie still hold up? It is a timeless and intriguing story simply because it's very well written. The movie is about a girl named Margo played by Bette Davis. She is widely popular in the world of theatrical performance, but she's looking a little long in the tooth. She worries about how her biological aging will affect her career, and doubts it will be good. One day, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) shows up to Margo's dressing room after one of her performances and tells her how big of a fan she is to the point where Margo thinks she is a bit deranged. Even so, Margo plays nice and lets Eve be a ""friend"" of hers, and Eve eventually goes on to perform in a play that Margo was meant to perform in. A critic watching the play is Mr. DeWitt (George Sanders), and he apparently likes it. Eve and DeWitt form an alliance that is somewhat hostile to Margo, and they openly criticize her for turning a blind eye to young and talented actresses like Eve. Later, Eve takes a role in another play after Margo says she doesn't want it. Eve also wants to marry Margo's friend Lloyd because he can ensure Eve stars in good plays. DeWitt later blackmails Eve because he is convinced she is trying to control him, and insists that he's not foolish. He says he knows her real name is not Eve, but Gertrude Slescynski, and was never married. If Eve tries to marry Lloyd, he will let everybody know these things and she will be done for. At the end, the movie returns to where it started; a ceremony where Eve receives an award, and Margo is in attendance. Despite being there, she does not like Eve in the slightest. Shortly after, it turns out that Eve (now a celebrity) has her own adoring and obnoxious fan named Phoebe. I'm guessing that this ending implies that Phoebe is fated to end up the same way as Eve did when she started idolizing Margo. Eve will act coldly towards her and only pretend to like her, but the naive Phoebe will mistake this for genuine interest. Widely considered one of the best movies ever, it's just obvious after watching it why so many people have this opinion regarding this movie. Pretty much all the characters are brilliantly played, and I don't think Bette Davis needs any introduction. Margo is the type of woman that wouldn't look out of place in a noir movie, as she is ruthless, cunning, and dangerous to those that get on her bad side. Anne Baxter plays Eve, the title character for certain, but I would think Margo is the real main character here. Eve's long journey from a generic nobody to a celebrity is caused solely by Margo's influence, and in the end, Eve discovers she might not enjoy being famous after all. George Sanders plays Mr. DeWitt, who is originally shown to be a sympathetic theater critic who is willing to give the inexperienced Eve some praise, but then shows up later to threaten her with confidential information about her life. He's unapologetic and just doesn't care about her feelings, and I think we can all agree the part where he hits Eve in the face definitely wouldn't be allowed today. Although a very minor character, a young Marilyn Monroe even makes an appearance during one of Margo's parties. To summarize, All About Eve is truly one of cinema's all time classics, and its story is an example of how there is no worse feeling than being hated by someone you look up to.",/

Addison de Witt is repeatedly described as a snake, but even he, as he recognizes, is not as ruthless as Eve Harrington. Eve would truly kill her own mother for a good role - and remember the experience so she could play it convincingly on stage. She gives you the willies.",?

22,16 December 2015,anaconda-40658,10, All About Baxter.,"All About Eve (1950): Dir: Joseph L. Mankiewicz / Cast: Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill: Fascinating drama about confrontation when Eve Harrington appears backstage to meet Broadway actress Margo Channing. Eventually Eve replaces Channing thus receiving praise once reserved for her. Brilliantly written, and directed with insight by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who touches greatly upon the glam and vanity of being a star. It opens at an award ceremony where facial reactions play the key as to what follows through flashbacks. Bette Davis is remarkable as Channing who is growing older and feels her starlight fading away. Eve is played with great innocence by Anne Baxter whose transformation seems alarmingly true in the business but these decisions also bear consequences as she learns when her hunger for fame runs rabid. Great supporting work by George Sanders as a theatre critic used by Eve for success but perhaps he already knows this drill. Celeste Holm plays the wife of an author who specializes in plays. She discovers Eve thus opening an introduction to Channing. Gary Merrill plays a film director who is also Davis's much younger boyfriend, which also plays into delusional show business relationships. Easily one of the best and most inspiring films of the year. It has terrific art direction and a message about age, entertainment and infinity. Score: 10 / 10",_

It's also about one of the most villainous characters to appear on a screen, and, yet, to her fans, she is the darling of entertainment. This is about two actresses who are at the top of their games, facing off like a couple of gunfighters or boxers, shadowboxing, waiting for the right moment. The great thing is that Bette Davis's character could be a true victim, but we know enough about her to know she ain't going to take this lying down. She's aware of the betrayal of her kindnesses and the empty flattery of her foe, but she also knows that she isn't dealing with a lightweight. The loaded verbiage, point counterpoint, is just amazing. The younger woman believes that she is the rightful heir to the throne and is willing to do anything.

It's really a women's picture all the way - Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, Celeste Holm as Karen - these are all strong roles.

With the exception of the cardboard Hugh Marlowe (who was equally wooden when he played opposite Gary Merrill within weeks in 'Twelve O'Clock High')all the cast do the script proud, especially the supporting characters like Thelma Ritter's Birdie (Ritter, of course, had a pivotal supporting role in 3 Wives) and George Sanders Addison de Witt (surely Mank's alter ego, witness the name plus the fact he gets the lion's share of the cynicism and one-liners whilst being portrayed as an urbane observer of talented children). The structure is craftsmanship personified; Ann Baxter's Eve Harrington is auditioning from her very first appearance and the irony is that the actress, writer, writer's wife, director, everyone, in fact, who SHOULD be able to recognise a performance at ten paces, Fail to realize what a consummate actress Eve really is until it's too late; only the life-weary Birdy and world-weary DeWitt make Eve for what she is and they respectively speak up and face derision or keep silent for reasons of their own.

Starting from the link between Davis and Elisabeth Bergner via a remake Davis acted in 1946 called A STOLEN LIFE -- itself a version previously performed by Bergner, and snowballing into the anecdote that Bergner herself had been the apparent victim of an unusual admiration by a young female actress of whose identity and life little is known (unless you read Sam Stagg's book ""All About All About Eve""), ALL ABOUT EVE is as interesting -- and at times, even more so -- as to its backstory to what was presented on screen as the final result.",

50,17 May 2005,gftbiloxi,10, An Acid Etched Classic,"Most film buffs know that Claudette Colbert was originally slated for the leading role of Margo Channing--but following a back-injury was replaced at the last minute by Bette Davis, whose career had been in the trash can since her departure from Warner Brothers. By most accounts the set was unusually explosive, with Davis proving as temperamental as the role she played and directing most of her fury at co-star Celeste Holm. But as they say, what counts is what you see on the screen, and ALL ABOUT EVE emerged as one of the most honored films of all time, racking up an unheard-of number of awards with its poisonously witty tale of an insecure, aging Broadway star (Davis) whose life and career are slowly consumed by a seemingly devoted but secretly calculating fan (Anne Baxter.)",

It was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for a record 14 Academy Awards, a feat which has since been matched (by ""Titanic"" in 1997) but never bettered. Of those fourteen nominations it won six categories, including Best Picture. And yet it is a film completely different in style to anything likely to win Best Picture today. It perhaps illustrates the changes in film-making which took place during the second half of the 20th century better than any other Big Film of its era. ",

Whether it is truly realistic or blatantly theatrical is not a decision between a flaw and a pro, but between the nature of dialogue that is normally striven for by a logical writer and what could be beyond that nature and perhaps some new, inventive little flare, something to keep the audience determinedly on their toes. The film is loaded, and neatly limited modestly at the brim, with powerhouse scenes of dialogue, be they fiery arguments between infamous flamethrower Bette Davis and a co-star who dares to match her or dangerous, hardly predictable scenes tossed with threats and lies between others. To me, beyond the cast, beyond the direction, beyond the atmosphere of the scenery and cinematography, director Joseph L.

Mankiewicz (Guys and Dolls, Cleopatra), I didn't know much about this classic drama, but with a good cast list, I was willing to try it. Basically ambitious Eve Harrington (Oscar nominated Anne Baxter) is very fond of actress Margo Channing (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Bette Davis), and manages to get close to her boyfriend, and her friends Karen Richards (Oscar nominated Celeste Holm) and her play writer husband Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), director Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill) and producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). All the big shots, except for cynical critic Addison DeWitt (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated George Sanders), believing she is only a naive and obsessive fan of Margo's, but Eve is much more cynical, manipulative and conniving than that. Using the lives of Margo and her friends, all along she planned to become an actress, and she achieves her goal of Broadway stardom, leaving a trail of unhappiness for everyone behind her. The end sees her accepting the highest award for any stage performer, and another fan wanting to see the now famous Eve, and it seems, this naive girl may have the same sneaky plans. Also starring Barbara Bates as Phoebe, then rising star Marilyn Monroe as Miss Casswell and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Thelma Ritter as Birdie. Baxter may not be the conventional wicked witch/bunny boiler/psychopathic bitch villain, in fact, she may not even by the right person for the role, yet even with a few appearances, she is a good light villain. Davis is very good as the emotionally wrecked actress, then little known Monroe makes the most of her few minutes, same goes for Ritter. I can see why critics complained about it being too chatty, and yet it is this, being witty and cynical, that makes the film very watchable. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay for Mankiewicz, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Alfred Newman, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Eve Harrington was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, Bette Davis was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 17 on The World's Greatest Actor, she was also number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Womem, ""Fasten your seatbelts.

62,1 September 2008,Quinoa1984,10, an excellent script and crackerjack performances steer this classic backstage theater melodrama,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz, it should be noted with All About Eve, shows how good a screenwriter he is. He's very good, almost too good if that's possible. It's such a richly textured script with its dialog and plot turns, its evolving and revealing characters that reveal through their distinct personalities, that it almost becomes too much of a good thing. In a way the script reminds me of the main star character of All About Eve, Margo played by Bette Davis, who knows she's good and is almost arrogant in its flamboyance (if not quite as insecure in comparison). This isn't as a put-down per-say; the film overall is one of those smashingly entertaining mainstream Hollywood classics, a less weird and noirish take on somewhat similar material as Sunset Blvd. If I won't immediately want to re-watch All About Eve as much as I would Sunset Blvd, it would still remain something I'd recommend in a heart beat to an aspiring movie buff.",

I basically sat there for over two hours in awe. I just couldn't believe the incredible performances from everyone associated with this movie. The writing, the acting, the story just makes you long for a Hollywood that unfortunately no longer exists. To see a movie with a real story and with real movie stars is something that has been lacking for the last thirty years in my opinion.

But, George Sanders, whom I find to be a sublime choice for his role, pretty much steals the film (along with Davis). The story of an outrageously ambitious young Broadway actress is nothing new, there were thousands of them over the years. What makes this one so unique is the supporting players, all of which give sterling performances. I am sure we have all heard the saying ""it takes a village to raise a child"". In this instance, it took a village to raise a star; from the producers down to the supporting players. Coming to grips about aging in a medium that idolizes youth was a difficult task for any leading lady that was getting on in years. This film illustrates those trials to a tee.",

She decides to take her in and introduce her to her feisty idol. ""Channing"" - despite the rather brusque protestations of her assistant ""Birdie"" (a lovely effort from Thelma Ritter) - and writer ""Richards"" (Hugh Marlowe) take a bit of a shine to this endearing young woman who proceeds to regale them with a rather sad story explaining her current predicament. Next thing we know, ""Eve"" has ingratiated herself into the home of her new - and increasingly frustrated - mentor, and - well is she quite what she seems? Davis is at the top of here game in this drama. Her characterisation of the ageing star is potent and poignant - especially when she hosts a welcome home party for her soon-to-be husband ""Simpson"" (Gary Merrill) and the ""fasten your seatbelts"" quote is unleashed to devastating cinematic effect. Holm is also really quite effective as the conduit between these two women, but it is really Baxter who steals the show. You just know she can't be as pure and innocent, as sweetness and light as she portrays. Luckily, we have the dastardly critic ""Addison DeWitt"" (possibly a career best supporting performance from George Sanders) on hand to help keep the audience ahead of the plotting and scheming and also to ensure a certain amount of divine retribution is doled out as required at the end. This is a cracking drama with six principal characters left to develop and evolve in front of us exposing all that is good and bad about human nature and nurture. Joseph L. Mankiewicz adapts and allows Mary Orr's pithy and sharp story to accumulate gently but powerfully and even though it starts as it finishes, robbing the denouement of a touch of jeopardy, it's still one hell of a star-studded ""bumpy' ride.",
72,17 October 2021,ThomasColquith,5, A Mixed Bag,"""All About Eve"" is a mildly entertaining story that is well acted but which ultimately suffers from its own deleterious content and messaging. This problematic story and content caused me to somewhat dislike this film, much in the way I felt about ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (see my previous review). Both films feature a creepy psychopathic main character who effortlessly moves up in the world without compunction. Both characters are shown to face no repercussions for their actions as well. The improbability of this and the lack of a moral ending are troubling to me and cause this film to seem like a celebration of bad behavior in the entertainment industry rather than a more needed critique or satirization of it.",
73,14 September 2021,briancham1994,7, Sly film with pacing issues,"This isn't quite Sunset Boulevard, but this contemporaneous drama hits the same notes. The film is as sly as the eponymous Eve Harrington, seeming straightforward and innocent on the surface but hiding some repulsive Machiavellianism that reveals itself once it has achieved domination. The acting of the two main characters was tragically compelling, with one being an innocent little girl and the other being an insecure has-been. This dynamic fuels most of the film as Eve hijacks Margo's fame to surpass her role, triggering all the futile outrage that Margo can muster. The other characters are pawns in her game but show their own schemes later on, demonstrating the wit of the script. The main problem with the film is the pacing, as it really drags at times and the amount of characters and talking seemed excessive (why did Marilyn Monroe really need to be there?).",

Our daughter wanted to see it, however, and so 60 years after it first hit the screen, three of us watched it. I really didn't know what to expect. It had won so many awards, and, even though she wasn't a favorite of mine, Bette Davis did have a considerable reputation in her day, and this was often cited as her best role. To my surprise, when the film ended, I learned that all three of us thought it was terrible. George Sanders in his patented role as an arrogant stinker and the young Marilyn Monroe who appears on his arm in a party scene were the only two characters we found interesting -- and MM is only interesting, of course, because of her later stardom. Ms. Davis chews the scenery as was her wont in her role as an ""aging"" (40) actress still playing roles meant for actresses in their 20s.

106,5 September 2016,peefyn,9, Great screenplay acted out by great performers,"Some films earn their place in the canon due to the importance they had at the time of their release. All about Eve was no doubt important, but it also holds up better today than many movies released this decade. It's wit is just as sharp, and the performances are still top notch. It's a movie about hunger for power, staying relevant, and realizing that nothing lasts forever - all of which are still interesting themes today. (Staying relevant will maybe never lose its relevancy.) While the cast is stellar all around, Bette Davis' performance really stands out as just amazing. She's the highlight of any scene she is in, and when she's not a part of the scene, you miss her. Much of it is because she really captures the character (which might have been easy for her), but also because of the writing. So many movies around this time has excellent dialogue. It's like they didn't care if it was realistic at all, it was more important that it was good.",

I finally got around to watching ALL ABOUT EVE and have concluded that its ALL ABOUT US! This classic film was based on a short, but true story of an actress' protege who was out to upstage her, and how true to life it is, regardless of who you are, famous or not. Bette Davis (absolutely unforgettable) is the one to watch, perfectly matched with Anne Baxter ( as Eve), the ultimate career and home wrecker. Period. George Sanders deservingly won an Oscar for his part as the unofficial observer (and insightful narrator) of the devious proceedings, always in a league of his own and making the most of his role, if not his lines. Celeste Holm is, likewise, a treat to watch, always by Davis' side. Not to be overlooked, as this is one compelling production, and perhaps a stellar example of storytelling at its very best. An early credit for Marilyn Monroe, who was skillfully climbing the ladder in Hollywood to better roles. Footnote: the biggest star if it all is the searing dialogue and one-liners that reveal human nature at its worst. One you've seen this, you are hooked.",
109,9 July 2009,Enchorde,9, A true classic,"Recap: We begin at the end, were the young actress Eve Harrington is presented with a prestigious award. There, the cast around her remembers how it all came to this moment. How they found Eve around the stage door, apparently the devoted fan. They took her in, gave her a chance and she used it to all it was worth. Although being in the company of prominent theatre professionals, and despite given an award for a play later, Eve gives the performance of her life to play all angles, to rise to the top, quickly and at all costs. Only writer Addison DeWitt sees through her, but instead of revealing her he gives aid with small advice, as another little project of his.",

The outstanding script is brilliantly supported by perfect performances delivered by every single actor involved.  Not one line or nuance is wasted. Beautiful and simple and real, the sets and costumes are what they should be: perfect accessories to living, breathing imperfect characters you will care about, even sometimes in spite of yourself.

112,31 January 2005,style-2,10," 'Eve, Eve, Eve, Little Miss Evil'","All About Eve A Triple-S movie (three suicides in the cast--Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Bates and George Sanders), All About Eve has enough dirt to satisfy even the heartiest appetite. A record 14 Oscar nominations for the cast and crew, it is as wicked and sophisticated as they come, with Bette Davis at her eye-popping, cigarette-swinging best as Margo Channing, Broadway's leading diva. Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington is deliciously calculating as the up-and-coming actress who moves in on Miss Channing, first ingratiating herself with Miss Channing, and eventually replacing her. The supporting cast is equally fine with George Sanders as ""that venomous fishwife"" Addison DeWitt, Celeste Holm as Margo's long-suffering best friend, Karen Richards, and an ethereally beautiful Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell, ""a graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts."" Joseph Mankiewicz's script and direction are superb, with dialog so crisp and poisonous, it makes you wonder where script-driven movies have gone. Chock full of quotable lines, fabulous New Look costumes, and sheer irony. So thick and rich you'll be tempted to eat it with a fork but use a spoon to get every drop.",
113,27 April 2007,dmwhite50,10, Brilliant Bitchfest,"ALL ABOUT EVE is a brilliant masterpiece of a film that is unique in that it is so cinematic, but its emphasis is on the word rather than the image. That makes the film more like a play than a movie-- and ironically the story is the best movie about ambition, and Broadway stage actors ever made. This is probably the wittiest, the bitchiest screenplay ever written! This is also Bette Davis' best performance in a movie. (What a blessed but ill-timed coincidence for her that Gloria Swanson was creating the spectacular Norma Desmond in SUNSET BOULEVARD the very same year- and then that neither actress won the Oscar that year as they cancelled each other out in the voting!)The whole cast is wonderful! I can watch this film again and again. It is a genuine masterpiece!",
114,30 April 2020,LeonardKniffel,10, Unforgettable Hollywood Classic,"As the film opens, we hear the voice of theater critic Addison de Witt (played by George Sanders) talking about the presentation of a prestigious acting award to the conniving Eve Harrington (played by Anne Baxter): ""These hollowed walls, indeed many of these faces, have looked upon Modjeska, Ada Rehan, and Minnie Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the room, Booth breathed this air...."" The Polish actress Helena Modjeska was still a theater icon in 1950 when the film was made, well enough known that her last name alone was all that was needed. Perhaps she was a role model to Eve, for later in the movie when Addison exposes Eve's lies and made-up past, the big shocker comes when he shouts, ""Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski!"" This movie is filled with immortal movie lines: ""Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night.""",

Anne Baxter turns in an understated but tantalizing performance as the title character, at the same time challenging co-star Bette Davis for the Best Actress Oscar, though won by neither that year. The film is a scathing portrayal of getting to the top in the ethereal world of the Broadway theater, and how one woman pulls out all the stops to go for the brass ring.",
123,8 May 2014,Natybug97,10, All About Eve,"When I first read the synopsis of this film, I was not very excited about watching it, regardless I pressed play and soon found myself completely immersed. I found the first few minutes of the film to be interesting because I wasn't sure what was happening nor who was speaking, but gradually the narration became clear and the story through it's flashbacks pulled me in almost immediately. I was so eager to know what would happen to this young girl, and how her idol would react to her presence. Then it was not her presence to which the famed theater actress began reacting to, but everything else. It was an interesting and beautiful film to watch. I thought all the characters were phenomenal, especially Bette Davis' character. She played her so well and brought so much life that despite her jealous fits you still sympathize with her and can't help but like her. To me this made an impact because it kept me interested even though I had several reservations about watching this film, not only that but I still find myself thinking about it. That small fact makes it a memorable and fantastic piece of art.",
124,26 April 2000,Kieranmc,10, The Bitch is back and this bitch is best!,"All involved in All About Eve were at the peak of their craft. Script, direction and acting are a pleasure to treasure. I have to single out Bette Davis, she is the pivot of the film and holds that position throughout. Delivering razor sharp dialogue with skillful precision she dazzles as the venomous, spoilt Margot Channing, thwarted at every turn by the calculated innocence of Eve. This is an instruction manual on film craft and a wonderful film experience.",
125,2 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,6, Cynical character piece,"ALL ABOUT EVE is a dark and cynical look at the world of theatre and those at the very top in terms of fame and fortune. It's remembered today for being one of the films featuring an inimitable Bette Davis as an ageing star who finds herself waning and facing opposition from her younger rivals. The film offers a pretty bleak world view in which everyone seems to be out for personal gain and fortune. It's finely-judged indeed and boasts some strong performances, in particular from Anne Baxter who takes ruthlessness to a new level. Davis the real star here though, performing in a more sympathetic role than usual and making the role her own.",

127,21 May 2004,CountessM,10, It deserves its reputation.,"This film has a legendary reputation and it certainly lives up to it.  All the catfights, the backstabbing, the blackmailing...  What an exhilirating film!  The cast is beyond superb and the ending is eerie, but sublime. George Sanders alone is worth the price of admission.  Those heavenly voice-overs keep changing the point of view, but it is always done so perfectly.  It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hasn't aged a bit and still revels in all its glory.  Set in the world of the theater, we listen to all the various characters talk about Eve, and not surprisingly, there is no shortage of things to mention.  There's a reason why that ""bumpy night"" is still being talked about!",
128,3 July 1999,boy-13,10, ....one of the greatest films ever made....,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, ""All About Eve"" combines the finest acting, witty dialogue, sparkling tongue-in-cheek humor, and a highly-entertaining storyline. Bette Davis plays Margo Channing, an aging star of the stage. Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington who claims to be Margo's most adoring fan. One night, Margo's dearest friend, Karen Richards (Celeste Holm), discovers Eve lurking around a stage door during one of Margo's performances, waiting for her to come out. A flattered Margo takes the seemingly innocent Eve under her wing. But we soon discover the adoration is really obsession, and Eve is actually out to take over Margo's romance and career. The crazed Eve's manipulations are a hoot to watch and Baxter turns in a beautiful performance. Some amazing effort went into the scenes in which Eve's ""Jekyll and Hyde""-like transformation from sweet innocent into devious witch are shown. The appeal of this film classic is made even greater by George Sanders, as critic Addison DeWitt, and his jaded, but funny commentary. Also, Marilyn Monroe in a bit part as a young starlet (what a stretch!) is a true gem.",
129,18 March 2023,jlspenc-84630,10, Nothing bumpy about this classic.,"Bette Davis was Hollywood's most dominant actress during the Thirties and Forties when she was under contract to Warner Bros. Although short in physical stature, the temperamental Davis made up for it by standing her ground, unafraid to take on Jack Warner himself over the quality of scripts that were thrust upon her.

The film is full of little dramatic moments: grand entrances, dramatic exits, fiery confrontations and lines of clever dialogue drenched in wit or sarcasm or acid. There are precious few casual or ordinary moments; the characters all know the power of words and the greater power of delivering those words with style. ",
135,29 June 2008,johnnyboyz,8, All About Eve is all about many other things.,"There can be no denying that All About Eve has retained some sort of epic feel watching now that I can only imagine must've felt rather jarring back in 1950, when it was first released. Here is a film that covers and raises so many points and issues, and does so in a very grand and atmospheric manner. If director Joseph L. Mankiewicz was trying to raise points and debate surrounding Hollywood; the need for greed; that lust for being famous and the transition or rivalry between theatre and cinema then All About Eve can only be attributed to being an epic success.",

BEFORE President Obama was a foreign-born Muslim, BEFORE Global Warming was a Hoax, EVEN BEFORE Evolution was a Discredited Crackpot Theory, Fox's unique skill at fashioning self-fulfilling prophecies out of Thin Air is abundantly on display here in ALL ABOUT EVE. Even without the Gofundme Campaign that would be necessary for me to Encyclopedically document the dozens of Fake News Scoops in EVE (or the thousands riddling the entire Body of the Fox Film Corpus), consider these two Norma Jean moments from EVE calling out ""Marilyn Monroe's"" most famous co-star and spouse BY THEIR REAL LIFE NAMES!! About 56 minutes into EVE, Marilyn's character ""Claudia"" says that she'll sacrifice ""anything"" for Clark Gable, an eerie foreshadowing of the co-star she'd leave with a fatal heart attack after plaguing him through the filming of his final flick, THE MISFITS a decade AFTER this comment is made in EVE. Twelve minutes later, Fox insures that its Fake News about a false-fronted bimbo seducing and ruining America's top playwright (EVE's ""Lloyd"" character) is cemented into American Culture's REAL LIFE Future as Arthur Miller is mentioned BY NAME in front of Artie's Looming Femme Fatale, nee Norma Jean Mortenson. Of course, it goes without saying that EVE--nee ""Gertrude Slojinski""--and her back-story dalliance with a Royal Family of American Booze is sly Fox's way of including Jack and Bobby Kennedy among Ms. Mortenson's long list of Real Life victims.",
139,9 February 2007,tday-1,10, let's hear it for Ann Baxter,"I like this movie,it's full of stinging wit and dialogs,although it's written by a male chauvinist,Joe Mankiewitz. The notion seems absurd nowadays that women can't have a career and marriage,too,but it has to be taken in the context of the times. The only problem I have is Eve is so transparently phony that I'm surprised the supposedly hip theater crowd doesn't see right through her. Anyway,I love the comeuppance scene where Addison tells Eve about all her lies and how she belongs to him. Ann's voice drops from sweetly phony to guttural scowling with panache. It's almost a shocking transition. Everyone in the cast is good but I like Ann Baxter. Incidentally,Claudette Colbert was supposed to be Margo but she dropped out because of a back injury. The idea was there was supposed to be a similarity between Margo and Eve.",

I love films from the 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's but this has got to be one of the most hyped films in the history of motion pictures. Naturally it does not deserve a place in the IMDb top 250, but since that list in itself as quite heavy on the Hollywood side, that doesn't surprise me in the least bit.

None of them, however, reached the heights of All ABout Eve, the definitive testament to director Mankiewicz's superb acumen & sophistication. Every one of its characters is subtly and robustly nuanced. Using flashback (the movie is a huge flashback that starts from the moment Eve receives the prize in her hands), plenty of scenes with mirrors and narrative displacements, the film is an acidic and lucid study on compromise and the rise to fame. Cannibalistic Eve is Margo's good, hard-working friend who in reality just vampirizes all of Margo's gestures and tastes. Eve's character lives the same relationships of dependence as those experienced by characters in Fassbinder's Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, in its tasty self-mocking tone, as well as in Almodóvar's variation on the same theme, Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Mankiewicz would once again address the world of theater and cinema icons in The Barefoot Countess (1954), a fine movie if far from a masterpiece like this one.",

154,25 November 2006,giffey-1,10, Comedy drenched in acid,"All About Eve is perhaps the most perceptive film ever made and the American theater. Wickedly funny, yet with the foresight of it's era, perhaps the most grounded film of it's day. We are introduced to the characters as they sit through a knowing, yet curiously boring speech at the Sarah Siddons Awards (today, it would be the Tony's). Addison DeWitt, that creature of the theater, introduces us to the majority of the cast in a voice over effect. Surprisingly, most of the cast reacts as if they can hear every word Addison is saying (if you don't believe me, watch Bette Davis' and Celest Holmes' reactions especially). As Addison comes to end of his recitation, he introduces us to the character who the film is ostensibly about, Eve Harrington, the actress being honored by the old actor's speech. She also seems to react to Addison, believing the attention being paid to her is only her due. At that point, just is Eve is about to accept the award, the narration shifts to Karen Richards, the playwright's wife, the ""lowest form of celebrity"" as she herself says. It is important at that juncture that Karen continues, as she is the woman who has unwisely unleashed Eve on the theater, and it's greatest star, Margo Channing. One never not believes that Margo is the greatest star. Even the fact that the young upstart has momentarily diverted the spotlight, it will always return to Margo. We then see most of the cast backstage in Margo's dressing room the night Karen introduces Eve to Margo. Even at that early moment, Eve knows just exactly how to worm her way in, to use her affected guilelessness to her advantage.

Both were big hits, and All About Eve was nominated for a record fourteen Oscars, winning six, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing.

162,24 December 2009,Ziya90,2, About cinema,"All the lists of the bests include All About Eve and it seems that all the people who are interested in black and white classics love the film. And it is in the IMDb Top 250 too. I believe that this movie is seen as a masterpiece because of the messages it has about the world of theater, the world of the players (like Sunset Boulevard, but I will explain why I love that movie and hate this movie) All About Eve, yes, criticizes fame, there is sarcasm. However, as an audience who is interested in cinematic elements (is it strange?), All About Eve cannot be masterpiece. The way of story telling was not impressive at all and this causes the movie to be uninteresting most of the time. In other words, can I say that it was not dramatically powerful? There is not any sound scene except the final and the scene which Marilyn Monroe appears was very nice. She added color into the film, she breaths life into the film. And as said, the alarming final was stunning. I love Sunset Boulevard, because cinematically (includes everything) it was great and impressive. And why I have compared All About Eve with Sunset Boulevard? because, they are alike in terms of the thematic element, probably, many people would agree with me at this point. Sunset criticizes the world of cinema industry, Eve criticizes theater industry. I know that All About Eve was not a blockbuster which you eat pop corn and drink cola and have a good time, but entertainment are important too and art is much more important though and I can't say that All About Eve is artistic. After I had watched All About Eve, I watched a Billy Wilder film and a Orson Welles film. It did good a lot.",
163,9 May 2023,Horst_In_Translation,6," I cannot call it a classic, merely an okay movie","""All About Eve"" is an American film in the English language from 1950, so this one will have its 75th anniversary soon. Maybe it happened already depending on when you come here to read this review of mine. There is also some French included in here, but really not a lot, so you won't need subtitles for this. Like most full-on dramas from that era, the film is in black-and-white and actually it is a really long film as this one makes it comfortably past the two-hour mark and even almost reaches the 140-minute mark. This film is part of the top250 highest-rated films on imdb, which is an honor for every film that achieves this and this one is even in the top150 at this point still, namely at 131. I would say it is vastly overrated, but I will get to that a little later and for now let's still look at the basics. The base material is by a female writer, namely Mary Orr and this one here is maybe the adaptation from her work that became the most famous, but her tale about Eve was taken to the screen on other occasions too in fact. And not just this one, but yeah she was around the age of 40 when this came out, so she witnesses the big success and she lived on for more than half a century afterwards even. The director and writer of the screenplay here is Joseph L. Mankiewicz. He was approximately the same age like Orr there and awards-wise, this was really the most successful time of his career. He won the year before Oscars for writing and directing and he managed to repeat in both categories. Impressive and difficult to imagine this will happen again anytime soon. And with ""All About Eve"" he also won Best Picture in contrast to the film from the year before. Or actually, it was not him who won, but somebody else, but the film was as much his as it was Zanuck's.",

I think Ms. Davis was too good of an actress (better than Margo would have been in the real world); and could just put on and take off a character like a nice sable coat.  The ladies in the movie were the real standouts --from Marylin Monroe's cute few minutes on-screen, through Thelma Ritter's tough ex-vaudevillian ""Birdie.""  And of course in addition to Bette Davis' performance there's Anne Baxter's evilly plotting ""Eve,"" and Celeste Holm as the misled playwright's wife ""Karen.""

The directing is good, not great, but that is in part by design; the reason the film looks ""stagey"" is because it's a movie about the theater, the ""stage."" Apart from the acting, of course, the most brilliant aspect of this marvel is the dialogue. I am not exaggerating when I say I could reel off three hundred lines of that film at a crack! I also like that director Mankiewicz took on some then-controversial mores. It is obvious that premarital sex is happening, the George Sanders character is so venomous that I think Mankiewicz STUDIED George Gene Nathan or something. Ignore those who call this film cynical; this is a slice of life in the theater of the late 1940s to 1950, and Broadway reviewers are known to be some of the harshest critics in the world; if you can't handle this, avoid the film. My own favorite strategem employed by Mankiewicz is during the party scene, when they are all sitting on a staircase. Some question if all the hard work is worth it, the business is a charade, and so forth, and the Ann Baxter stops them and equates applause with an orgasm! Brilliant! Says she in this scene, ""Why if there's nothing else, there's applause. <i>It's like waves of love flooding up over the footlights and enfolding you</i>."" Ha!

This only shows the Oscars, were not fair even on the '50s. The movie is marvel in monotony. Betty Davis's acting was overrated by herself and few cronies who put her on a pedestal, since there was not many contenders in the acting field during that era. She was one arrogant and conceited actress off and on screen. The only thing in the movie worth was Anne Baxter. The script has been praised beyond comprehension. Next time I will see the Hate! Section before I watch any movie, since if you go by the best section, you will invariably end up with a bummer of a movie like this. As far as Script-Billy Wilder and Charles Brach were better contemporary script-writers than Joseph Mankewich. The essence of the movie is, nubile post menopausal women in long trench coats walk to and from the theater and doing so, attract few useful idiots.

Warren Beatty's ""Bugsy"" should be in the Top Ten movies of all times (along with ""Good Fellas"") but it is not even in the Top 100..just an example of the Hollywood Morons(Capitol M!) making suckers out of the public..the correct word is Unjust Enrichment!",

There will always been someone working to overpower you in your field. You must always remain on top of your game.

That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats.

Mankiewicz was an important figure in the Hollywood studio system staring as a screenwriter in the 1920's and become a successful producer of major films beginning in the 1930's and branching out into directing films in the the 1940's he worked for Paramount, MGM and Fox and succeeded in everything thing he did weather it was producing, directing or writing. Often working with large ensemble casts he assembled a great one here with Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter, Gary Merrill, Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Bates and Hugh Marlow among the cast. This was nominated for 14 Academy Awards including an amazing five cast members in Davis, Baxter, Holm, Ritter and Sanders. Sanders won Best supporting Actor in his first and only nomination and win. Baxter and Davis were nominated for Best Actress and Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter were nominated for Best Supporting Actress but in both categories they split the vote and canceled each other out and came away with no Oscars. It won the big prize as Best Picture and also Best Director and Best Screenplay for Mankiewicz in addition to Costume Design for Edith Head and Best Sound. It was All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard at the Academy Awards for 1950 with 25 nominations between the two films and Eve winning six to Sunset's three.

However, this film is almost certainly one of them. The result of an ideal combination of factors, which harmoniously came together to make it a work of art, it is a timeless film that is as pleasantly watched today as it was fifty years ago. But when we talk about classic films, it's far from being one of the first to come to mind. What is the reason? It's hard to explain, but I feel like the film never really touched the hearts of the general public. The film deserves more attention these days and is worth seeing. I'm not one of those who measure the quality of a film by the awards it receives (although that is always an indicant to consider as to quality)... but the film is one of the most nominated for the Oscars, with fourteen nominations, something that has only rarely been equaled, and six statuettes won, including Best Picture.",

The incredible cast featuring Bette Davis, Gary Merrill, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Thelma Ritter, George Sanders, Gregory Ratoff, and Marilyn Monroe is one of the many reasons to see this classic movie.

It has the cyclic structure of all the greatest stories--the young actress at the end doing the same thing to Eve that Eve did with Margo. The picture with all the mirror images that ends it is perfect and illustrates the universality of the theme. You couldn't remake it as a movie. It might work as a musical or as an opera.

Eve and Margo reveal their true selves slowly to viewers and to the other characters, but they become less believable to me as the movie draws to its end.  I don't blame the actors: they are consistently excellent.  The writing is good and enjoyable to follow.  It's the character development that is weak.

George Sanders is sophisticated, and sinister as Addison De Witt, a role which he played to the hilt.. a well deserved Oscar winner..The other male characters, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and Gregory Ratoff are all well cast, and well played.  Celeste Holm made a perfect Karen.. and of course, Marilyn Monroe, as Miss Casswell, looked breathtakingly beautiful,with a promise of a great future to come.(I'll never understand why it took 2 more yrs.,for her next major role in""Don't Bother to Knock""??).

219,12 December 2002,perfectbond,9, A superb movie!,All About Eve is a superb movie in all areas of film production. First and foremost a top notch story has been crafted with excellent dialogue. Director Joseph M. (I know I'll misspell his last name!) gets the most out of his all star cast. Bette Davis is the star (both in real life and as Margo in the movie) and she delivers as usual in her role as the aging stage star who feels threatened by an up and comer. But I thought Anne Baxter was the premier performer in this movie. She is simply outstanding as the ambitious and duplicitous aspiring actress Eve Harrington who ingratiates herself to Margo. It's hard to believe she didn't make a bigger name for herself along the lines of Davis. The three male leads are up to par with the ladies as well. A minor quibble is that Marilyn Monroe's character didn't have a larger role. She is simply gorgeous in this movie. It must have been because she hadn't yet become the star she would be in later years. 9/10.,

It has a so-so message (of which it's really proud of itself), with the exception of George Sanders' cynical triumph it has terrible acting (especially Anne Baxter's ridiculously unconvincing portrayal) and, most of all, it is SO melodramatic.  I have never seen a movie beat around the bush as much as this one does.  I it weren't for some very clever dialogue I would have given this movie a two or three.  The most frustrating thing is that it was not only voted to the AFI top 100 list, but also it was named best picture of 1950 over the likes of ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""The Third Man"": two spectacular, unforgettable films.

Perhaps filmmakers had sufficiently recovered from the destruction of WWII to finally take stock of themselves, but it is in this year that Hollywood suddenly became self-aware; and it apparently didn't like what it saw. Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' is cinema's most scathing satire of Hollywood's demented and destitute moral values. Likewise, Nicholas Ray's 'In a Lonely Place (1950)' demonstrates how the studio system snuffs out genuine talent through its intent upon ""selling popcorn."" But it was 'All About Eve (1950)' that truly took America by storm that year, uniting an ensemble of the industry's most charismatic stars and giving each of them acerbic mean streak that is both wonderfully compelling and entertaining. Though the film, scripted and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz {who is also responsible for 'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947)' and 'Sleuth (1972)'}, specifically concerns itself with the theatre, the parallels to Hollywood are unmistakable, and such is the screenplay's apparent distaste towards the film industry that I'm almost surprised of its success.",

236,12 February 2019,koenvanhoorebeke,1, Pseudo artistic nonsense,"Over the years I have become a fan of watching classic movies; that is to say movies that span the period that is often referred to as the golden age of Hollywood, 1930 to 1960. However, not all movies of that era turn out be classics.
Something which certainly upholds for 'All About Eve'. This movie is all about the dialog, after all it is a theater play on printed film. And it is a very bad play with bad dialog and over-extend monologues and soliloquies who make you think of Macbeth but not in a way the writers of this vile play would want you to. I am sure it is full of inside jokes and innuendo that only real, ahem, artists understand. Do people from the world of theater, the actors, writers, producers,etc, really talk like that on cocktail parties?
Once in a while Hollywood makes this pseudo artistic nonsense. Other more recent examples are The Artist and La La Land. Hollywood makes those for themselves, to show off, to give themselves an air of artisticness. And they know it will fail so they throw everything they got at it. Lots of money to promote the movie, get the critics on board and of course, the best of it all, overload it with academy award nominations and wins. It is not a coincidence that this movie and La La Land both share the record for most nominations given to any movie. It is very sad that because of this abuse the number of Oscars a movie receives or is nominated for has become more of an indication of other motives then purely the intention to reward it for whatever category it receives that nomination or award.
Compare this to another 'theater play' movie from that same era, namely 'The Importance of Being Earnest' from 1952 directed by Anthony Asquith after a play by Oscar Wilde. And you are in a completely different league here. No academy awards for that movie, of course it was not a Hollywood production, so nothing Hollywood could show off with.",

The title, All About Eve, is very fitting because the main character Eve Harrington is very selfish and only cares about herself most of the time. Eve begins to get close and befriend a famous Broadway actor named Margo Channing and her famous friends. Most of the friends believed that Margo was just an innocent fan of Margo who didn't want any trouble and wasn't trying to pull anything. However, that was not the case. Eve was only using Margo and her friends in the business to help get her known and to help get her connections in the industry. She was only hanging out with them to benefit herself which was her plan all along.

Ageism for females was immense in the 50's and earlier.12 years later she did have a hit with the fun Baby Jane, but that was it among a lot of mediocre films, but by then her style of larger than life acting was passe. The fact that she was a replacement for the original actress chosen for Margo Channing is nearly incomprehensible as it seems as though it was written for her.

There are some films that are important, maybe not amazingly good, but still important for what they did for the industry or in the advancement of film.  But when a film is a classic because it is apparently just good, one should be able to dislike it.  ""All About Eve""  is just plain boring.  It was on AFI's 100 Greatest Films and won multiple Academy Awards, including best picture, but it is one of the hardest movies to sit through.  It is supposed to be a satire on the theater world and ultimately acting in general, but it isn't funny.  It is slowly paced, which isn't necessarily bad, because ""A Man Escaped"" is very slowly paced, but it works for the tone.  But in a comedy-drama, the pace should be an in-between.  Comedies are usually fast paced and dramas are usually slower, but ""All About Eve"" can't really find it's zone.  Which again can be brilliant, as in ""Pulp Fiction"". Two entirely different films, yes, but similar in that they don't have a distinct genre.  Regardless, ""Eve"" will be forever etched in film history as a wonderful movie and it doesn't matter what anybody really thinks now.

The film received an unprecedented 14 Oscar nominations (a record unbroken until TITANIC) and walked away with 7 Oscars, including Best Picture of the Year. Joseph L. Manckiewicz, for the second year in a row, won dual Oscars for directing and writing this sparkling comedy drama about an aging actress named Margo Channing (Bette Davis), who befriends a star struck fan named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) who we slowly learn has her own agenda in befriending her idol. This film is an on-target skewering of the New York theater scene and the poor souls who toil in it. Davis and Baxter are both flawless and were both nominated for Best Actress. George Sanders won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as an acid-tongued theater critic named Addison DeWitt, who becomes a prime player in the delicious twists this story takes. Gary Merrill plays Bill Sampson, a theater director and Margo's much younger lover. Hugh Marlowe (in probably the most significant role of his insignificant career) and Celeste Holm play Lloyd and Karen, the playwright who writes almost exclusively for Margo and his wife, Margo's best friend. There are also memorable turns by Thelma Ritter as Margo's housekeeper and a very young Marilyn Monroe as Addison DeWitt's ""protegee"", Miss Casswell. The cast all work at the top of their game, thanks to inspired direction, but it is the screenplay that is the real star of this classic. I can't think of another movie in history with dialogue that sparkles and dances the way it does here. Mackiewicz's Best Screenplay Oscar was richly deserved. His Best Director Oscar primarily stemmed from having a perfect cast. Ironically, Claudette Colbert was originally slated to play Margo but had to drop out due to an injury, twist of fate that allowed Bette Davis to give the most amazing performance of her career which should have won her an Oscar as well. A true classic in every sense of the word...don't miss this one.",

It was so very well sugar coated that the coating felt like the real crust of the character. It was all about Eve but Bette Davis had the strongest character in the movie, her performance in the party scene towards the middle of the movie is the most enjoyable part of the movie since that's when all the characters in the movie come into one frame and you can see the real dynamism between them all. The movie moves fast for a drama based movie and there is hardly a weak link in the movie. So enjoy!",

I kind of forgot about this, and today they emailed me asking for my mailing address. I asked if they needed my purchase invoice or pictures of the set or anything like that, they said they didn't. They were incredibly friendly over these emails. I guess I'll wait and see if the new All About Eve set is the right one, but they said it will arrive in a few weeks.

The fun revolves around the astute perception that actors never stop acting and it could be argued that we are all actors. Proof is offered in that Margo Channing (Bette Davis) marries the director Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) who loves and comforts her and, in the meantime, Gary Merrill divorced his wife, Barbara Leeds, in Mexico on July 28, 1950 and married Bette Davis that same day.

The last forty five minutes have a great payoff, a great plot twist, and a great way to tie the whole story together. I loved the British theater critic, Addison DeWitt (George Sanders). Such a great character. Ruthless ambition and lust for power and fame and fortune; a great cynical depiction of show business.

272,12 July 2016,avik-basu1889,8, The Magic of the Theatre !!!,"'A Letter to Three Wives' was the only other Joseph L. Mankiewicz film that I had seen before watching 'All About Eve'. One can easily find links between the two films in terms of an auteur's style. In both films one can find an immense priority being laid on the writing and the dialogue which is very sharp and witty, instead of directorial flair in terms of visuals,although there are subtle moments of visual storytelling. Both the films share the storytelling techniques like the voice-over narration and flashbacks. I had thought that 'A Letter to Three Wives' felt very much like a stage play. The same has to be said vociferously about this film. Not only does it have a distinct play- like style when it comes to the storytelling and the showy, dramatic acting, but the film is also about the world of theatre itself. 'All About Eve' is in both ways a love letter to the theatre as well as a scathing attack on its players.",

278,14 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Birds of a feather flock together,"Eve attracted and used four people with his brilliant mind, unremitting efforts, pure appearance, and merciless use of all things, the famous actor Margo and his director boyfriend Bill, the famous playwright Richard and his housewife wife Karen.
Please watch the video for the specific process. I wo n't go into details here. To tell the truth, when one third started to be bad, I was anxious and angry and could n't watch it anymore. This film was really watched in two.
Now that I want to come here, it's really a three-point shot. For fame and fortune, I can really say that everything is extremely useful. She can even ignore herself, how can she take care of others? Su Dongpo and Zhang Dun traveled together that year. When they saw the father leaving a message at the cliff regardless of his life, he lamented that the father could kill people in the future. The same is true for Eve, who has already thrown himself, and only fame and fortune are his goals.
But when you really abandoned everything to bring fame and fortune to you, you found out that the four places are desolate, friends are already like strangers, and the surrounding vultures are around. Mr. Dewey knows everything about her is lethal, younger and more beautiful One after another, welcome to the game field.
So are the two women in the four really so innocent? Their anger may come more from how an old river like me could be deceived for so long by being blind? Margo's four-year-old Shakespeare play knows how to hype. No class experience but many years of experience, rich resources, and the blessing of drama director boyfriend. Along the way, I am afraid that she has used less than Eve. In the face of reality, she finally confessed that she was old and no longer suitable for those young characters. What she lost for ascending to the peak now seemed extremely precious and urgently needed. Those sloppy and unreasonable troubles were just a means to retain her love The anger and frustration of youth perishable, and finally she no longer stubbornly, listened to her heart, and pursued her love. She admits that no matter how many careers a woman has in her life, no one can escape from being a woman. Respect your choice. There are many precedents for women at home and abroad during the peak period, and they will also be there in the future.
Karen, Dewey's assessment is that, by her origin, there is absolutely no chance to have a place at today's banquet. At that time she was just a college student, Richard went to their school to give a speech, the next year she became Mrs. Richard. Is it love at first sight or intentional, maybe all. Karen said that my husband likes my qualities. He has long been accustomed to it. Karen is just a housewife. Her husband is blatantly hooked up in front of her. She has no effective counterattack. She just quits silently. It is Margo 's at this point. Giant baby crying is more impactful. If it were not for Dewey to stop it, although he did not have any good intentions to stop it, Mrs. Richard might be about to replace him.
Fortunately, both men ended up with one. Although they were stunned in the middle, in the end, the cliff ended, only those who had seen evil, even if they lived in the sun, they would still feel cool.
Dewey rarely sees people who are as good as his own. It reminds me of the feeling of a beautiful woman in troubled times. We are a class of people with endless desires and endless talents. We despise all living beings and yearn for love and being loved. From then on you belong to I. Haha, let the two of you fall in love with each other. Looking back, both of them are masters of hype.",

It comes known that Eve will backstab and nearly destroy anything and anyone in her path to get what she wants, which is fame and glory on the stage and screen. At first seeming like a young and innocent girl hungry to learn and grow, it becomes much more apparent that Eve is mostly a status hungry troublemaker.

290,4 February 2023,ksdilauri,10," Worthy of the term ""Classic""","It's kind of fascinating reading some of the negative comments on IMDb , although negatives are clearly in the minority for this classic. Presumably they feel the same about most movies made before, say, 1960--as one unimpressed commenter put it, 'everybody looks alike and you can't tell them apart', particularly in B&W. (A rather superficial viewpoint, but granted---guys back then were all wearing suits and hats, all looked like they were at least 37, and in lesser films they did tend to blend together.) But such a view is sad, because they're missing some great performances, writing and directing. ""Eve""' has all of these things, and deserved every one of its then-record 14 Oscar noms. Most agree that Davis' performance here is the crown jewel of her career and should have snagged her that year's Oscar (although Anne Baxter's Eve matched her blow for blow) but the supporting cast is sterling as well......and for the record, the guys do not all look alike and you can tell them apart. The whole cast carries off Mankiewicz' clever dialogue superbly---no small feat. As this depraved old world turns on, most younger people are unable to recognize a drama about Broadway backstabbing that isn't filled with profanity, sex and probably a fair amount of nudity. In fact, they aren't even needed, and instead of those things ""All About Eve"" employs a witty script, strong direction and a perfect cast. It's a must-see for anybody who loves Old Hollywood.",

The performances by Bette Davis as Margo, Celeste Holm as Karen and Anne Baxter as Eve are incredible. Their performances are effortless. The main theme of this film is doing anything to get what you want. This is back-stabbing at its best. Eve gets herself entrenched into Eve's life and slowly takes over. The only person to see her for what she is in the beginning is Birdie, played superbly by Thelma Ritter, who is Eve's assistant. She makes people feel sorry for her and then uses them to get what she wants. Karen is put into the middle of the trouble when Margo starts to see Eve for what she is. Karen ends up betraying Margo, unintentionally, and gives Eve the big break she has been looking for. She ends up making a pact with Eve to help Margo but Margo saves her from being beholden to her. This film uses lighting to help with the theme. In the beginning of the film Eve is shown in soft light-almost as if the lighting was filtered. Margo, on the other hand, is shown in a harsher light. This is to show Margo's age and to emphasize that Eve is the younger of the two and that Margo is reaching a crossroads in her career as far as age goes. . As the film goes on I noticed Margo looking softer and Eve looking harder. At the end Margo is seated at the awards dinner looking happy and when we see Eve in her hotel room she looks hard and unhappy.",

Rather than being clever, sometimes what they were saying seemed inscrutable. But, one thing I cannot fault was the acting. The film was impeccably cast- bette Davis of course towers over her co stars in this movie. She is strong, assertive, but sometimes vulnerable and acutely aware of her flaws and her conceit. Similarly, Anne Baxter is also disingenuous to a fault, putting up a veneer of false humility hiding her cunning, duplicitous schemes. George Sanders is also first rate- he has a booming deep baritone voice which lends gravitas to his character as a sly but powerful man. The pacing however seemed a bit odd- the film seems 30 minutes over long, and while the film is designed to be particularly dialogue and character driven, I do feel the plot is overly slight. My reservations with All About Eve are palpable but I did enjoy the film- it is an amoral tale of the theatre and its vainglorious, paranoid Actors and Actresses, it's cunning upstarts, and its other morally dubious characters. Audiences more attentive and more observant than I was would however discover more- I do not doubt that given the overwhelming positive reception, they have discovered a majestic, witty, engaging and absorbing story expertly acted.",

Then Celeste Holm, who is sensitive and moving as a playwright's wife.

A total that has been equalled once but never surpassed. AND THE GREAT BETTE DIDN'T WIN!! DAYLIGHT ROBBERY!! True, she had formidable competition this year, particularly from Gloria Swanson in her comeback ""SUNSET BOULEVARDE"" and taking nothing from the thoroughly deserved Best Actress winner Judy Holliday for the comedy classic BORN YESTERDAY, nor from EVE herself, Anne Baxter. But Bette is utterly mesmerizing, and with a gallery of exceptional performances around her, in the end it's hers we all remember. With a plethora of outstanding films and performances prior to this and luckily for her fans, with many more to come, Margo Canning remains her best ever delineation. Perhaps Baxter, in the title role that gives full range to her own talents, from sweet to spitefullly manipulative, took votes from Bette. But that's no excuse for this outlandish oversight on the Academy's behalf. The deliciously malevolent dialogue is spat out with glee by both leading ladies as well as by George Sanders (an utterly deserving Oscar winner) & the ever delightful Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe, in a small role, made sure she was noticed too among the fireworks.  And let's not forget the stellar work of Celeste Holm & Gary Merill. Not to be missed, and repeatedly to be enjoyed, ALL ABOUT EVE is unquestionably the best ever film about the behind the scenes machinations of the acting world. In fact, IT IS THE BEST EVER FILM.",

Occasionally a few lines slip into slightly corny territory but that may simply be a matter of 50's sensibilities clashing with modern expectations of how a character might speak.

The twist in plot revealed by George Sanders' character made me think about all the events that happened earlier in the movie differently; mainly about Eve's intentions and attitude towards the rest.

The dialogue still seems smart and funny. the off-screen affair between Bette Davis & Gary Merrill probably added to the obvious chemistry between them on screen. Marilyn Monroe is the perfect scene stealer, but is hardly alone with other supporting cast members like Thelma Ritter, who easily dominates her few scenes as Davis' dresser. Although Davis was the star and the story revolves around here and ""Eve"", its George Sanders who steals the show. His long, confrontational speech with Anne Baxter near the end of the film is easily one of the best things about the film. I wonder how the subtext of lesbianism and homosexuality (Addison DeWitt's obvious ""beardsmanship"") got past the censors. Perhaps it was the heavy handedness of Davis' character's desire for a husband that overshadowed it. Margo Channing's willingness to give up the stage seems a bit overdone, even for its era and is the one false note in the film, especially coming from an iconoclast like Davis.

334,28 May 2023,julibufa,5, I just don't care.,"All About Eve is a monstrous movie that has inspired numerous works for the past fifty years. The story surrounds Broadway and all the characters are theatre people or adjacent to them. The reason for its popularity to me lies in a most interesting proposition: Bette Davis in her undisputed best performance plays an actress called Margo Channing who meets the titular Eve, a fan of hers who sneakily tries to get into the world of acting, upstaging Margo. Eve's slow turn from admirer to saboteur gives the film a pulse, although Anne Baxter's performance gives her away too soon. Despite what I read in other reviews, I never sympathized with Eve because Baxter doesn't sell the devotion that she is supposed to have for Margo organically. She only has two modes: the obsessed compliant fan & the cold ambitious understudy. Written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, it begins with three or four characters expressing thoughts through voice-over narration. This persists but is done very sporadically throughout the picture, rendering it inconsistent regarding its pace and gimmicks.",

There is an acting award involved in the beginning of the film, and indeed both these actresses received accolades for the movie. One should pay close attention to the theme. The direction is outstanding, and the acting is superb. No one can argue with the success of the performers in this film, and the DVD is a clearly superior one.

Margo is so vulnerable yet none of her friends really want to see that side of her... and the men are idiots. Even after Eve is exposed for what she is-- a lying bitch-- they STILL rally to have her star in their play, just because she's a fine actress and will make money for them: Lloyd, Bill, Max-- they all succumb! Margo is the least cynical person in this movie, because her character is colored with lots of shadings. She's not just ""playing Bette Davis.""

From the time it started, I was hooked into a marvellous cast, screenplay, and direction. I had never watched a Bette Davis film before, but I tell you, this ones a great one to start with. Her performance is certainly Margo, she just says every word with a 'stardom' feel about it-- especially when she says ""A milkshake?"", that is one line that I always carry with me. Anne Baxter makes a good effort as Eve, but only really when she is alone, she acts really well, but she is often over shadowed by Bette Davis. Celeste Holm also makes a good performance, many of her scenes are flawless, though there is that Davis problem. I still applaud Celeste for a good stab at it. I'd also like to recognize Thelma Ritter, I just adore her delivery of her character. I think that's an easy character to base anyone on, and Thelma did it with a cool calm approach. The other stars did well, but I admire the women's performances a lot more, since it's really a womens film!!

In the film Eve's main concern is to get ahead. I feel as though many people could relate to this because in many cases in order to get ahead in your own career it is necessary to con your way in. People in today's society scheme their way into jobs they don't deserve. Many like Eve purposely sabotage others in order for them to have their big break. I found it a little ironic that for a while Eve was able to keep the act of a good assistant, showing her true talent for Broadway acting without really knowing it. This movie is very good, and despite its negative reflection on society it was a movie that I enjoyed.

Additional fine performances are given by Celeste Holm, as Margo's best friend and the wife of the director (Hugh Marlowe) who directs just about all of Margo's plays, and George Sanders who plays Addison DeWitt an acerbic theatre critic who's onto Eve's machinations but supports her nonetheless. A small part, her first, was performed by Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell, a young actress trying to break into show business with the help of Addison DeWitt. The film has everything: great acting, humor, a wonderful story line and certain lines that have become quoted over and over again, like ""Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.""

Hollywood, the propaganda vehicle in those days, needed to dress up the shabby role of ""happy little housewife"". And so, one sees slickly corrupted presentations of Friedan's problem. ",

364,25 July 2019,ranisharmamumbai,8, Outstanding,One of those movies that stays with you afterwards. So very well acted by both Davis and Baxter. The storyline is timeless- be careful what you wish for!,
365,11 May 1999,debategod,10, They don't make them like they used to,This is one the greatest movies I have ever seen. (And I have seen a lot close to 1000 last time I checked)Anne Baxter is unforgettable as a quiet little theatre lover who turns into a a woman who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.  Bette Davis is well... Bette Davis she is the best and she ought to be claimed as the #1 actress of all time.  The writing is superb with lots and lots of one liners for Bette to make herself look superior.  If you haven't seen this movie yet go and buy it (not rent it buy it) because as soon as you see it you will want a copy of your own.,
366,24 April 2023,decalderonne,8, Anne Baxter is a Star among Stars here!,"The only reason I'm not giving this film 10 out of 10 stars as some fans have is because it would have been nice to receive a bit more information about Eve's background - perhaps even a flashback or two. As perfect as the revelation scene between Eve and Addison is from an acting standpoint, there is a bit of a disconnect between the brewery episode mentioned and Eve's dramatic aspirations. Was the brewery an interruption of her acting ambitions, or did she fall back on her acting dreams after leaving the brewery?",
367,8 November 2013,pvivek-371-866361,9, Brilliant Dialogues and Surprising Storyline,"The storyline is one of the most original and beautiful ones ever written for the big screen The dialogues are sharp and witty. So the Oscars for writing and screenplay is spot on The way the movie moves, the audience (at least me) is held in rapt attention and never once does the pace drop or the intrigue lose intensity. So the Oscar for direction is also rightfully deserved. If there was an award for looking beautiful on screen, it should have gone to Bette Davis. But unfortunately it is for acting and that no one got except Mr. Dewitt. I am not too sure about this.",
368,10 July 2005,peggya1,10, One of Hollywood's greatest films,"I agree with the above comment. It's redundant to repeat the prior praises; however the fact that Bette Davis did't win the Oscar for best actress is because Anne Baxter refused to be entered in the Oscar race as ""best supporting actress."" As she was quoted, the movie is not called. ""All About Margo."" Had she done so, they both would have captured Oscars. George Sanders certainly deserved his Oscar as the ""I love to hate you"" theater critic who enabled Eve to rise to stardom. All the other players in the cast were great too. Even Marilyn Monroe is good in her small role as a sexy, air-headed actress wannabe. It is an excellent script that holds one's attention throughout. There is a little something in it for everyone. It is my understanding that that the restoration ""pros"" stated that had they had to chose only one film to save, it would have been ""All About Eve.""",
369,24 June 2003,Jammin024,10, My Favorite Movie!,"I love All About Eve!  The script, direction and actors are all amazing! Bette Davis was at her peak in this movie.  Everyone does such an amazing job.  Celeste Holm is a little ""cheesy,"" but still gives a great performance as Karen Richards.  If you've never seen this movie before, go and see it right away!  You will not be disappointed.",
370,3 October 2022,lu-50527,5, I don't like her,Can't Margo just say that? And everything would be ok?,
371,1 January 2022,smirnoff_artist,5, Could end sooner.,"Pretty good performances and clever dialogue. No need to mention the pros of the film, but... I could never get around the fact that from the moment Margo realizes that something is wrong with Eve, doesn't just tell her to leave the house... This thing ruined the film from me. It is a shame to compare this film to a masterpiece like ""Sunset Blvd."".",
372,1 March 2012,h-macgraw000,7, Good film,"The ambitious Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing (Bette Davis) and her friends Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe); her boyfriend and director Bill Sampson (Gary Marrow); and the producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), believe that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business.",
373,12 May 2019,sharmairika,9, Good Movie,"It is similar to a good many films that have gone before it, but Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed the picture, has been so ingenious in his treatment of the subject that he has come up with a thoroughly entertaining movie.",
374,6 February 2014,mcgrud02,8," Broadway legend Margo Channing (starring Bette Davis), is aging but not gracefully, has everything: a successful career, close friends, a man who loves her.","After watching the film, I came up with the conclusion that the theme is female sexuality. Eve has no problem befriending women, and then stabbing them in the back by trying to sleep with their men. She pretends that she is innocent, but she uses her sexuality to get anything she wants. Flush with success, Eve reveals her true colors. First, she propositions Bill, but he turns her down. Next she blackmails Karen into arranging more starring roles for her. Then she seduces Karen's husband. This repression of sexuality is what gives her the ability to manipulate successfully. If you like the 1957 movie ""A Face in the Crowd"", you should like this movie too. Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight.",
