0,31 August 2005,JamesHitchcock,10, Life is Starting to Imitate Satire,"Life is starting to imitate satire. ""The Truman Show"" was only made seven years ago, but it predates the current mania for so-called ""reality"" television shows such as ""Big Brother"". The idea behind such shows is that they present the viewer with a slice of actual reality- real people in real situations with real emotions- rather than the simulated reality of drama or the edited reality of documentaries. The flaw in this idea is that nothing is more unreal than a reality show. The presence of the cameras has a distorting effect, inducing artificial behaviour patterns in those who appear in front of it, and the sort of people who star in such programmes are almost invariably eccentric exhibitionists. ""The Truman Show"" takes the central concept of reality TV shows one stage further in order to overcome this flaw: what would happen if we made a reality programme about a person who has absolutely no idea that he is appearing on television? Truman Burbank is an insurance executive, living in a small American seaside town called Seahaven, and happily married to a nurse named Meryl. Or at least he thinks he is. What Truman doesn't know is that he is the central character in a soap opera and that his whole life is a fiction. The company he works for does not exist. Seahaven, the island it stands on and the surrounding ocean are all part of a gigantic set, specially created for the programme and sealed off from the outside world in a gigantic geodesic dome. Everyone in Truman's life- Meryl, his mother, his colleagues at work, his best friend Marlon- are actors playing out their roles in his drama.",/
1,19 July 2019,skepticskeptical,9, Prophetic,"The Truman Show is a film I never got around to watching until now, despite having heard references to it here and there over the past ... twenty years?! Now that I have seen it, I am somewhat glad that I waited, because from this vista, twenty years later, it really seems prophetic. Think about all of the children who were born after the ascendance of the internet. Many of their lives are not unlike Truman´s life: every moment captured for all the world for all of time.",r
2,16 February 2014,planktonrules,9, A good film for those who think they hate Jim Carey.,"I have never liked Jim Carey's humor. I have found it to very broad and boorish. However, I was very happy that I saw ""The Truman Show"" and am surprised I did considering my feelings about his earlier 'comedies'. Thankfully, Carey showed he could act and NOT ham it up--a tribute to his native talents as well as the director and writer. With a weak director, Carey might have begun to seek laughs in 1001 crazy ways. Here, however, it's straight and quite endearing. I could talk about the plot, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this one. The bottom line is that don't assume because you don't like ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""Ace Ventura"" you won't love this film. And, I really loved ""The Truman Show"" and think it's a lovely film with a lot of heart and an awful lot of imagination.",e
3,10 March 2017,zkonedog,10, A Film Ahead Of Its Time,"When ""The Truman Show"" hit theaters in the summer of 1998, there was no such thing as reality TV. ""Survivor"", ""Big Brother"", ""Amazing Race"", or ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians""? All in the future. The fact that this film beat America to the reality-TV punch shows how much of a landmark production it truly was--ahead of its time, to be sure.",v
4,25 October 2019,MrPupkin,9," It's undoubtedly one of my favorite movies, the kind of movie that changes our lives, as well as looking like a long episode of Black Mirror.","As inventive and creative as Weir's staging is, The Truman Show wouldn't work without credible Truman. And Carrey carries off the tricky role with a chipperness that belies a deep-seeded longing for more in life than surface perfection in all this movie is one of my all time favorites.",i
5,12 June 1999,Altaira,10, Genius,"I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show.  He said, ""No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly.""  I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself.  Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person's movie.  If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!",e
6,9 April 2007,Mark1988,10, One of the Most Original Films Ever Made,"'The Truman Show' epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. This film is emotionally engaging, didactic, witty, dramatic and very unique. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Truman Burbank has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. What he doesn't know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality TV show of epic proportions.",w
7,10 July 2005,daveisit,8, Lawn Mowing At Its Best,"""The Truman Show"" owes a lot to the direction of Peter Weir. Weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars. Instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly. Just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you. So as you would imagine ""The Truman Show"" is another success.",/
8,20 March 2003,WriterDave,8, Ambitious and Entertaining Treatise on the Reality Media Creates for Us,"It's not often a Hollywood film arrives with such lofty ambitions as this. On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of ""Groundhog Day"" about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the ""stolen kiss on the beach at night"" and ""Cue the sun!""",r
9,1 February 1999,macpherr,10, Finally a movie that makes us think,"When I was a young adult on the search for my true self, religion and God; I found myself reading all kinds of books such as: Demian, Sidarta, Brave New World, 1984, the works of Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Bolvoir. The world of Truman Burbank certainly took me back to those days. I used to look at myself in the mirror and say out loud: ""I wonder if I am me? I wonder if everybody thinks the same shade of red when I say red? Why was I born? Why are my parents my parents? Why did God create the world? Will I get punished by God for thinking all these things?"" This is a deep movie, bound to become an art film.  Jim Carey did such a superb job that it earned him a Golden Globe Award. This is definitely an Oscar contender. It made me think! What a suprise! Movies do not make me think very often. They are predictable to me now. Could it be age?",w
10,3 July 2005,moviemanMA,10, Tru(man)ly remarkable!,"Have you ever thought you were being watched? Like you life was possibly a Television show? Well, Truman Burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a TV show.",3
11,22 April 2007,hankhanks12345,10, Brilliant. One of the most interesting films of the last 10 years,"""The Truman Show"" is a rarity in Hollywood - or movies in general - a film that actually makes the audience think, and is about ideas. How do we know what we see is real? Why do we accept what is around us without questioning it? What would happen if we found out that a fundamental we were making about the world turned out to be completely wrong? You'd think a movie that was about those things would be a chore to get through, but in fact ""The Truman Show"" is great fun. I certainly wouldn't call it a comedy (although there are a few light moments here and there), but it's not too heavy and goes down easy.",8

13,28 May 2011,ElMaruecan82,10," ""It's Live! It's Live!""...","With ""The Truman Show"", released in 1998, Peter Weir delivers a brilliant satire about the excesses of reality shows, with a prophetic relevance disguised under a misleading comedic mask. ",0
14,16 May 2021,aidanratesmovies,10," Good Afternoon, Good Evening, and Goodnight","One of the most creative films ever conceived, let alone made and executed- The Truman Show is on all fronts an absolutely perfect film- and will stand the test of time as an absolute classic. On every singular level this film works astoundly- jim Carrey provides a pitch perfect performance as our titular star Truman Burbank- in an incredible casting decision that I am sure turned a lot of heads at the time. Yes we see some of that classic Carrey throughout the film- but the man can act, and never before had it been brought to such attention as it had with this film- and he captures his role perfectly. The other actors do an excellent job as well, namely Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone- as well as Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich. The direction is fantastic, and much needed for the creative vision of the film at hand. The script is not only well done, but incredibly thought provoking, original, and brilliantly put into flm format. The music is fantastic, letting us feel so much emotion from such simple and classic pieces of work. The pacing is excellent, and the film leaves you with a smile and you wanting more- as I think any good film should. In the end, I have absolutely no complaints about The Truman Show. I've seen it more times than I can count, and it's easily one of my favorite films out there. Its a creative masterpiece that is unlike anything we would ever see today, or anything before it. It may be 20 years old, but The Truman Show may just be one of the most brilliant and influential films ever made.",2
15,30 March 2006,itamarscomix,10," Oh, and in case I don't see ya","With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.",5
16,11 January 2013,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,8, Very engaging even for non Jim Carrey fans,"As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.",8
17,13 September 2016,wlay-81852,9, Very good!,"I've seen The Truman Show a multitude of times, and each time it gets better. First watching it at a young age (Roughly 10 years old), I never picked up on much of the deeper meaning behind the film. The idea of someone's whole life being a television program was simply entertaining. Now, as an older viewer and with more experience in analyzing books and movies, I can really pick up on the satirical meaning behind the plot. Truman plays the star of a 24/7 television program. His entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see. He is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect ""island"". Throughout the film, we watch as Truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life, and as he attempts to escape. The struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message. The world is trying to oppress you, and although difficult, you can escape. This is supported by a statement made by the creator of the Truman show. He said, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It's as simple as that"". Several other hidden messages (Ideas) appear throughout the film. All the actors who play roles in Truman's life, are indeed fake. Despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie, the actors/actresses show no emotion for Truman. This is comparable to the lack of care society has for the majority of its citizens. Overall, The Truman Show is filled with subliminal messages and hidden meanings, all of which can be directly tied back to daily life.",/
18,15 December 1999,kingoham5,10, A True American Classic,"When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.",?

He would love to go to Fiji but he is trap on the island by a fear stemming from a childhood trauma. It turns out his whole life is manufactured by TV artist Christof (Ed Harris). The Truman Show is the most popular TV-series in the world. His wife Meryl is played by actress Hannah Gill (Laura Linney). His best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) along with everybody in the town as well as the town itself is completely fake. Even his childhood trauma was manufactured. Questionable things keep happening.

23,20 February 2005,EThompsonUMD,10, Great combination of social satire and philosophical allegory.,"The Truman Show may be approached on one level as social satire exposing the emptiness of an American Dream defined by consumerism and purveyed by the electronic media over the last half century. Life in ""Seahaven,"" the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such '50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Show's satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).",=

This movie was stunning. What was so amazing was the fact that they let you in on the secret pretty early instead of leaving it as a twist. So instead of finding out at the end of the movie that it was all staged we find out relatively early which leaves us something else to look forward to: will he ever find out? And if he does, what will he do? ",u
28,6 November 2019,bowmanblue,9, Life eventually imitated art?,"I remember hearing the briefest of synopsis of 'The Truman Show' in a film magazine that was promoting the next year's upcoming movies. It just read, 'Jim Carrey discovers he's a character in a TV show.' I have to say that that description hardly blew me away as I didn't know what to make of it. Saying it like that makes it sound much more simple and goofy than it really is.

30,14 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Peter Weir, Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, wow wasn't I in for a treat?","After being blown away by Fearless, I set out to see more of Peter Weir's work. Along the way I came across The Truman Show. After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

35,22 November 2019,acedj,8, Carrey's first serious role,"This is the first movie I saw where Jim Carrey plays it pretty straight laced and goes more dramatic. This movie is about the ultimate Big Brother television show. Truman Burbank is adopted by a network and his life is on full display 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all without his knowledge. He lives in a giant dome that recreates an island town. To prevent him wanting to leave, as a small child they instill a deep, fierce fear of the water. Every resident of the town is an actor, some of them having been there for the majority of their lives. Every interaction of his life is scripted as best they can, until one day Truman gets an inclination that not is all as it seems. While Truman struggles to find the truth, the world watches on.
While I have enjoyed watching this movie many a time, it does have one flaw, to me.Laura Linney, an actor that I have in all her other roles, seems miscast to me in the part of Truman's forced happy wife. Laura typically plays such a strong female lead that perhaps it was just her having to play an actress cowed into catering to Truman, a person she clearly dislikes, was what I did not like about her here. Were it not for this small flaw I would have given this 10 stars. This is a great look at mass consumption of media and the ultimate greed that is at the core of the human species.",

40,18 October 2020,ironhorse_iv,9, The Truman Show is truly in the limelight. It's worth viewing!,"Inspired by 'The Twilight Zone' 1989 episode titled ""Special Service"". This 1998 comedy drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol tells the story of a well-liked small-town insurance salesman, Thurman Burbank (Jim Carrey) slowly finding out that his whole seemingly idyllic life has been a television sitcom that been airing globally around the clock. Without spoiling the movie too much, the influenced of classic 1950s good wholesome American values tv shows are very noticeable on the film's choose of locations, sets and costume design; along with the highly comedic satire style of camera work materialistic commercialism, included with the Cold War fear of visual eavesdropping. The motion picture truly does look like we're viewing our eyes through a colorful Norman Rockwell socially conservative painting at times under its many different surveillance like techniques. Even when the film is looked upon with modern day foresight. Seeing the film through pov cameras in buttons, car radios and mirrors was a very unique watch even if it's a bit over gimmicky and wonky at times. It really does mirror the rise of mass domestic surveillance within America during the late 20th century; as well as the public interest in straightforward voyeurism reality-based television like 'Big Brother'. Both eerily haunting and comedic satire foreshadowing. Well done shooting. Then there are religious analogies. While Truman is viewed from some audiences as Christ like. Even the scene where Truman walks along 'the sky' in the end makes it look like he's walking on water. I think he's more like Adam before the great awakening. The town of Seahaven can be viewed as the modern day Eden with the show creator Christof (Ed Harris) as the patriarchal overlord version of god from the old testament; trying to prevent the 'true man' from having too much free will and being enlighten from the dangerous temptations of the outside world by the woman in red Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), the Eve of the story. Much like Yahweh and the stories of the Great Flood, Christof kept Truman in check by instilling Aquaphobia fears. Other people viewed this act more as a false god or antichrist like the antagonist name suggest, because the deceitful ways he operates. Regardless I'm not really please with those audience members who has taken this movie's interpretations to the extreme often with antisemitism or racist results. I doubt that hatred for a certain people or religion is what the film was going for. Despite that horrible thinking from some, the visuals of Christof's backstage control room are just as rich as the Seahaven set. After all, it has a cameo of composer Philip Glass playing the piano. His score for the film was beautiful. Anyways, you also start to notice a lot more subtle hints that something is not quite right with the studio production in the moon. Foremost, the idea that Christof's value his privacy so much over others to the point, that he crafty hangs up calls from the Hague in order to avoid facing different international judicial bodies for the human rights violations shows how self-sighted he is. The legal problems must be so vast that employees of his are viewing the classifies for other means of work. To add onto that, the majority of the mishaps that happen in the film can be explained by the creator's lazy short sights such as the lack of updating the dome like unfinished bridges to mean Truman's modern standards and allowing camera crew to fool around with basketball hoops and treadmill while working. Along with that, the whole Tru Talk sequence with Christof really does explained a lot without going overboard into lecture dump territory. It gave enough information to suspend our disbelief even if producing a show like this is nearly impossible. It was so well done that the filmmakers use part of the interview for the opening, along with other footage of the inworld cast talking about their roles in a once separate marketing behind the screen mockumentary. While this decision kinda does hurt the suspense as the audience is waiting a while for Burbank to catch up. Revealing Truman's world as a show in the beginning was indeed the right choice. In truth, the filmmakers made a lot of good decisions in the editing like cutting away jarring moments like Truman confronting another homeless person. Honestly if they kept that scene, it would be super weird to think that the creator would allow performers to portray homeless people; seeing that Christof wanted Seahaven to seem like the ideal utopia. Wouldn't many of the show commerical sponsors be against that idea? Anyways, they made the right decision to have the real homeless guy Kirk (Brian Delate) just break into on set, instead of portraying one. Other story changes that work well was getting rid of the teenaged angst version of Thurman in a metropolis like urban settling with the staged rape scene and a boy dying from a car wreck. That's pretty dark. It's disturbing enough to see Thurman overly obsessed and desire a woman he only met one day. Seeing him stalk and make a photo of worship of her was a bit too much. Nevertheless, another great choice the filmmaker did was getting rid of actor Dennis Hooper in the antagonist and replacing him with Harris even if Ed wanted Christof to be a hunchback. Regardless the acting from all the cast was great. Another great decision was inserting moments of outside dome fans watching the show. While the structure can be seemed somewhat fragmented because of that. Nevertheless, it does enhance the film experience; especially in the Plato's ""The Allegory of the cave"" type ending. You'll find yourself rooting for Truman due to herd mentality by the end. The flick was so popular that even a syndrome was named after this movie. Overall: be adventurous, spontaneous & check this film out. It will certainly be worth your time.",

In the light of reality shows like BIG BROTHER, THE TRUMAN SHOW is effective in its depiction of an entire world obsessed with one specific television program, which is in itself the ultimate ""reality"" show as it shows the 24-hour day, 7-day a week life of the one guy who's not acting in a sea of fake appearances and pretend people. Blessed with excellent music and a fine, distinctly un-Hollywood director in Peter Weir, this is a film in which the concept can't fail. The script is witty and highly amusing at times, especially when real-life invades the fantasy world and has to be desperately explained away by the producers.",
45,17 September 2016,Tweekums,8, Jim Carrey is on top form in this satire on reality television,"Truman Burbank thinks he is an ordinary person doing an ordinary job in a fairly ordinary town... he does not realise that he is the star of a reality show. He has lived in the town of Seahaven all of his life; never suspecting that cameras are watching his every move and that everybody else, including his wife, mother and his friends are merely cast members and that the town itself is under a giant dome. Strange things occasionally happen but excuses are quickly made; for example a falling spotlight is explained away as something that fell from a plane. From an early age Truman has been conditioned so that he won't try to leave the town; the drowning of his father gave him a terror of the sea and any time he thinks about leaving an obstacle appears. Eventually he starts to realise that something is wrong and decides that he must leave to prove that he isn't paranoid.",

The script of the film ignores many details that even the most unbiased viewer pays attention to. But this is not done, the message of The Truman Show in another. There is a vivid reflection of modern society in this hypertrophied toy world. The work of Christophe's team reflects the state.

Next the cinematography was amazing though some critics called it ""awkward"" upon further re watch's I realized that the scenes with ""awkward"" cinematography was actually the hidden camera angles. Next the writing and plot the writing in the beginning feels like a cheesy sitcom yet later it really feels like the actors are freaking out when Truman is starting to realize that he is in a TV show and nothing is real. And the plot is one of last original plots ever created. And the scenes of the ""Director"" in the studio directing the music is a very good scene. And then there is the small details like how close the moon is to Earth and the hidden camera in Truman's ring. And then my favorite part of the movie other than the car scene is a quote that I use everyday ""Oh and incase I don't see you good afternoon good evening and good night"".",

The Truman Show is a film about a man called Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Who lives a normal life; with his normal job. But he is living in an abnormal world. Because Truman is living in his own world called sea heaven; sea heaven is actually a set and his home and job is all a lie. Truman has a world based around him and what ever he does the citizens of sea heaven have to go along with it. His Mum, Dad, Wife and even his best friend are all actors. The Truman show is filmed with the highest technology in cameras around. Small clip on cameras that can clip on to a jacket and not be seen. But when Truman sees that elevators have 4 men drinking tea in the back of them and that the radio has co-ordinates of his position on it he starts to get suspicious. The Truman Show has been nominated for three Oscars and has won three Baftas. Award winning director peter weir worked with paramount pictures to make this film a masterpiece.

Alongside Truman of course, the movie make you realise all the above and highlights the unfairness of the case.",
74,29 January 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8, Meaningful,"It's been about a decade since this film came out, and the sad truth is, the majority of people haven't learned. Reality TV is not dead, but has rather flourished, and is gradually becoming more and more perverse(indeed making the idea presented here seem almost tame by comparison, which is a very unpleasant notion to consider), digging deeper into the lowest common denominator to grab attention(worse still, it's working), and they are at least as shallow as they've always been, quite possibly worse(I won't claim that I watch them), and costing depth in real people, by abandoning it in favor of more ratings-grabbing ""entertainment"". Niccol is not a man who favors superficiality, or that which seems, at first glance, to be perfect, beautiful, or even right... nor is he one who keeps quiet about his view on said subject. One needs to look no further than two other movies he wrote, Gattaca and S1m0ne, both of which he also directed(he is perhaps less shrill in his protesting in the former and this, compared to S1m0ne). I've not watched much of Weir's work... to this day, only this and Dead Poets Society, which my review will immediately reveal, I did not find to be anything special. Therefore, I don't know whose idea it actually was to let the imaginary hidden cameras be our eye into the world of Truman... whether Niccol had it in the script, or Weir thought it fitting... but I commend and respect whomever thought of it. The score and music are fitting. The acting is good, all-round... Carrey surprises. Harris is marvelous. Carrey may have some sillier moments in this, but it is a film separate from his comedy work. Those seeking his typical brand of humor(which it should be noted, I am somewhat fond of) won't find that satisfied herein. Exposition is delivered with fairly good subtlety. The writing in general is excellent... Niccol hits the mark entirely, and maintains a realistic tone, steering carefully clear of the pitfall of mockery to the point of the ludicrous, which he would later fall into with S1m0ne, and his continued exploration of reality is interesting. I personally make it a point to keep up with what the man is working on. The satire and cleverness found in his work deserves recognition. This, as The Cable Guy, has some social commentary on the viewers, but on the whole, this is by far the superior film(sorry, Ben). It is but saddening that it would seem that the film caused exactly what it may have been trying to prevent. I recommend this to fans of science fiction, Andrew Niccol and Jim Carrey as a dramatic actor. 8/10",

The film begins with an interview with Christof (Golden Globe and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Ed Harris) winning, creator of the highly popular reality show called The Truman Show, along with cast members Hannah Gill playing Truman's ""wife"" Meryl (Laura Linney) and his best friend Noah (Noah Emmerich). Then we get to the main story, where since birth, Truman Burbank (Golden Globe winning Jim Carrey) has been the star of the show, only he doesn't know it, and he has lived in his fictional town filled with an all actors cast. On Day 10,909, a TV camera suddenly falls from the sky, and later on character Lauren, played by Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) tries to tell him that everything is fake and everyone is pretending. Very slowly more peculiar things happen to make him believe he is ""part of something"" (e.g. his wife promoting products, he sees his Dad who he saw die, the radio broadcasts his movement, he sees a film crew where the elevator is meant to be, characters circling the block, and when he tries to get away everything the makers can think of are stopping him). The network is the first to legally adopt a child, they have 5000 cameras watching Truman's every moment from the mundane to the monumental, they gave Truman a fear of water when his Dad ""drowned"", and they have no intention on ending. But when they think they have sorted everything bringing back Truman's ""father"" (Brian Delate), Truman tricks the camera and escapes, but not before they find him sailing away from the town. They attempt to scare and stop him with a storm, but he continues till eventually he reaches the studio edge (i.e. the sky). Christof talks to him for the first time when he sees the staircase and exit, and has a little heart to heart to try and make him stay, and when he asks him to say something because he's live to the whole world, Truman says his catchphrase ""In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"" and finally leaves. Also starring Holland Taylor as Truman's mother, Paul Giamatti as Control room director, Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer as Mike Michaelson and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Network executive. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Burkhard Von Dallwitz and Philip Glass, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture.

They believe that they alone are the center of the universe and everyone and everything that comes in contact with them exist for their own personal benefit and enjoyment. This isn't exactly the idea behind ""The Truman Show"", but it was close, as Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) was born and raised as a corporate entity and marketed to the world as the central character of a thirty year old, twenty four hour a day living soap opera. I guess the picture did the best job it could of providing the viewer with the rationale needed to make this concept work, like throwing up roadblocks in Truman's youth to steer him to certain conclusions about life and it's limitations. On closer examination however, some of those foundations begin to crumble. One of the biggest plot holes for me involved Truman's marriage to Meryl (Laura Linney). Even though presented with a simulated wedding photo showing Meryl's fingers crossed, my thoughts proceeded to the honeymoon and the consummation of their marriage.

It stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank whose life is an open book for anyone who wishes to watch. He is unaware of the hidden cameras that observe his every move since birth. Anyone who attempts to warn him of his peep hole existence thus sabotaging the show, are removed. Through space satellite program director Ed Harris has achieved the first fully televised human life. Everybody is an actor and Truman is gradually suspecting that something just isn't right. Triumphant masterpiece by director Peter Weir whose credits include Dead Poet's Society. Could Weir have predicted the influence his film would hail onto reality television? Filled with creative camera angles and art direction. Carrey delivers a sympathetic performance combined with comic wonder and bewilderment. He is the ultimate modern hero and champion. Harris is fantastic as creator Crissoff whose genius knows no limits until his creation challenges him. Laura Linney is bizarre as Truman's wife who speaks as if in commercials. Noah Emmerich plays his best friend who stocks bending machines. Natascha Mcelhone plays Sylvia who attempted to warn Truman of the reality of his lifestyle.

101,15 August 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10, Timeless classic,"Everyone at some point in their lives has been bothered by the notion that their surroundings are all an elaborate prank, that somehow every single human being but them is in on some giant impossible joke, watching their every move for strange and unthinkable purposes. What if my life isn't real? What if all my friends and family members aren't who they say they are, and I'm just part of some ungodly social experiment? What if my life as I've known it just isn't.. real? For Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) these concerns are very pressing, as he discovers throughout one of the most thoughtful, touching, creative and insightful films ever made. Director Peter Weir works with a script by Andrew Niccol to bring us this now timeless tale of a man existing in a patented pastel world that was never his own and always destined for him. Truman is the unwitting star of his own television show, inducted into its gargantuan studio set since the day of his birth, and conditioned to believe all his life that the people, places and events around him are in fact his real life. Cruel? Perhaps, but the film never takes sides, instead favoring wonder over analytical dissection, a wise move. Even the conductor of this whole absurd symphony, a prolific filmmaker played by Ed Harris, gets his moment of sympathy which can be read as preening ego or the desire to connect with his leading actor beyond the pixelated jumbo- tron he sits behind, depending on how you view the situation. Truman has a lovely wife (Laura Linney), a salt of the earth best friend (Noah Emmerich) and the perfect little white picket fence life. But none of it is real, or at least organic in the sense that every person deserves out of the womb. Truman is a rat in a very elaborate maze, but like anyone who's had the wool pulled over their eyes, eventually he begins to see lights of authenticity piercing the seams. Gradually he begins to sniff out the ruse, like a child losing their innocence, and questions the eerily idyllic life he has been given. The people, or rather, actors in his life react in different ways. Some panic, others stick to the script, and Harris sorrowfully watches his controversial creation awaken beyond his control. Carrey is a starry eyed revelation as Truman, in one of the most overlooked performances of the century. His arc is the stuff of dreams, spanning the lengths of naivete trapped in a bubble that bursts into affecting, starry eyed realization and wonder. Every moment is owned by him, every beat is resoundingly hit in flawless fashion. When a mysterious and beautiful defector (the luminous Natasha Mcelhone) enters his life to play the part of whistle-blower, it's the first genuine and non-puppeteered interaction he's had with a human being. Sparks fly high enough to reach the heavens, and it's the catalyst for a journey to find the self, the reason for his predicament, a world beyond the Lego brick suburbia he has known and the next step in his impossibly unique life. There's a piece of Truman embedded in every viewer beholding, and I believe that's why the film has held up for so long, and been beloved by so many. Every human being has insecurities as large as the fake sound stage that raised him from a pup. Every one of us has at one point felt the alienation he must have gone through upon realizing the truth. In a story so larger than life, we find the answers, or at least a modicum of such, to what it means being a person in this world. Carrey's Truman is an achingly relatable avatar of this and a direct conduit into the essential. Couldn't have picked a better actor to bring all of this to life. Couldn't have made a better film about it. A classic. Good morning, and in case I don't see you: good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.",

We, as the viewers, are treated to three different perspectives: Truman's World, Christof's World and the rest of the world who have been watching Truman's life unfold since the day he was born. Beyond the creepy, suburbanesque world that Christof created for him is the real world where billions of people watch him day in and day out. One thing that movie does extremely well (although I don't think it was the first) is how eerily prescient it is in predicting the nature of reality TV and its effect on our culture.

This was a good development of his determined, and very go getter type of personality.

120,31 July 2019,garethcrook,8, Was nothing real?,"Jim Carrey is an odd one isn't he. Much loved for his slapstick stylings, I've never really warmed to that side of him. The Truman Show is different. Yes there's Carrey's silly side, but here it makes perfect sense in his fictional world with every detail dialled up to eleventy-stupid. It's the sinister underbelly that's that lights the touch-paper though, it's ridiculously troubling, taking a baby, putting him on camera, cutting him off from the real world and fabricating a picket fence utopia without his consent or knowledge. It's the knowledge factor that's key for Truman, not his lack of, but his thirst for. This is Ed Harris' world, his character Cristof's idea of utopia and as Truman grows up, he outgrows the godlike creators vision. Sure there's love too, a longing for someone, but Truman is an explorer, it's in his soul and can't be contained or controlled. It's a film full of spirit, as well as chuckles and twilight zone drama, but it's the rooting for the underdog urge that makes me love this so much. Maybe we see ourself here somehow, don't we all sometimes imagine ourselves as the star in our own show and what is real in our consumer world anyway. ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented"", but we all know what's real and what's fake... well just about. This is a fun film, a simple premise, yet feeling utterly original and as over the top and grand as the world it displays. It's cinematic to the core, even boasting a Philip Glass score and is probably my favourite Carrey film (although Eternal Sunshine is great). A joyous ride to the end, with genuine heart in mouth moments. ""Was nothing real?""... well who knows!",

In the beginning of the movie, it really makes you think about life itself and it brought so many philosophical questions to my mind. Witnessing how the people he considered friends, and even his own wife didn't actually care about him was heartbreaking, as they were all just actors.
That being said I believe so much more could've been done because they had such a brilliant idea behind it. The ending really leaves you wondering and I just can't help but wish for more.

This film has a great atmosphere from the very beginning and never lets up. I had heard many different things about Jim Carrey's performance. All I can say is that this is the best performance of his career so far and shows that he is much more than just a great slapstick actor. Peter Weir has done an excellent job with this film and Andrew Niccol's screenplay is amazing. Don't go into this film looking for Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber, you'll only be let down.

It's an extremely unique idea, and it makes for a very ambitious film. It's the kind of idea that needs to be carefully executed because it's an easy one to fail to correctly portray, but the team behind The Truman Show did a fantastic job. At no point in this movie does it feel like it's dragging. At no point was I compelled to check the time on my phone.

No show lasts that long and this show would be rather dull one to watch. This one is at its best when it is more comedy oriented. Unfortunately, it is more of a drama and takes itself to seriously when it should be more fun to watch. Carrey does do a good job in the main role, but Ed Harris is just too bland for me.

Its a ending that leaves you wanting more
To see where truman goes from is escape. The film leaves you with so many questions. Like if Kristin had just let his love stay on set with him or figured away for him to have trips out of seahaven
Would he have stayed.. Truman show is definetly 1 of the greatest films ever made. You will beanle to watch time and time again.",
163,6 January 2005,ram-30,10, A story full of Christ symbols.,"The first time I watched ""The Truman Show"" when it came out in 1998 I was impressed with the story, a delightful Science Fiction tale, and with the acting, the movie proving that Jim Carrey could do more on the big screen than talk through his butt. When I revisited this film 5 or 6 years later, I was even more impressed. For one thing, this story has proved very prophetic. How many reality shows dominate the TV today? It also has many allegorical layers that I missed the first time. I think 5 years ago I had a sense of some attempt at symbolism in ""The Truman Show""; the Ed Harris character is CHRISTos, he's the creator and he's up above over seeing everything. However, the more I watch it, I see Truman Burbank as a Christ figure also: a man singled out, sacrificing his life for the sake of others, a man who knows he does not belong in this world, a man who ascends to his true home at the end of the story in fine ""resurrection"" style. There's even a scene where he appears to be walking on water. Again, it's an entertaining story on the surface level but like Truman himself I hope the viewers can rise above the surface and see a new world.",

Already this week, the CBS network is building up anticipation for Survivor 3: Africa and Big Brother 2 while other broadcast and cable networks follow with much of the same (MTV's REAL WORLD of a few years ago).  In the world of Truman Burbank, the all-seeing, all-knowing (supposedly) Christof plays ""God"" with maniacal gusto.  He's like the Grand Inquisitor in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. Director Peter Weir and Original Screenplay author Andrew Niccol have shown convincingly their audience that today's Pop Culture in the light of day is pathologically or at least neurotically obsessed with ""on-camera"" peers who have been manipulated into ""maze-like"" situations and problems. Mainstream TV audiences (according to ratings surveys) want to watch religiously as people are ""voted off"" or ""lose a challenge"" for a weekly dosage of bread and circuses.  From scene to scene, Truman gets tormented, teased and finally caught up in a deadly hurricane as his TV audience sits back and breathes sighs of relief.  He does have one true friend inside his tormenting contrived ""universe"": a beautiful informer-traitor named Sylvia/Lauren who cheers his efforts to find a real world apart from the Land of the Smirks, Patronizing Product Placements, and Constant Surveillance.

There has never been anything like it before! Jim Carrey is exceptional! Peter Weir, who did another movie on my top 3 list, Dead Poets Society, did a FANTASTIC job directing this story of paranoia! And of course, the script is brilliant. Jim Carrey should really be proud of himself for doing such a different role, and to star in a DRAMA-comedy. This movie is definitely on my top 3. That's funny, my top 3 movies all have something in common: Ethan Hawke is in Dead Poets Society and Gattaca, Gattaca was written by Andrew Niccol along with The Truman Show, and Peter Weir directed The Truman Show along with Dead Poets Society! (Note: I do not count the Star Wars movies on my top 3 list because I don't count those as movies, I count those as empire's.) I am very glad that this story had very little comedy elements in it.

In a ""post-truth"" environment where the leader of the free world is a former reality TV star, ""The Truman Show"" couldn't be more relevant.

Now I got a whole different story and I loved it even more than the first time. Truman is a man who has been imprisoned without knowing it for many years, and is the biggest star of the outer world. People have followed his life since the his birth to this day. It starts off with Truman clueless of what is going on, but the fake world around him is starting to catch up with him, and he suspects something isn't right. And when he meets a girl in the library she lets the secret out. She takes him to the beach to let him know everything, but its not long before the actors are called in to save the show. This time a man playing a dad to the girl, who saves everything by saying she is mentally ill and drives her away. Truman is left with nothing but questions and an ambiguous mind. He's doubting everything, questioning everything, and starts to think he is going insane. The director of the show is well prepared and got everything figured out to keep Truman in the pretend world that The Truman Show is reliant on. The smartest move of them all, was probably making him and his dad go sailing, killing the dad by creating a storm, and drown the dad. And that would sooner lead to a phobia of water, very clever since the town is surrounded by water, which would make Truman stay there forever. The hidden subjects about, The higher power/god, ownership of our own life and Ethics was in the back of my mind throughout the whole film. It would be unethical to keep someone imprisoned like that, not only that but to share his life with the whole world, showing no respect or giving Truman privacy. The idea of the story that the film is built upon is truly phenomenal, so intriguing. I can't imagine what I would have done if I found out I was the star of a show like ""The Truman Show"".",

195,16 April 2003,mhoney-1,10, Quite possibly the most intelligent allegory ever put on screen,"This is a perfect film. Andrew Niccol, a genius of frightening allegories(Gattacca, S1mone) created a brilliant story of a reality TV show(before we HAD reality TV shows) created by a demented genius known only as Christof(Ed Harris) about the life of Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey, in what is his first and best dramatic role--I can't believe he wasn't nominated!) who lives the American Dream in a picture-perfect island town. From the start, as you see that everyone he meets(or is supposed to meet) is an actor, and people are glued to the TV 24-7 to watch his life unfold. The movie is a frightening tale of manipulation, reality, environment, and a number of other things that haven't come to mind yet. Laura Linney, as Truman's ""nurse"" wife Meryl is hilarious when she picks up an object and speaks to the camera, advertising the item to the audience while Truman just watches, a little bewildered by her enthusiasm. Noah Emerich as Truman's beer-guzzling best friend comes up with some subtle yet humorous lines: ""You've got a DESK job! I'd kill for a desk job."" Natascha McElhone also shines as the girl who stole his heart, exposed him to the truth, and now is part of a minority of people protesting to free Truman. As Truman's suspicions arise about his life we feel with Truman, we become just as intrigued by his adventures as the people watching him on TV, and perhaps more compasionately. Ed Harris adds subtle charm to his character as a man who admires his art so much, and takes it so seriously, that he has come to forget that he's not God, and that Truman is a person just like everybody else. As long as he can keep him afraid of the water, Truman is a prisoner, never going to Fiji.",

204,7 May 1999,halnexus,10, **** (Out of four),"Some general comments about the grave injustice of this film being robbed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would obviously be unnecessary due to the high amounts of people demanding an explanation for the inexplicable lack of a Best Picture Oscar nomination for this film. So let me just go about in praising this film: ""The Truman Show"" was definitely the best movie of 1998 and one of the five best of the decade, behind ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Forrest Gump"".  What struck me about the film is just how meticulous everything was.  Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir really thought everything out to its fullest dimension!  It took me two viewings to appreciate this film's greatness, but the scene that will always strike me is just how carefully orchestrated Truman's moonlight stroll by the beach with Lauren/Sylvia is used to elicit an emotional reaction.  Chopin's ""Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Minor"" has never sounded so melancholy and beautiful as this wonderful scene, and the breathtaking imagery and careful build-up to Truman's makeshift assemblage of her face is one of the most impressive and subtle plot developments I have EVER seen. Weir does not bang us over the head with this film, unlike some films that were inexplicably crowned with the sheath of greatness (namely ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or ""Saving Private Ryan""...a well-made film, no doubt, but not the greatest war film ever made).  Whoever claims that this film could have been more missed the point of subtlety that this film was trying to get across...what did you want, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis suddenly appearing on the screen to deliver some Oliver Stone-style message on violence or the JFK conspiracy?  The film's climax is one of the most surreal and strangely moving pieces of cinema I have EVER seen, and just the way Carrey enunciates a pained ""Was nothing real?"" to Ed Harris was worth an Oscar nomination alone.  Give me Carrey's nuanced performance over the contortions and muggings of Benigni anyday, a trait he must have inherited from...Carrey himself!  Oh well, to give this film the recognition it deserves would be to misrepresent the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a sincere, incisive group of people instead of the smug and sanctimonious group of bootlickers they truly are.",

206,5 July 2010,lesleyharris30,10," A Clever, Unique, Well Acted Delight,","The Truman Show is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a stellar cast. You will never find a movie that is anything like it, it's incredibly unique, if any other film tried to imitate it they would be caught straight away, as we see a man's entire life filmed by a worldwide tekevsion show, unbeknownst to him. It really explores this interesting formula to a significant degree, unlike some movies that often fail to deliver their full potential, we see Truman disovering the truth about his world and struggling to uncover it, we also get to see the effect the Truman show has had on the world and, the most complex part of the film, how they have managed to make the show work for all the years of Truman's life, there was no aspect that felt unexplored. The cast is outstanding and were all very able to act with this unusual storyline, Jim Carrey delivers one of the finest roles of his career, being able to showcase his talent for both comedy and drama, he has some hilarious parts, but also plays a very complicated, complex character very effectively. Carrey is also joined by talents such as the great, underrated Ed Harris, playing a man obsesssd with the world he has created, Natascha McElhone shines as a woman who has fallen for a man she can never be with, while Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich play two actors struggling to hide the truth from Truman, stellar acting all around.

We get the fact that modern suburbia is supposed to look like a plastic paradise out of a TV commercial, but the colors here are tepid, the camera set-ups dull and unimaginative, and the direction mechanical and without a hint of inspiration. Jim Carrey, playing Truman (whose life is a TV show though he doesn't know it), shows off his dreaded ""range"" as a performer; he's always on-camera a second too soon and stays there seconds too long. This is also the fault of the director (Peter Weir?!) and the editor, who hope we in the audience don't miss any of their tricks. How could we when the whole set-up of this story is as plastic as the town's inhabitants, or when every gesture is as subtle as a pack of stampeding elephants? *1/2 from ****",
211,27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, The Truman Show proves that an original concept can provide an innovative and engaging story.,"In a time where the UK has 'The Only Way Is Essex', 'Geordie Shore' and 'Made in Chelsea', reality TV shows are a massive hit. I wish they weren't, but they are. It's clear to see why. Observing the lives of others on a routinely basis makes you feel like you know them on a personal level. The same applies to this film. Truman Burbank is unknowingly in a hit reality show where his life and world is fabricated. He starts to find odd idiosyncrasies in his day to day routine that makes him question the legitimacy of his world. Straight up, this is Jim Carrey's best film and best performance. He controls his usual animated comedic mannerisms to create an understated and emotionally captivating performance. Peter Weir's direction is also compelling, utilising hidden cameras in this false reality to enhance the TV show-like qualities, making the experience feel real. But what really puts The Truman Show on the map is the concept. I've seen this a good few times, and every single viewing gives me a sense of euphoria. The ending might be slightly underwhelming but when we get to the final five minutes, it's like we've completed a quest! Me and Truman, together. The narrative evokes many themes. The idea of our lives being dictated by a higher power. The right to have the freedom of choice. Exploring the concept of fate and destiny. Is it subtle? No, but it doesn't need to be. That's the point of the plot. I adored the small details that reality shows include, like product placements. Laura Linney staring at the camera talking about cocoa...it's a thing of beauty and kinda makes me want to buy some. The natural progression of Truman discovering unusual happenings was well paced and all the loose ends were tied up nicely. Overall, a fascinating and enthralling study of reality TV shows with a career best performance from Jim Carrey.",

We will never be able to understand the world like the Almighty God. We have to rely on various carriers to get rid of our physical barriers, so that the mind can reach the long past, think about the long future, imagine the alien world, to meet our infinite curiosity and knowledge desire. In this sense, we have to agree with McLuhan's wisdom: ""media is the extension of human body"".
However, the paradox of the development of civilization is that it often goes to the opposite side of itself and becomes the accomplice of deprivation of freedom and elimination of subjectivity. Today, the popularity and rapid expansion of electronic media in the world has fully realized McLuhan's prediction of ""global village"". Because of this, people all over the world can watch the world of Truman on the same earth at the same time, so as to deduce the prying desire in human nature so vividly in such a vast space-time range.
The tragedy of reality lies in that in this era of media, no one can escape the fate of Truman, and no one has full confidence to say that he has nothing to do with Truman. In all kinds of TV reality shows, can't we see the shadow of Truman? When we are cheering for the super girl, can't we see the shadow of the audience holding the TV and Truman together? Today, economic interests drive everything, and the proliferation of business logic has forced us to play with ourselves. We have to entertain ourselves and sell our money, privacy, freedom and even life in the moment of revelry.",

The Truman Show is about a person called Truman Burbank who lives in a small island called Seahaven near the coast of Florida where nothing really happens. Everything in life almost perfect, but certain events of the past often disturb his feelings towards the life he lives. The sudden turn of events and suspicious happenings around him makes him more curious to discover the world he lives in.

You can't help but feel badly for poor Truman when he starts discovering things aren't what they seem. I think my absolute favorite line in this movie is from Christof when he said ""Cue the sun"". Sure, maybe its impossibly expensive to build an entire town inside a sphere and create a TV show about a persons life without them knowing it. But when was the last time you saw the Star Ship Enterprise (or Voyager) flying over earth ? Its a great fantasy movie, thats all it is. The acting in this movie is superb, especially that of Jim Carry and Ed Harris. Ed Harris' character is so evil, the way he thinks he knows what's best for Truman. One line he says ""I am the creator...(pause)....of a television show that brings hope and joy to millions"" Its almost as if he has a God complex. Well, I think he does. I have to wonder, if such a show actually aired, where a persons life was on the air 24/7 from infancy to adult, would we actually watch it ?",

228,4 May 1999,WeslyM,10, Insightful and delicately beautiful,"Peter Weir is one of the most interesting directors working today.  His casting of Jim Carrey as the titular Truman may have raised some eyebrows, but then Weir has never been known for his conventionality.  Weir has a way of drawing great (or at least greatish) performances out of his actors: Robin Williams in ""Dead Poets Society,"" Rosie Perez in ""Fearless.""  And Carrey has shown seeds of greatness before; rent ""Doing Time on Maple Drive"" (if you can find it) to see what I'm talking about.  Truman's entire life, since the day of his birth, has been orchestrated on a giant television studio set, the only world Truman knows, and televised worldwide as ""The Truman Show.""  Truman represents something impossibly difficult to find in our society today: an absolutely innocent person.  This goes a long way to explain his public's fascination with him.  Ed Harris brings a bizarre dignity and ethic to his portrayal of Christos, the god-like creator and director of ""The Truman Show.""  This delicately beautiful film shows us the utter hypocrisy of our media and the herd-like docility with which we accept that very hypocrisy.  Although it doesn't offer many answers, it asks a lot of the right questions.",

231,2 February 1999,jaylewis-2,10, a masterpiece,"I've watched quite a few movies over the years.  The friendly neighborhood Blockbuster Video people could probably retire on the money they've made renting to just me.  I've seen the entire AFI 100 and every critically acclaimed movies that I can find.  Even so, I'd have to say that The Truman Show is one of the greatest movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  It's a perfect film.  The acting is great, the screenplay is phenomenal, and it is a very deep and symbolic movie.  I've seen it seven times and I pick up something new every time I watch it.  Even the title character's name, ""Truman Burbank,"" is oxymoronic and symbolic.  He is a ""true man"" who is the product of Hollywood.  You can even spot a few allusions to the crucifixion when Christof tries to stop Truman from escaping by flipping his boat.  The depiction of a Utopian society reminded me of Alduous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" a world were freedom did not truly exist even though the citizens thought it did.  Why did they not do anything?  It's just like Christof said in a memorable and disturbing quote: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.""  This cynicism is thrown at you one last time in the final scene of the movie.  Two security guards, upon realizing that the show is over, shrug and say, ""Hmm, it's over. Let's see what else is on"" while stuffing their faces with pizza.  Likewise, viewers of this movie may see it and say, ""Hmm, it's over"" without giving it a second thought, not realizing the significance of the movie.  Don't see this movie if you're not willing to think.  Don't see this movie if you're looking for a superficial, slapstick, screwball comedy like most of Carrey's other pictures (You'll be disappointed if that's what you're looking for).  See this movie if you are prepared to be challenged philosophically.  Along with ""A Clockwork Orange,"" this is one of two movies that I have given a ten out of ten.",
232,22 June 2020,timmyminh,8, Viewer Culture,"I think The Truman Show is more than just about being entrapped in an identity serves only as a spectacle and that the world around you are just arbitrary and made-up, which follows by a wish to be liberated from that simulated reality. That is what the surface of the picture demonstrates, but I also see it as a demonstration of this viewer culture we have in this modern age of social media. Everything we watch on screen are virtually entertainment for us whether it is about two people yelling and fighting on the street or a reality show about god knows what. I love how the picture let us see that in the final scene where, after everyone had finished cheering for Truman's escape, they immediately just continued to deliberating which channels or shows to watch next. In other words, they never really cared about Truman's life and freedom or his desire to escape, they only see it as a part of their entertainment. Truman's happiness, sadness, struggles are nothing more than just entertainment and good TV for the audience. Additionally, if I may add, I love how Truman didn't care or inquire much about what is the real world like - for all he knows, the real world could be a dystopian wasteland and humans in chains, but regardless he just wanted to be anything by a spectacle, anything but living in a surreal and superficial world. Both the two points I observed above just shows this picture as having more aspects than just about ""living in a fake world"" and the filmmakers did a stupendous job at writing that out for us.",

While the premise is excellent, and a number of the supporting performers (especially Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich) do well in their roles, in any star-oriented film, the final judge of the movie's quality must be the star. Jim Carrey ultimately fails to deliver.  In yet another example of his unique, non-acting acting style, he manages to miss (or overshoot?) moments many other actors of lesser stature would hit dead on.  What could have been a very powerful movie dealing with the pressures of life and the changes of aging is ultimately reduced to a hollow, meaningless study of its star. Since the material does not allow Jim Carrey to do that at which he truly excels--outrageous physical comedy--he looks and feels very stiff and very miscast.

Our thinking has created the world as it is now. Whenever we label something as good or bad or create a preference in our mind, it is due to the coming into being of egoic structures or self-interests. The solution is not to fight for peace or conquer nature, but to simply recognise the truth; that the very existence of the ego structure creates duality, a split between self and other, mine and yours, man and nature, inner and outer. The ego is violence; it requires a barrier, a boundary from the other to be. Without the ego, there is no war against anything. There is no hubris, there is no overreaching nature to create profit. These external crises in our world reflect a severe inner crisis; we don't know who we are. We are wholly identified with our egoic identities, consumed by fears and are cut off from our true nature.

The idea is so different from other movies that I have ever seen.The casting is perfect, with Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank the guy whom the world is watching throughout his life, the guy who live among actors who pretended to be his mom, dad, wife, best friend etc. After a long years he started to notices something wrong; and this is the story of his great escape to REAL world. Andrew Niccol (New Zealnder writer) have done a great job. This is gonna be the best black comedy movie anyone have ever seen I highly recommended that everyone should watch this movie .

260,2 August 2012,jephiachantharath,10, Brilliant!,"As a fan of the twilight zone series, I could easily see the influences from that series into this film. I knew that the motion picture of that series failed, and I was a little worried at first. But to my surprise I was blown away! I haven't seen such a bizarre idea be the main story of a film since Transformers ( however that film wasn't good). In bizarre I don't mean dumb or stupid, but more like interesting, and boy is it interesting. This opening is different to most films I've seen, it shows the cast of the actors characters ""acting"" in an interview, which is good because it is already treating itself like a movie, and unlike Truman, they all know they're being watched. In the beginning of the film you get to see lots of product placement, when Truman is saying hello to his neighbors it shows the ideal neighbor, then when Truman meets the twins, one of them pushes him in front of a poster which shows some sort of chicken dinner, later in the day he is in the garden when his lover shows him a brand new kitchen knife and showing all the features like a commercial, and also when your introduced to his best friend who is drinking a beer and says ""now that's a beer"" or something like that. One thing I noticed about this film is that it is very smart, Like when a light falls from the sky they later say that it was a part of an airplane, well since he's always being watched the director can make sure Truman doesn't suspect anything, and I should be more specific in that this director is smart. I saw that this was listed under comedy, which I didn't get at first, but if the point was to be satirical, then it did a perfect job. My last thoughts, I think this is a very unique film with its ideas and great characters, and think that anybody would be interested in this film.",
261,10 November 2017,Dr_Coulardeau,10, One puppet for the perverse pleasure of all others,"This is an intriguing film. Truman is in his mid or late 20s when we get to him in the present. The idea is that he was one of several children born from mothers who gave away their children for adoption at birth. He was the first one to be born and as such became adopted by the corporation represented by Christof, the director or this show. Suspend your disbelief a lot because the fact that he lived in this artificial cinema setting all his life, which means went to school on a daily basis and to college to get his qualification for his job, is a pure illusionary impossibility. It is maybe easier to make a few hundred people live in this community with only one real inhabitant, Truman, and all the others actors who have to be unionized in a way or another and hence cannot work more than a certain certainly limited number of hours a day and a week and a month and a year.

264,31 October 1998,dmb1243,10, Astounding Cinema,"The Truman Show is cinema at its highest pinnacle- it's the sort of film that all others should be judged against. Though its pace is consistent, never reaching fever pitch, its concept is ground breaking and its storyline magnificent. Jim Carrey is Truman Burbank, an ordinary man, living in an ordinary world. At least that's how he defines his world, for unknown to him, he is the star of the world's most popular television show, 'The Truman Show', which has captured on film every second of his thirty year existence. Everyone he knows are actors, every situation that arises is perfectly choreographed. The idea behind The Truman Show is genius, as was the casting of Carrey in the title role. All too often criticised for his slapstick style in movies such as 'Ace Ventura' and 'Dumb and Dumber', Carrey puts on the performance of a lifetime as Burbank, whose life begins to collapse around him. Also of note are performances by Laura Linney as Truman's 'stage' wife who finds it increasingly difficult to cope with Truman's developing ambition to discover life beyond his manufactured world, and by Ed Harris as Christof, who has single-handedly created and moulded Truman's articifial world. The brilliance of The Truman Show is that it works on so many levels, and plays up to man's greatest fear: that his world is not so secure and perfect as it appears. The Truman Show is astounding cinema. See it. Be Thrilled. See it again.",

The only time I got into the movie, was when Truman was trying to escape « his world ». Other than that, I was unable to relate to anything. Let alone any of the characters. Especially those that were supposed to represent us viewers. Apart from Carrey, the casting and acting sometimes, was great. And prevented me from completely hating the movie.

281,3 January 2012,eabakkum,8, A warning against spying and oppression?,"I used the last days of December to watch some films, that had impressed me about a decade ago. The film The Truman Show was among them. Around 2000 I watched The Truman Show several times, and tried to analyze its contents. Like many modern movies, it contains an ambiguous message. Obviously the leading theme is the obtrusive invasion of our private life by the producers of television programs. The common life of individual people is transformed into entertainment, not just in the form of a single commentary, but by means of regular (weekly or even daily) broadcastings. At the time this type of entertainment was still a novelty. I even remember that shortly after The Truman Show a similar film about the topic was released, titled EdTV. Since 2000 the so-called reality TV has become a common vehicle of entertainment, probably because it is cheap and doesn't require any careful considerations. Nevertheless The Truman Show has withstood the ravages of time, and still succeeds in fascinating me. At the time, I interpreted the story as a critique on the unwanted invasion of your private living space by unknown outsiders. For passer-bys clearly and intentionally block Burbanks passage, when he is in a hurry, both in a hospital, on the sidewalk, or in the file on the highway. During a chance meeting a cop unexpectedly happens to know his name. When Burbank wishes to visit the Fijis, the posters in the local traveling agency try to instil a fear for flying, and the flights to the Fijis happen to be fully booked for at least a month. Burbank discovers that in an eternal procession the same group of strangers circulates around his house. As a whole the chance of an accidental conjunction of circumstances becomes negligible, and Burbank logically concludes that it is all premeditated. The only surprise is his slowness in the uptake, considering that he had already been encysted for thirty years, since his birth. In the end Burbank succeeds in escaping from his artificial, repressing and hostile world. But now, after another ten years, I doubt that this is really the leading theme. For we live in a world, where you can simply watch the home life of your neighbors by infiltrating their computer through the net and controlling their web-cam by means of spy-ware. And if you can not do this, your government or an ICT firm certainly can. Apparently The Truman Show is not so much a protest against a threatening future Big Brother society (after the narration of the totalitarian society by George Orwell), as a warning against the actual way of living, that develops around us. Thus the story becomes a hotchpotch of undesirable developments: for instance the intrusion of advertising in our lives. Or the social encysting and gossiping in the small community. Perhaps even the oppression by social conventions in general. Or the spying by the state and enterprises on their citizens and costumers, which in the professed age of terrorism has become unbounded. Apparently the narrative of The Truman Show is more a shower of grains of shot than a well-targeted critique. So although I still appreciate the film and its invitation to ponder, it is clearly not the monument of resistance that I presumed twelve years ago. A pity. Disappointing.",

Initially if you will think of the film's story then you are bound to laugh at the weird concept but the way it is presented to you is commendable.

I personally believe that there are a lot of satirical messages in The Truman Show, but I think the most prominent is that the media is used to display people's lives in whatever way they please. The Truman Show targets the media, and displays the problem of media manipulation. This idea is exaggerated by Truman being the media's subject matter without consent for every moment of his life. We see this in real life with celebrities in paparazzi photos and reality TV shows, although, contrary to Truman, celebrities are aware that the world has their eyes on them. Throughout the movie, we see the producers of the show plant subject matter into Truman's life, such as his father coming back to life, or all the advertising for hot chocolate. This can show how the media manipulates people. In the movie, the inhumaneness of Truman's situation is deflated. The movie is ironic because Truman's audience knows that he's on television, but Truman does not.

Christof's character is very philosophical and deep, providing many great statements and ideas throughout the film. What I want to praise the most about Christof though is his relationship with Truman. The two didn't even meet until the very end, but Christof treats Truman like he is his child, and Christof is the father. He adores Truman and cares for him like a child. The scene displaying Christof watching Truman sleep on camera, putting his hand on Truman's face as the emotional music swells does such a great job at showing this. On the outside, the Truman Show is a comedy about a man discovering his life is a lie, but at its center it's so much more than that. It's a story about deep realization and betrayal, growth and maturing. Deep down it's a sad, depressing look on modern reality tv. Throughout the movie, due to his positive outlook on life, Truman never takes time to mourn and contemplate his stolen life, and that shows how tough he really is at spirit. The way those who filmed the movie blackened the corners of the film on certain shots to show shots from cameras in the movie is artistic and different than anything else from television. The payoff at the end is absolutely wonderful. We're rooting for Truman the whole movie to learn the life changing secret and his incredible escape onto the ocean is just perfect. The score intensified when Truman is in danger by the weather, and calms down to a beautiful, melodic, orchestral theme illustrating victory. Jim Carrey gives an excellent performance in every scene he's in, whether comedic or emotional. He embodies this role in such a way that Tom Hanks embodied Forrest Gump. The good storytelling doesn't even end with just Truman's story though. The shots of the outside world show people dedicating their whole lives to watch this simple, normal man. The whole world fell in love with somebody just as insignificant and regular as them. The reason why this is so great is because in real life this is something that could very likely happen. Beyond the surface of this lighthearted, at times comedic movie is an extremely sad story that has brilliant acting, dialogue, and morals. The pacing is incredible, given that every scene keeps you wondering what will happen next. Just like the audience in the movie, you fall in love with Truman and cheer for him throughout the whole movie, and the ending is victorious for both the fans and Truman himself. Truman's final line, ""Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon good evening and goodnight,"" mimics his line repeated twice earlier in the film to his neighbors, but the first times it was an introductory statement but this time it felt more like a closing. A goodbye. Christof faking Truman's fathers return showed how deep and desperate to succeed he really was. To conclude, this film has been brutally unappreciated for what it is since it's release. This is art for those of all ages to appreciate and look at differently. Every human needs to witness this masterpiece at least one time, I personally have seen it thrice, and it only got better each time. I 100% recommend it. 9.7/10.",
309,1 October 2022,asoomiijay,10, All time favourite,"I absolutely love anything and everything that Jim Carrey stars in and this film is an all time favourite. The story line is genius and Carrey's acting is brilliant as always. I cant even count how many times I have watched this movie and I would recommend it for anyone who loves plot twists and movies with ""hidden meanings"". And many can even say that the story line (which is initially thought of as a ridiculous satire) depicts the state of the world is currently in (think of a Black Mirror episode where one's reality isn't always THE reality). Many emotions were invoked, especially towards the second half/end of the film. So grab some friends and some popcorn, and get ready to have your mind blown.",
310,4 May 2020,evefarion,9," ""Good Afternoon, Good Evening and Goodnight!""","The Truman Show was an immaculate and visually stunning film that was ultimately one of Jim Carrey's best roles. Jim Carrey offers an iconic performance as the naive salesmen, and while being one of his less over-the-top roles, he is able to put a bit of himself into Truman which really takes the character to the next level.
This film had an original, well developed concept that was able to convey strong messages and is still light-hearted and comedic. It maintains a good story and morals while also being technically excellent with magnificent cinematography. The shot of Truman walking up the stairs in the sky is one of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen. The story was able to portray many ideas throughout the film that questioned reality itself.
Cristof states ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented."", which is very accurate in my opinion. We are put on this earth with no true sense of reality until we are presented with it. Our beliefs manifest from what others tell us to believe. Truman represents society being forced to follow under the beliefs of high power without having any of their own. But upon realization, Truman can break free and move on to a better life.
Christof is an excellent antagonist. He is said to represent God and how he has control of everyone and everything. I didn't see him as a villain until he overturned Truman's boat, unspokenly admitting that he'd rather have Burbank die than lose his star and TV show. He believed the whole film that he was in the right, never once doubting his ideas or thoughts. To him, his assistants and staff, he was not the villain but the hero; bringing a wonderful show to viewers around the world, to the detriment of Truman's life and freedom.
With our current crisis, the world seems to be silent. Our reality feels altered and shifted in a way that seems eternal, similar to Burbank's. But like Truman, we can rise above it all and come out the other side feeling more confident and stronger than ever. Eventually, this will be a blip in our lives and in history, becoming something we can laugh about as I imagine Truman would too. Peter Weir created amazing films like The Dead Poets Society and Witness, with the Truman Show being another. This film was a beautiful representation of society and its morals and is still a great film 23 years later.",
311,18 January 2021,Itsevelynchy64,9, The most unrealistically realistic movie,"First I admit that as an after-00s, I wasn't interested in this soooo much when I watched it at the first time with my dad, though he continuously iterated how good is that (well now I do believe that it literally means a lot to those who are born in 70s because 90s was their shining era, right) . But few years ago, my crush in high school set the Truman show poster( the one with Truman's laughing face on it) as his line profile, and I immediately rewatched it that night in order to discuss with him on the other day(yeh such a indecisive valley) but wow it turned out to be resonated af. I supposed that people who are a bit cynical and negative or who sometimes figures that life is a bi*th would feel related to Truman. We're all shackled by frames of social norms and standards, struggling with what I'm supposed to be, dominated by what I supposed to do. People unfriendly eyes and attention disturb us to be ourselves. Their unintentional comments hit the softest part of our hearts. All these make us live as performing an ever-lasting show, we'll never be satisfied with the suppressing and deceiving scenarios, and either are the audience, the public, the society.
Thus, screw all those goddamn standards and limitations. It's how we are and It's what we are.",

314,19 February 2000,krumski,10, One of the films for which the Nineties will be remembered,"I believe that, in the future, when the 90s are looked back upon, The Truman Show will be seen as one of its truly representative films, not only for its high quality but for its unerring evocation of one of the most prominent themes of our times: the out of control nature of the media, and its invasion of our personal lives. Think about how many movies over this past decade have used this theme as a jumping off point: Natural Born Killers, Mad City, Wag the Dog, To Die For, The Cable Guy, Quiz Show, EdTv, . . I could go on, but you get the idea. The Truman Show towers over all these films because instead of being a polemic, it casts its story in the form of a fable; you're free to buy what's happening as ""real"" or simply metaphorical, and the story works equally well either way. Because there's no direct reference to any current media images (no MTV or CNN or Jay Leno monologues about Truman and his life) the story exists outside of time - it could take place either in the future, a fictionalized present, or an imagined past: it's never made clear and it doesn't matter.

321,27 April 2020,Aboxofbread,8, Gives you a lot to think about,"The Truman Show was a great film. The time I spend watching it I was engaged, and I thought it did a great job of mixing in comedy without getting rid of the more serious aspects of the film. It made me think a lot about what I would have ended up doing in the situations Truman was put it; for instance, would I have had the guts to leave Seahaven after so long?
Christof found a way to become god-like, and to many around the world who watched the Truman Show, he was probably considered a hero of sorts. But to Truman and Sylvia, he was a great villain. Trapping Truman in this picture perfect, happy-go-lucky town gave Christof complete control of every piece of his life. For Truman, once he realized things weren't as they seemed, he started to see that nothing in life was his choice, nothing belonged just to him except Sylvia, and his escape at the end to find her and
start his own life is sort of like the risks we take in life, to pursuit something that feels far away or out of the question.
I think that when Christof said, ""we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented,"" he was partly right. I mean, we grow up understanding the things around us, the routines and the constants. Why would we have any reason to question what we've known our whole lives? If we could change our realities, we wouldn't learn half as much as we do. If every time we failed a test in school or didn't get the job we just decided, 'hey, no, I'm just going to change that,' we'd lose so much valuable life experience.

(2) The story as constructed by the world's greatest producer, The Man in the Moon named Cristof (Ed Harris), who manages the television show of which the thirtyish real-estate salesman, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), is the unknowing star.

Regardless, Jim Carrey delivers a perfect performance and I recommend this to everyone and anyone. Pay special attention to the last line in the movie...it always makes me think.",
326,8 October 2016,cathaleoin1999,10, This is a film you must see. End of!,"I don't know why I really should bother writing the 915th review of this film on IMDb, but such is the power of The Truman Show that I saw myself left with no choice but to. To put it in simplistic terms, this film is nigh-on perfect. There is no fault with this film, and if anyone finds a fault with it, I would love to be informed of said fault to see if it is really a fault. Jim Carrey gives the best performance of the year (with maybe the exception of Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful) as Truman Burbank, perfectly portraying the paranoia and strife a man in such dire circumstances must go through. Ed Harris is enigmatic and scene-stealing as Christof, and honestly I think it is one of the best-written parts in the last twenty years of cinema. The rest of the cast are excellent too, ranging from Laura Linney as an actress who knows that The Truman Show is her big break, to Paul Giamatti in a very small role in the ""real"" world. Andrew Niccol's script is one of the best ever in Hollywood, on par with Paddy Chayefsky's Network and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Peter Weir's direction is brilliant, but I now find myself contradicting what I earlier said about there being no faults with this film. The only fault with this film is that they didn't go far enough. I read in the trivia section on IMDb that Peter Weir planned to have the film cut, the screen shows people watching the film in the theater through a security webcam, and then keep going on with the film. This would have been amazing, and we are left with only wishful thinking of what might've been. Several other deleted scenes, one being a jogger portrayed by an actor who two days previous had played a homeless man in a wheelchair, would have elevated this film from nigh-on perfect to as important as Network or dare I say Citizen Kane. In one of the strongest years in film, this film was almost thrown into the gutter and forgotten about at the Academy Awards. I need not tell you how much of a disgrace it is Carrey didn't win for Best Actor and Niccol win for Best Original Screenplay. Thank God everyone else on IMDb agrees with me that this film is outstanding, except with its current ranking of 207, I am also disappointed because really it should be top 25-30. This film contains many subtle messages, from schizophrenia to the power the media holds in our society, and it is very difficult to choose what moment is best, except I think I have it. At the very end, and in case anyone didn't see the banner at the top SPOILER ALERT, when Truman exits his alternate reality, and the show ends, we see two men discuss what to watch next, so seamlessly as if they have to watch something. This is the best moment of the film because it shows our complete lack of care for Truman, and that once something ends that we have devoted time to watching it, we must go and begin to watch something else. This film is difficult to comprehend with one viewing, but once you appreciate its power, its subtleties and its satirical messages, then you will relate to this review.",

Once aware of this, Truman tries to find a way out, while the show's creator and director Christof(played by Ed Harris) tries to keep a lid on the situation... Existentialist film works reasonably well, though this idea had been explored before on ""The Twilight Zone"". Still, this is an interesting and thought-provoking film regardless.",
329,23 February 2016,Mr-Fusion,9, Brilliant,"""The Truman Show"" is a marvel of engineering. Great cast, high concept, but it's the overall illusion that's really impressive; that it somehow all works. If you really wanted to poke holes in this movie, you could (the enormous resources required to maintain that dome, the ungodly costs, and that doesn't even touch the subject of prostituting Meryl). But the script is adept at addressing such concerns, or at least sweeping them under the rug. You find yourself absorbed in Truman's inner struggle, and his blossoming sense of adventure. This is probably my favorite Jim Carrey performance; he's ideal. Ed Harris, too (geez, what can't that guy do?). The movie's premise of reality TV isn't new (and I'm not sure it was even back in '98), but it's honestly an imaginative take on the whole concept and maintains a surprising level of depth.",

What we have here is a film that more than delivers on the entertainment front, while still finding time for a backbone of thought-provoking substance. More often than not with movies that work from a premise, rather than an actual plot, they miss the mark because of a lack of ideas to populate the premise with; but that certainly isn't the case here! The film follows the story of Truman Burbank. Truman is an insurance salesman, but unlike most insurance salesmen; he has his own show. And unlike most people with their own show...he doesn't know about it. Truman Burbank is the unwitting star of the massively successful TV show; The Truman Show. His whole life has been the subject of this show and everything that he believes to be real is actually the brainchild of the show's creator, the flamboyant Christof.

It's interesting how this film and ""Pleasantville"" came out at the same time. While ""Pleasantville"" is about going into the fairy-tale land and making a difference, this one is about a man trying to leave the fairy-tale land. It isn't as magical as it was when I saw it as an adult but I now appreciate it more for what it is after having some life experiences of my own. It's about not conforming to the same routine, about taking risks, to sometimes be able to leave the comfort zone in order travel abroad and have experiences that are beyond where you are at. How some people can try to restrain you from exploring and and take away chances you dreamed of and how it's your choice when it comes to what you really want to do with your life. Despite the really far-fetched and a ridiculous concept this film has, it accomplished what it tried to do. Jim Carrey was at his peak when it came to stardom and was the topnotch actor at the time.

It is this artificiality latent in everything that bothers, always bothered the character who, after all, is unaware of being part of a millionaire reality show, which transmitted to the world every moment of his life. And here lies another important provocation essential to understanding the film: a critique of the kind of TV shows we watch, programs that exploit and make millions at the expense of people's weaknesses and pains.

A simplistic plot that could've been explored fully in a Twilight Zone episode (and, I think, probably was).

353,9 December 2006,jonmeta,7, You choose: the fake light or the black door,"Peter Weir's earliest major films -The Last Wave, Picnic at Hanging Rock --are studies of people overwhelmed by circumstances they can't understand or control. But his later films offer hope of redemption and triumph. Like Dead Poets' Society, the Truman Show is the story of struggle for freedom from an oppressive system. While ""DPS"" was an interesting development of a standard situation (a liberal-minded teacher helps students free their minds from tradition through creative literature) the Truman Show is based on a very unique setup. The main character, Truman Burbank, is the only ""true man"" in a TV-show world of actors and commercial advertising. We, the viewers, discover this truth before he does because Weir introduces us to a selection of viewers who are hooked on the show. The film holds our interest by showing us, first, Truman's process of discovery, and then his attempts to escape his situation.",
354,10 September 2017,ashleysudmann,6," Takes a little while to get into, but after the climax, you won't want to stop watching!","In the Truman Show, we follow the life of Truman, someone who was adopted by a film corporation at birth and lives as the focus of the most famous reality TV show, without even knowing it. This show is on 24/7, following every little detail of Truman's life. His little town is all he knows, and for years, he is okay with it. Since he is the star of the show, he is the center of attention of the town. Eventually this fact sticks out to him; Truman starts to figure out that something isn't right and decides to do something about it. He tries to escape, but he encounters many obstacles keeping him on the TV show's island. This movie inflates the idea of how far we will go for our own pleasure. In the movie, the whole world knows about the TV show, that the main actor is being watched 24/7 without knowing it, and that his life is being controlled by the cast and directors, yet they do nothing about it. In fact, they don't want to do anything about it; they enjoy it. Truman has no privacy, but no one seems to care; it must be alright since they are getting entertainment out of it, right? The movie also uses irony to convince the audience of flaws in our society. When Truman is struggling in his life, he turns to his ""best friend"" who talks to him using the director's words spoken to him over his earpiece. One of the most ironic line in the movie, in my opinion, was when Truman's best friend turns to him during a serious conversation and says, ""The last thing I would ever do is lie to you,"". This is ironic, because of course as he says this, he is lying. He is trying to convince Truman that he is just thinking crazy thoughts and everything is normal, when he actually knows that the whole world is watching is life play out. The Truman Show really makes us reflect on our lives; how far do we go for our own pleasure? It uses many satirical elements to convince us of this flaw. At first, while watching the movie, we find it crazy and over-the-top at this world's crazy idea of reality TV. When we stop and think about it, it makes us wonder how far-fetched it really is.",

I remember seeing this film when I was in my teens, I was in my sophomore year and of course it was the 90's when there was the Jim Carrey train. Jim Carrey is one of my favorite comedic actors and seeing him in something like this really took me by surprise, in fact the whole film took me by surprise and believe it or not it's my favorite film from him.

One day, after years of this ordinary life, he decides he wants to take action and actually gain experiences. To have an adventure or two.

I feel like it's more relevant even now than it was then thanks to the advent of social media because I can only imagine how some people feel as though their whole life is being scripted and obsessed over by thousands of people.

What's lacking about the movie is that even though it runs at about two ours, it doesn't really elaborate much on Truman's unsuspecting life. The movie immediately sets its conflicts and Truman's suspicions as soon as Truman's character is introduced. Nevertheless the movie can really hold on to its grip over the story and exploits all it can from the angles by using the lens filters and robotics-moved cameras to give the actual spy- cam feel. The acting overall feels also nice. Jim Carrey's acting feels suiting to Truman's character and the changes he goes through.Laura Linney did her part well enough, maintaining that smirk almost all over her screen time.

374,10 May 2022,Abdulxoxo,9, A truly compelling film,"What if your entire life is just an illusion?""
That is the question that the film The Truman Show asks the audience. The story may not be entirely original but the film works because it took a different approach. The story incorporated good world building through unraveling the mystery behind how that particular world works. Everything seemed so normal yet something kept bugging Truman. The manner in which the tension of the plot maintained its engagement is good. There were nice plot twists and turns that added to the mystery. The story also had a balance of drama and comedy. The performances are all great, most especially of course by Jim Carrey. His signature comedic style is present. But more than his comedic portrayal, his dramatic parts also stood out very well. Ed Harris was also a great actor in the movie. His character may not necessarily be a bad guy. But he was able to portray a person who is controlling and somehow selfish yet convincing. The film was able to present an admirable production set. The film showed that in actuality the setting for the ""show"" was done in a studio. That is complemented with an actual behind the scenes studio that works through everything. This gave a feeling that the show within the film was large, very large. Aside from that, the film also included audiences in the real world watching Truman. The scenes that they were in emphasized how big was the fanbase watching the show.",

The things happen too randomly and non-sense until around 70 minutes of running, which made me very bored and lost in the story. The soundtrack isn't touching neither deep, so the film isn't comedy, isn't drama, isn't anything! Also, this is a much improbable show, since no decent country would have laws to allow it.

Thousands of extras and covert cameras, a gigantic dome complete with artificial moon and sun, 400 life sized buildings, props and costumes of all kinds...But Biziou also injects a sense of hyper realism into the film. The use of high key lighting, the scenes slightly over-lit create a subtle and controlled sense of artificiality. It's combined with the voyeuristic photography; sneaky povs from behind car dashes and vending machines and cupboards, vignetted frames suggesting surveillance, the way the edits will bounce from normal compositions to handhelds from the likes of Meryl's necklace or the neighbour's trash-cam.

397,17 August 2008,cariboolean,4, Fun but far too many gaping holes even for a fantasy,"There's a point at which some works of fiction ask you to convert the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" which we must bring to any fictional work into ""throwing all critical faculties completely to the winds"", and that's what happens here. This film is mildly entertaining for a while..until you start actually thinking about some of what it asks you to take for granted. 1. Weather on demand. While we've all seen wave making pools, has anyone actually seen the technology to create violent localized storms? (While there are some who claim the ""secret"" government has such weather control technology, even they supposedly can only do it over a large area.) On a sound stage, this could only have been done with giant fans and large, obvious water-spewing machinery. Where were the fans and the other machinery? Or are we supposed to believe all that weather just came out of thin air? 2. Ventilation. With all the car exhaust and heat generated by the community and the artificial lighting, there obviously would have to be giant air conditioning systems (remember, the dome was supposed to be a closed, sealed location) to dissipate the heat and provide fresh air. Where were all the giant vents that would've been needed? The a/c equipment? The constant noise that large a/c equipment generates? 3. Wouldn't Truman have noticed that there were never any airplanes or helicopters seen flying anywhere? Wouldn't he have asked ""why don't we have any aircraft here?"" I can't think of any ""excuse"" for that which would have been even remotely plausible. 4. For this ""community"" to have gone on so long, it would've meant that all of Truman's ""schoolmates"" weer actors who grew up there along with him. Does anyone really think that so many children (actors, no less) could have kept such a big secret for so many years? Come on, now! You can bet that more than one kid over all that time would've felt the need to spill the beans. 5. Laura Linney's character was initially shown as a cheerleader. That means that the island's high school played competitive sports with other schools. So...does that mean they NEVER played an ""away"" game?? Wouldn't Truman have thought that to be a little strange? And would all of the opposing team's athletes have agreed to be bought off and keep silent? How much money would it have cost to buy the silence of those kids, in addition to all of those mentioned in 4. above? No t.v. show would have been able to marshal the huge budget necessary to pull all of this off on an ongoing basis -- not to mention the huge budget just to pay all of the hundreds of actors. 6. All t.v., radio, magazines, newspapers, movies and internet (yes, internet existed when this movie was made) coming to the island would have had to be censored of any references to The Truman Show. There's no way a t.v. network would be able to exercise such total control. Truman would have noticed that the only media were locally generated. Wouldn't he have asked why he was cut off from everything else? 7. Even if the supposed explanation that he was adopted by a corporation was valid, the moment he was restrained from free movement of any kind the corporation (and thus Christof) was committing the felony of kidnapping -- a federal crime which wouldn't have been excused. 8. There were even internal inconsistencies..e.g., ""Christof"" said in the Harry Shearer interview that all revenues for the show were generated by product placement. If that's so, then why did ""Meryl"" have to hold up various products to the camera and deliver spiels? 9. We're supposed to believe that ""Meryl"" was so upset by some of the manifestations of Truman's waking-up process that she breaks into tears and claims she ""can't work under these conditions, it's not professional"". But at the same time, we're supposed to believe that living for years in a sham marriage with a man she doesn't love (and presumably, routinely having sex with him) was perfectly okay with her, simply because it was a paid gig! That's pretty cold, even for Hollywood.",

406,25 June 2004,Ben_Cheshire,8, As perfectly choreographed as the world it depicts.,"The major factor in this is one of the best screenplays i've ever seen. Its a thing of beauty the way it progresses, shifting gracefully through different levels of reality: first we begin inside the show (with opening credits like ""Truman Burbank as Himself, Created by Christoph""), along with interviews with cast members to establish the concept that Truman Burbank is naive to the fact that his entire environment is contrived by a television producer in the ultimate reality television experiment, everything from the weather to the dialogue of the actors who play the people close to Truman. This terrific concept never loses its impact: each time you see it, it takes you on the journey again. Even considering the spate of actual reality TV that has invaded our homes since 1998, which this movie foretold (or perhaps inspired), this movie will always retain its appeal because its specific situation, raising a baby in a reality-TV environment and keeping them from knowing they are on TV and that they are fake (in other words, what reality TV strives for, giving viewers genuine reality to watch, in the person of Truman), is not likely to happen in real life.",

I was pleasantly surprised when the movie actually turned out to be good. Before watching I read the description and I had my doubts but those were quickly cast aside while watching Jim Carrey play the main character Truman so well.

410,27 April 2020,lucy-95505,9, A Reality Shift,"The Truman Show is one of my favourite films of all time. I think that even though it's fairly simple to follow the story, there are layers beneath the surface. There are so many stories in this film that are unexplored, and a lot of major pieces of the story are hidden in the background of shots or barely referenced. Something that I feel is a major part of the film is the activist movement, led by Silvia, to free Truman. However, we barely get a glimpse at her work, only hearing about it through her phone conversation with Cristof, and seeing the countless 'Free Truman' banners, posters, and memorabilia in her apartment. We don't know the extent of what she's done to free him, and that's a layer that I think really adds to the film. Another layer is that nearly every person shown watching the show is absolutely thrilled to see Truman escape. Other than Cristof, no one is upset or angry. It begs the question, why did they watch the show in the first place? If the general public was happy that Truman escaped, did they already believe that his imprisonment was wrong? And if they knew that the show was inhumane, why did they watch it in the first place, and buy Truman merchandise? My theory is that, well, people are lazy. I think the general public assumed that eventually, Cristof and his team would give up and set Truman free. The two security guards at the end of the film sum it up very well- 'What else is on?' They don't really care about Truman's life. TV is TV to them, and seeing someone escape after being lied to for thirty years is great TV!
I think that the Truman Show has an incredible story, and the imagery, style, and cinematography has stuck with me for years (since I first watched it). Truman's last scene, where his boat hits the wall of the dome and he walks on the 'horizon' is breathtaking. The combination of the impact of the story and the beautiful colours of the cinematography makes it a truly iconic scene. Another feat of technical excellence in the Truman Show, in my opinion, is the way that almost every shot feels like it came from a hidden camera somewhere near Truman. You can tell when a shot or angle comes from a camera hidden on a person, like in a tie or brooch, or when someone carries a camera, like the old man with the garbage bin.
In the second half of the film, Cristof becomes a major character. He is the creator of the Truman Show, and, in his eyes, a god. However, not everyone sees it that way. Because people around the world are cheering for Truman's escape, they must hate the person keeping him imprisoned. Cristof is the villain to Truman and the viewer, which includes the viewers of the Truman Show in the film, and us, the viewers of the film.
As Truman's world begins to unravel, Cristof is hurrying to try and put it back together. Throughout, he remains nonchalant and almost boasts about his creation. When asked why Truman has never figured it out, Cristof says 'We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.' I believe that this statement is very true, especially for someone who grew up in that world and that reality. When, as a child, you are presented with a world, you will be curious about it, but before long you accept that it is real. We accepted the reality of our world just as Truman did, but how do we know we're not part of a bigger-scale secret reality TV show?
Our world isn't that great, and there are several realities that I wish could be changed. Our current reality may seem a little similar to Truman's; we cannot leave our homes or towns, but that's where the similarities end. After this is over, it will be strange to go out into the world and see what has changed. After Truman leaves the show, he'll have a hard time adjusting, just like we will.
These shifts in reality have huge impacts on us, which I think is another layer of the film that really adds to it, making this a film I would enjoy watching over and over.",

How does he behave, what does he do, and more importantly how can other decide on his most important decisions: the woman he marries, the trip he takes, the family he has, the career he needs to take. It is even better if all this decisions are made without him noticing, at first. But wait... Are we sure that our decisions aren't at all influenced, or watched, or guided. Social media, television shows, news, showing us just glimpses of a picture instead of the whole.

414,5 December 2005,Isaac5855,9, A Biting Social Commentary On the Effect of the Media on Today's Society,"THE TRUMAN SHOW was an intelligent and stylish social commentary about lost hopes and dreams, as well as the effect the media has on us. Writer Andrew Nicol and director Peter Weir take us into the extraordinary world of Truman Burbank, a sheltered young man with an alleged perfect life whose life, as it is slowly revealed to the viewer, is a 24-7 television show, directed by a God-like dictator (Ed Harris)who has televised and controlled Truman'life from birth and is determined to hold onto Truman even after he has caught onto what is happening. The thing I love about this story is the way it unfolds slowly...the story is told at a leisurely pace and we are only thrown subtle clues at first. There's a wonderful moment where Truman is walking down the street and is almost brained on the head by a spotlight. The expression on Truman's face at seeing a spotlight fall from the sky is just priceless and we are scratching our heads the same way Truman is. Once Truman realizes what is going on, he wants nothing to do with it and attempts to escape. Whether or not Truman escapes is unimportant, what is important is watching Truman trying to figure out what is going on. Jim Carrey redefined his career completely with this completely captivating performance in the title role. Carrey proved that he knew how to do more than pratfalls and mugging with this thoughtful and riveting performance and it was outrageous that Carrey was not nominated for an Academy Award. I don't know about winning but he at least deserved a nomination. Ed Harris, as Cristof, the director of Truman's show, gives the performance of his career that should have won him the Oscar. He was nominated but was robbed. A wonderful film that is worth seeing if for no other reason than to marvel at the amazing performances of Carrey and Harris.",
415,7 January 2006,jsataluri,9, Surprise! No hysterical comedy anymore!,"When my family and I watched the movie, we expected a hysterical comedy. Instead we got a drama about a man whose life is a TV show and how he slowly realizes that it's fake and tries to escape from the fantasy he's living in. This has got to be one of Jim Carrey's greatest performance. It was a chance for him to prove that he is an actor and not just a comic and he perfects it well. Ed Harris, a good actor gives one of his greatest performances ever as Christof, the creator, the ""father"" and the villain who obsesses with the Truman Show so much that he makes Truman a prisoner in his world.",
416,22 January 1999,emm,6," Carrey's ""breakthrough"" movie unearths too many possibilities.","First off, this is Jim Carrey's best performance I've ever seen, although he still doesn't act very dramatic like some have believed. He has a jolly, cheerful character inside of him, and is toned down from his past films, which is acceptable. Consider him a world famous television icon, if you will, because THE TRUMAN SHOW is how simple, everyday life compares simultaneously with a never-ending broadcast. In other words, ""All Truman, All The Time! 24 Hours A Day, 7 Days A Week!"". (L.O.L.) Many will miss Carrey's goofball personality, which confirms a local newspaper out here giving this one of the worst five movies of 1998. Well, go figure! You have many options of how to describe the movie. Is it based on real life accounts or is it an imaginative fantasy about the world media? Does it mean to be heartwarming or just made to be the highest-rated television program in the world? Will it be funny, or will it make you shed some tears? It's obvious that the first half tends to be tedious, only for the second to be more meaningful as we finally understand our pal Truman being under surveillance by a special broadcast control center past the heavens. This bares a similarity with God in control of everything around him on the earth. It appears like Truman is the inspiration for every one of us who tune in. Overall, I discovered the second half being the best feature, but while it had the best entertaining value, it goes by way too fast along with its final ending, making me beg for more. THE TRUMAN SHOW isn't a bad idea on Peter Weir's part, but it might not be appealing enough to attract our strong desires for solid enjoyment. I fare this film better than the newspaper gave it, but as a whole, I say ""above average"".",

The metaphor is very, very potent in this one. So much goes into criticizing our current publicity/promotion oriented society, governed and determined by money, where man is turned into either a slave (Carrey) or a machine. This film is a big, big eye-opener on what free-will has become in our societies, free-will which we supposedly have more of now than ever before in our history. This film is quite subtle, pays attention to detail well enough, and delivers an incredible metaphor that seems too great for anyone to miss out on. Just one of these main, essential ideas that should've been made before but wasn't, and now this is it right here, and you have to watch it.

431,11 September 2017,spow-07667,6," Interesting as a satire piece, not really a good movie plot-wise","As a satire this movie was decent, as a movie for pure entertainment purposes it had a weak plot and no real climax point. There were many places where satire was seen in this movie. The first satirical element we saw was irony when Truman agreed to take part in a job that he needed to take the ferry to get to, except he was prepared to go and then he did the exact opposite, walk off the pier and not go. This was a good example of dramatic irony. I think that the target of this satire is reality television. There are many similarities between the Truman Show and reality television such as, both give others insight on people's' lives through television and both are a little too invasive in the stars' life, especially the Truman Show because the people can watch Truman for 24 hours if they'd like to. Because the target of this satire is reality television it could be said that the Truman Show is merely an inflation of reality TV to show people the problems that are present in reality TV. The Truman show shows Truman as a baby and you get to see him grow up, most have been watching him his whole life, and in reality TV when there are child stars, like Kendall and Kylie Jenner (who have been on reality TV from a young age), the audience watches them grow up as well, the Truman Show just takes it to the extreme. Reality TV and the Truman show are also similar in the fact that they don't want the stars to leave, so they create obstacles. In reality TV the obstacle that most stars face when trying to get out of the limelight is media backlash/loss of fame. Both of these things can be very hard to face, that's why the star will continue to be a star and make their boss company money. The obstacle for Truman is that he is terrified of water. This fear was instilled in him by the producers of his show, made so that even if he wanted to leave he would be too scared because Seahaven is surrounded by water.",

Its sad, but not too sad. Its funny, but not to annoying extend. Its a clever film, with an interesting plot but not in a way you have to use 150% of your brains to keep up. The characters are unique but none is acting over the top. The music is beautiful, original and perfectly fitting. The decor and setting is very well done. Just perfectly balanced.

Once again the Academy ridiculed themselves by not giving the Oscar to Jim Carrey. It is one of those movies I call a cinematic experience. The perennial story of the fight for freedom, told in a truly original way. If you think you are left unsatisfied with the end, you are potential viewers of the fictional Truman Show. But the most annoying scene for me was the very last, where the two cops take the remote and change the channel to find something else... At their faces I recognized everyone of us.

It would have been great if the director died. During the film, I imagined myself going up to him with a gun and shooting him in the head.

440,24 May 2005,Boheme97,10, The Triumph of Free Will,"There is something very emotionally affecting when you watch someone slowly start to realize that they are caged. How Truman was totally controlled by a corporation. What they insisted to call real, yet controlled. It was controlled in that this young boy's (Truman) father was taken away from him, he was deprived the joys of growing up with a father, not because it was his father's time to go, but because a board of advisers thought it would be good drama, and would help to keep him where he was. In their prison. It doesn't matter that Seahaven Island might in fact be the greatest place on Earth, and that the real world is ""this sick place"". Truman should still be afforded the luxury of choice that we all have. And when you consider that he didn't even get to choose the girl that he married, it makes you feel that much more for him. And I think there is SOME truth to the statement that ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented."" At least, Christof wasn't so blind that he actually realized, ""He could leave anytime, if this was more than just a vague ambition, if he really truly wanted to leave, there's no way we could stop him.""

It goes beyond the simple speculation about the value of privacy and the lack of ethics in the entertainment business, but it leads to ponder about weightier things, for instance the matter of a sheltered but not very interesting life vs. a life of adventure with nothing guaranteed. Also, the reason why utopias don't work: Christof thinks that a world that resembles a fifties movie is the perfect world, whereas Truman's dream is to explore some South Pacific island never visited by man. And, of course, the quest for truth vs. a beautiful lie: In his obstinate search for the true world, Truman understands that truth's beauty surpasses any lie, no matter how shiny or cozy.",

456,5 September 2019,zachanders,10, The Creepiest Non-Horror Movie I've Ever Seen!,"Wow. What an experience. I've never seen a film more thought-provoking as this one - nothing compares to its originality and true craftsmanship put into the production. An absolute gem of cinema.
There is so much about this film that I love. The overall idea of a man's life controlled and watched entirely by a TV corporation is intriguing as can be. I especially love how the TV set resembles a '50s nuke town, architecture wise and how the civilians (all actors) dress and speak. It's a perfect environment in which the protagonist, Truman Burbank, can gradually find small hints and clues as to what elaborate, insidious plan is taking place over his life.
More to add is the stellar cinematography it has. The shots are arranged as if we are seeing it through the hidden cameras put on the TV set, and it can be in the most peculiar of places - light-posts, trash cans, posters, magazines, even Truman's wedding ring. This aspect adds another layer to the film that is unique from most other films' standard camera framing.
The musical score fits the film in the most absolutely perfect way - that is unparalleled to anything I've witnessed before. Yes, I have since come to learn that the musical score was in fact not composed for this film, but for a 1989 foreign film - but the notion still stands. The way it is incorporated into the setting gives off an eerie mood, as it fits the film's eerie feelings.
And finally, I simply must acknowledge the absolute feat of the script and acting that is present in this movie - notably from Jim Carey. I have to admit that Jim Carey isn't really a favorite actor of mine. He's a decent comedian, but from what I've seen of his, I realize his best work is actually in his dramatic roles. The Truman Show has Carey's best acting. It's literally perfect. I honestly prefer him in more dramatic roles. The supporting characters also put up a phenomenal job with their line delivery and overall acting, also thanks to the intricate screenplay.
My favorite of the entire movie is the ending, when Truman crashes his sailboat into the edge of his world (the TV studio). As he walks up the stairs to the blended in exit door, the emotion is in full swing. The elegant music, stunny cinematography, and heart-wrenching dialogue between Truman and the creator, Christof. It's then when Christof tells Truman the truth, saying:",

I really liked the first half, where Truman Burbank slowly began to realize that something was going on. That was really exciting! On an other side, I wish this build-up continued throughout towards the end of the movie. The big reveal kind of spoiled everything in the midway, and things got predictable. I wish we had to follow Truman's perspective all the way, and didn't get any reveal of his life's truth until the very end. That would be a big surprise. I think the actors were great, though! Especially Jim Carrey (as Truman Brubank), Ed Harris (as Christof) and Laura Linney (as Hannah Gill). Very convincing! I realized that camera work that had to types of perspectives: one we as an audience watched, and one as the audience of The Truman Show (and surveillance) watched. A nice technique!

Carrey was perfect as the typical ""Leave It To Beaver"" kind of guy, who turns out to be a real person, who has real feelings.  You see, it's not the ""Leave It To Beaver"" part that is so great about his performance, it's the metamorphic change that occurs in Truman where he moves from the ""Leave It To Beaver"" guy to the real man, who will stop at nothing to know the truth.  This isn't a movie where you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.  You have to think, and if you look close enough, you will see the quietly powerful message; the message of hope and freedom, the idea that no innocent man or woman can be kept in some place against their will, and the idea that if deception is involved, then eventually truth will prevail and hope and freedom will be restored.",

A story about the ultimate betrayal on one hand, a deconstruction of the hyper-realist nature of our post-modern lives on the other, and an unintentional retelling of Doctor Who  Vengeance On Varos on the side, this is really something of a minor masterpiece.  Carrey's Truman Burbank is a put-upon hero to rank with George Bailey from It's A Wonderful Life, a man whose destiny is to come face to face with `God' (and it's also better than Bruce Almighty).  One of the more perfect endings put to celluloid caps it.",
517,30 July 2013,xboy614,10, Truman Show is a wonderful piece of cinema,"Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.",
518,18 July 2011,the_naked_airplane,9, Reality,"""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented."" A film adequately summed up in one quote. It's an allegory on the influence of the media. How films and TV shows and adverts are packaged and manipulated by those who are in a position to do so. The message is strengthened here by Carrey's performance (at a time when he was not known for 'dramatic' roles) and the character of Truman himself who gives the film it's emotional weight. We want to see Truman escape this world that he has been essentially trapped inside, as do the audience of the show as we see them in the film. However they also want their show to continue. For them Truman's life is not reality but catharsis- ring any bells Big Brother, Survivor and the numerous other 'reality' shows of the past ten years? The Truman Show is one of the best films of it's time.",

On one level, you can think of this story as an attack against an inhumane, consumerist, media-controlled society where everything is to be sold and benefited from, even human lives. On another level, the story is nothing but an existential pondering on the man-god relationship. Truman represents the once helpless, mind-controlled man who gradually starts to break free by pushing the limits of his reality's already given axioms. Some may not like this saying it represents a breaking away from god (represented by Christof, the show director), but I think it just encourages man to think outside the box and pushes him to refuse whatever reality imposes upon him... to, simply, unleash his imagination. Jim Carrey did a great job, but the one who really blew my mind away was Ed Harris with his extremely grand and mature performance.. I just couldn't take my eyes off him!",

536,11 November 2007,nelliebell-1,8, A Special Edition,"The motion picture,""The Truman Show"" is not so much an interest but a shock.The picture is not only a discredit but such a fallacious argument as to set back the human race some 150 years.The reference to 150 years was to refer to a time when there was a Civil War in what was then the United States against the Confederate States of America.The conflict was to cause the abolishment of slavery as an exercise in any state right issue whereby a human being was denied the right to life,liberty and the pursuit to happiness.The Truman Show is a latter day attempt to undermine the very foundations of that which there was given the last full measure so that we might enjoy a new birth of freedom.A paraphrase taken from the Gettysburg Address when spoken in July 1863 by then President Abraham Lincoln.There is in fact such an arrogant position had by this film that we might be said to enter into a new world order whereby a state is indeed introduced as a Godless Overseer and right holder to the human being.There is such an inbred contempt for Trevor Burbank who is the victim of this raid of the heart that a story told by Civil War historian Shelby Foote,told of a slave who was the property of an over seer on a Virginia Plantation.The slave managed to escape and won his freedom by moving stealthily through the underground railroad to a community North of the Confederate territory.He was, as fate would have it,to join union forces and at a time later was to be part of a Union move against the South whereby he would come directly across the very land whereby he was once a slave.The story told of the very deliberate seeking out and killing of the overseer with whom he was in slaved to.If this be worth anything it would be that Trevor Burbank should not only seek out and kill Christoph but every person directly associated with the broadcast.This is more than a mere crime this is slavery.The degree to which the ways of this world have parted is that we hardly recognize ourselves because with the passing of time came the advent of telecommunications and the conceit of another form though in fact it was to be the same old story yet in another form.That is what we are in fact looking out in this,""The Truman Burbank"" Show.It is a very real attempt to thumb there noses at the foundations of a Democracy and flaunt their victimization of one Truman Burbank.The characterization of all those around the life of Truman Burbank share not common ground to such an extent that all of life seems merely to be lacking in color and even back bone,such is the offense!This coldly impersonal affront even onto decency is so vile as to be culpable and worthy to die as many times as necessary so as to rid the world of this malady once and for all.Christof should be sought out as stealthily as the story told of the former slave noted above and killed,because he is a Godless Monster.This order should be done with due diligence and with prejudice aforethought so that all associated with this event should see the end of their days on this Earth.There is nothing timid in this attempt to silence a heart beat and there should not be anything timid in its roar back as well.Let the human heart roar back at the attempt upon its place here as this system is as in human as it is a new world order.There is nothing here but a discredit and it is nothing but a discredit that is represented but this attempt upon our place in this world.Though we are in fact looking at a Motion Picture,the entertainment vehicle that it represents is not entertaining at all but in fact represents a hatred for honesty,for nature and for love.This film is an un-natural affront to entertainment and goes beyond mere viewing pleasure to a virtual contempt for civilization.This film is in fact a very violent attack upon life and can be construed as a promise of what maybe coming to a theater near you.You as a theater going public are warned of the propensity to pooh pooh this hatred and dismiss it without the right of way being taken back.The inability to right the wrong breaches the very cloth so sacred in our devotion to duty,honor and fidelity.There is present a matter of life and death with only judgement to wish for in the passing of the days.The end time is now upon this world and it is indeed a time to judge those who have sought to judge us.Let this be a prophecy foretold!",

OK about the story its about guy who has beem taken care of some actors in this and he does not know its real and many people try to get in his way to stop him getting into other places as well. He trys to get out but fails he trys one more time to get out because in his teenage hold he find someone that he really loves and they took her way from him which is the fact he want to get out and find his true love that was the fact that made this movie really good not to bad not to stupid. I love the boat scene where he trys to get out which really good but and thats how movie should be. I know that some people disagree about this but I don't disagree about hating this movie.

If it is to be considered a drama which I think is most fitting, the rating may deserve another star but only one at best. However, aside from the concept of a person being the star in a show he is a unaware of since birth, the movie itself is very dry and boring. The acting is fine but not strong enough to carry the film without causing the viewer to want to do something else and let the film play in the background as I did. I have always wanted to watch this movie but was very disappointed in it overall but do like how the ending leaves the viewer to interpret what may happen next though we can all probably guess accurately. I did enjoy how Christof explained to Truman that he ""is the creator... of a television show,"" that was some pretty fantastic writing.

In the first, somewhat overlong half the story is following the main hero Truman through his point of view and elaborating his quiet, normal life while the director Peter Weir is cleverly choosing strange camera angles to give the feeling as if he is being spy-ed by someone.

When I did eventually see it, I was very impressed by what wasn't in the commercials.  This film has a lot of quiet charm, due not only to Jim Carrey's performance, but also to the subtle, serene way the story flows to it's conclusion.  ""The Truman Show"" isn't a big sprawling epic, with big characters and big events, but a simple movie about a man who is slowly discovering his life is a lie.  There's no real suspense, since the audience already knows the truth.  But, this is not a suspense movie, it is a satire of reality.  Given the popularity of TV shows like ""Survivor"" and ""The Real World,"" ""The Truman Show"" speaks volumes about the American obsession with voyeurism.  This is the best parody of television since ""Network.""",
585,19 January 1999,Paul-103,8, Fascinating premise,"With the myriad of movies out there that are strictly ""formulated"", this was an incredibly refreshing movie.  I thought that the plot line was very original and imaginative.  What really got to me in this movie was not the technology, but Truman's relationship with his ""friends"", and how sad I thought it was that even his ""best friend"" was anything but.  Lots of deeper meanings meandering beneath the surface, one is the coldness which people inflict upon one another using the excuse that it is ""professional"" or OK because everyone else is doing it.  Jim Carrey puts in a very touching performance.  Ed Harris was excellent as his own god.  Highly recommended.",
586,27 January 2012,theshadowoftheghost,10, Brilliant.,"If you can't give something 10/10 to, what can you? This is an excellent film in so many ways. It's heart-warming, inspiring and tear-jerking at times. I was going to give it a 9, but this is exactly what movies should be about: originality, ambition, great directing & acting, and an immersion into a world built up within it. Truman Show has all those qualities. This is something that has never been done before. Those of you who want to take something philosophical away from this film and look into it deeply will find you can do just that; it's deep enough to incite thought, and those of you who just want to sit through a feel-good movie with a few twists and turns that will leave you gripped need look no further. I think this was the first time we saw Carrey shy away from comedy, and although there are parts of his humour that shine through, the film is all the better for it. He plays this part perfectly, right through to its epic climax. His humour is not utilised in this film to give his center stage and an open floor to be as silly as he can, instead this film allows you to laugh with him, and not feel as if you're watching a stand-up show. The rest of the cast are perfect, fitting in well, including Ed Harris as the ""director"". He surprised me here, because he is just the ""right"" amount of his usual badass self, mixed with some emotion and empathy. This is definitely an original concept, and executed well. I haven't seen this film in a few years yet still remember much of it. You won't be disappointed.",

What i really like about this movie, is that the whole movie is a show of a person. The plot was brilliant. I wouldn't think of anything like this if i was a movie director/writer.

A ridiculously humongous set so that he'd never know. Jim Carey was perfect; a seriously funny person but he has another brilliant personality up his sleeve. He can look seriously insane. Jim brings a refreshingly interesting and masterful edge to this film. He plays an ordinary insurance seller in a world that seems to revolve strangely around him. Slowly he begins to realise that things are not as they seem. A strange object plummets down from the sky that appears to be a stage light. It starts to rain... only on the spot where he is standing. His car radio suddenly has strange interferences and then starts reading out his exact coordinates. Jim Carey plays the role very well and one of my favourite scenes is where he and his supposed wife are alone in the house and Jim snaps. The wife's - (actor's!) - desperate attempts to suppress his confused anger and realisation is very cleverly done, but the whole idea, though being original, does seem a bit too far-fetched. Jim Carey as always adds his hilariously wacky touch to the film and overall this is a masterful and original film that impressed and intrigued me massively!

598,7 September 2019,ache-18163,10, Relevant Commentary on the Mass Media,"I found the Truman show to be a very interesting, through effective, satire. In Truman's world, everything is perfect, from his perfect wife, Maryl, to his desk job just a short drive away. In short, Truman is living the American Dream. What he doesn't know is that his life is just an illusion carefully tailored by a television producer broadcasting his every move live, 24 hours a day and that everyone in his life is an actor. After a series of small mistakes and mishaps by the cast and crew of the show, Truman slowly begins to question his world, peeling back layers of the giant set. In this movie, the producers of the show act as the media, constantly stimulating our minds with directionless static that, without careful attention, can fall onto our radar as all-consuming. Truman, in this show, acts as the everyday person, completely absorbed in our world of media, news, and mundane reporters. The repetition of Truman's daily life reflects our own, in this day and age. What, really, then, is our objective in life if we continue to live the same loop for so many years? We have goals, yes, but why are we still stuck in the cycle every day? I loved this movie because the viewer acts as both the observer and part of the issue at the same time. Because we were so focused on the story, we weren't aware of our surroundings in real life, which was brought into clearer focus when Truman became justifiably paranoid. The viewer here is both Truman and the creators of the TV show. This was an incredibly real movie, especially in this day and age where we are so engulfed in media 24/7 and I would recommend it to everyone, especially children who are more vulnerable to media influence.",
599,10 September 2019,cfra-35481,9, Great Movie!,"The Truman Show is a juvenalian satirical analysis on the effects of media and the manipulation media has on our lives and is extremely effective in targeting people who may not know how absorbed they are in modern day television and media. While some may argue that The Truman Show is in fact a horatian satire piece, the deflation used to downplay the actual inhumaneness of the show portrayed in the movie is only hiding the actual dark things going on, such as using ""plot twists"" to make traumatic event actually happen in Truman's life. The entire thing is an ironic take on Truman's life; Truman has no clue that viewers are watching his every move, while the audience and the viewers of 'The Truman Show', as both the show in the movie and the movie are named, are in on the false narrative set by the directions of the show. By inflating the viewership of The Truman Show and portraying everyone as constantly watching and being obsessed, the movie furthers its satirical intent of showing how obsessed everyone is with media, and how the media can manipulate our lives. The subtle innuendos of Truman getting subliminal messaging through the radio and television programs is also an innuendo to us as viewers, and is an eye opener as to how much we, to, are subconsciously impacted by the constant stream of information going on all around us. In the beginning of the movie, Truman is shown to be going about his daily life, just like many of us, and bumps into an object that seemingly fell from the sky. He later hears a program on the radio about how a plane flew past earlier that day, dropping parts as it went. Truman did not react at that time, but the connotation to the viewers was that it was an explanation to Truman that he didn't even consciously register, but was subconsciously filing away the incident with the explanation.",

Not every film is as instantly recognizable as The Matrix or Star Wars, but their set-ups are crucial to the intrigue.

601,11 September 2019,hannahwheeler-78110,9, Very interesting!,"The Truman Show was a fascinating movie that captures the idea of living life the way you want to live it and searching for the right thing until you have found it. In this movie, the main character, Truman Burbank lives in a town called Seahaven which is actually a television show. The beginning of the movie definitely has a few innuendos to what is actually happening. Everyone in Truman's town are actors and no aspect of his life is real, but he doesn't know this. Throughout the movie, the idea of having a ""perfect life"" is definitely inflated as a reason for why Truman should stay in Seahaven and why be kept unaware of what is actually going on in the world and what he is actually apart of. The actors all try to keep him in the dark and anything that could give him a hint to what is actually going on is hidden. This eventually leads to the paranoid side of The Truman Show. As we view Truman's world, we watch as he begins to find one thing odd and then another, until he is very paranoid and he wants to scrutinize everything in the town that seems odd. This was interesting to watch because as an audience, you already know what is going on. You are waiting and hoping that Truman will also figure out the truth and escape his fake world to, finally, live a real life instead of his artificial one.",

It can manifest itself into a reality, or make us realize it was there all along and we just never saw it. It brings up front what we think is normal, and makes us question why is it normal.

The soundtrack is definitely worth buying, and the movie itself is worth seeing for a second time. But the trailers, thanks to the well-praised (!) media I think spoil the surprising and spooky feel.

It might have given the movie a certain sense of pathos and let the audience identify a lot more with Truman.  As it was, I think that too much was given away too soon...knowing that it was a TV show in advance, made it harder to identify with Truman's dilemma.  It made all the show's action seem stilted, the reintroduction of his father obvious, and subplot with the mysterious redhead, unconvincing.  Even the social satire came off as overwrought.  As such, The Truman Show was not the great movie I was hoping for when I went to it.  It had great potential, and squandered it. So consider this, my could-have-been-better pitch.",

The Truman Show is not a typical movie but resembles some kind of reality TV show. As the title kinda says its a show around the character Truman Burbank . Truman Burbank ( Jim Carrey) lives in a city called Seahaven in a huge studio . All the people around him are actors and he is permanently watched by millions of people around the world since he was a small child. Other Characters are his wife Meryl Burbank ( Laura Linney) his best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) and the director founder and manager of the show christoph (Ed Harris). The director of the film was Peter Wier . The reason I think this film is so good is that even after 20 years its still good. Also is the script and plot very nice made . It also can make someone questioning about the might that technology has and what it could do. On the other hand the film sadly gets old and soon will not fit the standarts of filmtechnology soon..",

Truman does not live in the world, he actually lives in an enourmas dome shaped building. He also doesn't know about how everybody around him is an actor, his mom's an actor, his best friend is and actor, even his wife is an actor, but he is not an actor. He starts to become suspicious about his life when his radio goes haywire and he hears a voice commenting on his every move. As the movie goes on he becomes more and more suspicious about his life.

Trueman is desperate to escape his normal happy go lucky life. Because it isn't real. The world has been watching him since birth. His viewers love him. But he has had enough of his life (without knowing he is a star) and its all becoming clear that its perfectly orchestrated.

The plot is quite original and even though t has its similarities with EdTV, personally I like the treatment it got in this movie. The subtle psychological manipulation of Truman Burbank to keep him from finding out that he is just a character in a Reality Show has some ""orwellian"" spin (1984?, Big Brother?).

In fact, it is a sick and violating feeling knowing that they government have been torturing and brainwashing you for decades and have been kind enough to film everything and put it out there for the whole world to see turning you entire life into a sick joke. I have very mixed feelings. This is a once in a generation movie. You only get movies this profound and interesting once every 10 years if you are lucky. So I have to like and respect it for that. It is also an amazing performance by Jim Carrey, he is a great actor who has made many great movies, but I think this is his best movie by far. The visual style is interesting and at certain points the music punches me right in the heart and makes me want to cry until I die. It is just sick the way they traumatise and manipulate a person all for the sick entertainment of the unwashed masses. There is nothing that could make up for the hell that I have been through, but one thing I do find almost comforting is knowing that the same psychopaths who have been destroying my life and taking pleasure in my suffering are being brainwashed and manipulated just as much as I have been, they just don't realise that yet. Natasha is mouth watering. I know I'm a sexual creep, but in my defence the woman is gorgeous. I want to break free.

Those people who describe The Truman Show as ""boring"" or ""not funny"" completely miss the point. I would venture to suggest that they are the kind of individuals who watched every episode of Dallas or Dynasty (or for my fellow Brits, Coronation Street or Eastenders). These types do not like to have their addiction mocked, which this movie does so well. REAL life is not perfect, with every little thing being organised to suit. As someone once said, ""s**t happens"". Although I may not have cast the admittedly excellent Carrey as Truman, his eventual desire to find out if ""the truth is out there"" is human nature at it's most real. Don't we all want to know the truth to our lives? Overall an original movie, and God knows, there are few enough of them. Check it out, and don't forget to engage brain before viewing!!",

683,1 October 2000,redneck-6,8, One of my favorites.,"Jim Carrey portrays Truman Burbank, a man raised from birth by a corporation to star in a televised life in a town that's merely a facade, surrounded by family and friends who really only regard him as a coworker.  It's certainly not the comedy I was expecting, though it stars Jim Carrey and does contain some comedic moments.  Upon viewing, I found it to be intensely dramatic, and quite moving when all was said and done.  The film can speak on a very literal level, aptly skewering our society's obsession with voyeurism and the media's rapacious appetite for conent,  or on a spiritual level, with the gigantic set upon which Truman's ""life"" takes place becoming an allegorical Eden.  While it makes some remarks about what could be considered rather dark characteristics of the modern media's role in society, the film itself is far from dark, and in fact contains a very uplifting message in the end. Jim Carrey turns in an excellent dramatic performance as his character slowly comes to realize that the things happening in his life are sometimes quite odd and surreal.  Ed Harris is good as well as the producer who watches the events in the manufactured town from on high (another obvious spiritual metaphor).  All of the main characters, in fact, do a very good job of switching between Truman's acquaintances and actors simply moving on and off of a set, turning off and on their apparent feelings for the main character.  My favorite scenes were the ones in which Truman appears at his most human, doing something outside of the producer's tightly scripted goings on around the small town. Even if you ignore all of the messages and just take the film as a simple narrative of the events in a man's life, it is paced and filmed well enough that it will probably entertain most people.  And while I've read a few reviews that speak poorly of the ending, I thought it was perfect considering the central theme of the movie.  I highly recommend it.",

686,7 November 2020,elmokenthos,5, It could be better,"Seriously, this could be better. I like the idea, until it became ridiculous. The set was in a secluded area, it's a dome, it's not an open world, so people who enter the dome should be checked, not to mention those who were on the camera. So, the woman (Truman's lover, forget her name), shouldn't even be in the set, but her being in the set, and able to speak to Truman for so long, it's just stupid. Yes, eventually her 'father' got rid of her. But it shouldn't happen in the first place. And remember the one who parachuted himself into the set? How can he did that, it's a dome, it's not an open world! So stupid!!! Truman didn't act by script, so it's another stupid thing to make others act by script. Well, I still enjoy watching the movie, even sometimes I got annoyed by those ridiculous things.",

The way the story progresses is extremely wonderful as we try to look behind the cracked bricks of the fourth wall rather than being fed the classic 100-season show that we are used to following on TV. The only thing that bugs me about this masterpiece is that it doesn't really show us a bit more of Truman's descent to madness after learning the truth. All in all, really good watch with a high rewatch value. Loved the cartoonish feel that contrasts the deep and dark dystopia behind it.",

The movie works in two ways. First, it is an often hilarious satire of the entertainment industry. But, it's not really a satire of reality TV; when Truman came out in 1998, the only mainstream reality shows were Real World and Cops. Nicol's script actually predicted America's (and the world's) fascination with reality based programming. Second and more importantly, Truman Show is a statement about human existence. Truman represents all of us. He is the every man, the true-man. That may sound pretentious, but it works beautifully. Throw in Weir's tight direction and amazing performances by Carrey, Harris and Linney and you have one of the best films of the 90's. A must see.",

I thought it would be a Tv show based off of the title but the creator didn't seem to mind ling to me and the audience. The main issue with this film is that it tries to make you feel sad or happy throughout the movie but it completely lacks emotion. How am I supposed to care about the movie when the characters are so poorly written and unrelatable. The next complaint I have is that the movie never lets the actors get into the role they are supposed to play, and on top of this the movie keeps reminding you that they are just actors and there is no reasoning behind this, I guess the director jut had no idea what he was doing. If you are thinking of watching this do yourself a favor and watch something which is actually good like black mirror.

In the film Truman seems like a typical man with an indefectible lifestyle. However, what soon comes to follow as a shock for Truman is that most of his life is a set-up and he is the star of a reality t.v. show. Truman's suspicions starts as a plethora of deplorable actions from the crew occur; from common mess-ups to breaks in character. He soon realizes that this is not the life he wants to lead and that there's something more than SeaHaven: the truth. One of the more interesting aspects of the movie is the fact that it is actually a very satirical piece. The film calls to notice media manipulation, it inflates the concept and uses a blame by praise to scrutinize the issue. If you do watch this I'd personally suggest actually looking into and interpreting the deeper meaning rather than just watching the movie without a thought. If you are more into Carrey's funnier movies only manufactured for laughs then I wouldn't suggest this in consideration of the fact that it hits closer to sci-fi, drama and is a lot more than just a comedy.

The whole movie manages to be one big hyperbolic metaphor for the societal problems and manages to strive towards fixing them in a blame by praise format due to the way that they show how great the show is, even though they are being incredibly unethical. Even with the beauty of this film's satirical elements, the movie managed to show other incredible aspects in the form of Jim Carrey performing in a more sensible role with none of the slapstick that he is infamous for, and the other thing to consider is that the biggest of the movie impact is the popularity of reality television that was sparked by its release, and how those shows still dominate a plethora of channels to this very day.",

I took this as saying that like Truman in the film we tend to get stuck in routines by whatever the world throws at us and we don't do anything to try and change it, like Truman who went into adulthood before finally realizing his whole life has been planned. This quote could also hint at the way the media affects how people live.

The fake sun that radiates false sincerity of the actor he believes to be his best friend. And it's flawless. There are almost no flaws that give away the illusion until things start to go wrong. Truman shows the symbiotic relationship we have with media and how we want to leave it but we can't break it off. It describes two kind of relationships we have with media. We either adore it and have everything to do with it or we don't get involved with it and are repulsed by it.

Well, this code has been broken in the summer release The Truman Show by Jim Carrey.  Yes, the Jim Carrey from The Cable Guy and Ace Ventura 1 & 2.  Though this rule has been broken before (Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting, Awakenings, and Dead Poets Society), but never this well.  In The Truman Show, Truman Burbank (Carrey), the first person to be born on TV is the unsuspecting host of the television show named, simply, ""The Truman Show"" which has sparked ""Trumania"" in the nation.  Truman goes unsuspecting of his certain-to-be-trapped doom in the TV show.  But one day, while heading to work, an object falls from the sky.  He listens to the radio, suspecting the odd, but the DJ's cover it up saying an airliner dropping parts.  Thinking nothing of it, Truman goes on, continuing his life in his little town, while the day, night, weather patterns, and even Truman's life is controlled by one man, Christoff (Harris) AKA, The Creator.  His pleasant life is disrupted, though, after odd things happen, his dead father comes back, a man Truman's never met before knows his name, an elevator has no back to it, etc.  He slowly catches on that his life is not what it seems to be.  With a fabulous Screenplay written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) this turns out to be one of those films where after you see it, you come out feeling good and thinking.  What if your world is like that?  Is your world like that?  This movie is definitely Oscar bound, a sure fire nomination for Carrey in his second serious role, his first being in the fabulous made-for-TV-movie Doing Time on Maple Drive.

The connotative language throughout the deeper parts was absolutely moving. It made the watcher think about what it would be like for them if they were in that situation and feel horrible for Truman. The idea of media control is still in today's society. We are starting to see some debate over the way the media manipulates public opinion.

At the time the movie was produced the world was just beginning to see reality television and today it's everywhere and has progressed so much from even the movie.

There are cameras everywhere and everyone, including his loved ones, are actors. The only person who doesn't know his life is a television show is Truman. In our current society we are heavily influenced by media. Throughout the film you can draw many connections to the media's influence on our lives. The media influences what we believe and what we do with our lives. Perhaps we are all being controlled under a figurative dome which is being held up by the media. The Truman Show also targets ""reality"" television. As reality television continues to grow in popularity, (such as Keeping up with the Kardashians, The Real Housewives, Duck Dynasty, Jersey Shore) the movie attacks the connotation of ""reality"" in these shows.

As the story progresses the satire of the story becomes obvious. The satire of the Truman Show is the amount of manipulation that the media goes through in order to produce something for their audiences. The producers built an entire town for Truman, ruined lives, and psychologically scarred Truman with the ""death"" of his father. Another interesting point concerning the Truman Show is the way that nothing is truly fake, it's just manipulated. Most of the characters had genuine emotions concerning Truman, but they were fed their lines as to manipulate the scenes in the way that the producers wanted for it to go. The Truman Show also brings up the private vs. public life argument. Celebrities are often struggle long and hard for a private life. This causes damage to relationships for those celebrities. The Truman Show illustrates that with the fact that the television show is 24/7. Truman is watched while sleeping, while brushing his teeth, and while they do pan-away during restroom scenes we hope, one of the goals that the producers have is the first ever live conception. The Truman Show has many different satires targeting a wide range of topics surrounding the spectrum of media influence.",

733,13 September 2016,gjoh-50385,9, Makes you think about your purpose in life.,"The Truman Show was very enjoyable to watch. The show seemed to fulfill a very strong satirical purpose. The show evoked fear and made me feel sad, giving me the impression that it is Juvenalian satire. The show had great examples of purpose, acceptance of the status quo, and morality. First, the purpose of the show was to make the audience reconsider their opinions on capitalism, and our current society. Watching a large company sell someone's life makes one relate to their emotions. This gives the impression of a deep impact on the watcher's viewpoint, and helps them understand the intended impact. The viewer finds a relationship to Truman, and begin to root for him while watching the show. This is relating to the humans ethos, and deflating the worth of human life. Second, the show has a deeper message about humans as a race. Generally, humans accept what they know, and live with the status quo. The whole movie, all Truman knows is the life that he has been shown. He takes over 30 years to actually start reaching out, and desiring to find new things. The system dampered his desires to travel and adventure, but he eventually wanted to overcome. This tells us that we need to try and go beyond what we accept. The directed target seems to big businesses and media, yet seems to give direction to the audience as a whole, no matter if they are the target. Last, the show makes you question the morality of large businesses. As you watch all of the satirical elements, and mainly the inflation of a desire for success, the viewer begins to question what limit we should hold to capitalism. Where should morality be weighed against a human desire to win? The show was highly entertaining, and with the funny moments such as product placement, and ironic/ evident moments of control, the show always keeps the viewer interested.",

I'm grateful for that, but when I found myself asking why it hadn't grabbed me as powerfully as some of Weir's other films, I realized that he hadn't really made me CARE what happened to Truman - I could see the horror of the idea, but I felt no real emotional link to the hero. It's significant that IMDb categorizes the film as ""Drama/Romance"". Romance? That side of the film (= his emotional life) flopped completely, perhaps because the real climax of the film is the revelation of Christof's up-in-space studio: the focus of the film switches totally  to the Evil Film-maker and we succumb to the glitter of high-tech film-making, even if we're supposed to be as frightened as we once were by Big Brother. Why were we not shown the full impact of the reunion with his ""father""? (What on earth would they have said to each other? What pain/joy would Truman have known?)

736,13 September 2016,kvla,9, Review of and Satirical Techniques in The Truman Show,"To quickly explain the movie for those who have not seen it or don't know the basic plot, Truman is a a huge celebrity on a TV show, unbeknownst to him. Everyone in his daily life, even his mom, wife, and best friend, are all actors on the show. Throughout the movie he begins picking up on clues like actors telling him ""it's a TV show"", the same actors walking around the block over and over again for no reason, and the fact that somehow, everyone seems to know what he's doing, where he's going, and stops him whenever Truman does something that's out of his ""character"".

738,6 January 2002,andy67uk,9, Brilliant performance from Jim Carrey!,"Jim Carrey is to 'The Truman Show' what James Stewart is to 'It's a Wonderful Life' - completely indispensable. Carrey's great performance as Truman, a man predestined to be an eternal innocent and denied the full knowledge of how his circumstances came to be, makes this film. In spite of an over-the-top 'Twilight Zone' style plot, this film has more to say about the 'human condition' (and is far superior) than 'Good Will Hunting' which aspires to the loftier heights of 'realism'.",
739,13 September 2016,tpar,9, The Truman Show as a Satire,"The Truman Show is a great satirical piece. Staged within a giant dome, Truman lives his life alongside actors, and he is the only one that doesn't know he is star. During the video, he begins to figure out that his life is a lie. He ends up escaping in a boat, overcoming his fears, to find freedom. The Truman Show is a representation of the control media has over our lives. Wherever we go, we are surrounded by it. In the show, there are a couple of occurrences in which people try to alert Truman of the control the media has over him. In response, the character is removed and the media tries to destroy their credibility. Later on, Truman is able to avoid the cameras by covering some of the cameras and pretending to sleep creating a gateway to escape. The directors of the Truman Show (the movie, not the show) are able to create some sense of freedom, showing how escaping the prying eyes of the public and media allowed him to have his own liberties and control his life. Near the end of the movie, as Truman is trying to escape, Christof, the director with a God complex, tries to scare Truman into going back to the city and living a ""normal"" life. Instead, he chooses to die rather than living as a slave and continues on his path (but he survives). In one of his final lines, Truman says, ""You never had a camera in my head,"" in response to Christof stating that he knew Truman better than he did himself. The accuracy of how the media feels it is in control was brought to mind by the techniques used by the directors of the movie. Overall, the Truman Show is a great satirical piece, helping to bring its audience into the realization of the effect and control the media has over them.",
740,11 October 2001,Smoothfox,9, A truly beautiful film,"How  Jim Carrey didn't get an Oscar for this is a mystery to me. Given the power, I would let this would sweep the board. Like all classics, there are many levels, and subtleties that I am always finding (The Sting is another fine example): so much in the background, and the film has a consistent tone of both cynicism and optimism (You can read it as one man beats the system, or the inevitable point that reality TV will one day reach...remember this preceded the craze!) The actors are all spot on, esp. the background actors who manage to switch on command, providing an eerie Prisoner-esque environment. And of course, if I could nominate a set for best Actor, Seahaven wins hands down. Excellent work all round guys! ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever"" John Keats",
741,23 September 2016,dper-45981,8, Pretty Good,"The Truman Show is a satirical movie about a man named Truman. He is trapped beneath a bubble and is being filmed for a popular TV show. Everyone around Truman knows they are being filmed and knows that they are underneath this dome. Everythings to be going smoothly until one day when Truman finds a girl and it is love at first. She tells him the truth that everything is fake and everyone is pretending. She is then whisked away by her ""dad."" Her ""dad"" then mentions that they are moving to Fiji. Flash forward a few years and Truman is out of high school and questioning everything around him. He then suddenly wants to go to FIji and find this girl. When Truman tries to leave there is always something that stops him from going anywhere. This is of course where the producers of the show come into play and the question of whether the show is treating Truman like a human being. One second it is that all the flights are booked, the next is the traffic, and then there is a hazardous waste spillage on the road out of town and he is tackled and subdued back into his own personal house. The directors sit there and feed lines to all of the people around the place to make sure that Truman never goes anywhere. Bringing his father back from the dead. Whenever Truman decided that he really wanted to leave they cut the stream for the first time ever and made it so that no one would know what is going on behind the scenes. He was so determined to leave at the end of the story they have to almost kill him to keep him in the dome. In the end Truman is confronted by the director of this whole story and he is told the truth. He has a very important choice to make will he stay in the dome and continue entertaining or will he leave.",

In Truman's world, about 5000 cameras are positioned around the gigantic set. Although the government-is-watching-you-scare is now less than it used to be, our lives are becoming more and more public. Not in the least because of this great Internet. But mainly because media is bringing everyone much closer to each other and giving us the opportunity to know much more than before; Making information available on every subject possible. What then, can assure us that eventually our lives will NOT be like Truman's? One big show, for everyone to see. And fake from the bottom up.",
745,13 March 1999,ryan-51,1, As the years go on this film will be laughed at!!,"Let me go on a point by point basis, in discussing this piece of dreck, this film sickened me to the point that I have to write a review for posterity so that they will know how bad it really is. Peter Weir=Dead Poet Society his only good film the rest forgettable Jim Carey=first saw him in Once Bitten - he played the character straight, he can act, it's just that this performance is not worthy of any award. Ed Harris= I defy any of you to name one film in which this man has played anyone other than himself. He plays a character that would only be believable if this were a farce, his character is so unnaturally evil, am I suppose to believe in this film that his character is so obsessed that he is crushed when a fellow human being wants to be free. And what is with the hand gestures, I want everyone to pay attention to his hand gestures, almost homoerotic in a way, if this were done on purpose it might be funny might be fitting, it's that method acting isn't it? The woman who plays his love interest=one word-TERRIBLE her face is shot in such an annoying way it is almost unbearable to watch. PLOT: if you are going to do social satire with a moral dilemma it must be believable(i.e. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (FILM and NOVEL) 1984 (NOVEL) and NETWORK (FILM)) you cannot do a STAR WARS treatment to a supposedly serious film. For example, we are supposed to believe that a man in his early thirties has been on film for his entire life: 1. if he were born sometime in the sixties the technology simply would not be available to carry on with this charade. 2. and most importantly as bad as we are as human beings I cannot believe that any of you would allow this to happen to a person, therefore what is the point of this film? It doesn't make me think of anything other than Hollywood made a great deal of money off of us and we are starting to appreciate the sh** that they give us. So now that Stanley Kubrick has died where are we? The only thing that I can think of is that I am going to have to start making movies, I can't be any worse than these guys!!!",

753,19 September 2018,peterromero-40146,8, An original science fiction feature film.,The Truman Show shook me by its audacity of premise and execution. This is straight out of The Twilight Zone(in fact writer Andrew Nicchol based the screenplay on an episode of The Twilight Zone. Jim Carrey plays an insurance salesman who has no idea that his entire life is scripted and part of a television show. This is a departure of sorts for Peter Weir also and though I have forgotten much of this film I remember liking it a lot. There are many underlying themes and the entire presentation is something you don't see often. This is a healthy recommendation regardless of whether you are a fan of Carrey or not.,
754,18 January 1999,college,1, Crap,This film had a good premise but it failed miserably to develop it. The characters were all over the place.Jim Carrey's acting was the only redeeming feature.

It is both a comedy and a drama, so everyone can get something out of it no matter what they like. Although there is some language, most of the movie is pretty family friendly. It also has a great message about reality TV. One thing you should look out for though is that the ending scene is very intense and may give children nightmares. ",

Normal in all ways, except for the fact that his life is actually a 24-hour TV program, watched by the entire world. Sounds rather Twilight zone, right? Wrong. This is better than anything I've seen on the Twilight Zone. This was absolute heart stopping action, from start to finish. I couldn't believe how fast my adrenaline was pumping or how hard my heart was beating. This obviously isn't a James Bond flick or a movie with Mel Gibson. But this isn't Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. When you begin to watch this movie, forget everything you know about Jim Carrey. Why? Because you will meet a different actor, a totally different man.

So I endured a second viewing.  The third time was another very long story that I won't even get into.  The 5 times I've seen this movie I enjoyed it every time.  Jim Carey really is an actor!  I was amazed at how unike the story was.  No story I had ever seen had come up with an original plot idea like this one.  Laura Linney was great as Jim's ""Wife.""  Ed Harris also did well as an insane creator of The Truman Show.  This movie all together had something.  It had a sort of ""feel-good"" yet ""sad"" yet sometimes ""funny"" attitude.

A small scene with him and Sylvia would've really been something way too good to see, so they let us create it into our minds. Jim's acting really made me cry of happiness when he touched the wall. Definitely gonna watch it again not too soon, because it's that kind of movie, where I want to forget most of it to enjoy it even more the next time knowing how good it actually is. Can't believe I haven't watched it until now. No movie, or rarely movies can be this good these days.",
767,10 September 2018,adow-45952,9," Despite its 1998 release, the message still holds true two decades later","The movie is a good one and can still be a very good lesson for today's audiences. A lot of our society could still be considered the target, relating back to things such as reality television. The shows of even today are idyllic and display an improperly perfect version of our society. The same could be said for those who create video blogs, or vlogs, and videograph the best parts of their lives as if that is all of it.
It was almost aggravating to watch, considering how much I wanted Truman to realize the truth of his reality and speak out about it. It made me both sad and mad to watch the movie because of how it felt like a cruel joke against him to me. But, despite that, I really enjoyed the movie. The way the movie shows the reactions of those watching The Truman Show is a very good addition in my opinion.
The irony of the audience knowing that Truman's life is fake but him not knowing is the most essential part of the movie. Though it could have been shot entirely inside the set of Seahaven, with the audience realizing that it is a television show set along with or slightly before Truman, it would have been a far different movie than what it actually is and watches like. It is hard to say whether that lack of irony would improve the movie or not, as it is such a stark difference.",

So it's not clear why so many reviewers are treating the movie as if it is a cinematic masterpiece. This is a mildly entertaining movie which is worth seeing if you haven't seen it.

771,24 March 2017,iollann,8, The Truman Show review,"Directed by Paul Weir, starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris and Laura Linney, 'The Truman Show' is a satirical comedy-drama about an insurance salesman who discovers his whole life is a television show. Released in 1998 the main character 'Truman Burbank' played by Jim Carrey is perfectly summed up in the films tag line: 'On the Air. Unaware'. Jim Carrey obviously steals the show with it being centred on him with a genuine serious role instead of his usual crude, wacky, comedy self like in 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'. Truman is an insurance salesman living a lie. Unbeknownst to Truman he is the star of the biggest television program in the world. Everybody he knows are actors. He lives in a town inside a studio with cameras everywhere. The character of Truman is easy to like as he is honest and easy to sympathize with as he is a good man. Jim Carrey suits Truman in the sense that he is versatile. In parts Truman can act a bit manic and in others he is quite serious and emotional. This plays into Jim Carrey's hands because he is, as I've said surprisingly versatile. Ed Harris has a very good performance as a supporting actor playing 'Christof' the creator of the television program 'Truman has been trapped in. The best part of Harris' portrayal of 'Christof' is that you are not sure if he wants to help 'Truman' and believes he is helping 'Truman' or if he is doing this for himself, for his ego, money and overall fame. In my opinion, the films deeper meaning is that we have to question news and we can't be trapped in this fabricated world that reality television and the idolization of celebrities like 'the Kardashians' that the media has made. In short, there's a whole other world outside of your television, laptop or phone screen. That is why I feel this film is extremely relevant today because of people being constantly on their phones. In conclusion the Truman show is an extremely thought provoking film, Jim Carrey's performance anchors the film and the deeper message of the film is relevant in today's society. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10.",
772,27 April 2020,calderonp8,9, And in case I don't see you ...,"The Truman Show is a film about a man who lives in this ""perfect"" world, has the ""perfect life"" and the ""perfect"" wife. This man was this life because he lives in a television show, unknowingly. Almost everything about this movie is great, the amazing acting, the script and the plot. The one thing about the film that I thought could have been a little different was the ending. Even though you kind of understand that Truman and Lauren will be reunited, I would have liked it if we actually saw that. Throughout the film, as Truman starts to uncover that the truth about his life I started to think about his actually imperfect life. While some people would say they'd be happy living in this world ignorantly, imagine this. Nothing you have experienced is real, nothing, your wedding was a fabrication for a large TV audience, your wife doesn't love you, hell even your parents are actors. In this discussion I feel like it's just not fair for Truman, while he eventually escapes from the massive set that is his home, what does he actually have in the real world? At the end Christof is trying to convince Truman to stay, by saying that here he has the perfect life and is free from the horror of the real world. When Christoff says ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented."" I believe this is pretty true. Sometimes we wish that our reality would change, such as in these trying times, but we know that we can't do anything about it so we simply try to accept it. While people will always try to fight a reality that they dislike, most will soon simply try to accept it and move on with their lives. In every reality there is something, even if it's very small that we can take away. For example, right now I believe that we can all learn new things at home, and when it's over we'll come out better. While of course there are aspects of the real world that are not very good, it's still real. It's better than any fake life, just as Truman realizes at the very end. The film itself is just amazing, the story is something very original that had a powerful message but still remained very interesting to watch. Jim Carrey's acting is just superb, how you can feel his emotions and his weaknesses. In the film, there are some funny moments in which characters suddenly pause and literally advertise a product. This was funny, but I think it's also an analogy on how every day of our lives we are thrown with so much ads everywhere so we buy things that we don't really need. There were some unrealistic things in the movie, such as how the show would get so many viewers during the first years of Truman's life, I mean I just feel like that would be pretty boring to watch, but maybe that's just me. The other thing is that supposedly the ginormous set is built in Hollywood, but jeez that real state must have been ridiculously expensive. While I get why they did it there, it would have been more realistic if they built it somewhere other that was cheaper. Also at the very very end when the two security guards are watching the Truman Show and when they see Truman leaving, they're like, ""Well we watch something else?"" This was a pretty funny way of showing the reality, like many people try to watch so many things that they can't fully get the essence of what they watched. In Christof's eyes, he is God in this world he has created, but to everyone against the Truman Show, such as Lauren he is a villain. For the media and the people who just love the show he is someone very special though. In conclusion, I felt like this film was greatly crafted, had strong acting, an original plot and real life issues that we should all think about in some way.",

776,2 March 2019,rachelsoriano-76697,9, Rachel,"I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show. He said, ""No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly."" I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself. Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately. The point (the media and its destructive powers) is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals. Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless. Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here. This is a thinking person's movie.

779,23 November 2002,Dr_Cool,8, When reality can be more shocking than fiction...,"I liked Truman Show, although, in some weird sense, it made me feel quite uncomfortable at times. Only Truman and his true love, Sylvia, deserve to be called human beings in this story. The actors, producers and the audience are the true puppets here. I sympathize with Truman's search for truth, but in the end I can feel only pity for him, knowing that he had to live almost an entire artificial life. Anyway, despite the uncomfortable feeling, and despite the lack of humanity of the audience, who can live only through Truman's life (this is by the way the most shocking part of the movie, which most accurately represents reality, particularly now with all those reality shows out there), I thought it was very good. The end was particularly satisfactory and well stitched. The final scene with the guards was very symbolic: Truman's true drama, even with a happy conclusion, had been planned to be just another big fiction, and ends exactly like that: just another mass-consumption show among so many. A very strong message under the skin of what, I suppose, can be seen by some insensitive souls as a superficial just-for-fun fiction.",

And it is made really well. One of the best parts is how they had to make the main character talk to the audience because nobody just talks to himself. So the actors had to push him into talking to himself but actually he is talking to the audience. Jim Carey is not very good at the beginning of the movie because he can't play really well just a normal guy but he nails it after Truman discovers he is in a TV Show. Carey has to play this person who just discovered his whole life was scripted and is going insane and Jim Carey is very good at. It also really makes you root for Truman and you hope he can get out of this ""Matrix"".

793,6 November 2013,millmat,10, Not your average Jim Carrey.,"""The Truman Show"" isn't your average Jim Carrey film, as it doesn't show Carrey using his usual schtick as he does in other movies. And those are the Jim Carrey films that I love to see, because when you take away his comedic appeal, you can get a very dramatic and emotional actor. Carrey plays a man who is unaware that his entire life is a television show. He has been on the show ever since he was an infant. Despite having kept this a secret for 30 years, Truman soon begins to suspect something different about his perfect life, despite the shows clever and hilarious lengths to keep him uninterested in the world outside of him. Where does Truman want to go? Well, in a very interesting subplot, we learn that Truman wants to visit Fiji. Why? Because the girl of his dreams, (previously an extra on the show, now an activist living in the real world with an ambition to free Truman with the help of political activism) was taken away by her supposed father, who hastily replied that they were going to Fiji. Now Truman wants to go to Fiji to reunite with the love of his life, and escape his blond and boring wife. If there's one thing that holds this film together, it's the acting. Not just from Carrey, but from the supporting cast, which has an exceptionally difficult job of being a good actor when portraying a good actor, and they pull it off flawlessly. One of ""The Truman Show's"" themes is feeding into ones anxieties. It carries this off by having Truman live in a world where travel is frowned upon and made to seem to dangerous and too expensive. There's a really funny and well done scene where Truman goes mad, and attempts to drive to anywhere in America, and the show tried to retail irate by presenting Truman with controlled dilemmas like traffic, forest fires and chemical leaks. It makes me happy that I didn't see it when I was younger, because it surely would upset me. But even still, Truman still attempts to escape, giving the character a sense of courage. And that's what makes ""The Truman Show"" work. The character is great. The character is relatable. He represents a great film character. And what great film character would be complete without a great film. ""The Truman Show."" Check it out.",
794,15 December 2005,stephieca,9, Fantastic,"The Truman Show is truly a movie we need in today's world of massive media coverage. Who hasn't felt like poor Truman, feeling like the whole world was watching our every move? Imagine finding out that was actually true! I have a hard time not getting teary during the scene where Truman talks to his best friend and his best friend, in the same sentence, proclaims that Truman is like a brother to him and then tells him the lie to top all lies... all while swearing Truman can trust him! In the scene, Truman has tears in his eyes as he is really listening, but yet you can tell he has doubts to his friend's honesty...at least that is what I feel. At that moment, everyone can relate to Truman. He feels that there is no one in his world he can trust, and hearing his best friend lie finally verified that for him. The risk he takes in the end is truly a quest for real love and real friendships, and in this action there is somewhat a lesson to the viewer. Ed Harris and Jim Carrey are terrifically cast, even if they don't interact until the last few minutes of the movie. Sometimes the creator must let his creation go :)",

Somewhere between the illusion of power and the realization of no power exists the existential nightmare which we observe in Truman. He is indeed 'true-man' and can be identified with perhaps more than any hero in the history of the screen simply because he IS the screen and we are given awareness of the fact. Truman will be destroyed by the outside world - maybe a bit pessimistic - because he will become the greatest celebrity in the history of the role. Whereas, to him, our Earth is his Heaven, our heaven is his unimaginable and the frightening realities (violence, pollution) are his Hell. So where is Truman Burbank really going when he passes that irradiated threshold?",

As Truman Burbank, Carrey displays an emotional depth in this movie like I've never seen him portray before.  As a man who's begun to realize that his entire world is not what it seems, Truman's reactions to these breakdowns in his reality are priceless.  The car trip in which he tries to escape the `city' is absolutely hilarious.  Carrey's typical brand of slapstick and low-class humor is thankfully absent from this movie.  In its place is a movie that you feel good laughing at.  And Truman's scene with his `father' is a true work of art.  Don't miss this movie.",

817,1 November 1998,pluis,8, Great film despite lots of weaknesses,"At last The Truman Show has reached the mainland of Europe. And after all the hype I saw on IMBb reviews, I must confess that I am a little bit disappointed. True, the movie makes its depressing theme ""life imitates the media"" very clear, and I would advise every critic who mistakenly calls this a comedy, to look up that word in a dictionary and compare the result with the things he has witnessed on the screen. The view on society that is pictured in The Truman Show is very bleak indeed. Still, good drama should be believable all the way and it is here that director and scriptwiter let us down. The suggestion is that people are watching the show day in day out and never consider switching channels. Why? Of course the idea of an actor believing he is leading a normal life is appealing (to the audience), but is it entertaining as well? What happens when Truman goes to sleep, and his house is dark and silent during seven or eight hours? In fact, what happened in the first couple of years of his life, when he wasn't up to anything more substantial than crying while lying down or whatever an infant does to pass the time? It is hardly likely that viewers enjoyed the continuous sight of an infant solely for the reason that it wasn't aware of this ""immoral"" intrusion of its privacy.",

819,9 December 1998,tajci,10, The best movie of the year,"This is the only movie from the entire summer season that I've been looking forward to, and I was quite scared that I'd be disappointed when I finally walked into the cinema. But - without a reason. The Truman Show IS the best movie I've seen this year. I think, I admire most how ""whole"" it seems. From the beginning to the end we have been watching THE Truman Show, and not the movie about Truman Show (although there are bits of that as well - and I feel that this is it's only flaw). I enjoyed every line and every scene in it. The movie is full of excellent writing and directing. The way that Peter Weir doesn't want to show Truman's deepest emotions when he finally finds exit, but instead hides his face from us and let us imagine how Truman feels. Or how motive of escape to Fiji evolves in the movie: first, it's just a remote place on the Earth where Truman wants to escape; then it's a place where his love lives; and finally, it's a map of Fiji that hides Truman's escape. And so, in a way, Fiji becomes Truman's escape. Also, the amount of our identification with Truman is amassing and unseen in Hollywood movies for years. And if you haven't seen the movie and you're afraid that it's very ""serious"", i.e. boring, I can reassure you: It's not boring - it's funny and time just flys by. I would say that this movie is a MUST for everyone, especially those who think that Jim Carry cannot act (I was one of those, but I've changed my mind). P.S. I've seen once an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" with the same main plot, but it ended differently.",

It marks the suprise turn of Slap-stick comedy actor Jim Carey into the drama/serious movies and does it not that badly.

Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone.

At the time, I thought it was a very good film with undoubtedly the best performance by an actor that I'd ever seen, at the time, by none other than Mr. Jim Carrey. I was never a big fan of this guy until 'The Truman Show'. His performance alone is worth the price of a rental! Only the recent performance by Sharlto Copley in 'District 9' is somewhat better than Mr. Carrey's. Over the years since it was released, 'The Truman Show' has become more relevant, and far more potent and personal. I watched it again a couple of nights ago, and was shocked, realizing while watching the film, at how our current television programs have been overrun with 'reality' shows and 'entertainment reality' shows. With what may be divine foresight, Mr. Peter Weir and his crew created 'The Truman Show' which depicts our 'reality show' at its far extreme. If you haven't seen this, and are a 'reality show' fan, then watch this movie, and prepare to be shaken. A tie for my number 2 spot with 'The Green Mile', behind the number one film of all time 'The Shawshank Redemption'. And like 'Shawshank', I strongly believe that this film's list of admirers will continue to grow such that it will be, someday, in the 'IMDB's Top 250' where it so rightfully belongs! Heck, it should be in the 'Top 10'!",
837,22 December 2017,gamzeyilmazcan8,10, fantastic!,"The Truman Show is like a mirror of our postmodern world and the way we maintain our lives. How can we know that we are not being watched or controlled? The problem is that Truman has the courage and confidence to leave the world behind to chase after the truth and original. That doesn't mean that everyone has that courage. We are used to see the things as they are and we accept the world the way it is presented. Very few people try to find the meaning of our essence and how the truth can be found in the deep oceans. We know that the place Truman lives is a simulation, but when we turn and look our world we can't see any difference between Seaheaven and the world we live in. The bed we sleep; the chair we sit or the book we read are just a simulacrum. We don't attempt to look for the original because the copies become the reality and that doesn't bother us at all. Truman Burbank is the man who cannot make shift with the visible or knowable, he is brave and courageous enough to look for the light and truth.",

840,13 September 1998,Pete-17,7," Strong premise, weak execution","What occurs in the first act of ""The Truman Show"" is about as good as it gets.  The expectations for this movie (and probably most of its overrated praise) are based on the first half of the movie in which the Ed Harris character describes ""no scripts"", ""no cuecards"", and most importantly that Truman (Jim Carrey, in not a ""serious"" role but one not nearly as silly as he's played before) is a genuine character, not artificially created.  Now, if this were all true and the movie evolved as it should have along these lines, perhaps it would deserve all the praise it is getting.  However, everything that happens in the later 2/3 of the movie completely undermines everything we've been lead to believe about this world Truman lives in. Imagine my utter disapointment when during what seemed like a truely emotional scene between Truman and his best friend, we cut to the control room to find the best friend being fed his lines!  What was that about not cue cards?  What follows completely destroys what was one a wonderful premise and gives no hope of redemption.  Even when Truman finally goes against the odds and attempts to escape the small island, it turns out to be a case of too little, too late.",

Those are one of the last lines of The Truman Show,  and     simply one of the best lines in the whole movie. Jim Carrey and Ed Harris takes us to an odyssey of moral issues; You can never think yourself as a God, because the more you believe it, the less your sons adore you. When I saw this film I was in the biggest state of awe i have ever been in a long time in a movie theater, I LOVE all the camera angles in every frame, the Director Photography must've had quite a lot headaches trying to satisfy Peter Weir demands, and in my opinion, deserves and Oscar, as well as the Editing, Art Direction, and Music. Not to mention the great performances by Ed Harris (who should've won the Oscar a long time ago) and Jim Carrey (the first time he actually attracts the audience not only by his jokes and charm but also by his heart). Many people disagree by the ending, the believe to be frivolous and incomplete, but I believe they are wrong, the whole movie IS THE TRUMAN SHOW, and after Truman leaves the set, THE SHOW IS OVER, that's the whole art of the issue, If we get to see him in the outside world, it would be some kind of sequel, not precisely THE SHOW. This is one of the most original movies of the 90s, anyone who adores the art of making movies out there as much as I do, don't miss it.",

846,26 February 2000,ickyptang,10," ""The Truman Show"" is a masterpiece.","""The Truman Show"" was one of the true masterpieces to come out of the late 1990's.  One contributing factor being the dynamic performance by Jim Carrey, proving to his critics that he's not just a ""rubber-faced goon"". But despite Carrey's breakthrough, the film stands on it's own as something truly unique.  The script, by Andrew Niccol beautifully satirizes our television and media dominated era, incredibly being cynical and heartwarming at the same time.  The viewer is allowed to observe the ridiculous position Carrey's Truman Burbank is put in and at the same time care for the man, much like his millions of adoring ""cattle"".  While laughing at the ignorance of the apathetic world around Truman, one can not help but be fascinated by his story.  But the script is not the only genius. Peter Weir's stylishly executes  the story at a rapid pace, cramming so much into the film, and at the same time creating an entertaining and hypnotic movie.  The camera positions switch back and forth from an ""directorial"" standpoint to the ""hidden cameras"" all over Truman's world, giving a multitude of perspectives, and ultimately creating an amalgam of emotions.  ""The Truman Show""  walks the fine line between comedy and drama, even surpassing the typical ""dramedy"", designing a world all it's own, perfectly capturing the bizarre place Truman is stuck in.",

I also think that the part of the story, when Truman is unaware that he's on a TV show, should have been extended in length. I don't know the name of the lens where the viewer sees just a circle of the screen, but I don't think it should have been used. If the camera was positioned to make the viewer THINK something was wrong, but not be quite sure, I think it would have been better. I think that soley unique camera angles would produce an awesome effect (and a greater ""Wha????"" moment when we realize Truman is on a show).

I recall TTS being marketed as just another funny Jim Carrey movie and for this reason, and the fact that his previous popular movies were all very comical, general expectations were that it was the next laugh-out-loud Carrey movie with his unique style of pulling faces and elastic slap stick style comedy. I must say I didn't enjoy this movie so much when I first saw it in the cinema because I didn't appreciate the concept. I was also a teenager looking for the usual fun and laughs from watching a Carrey movie. But after having watched Carrey films that followed, such as Man on the Moon, The Majestic (a personal favourite) and Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind, I appreciate what a fantastic actor the man is. His ability to play funny man is matched in his ability to be taken seriously. He should've had an Oscar in his hand ages ago, particularly for his performance in The Truman Show. I strongly believe that had this movie been released within the last couple of years, in the age of reality TV where more people would understand and relate to the concept, it would've received the appreciation it deserves and Carrey would've been nominated for an academy award.

He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor.

We can say that some of these initiatives give immortal artifacts to cinema history. It is certainly not exaggerated to say that THE TRUMAN SHOW, one of the master pieces of Peter Weir, is one of the most important pieces of these works. Truman show tells a person who has met his fake identity in an isolated environment as if he tells Sommerset Mills that he never knew his name in the movie SE7EN and he says ""they follow us all, they look at what books we have taken from the library and analyze us"" Truman Show is a production with only a few movies in fact.",

Why is it scary? The Truman Show is about the ultimate conspiracy. A conspiracy that can actually pull it off for 30 years of this man's life. Creating a make believe world where nothing is even close to what it looks like. And it IS believable. In Truman's world, about 5000 cameras are positioned around the gigantic set. Although the government-is-watching-you-scare is now less than it used to be, our lives are becoming more and more public. Not in the least because of this great Internet. But mainly because media is bringing everyone much closer to each other and giving us the opportunity to know much more than before; Making information available on every subject possible.

Story is pretty plain - TV corporation adopt newborn just for create 24 hours uninterrupted TV show about his whole life.
The town, where he grown and live is one giant TV studio. All people around, whole town population are actors. Fake parents, fake emotions, fake job, fake friends, fake ""fate"". Everything in his life is secretly controlled by TV visionary Christof, including what woman he have to start dating and marry.
It's quite interesting, that despite Christof saying in first line ""We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions."" and then ""there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards."", practically everything in movie contradict his statement. Everything is phony and fake. So much resemblance with our life and world around us, isn't?
However, despite such uniqueness, or maybe exactly because of that, there are too many plot holes. After deep analyze, such thing as 24hrs TV show of whole life one person, whom have no idea about that, couldn't really exist not even survive. Especially financially. Interesting moments from Truman life shown in movie looks fine, but if his whole life would be transmitted over 3 decades while show is on the run, those few interesting moments would be spread over that time so rarely, that hardly enough people would watch such boredom show, not even speak about financial aspect.",

The director Peter Weir does a very good job making fun of us. He shows through comedy, triumph, and weakness how to advertise. The way that Weir makes fun of reality TV makes all Americans look like cruel idiots. The Truman Network that people watch almost 24/7, is pop culture at its weakest. This is saying right there that we are sort of interdependent to it. Also it proves Foreign countries opinion that Americans are lazy by showing people of all ages watching The Truman Show. Overall Jim Carrey and the rest of the cast does an amazing Job of portraying the fairytale life of Truman",

Jim Carey did a phenomenal job... of course having a fantastic director like  Peter Weir does not hurt! Weir does a wonderful job of using his actors in ways that surprises you. Holland Taylor does a great job as a woman who ""loves"" her son even though she is just acting...Laura Linney is incredible was the long suffering actress that must play Truman's wife... and Noah Emmerich does a wonderful job as Truman's best friend when in reality he is Truman's worst enemy. This movie is truly disturbing because in this media driven world that we live in it is not that big a stretch of the imagination that the networks would try something like this... or that we would all watch it whether we admitted it or not...

But the truth is cruel. Trumen Burbank, is actually a well-known leading character in a TV series called ""The Trumen Show"". All of his movements have been recorded by cameras, sent to worldwide by satellites, and at last, shown by the TV monitor, and have been seen by most of the people around the world. Having read the novel ""Running out of Time""? Jessie Keyser, the young leading character in this book, has the same situation with Trumen. Living in Clifton in 1840, she didn't know that many eyes have watched their life until her mom told the truth, about the outside world in 1996. It just let me think about those celebrities. They have been chased by some paparazzi since they became a focal point. ""Princess Diana's accident"" might proved this. Some odious paparazzi, no, ""spies"" would said,""This is just my job."" for excuses. This movie told us, that the importance of the right of privacy and respectability to the others.

Some things are fake and when you can't see that its dumb but you can try to change that. The film was really good and the actors did a great job because the show felt like you were a part of the story and it also showed that when you love someone you would do everything to do things with them and make them happy. When you only watch a few scenes you will not understand much because its difficult to umderstand if you didnt watch the whole film because its complex. I think the film was good and when you watch it you have to watch it till the end because thats the best part. At first i didnt want to watch it because i thought it was horrible but in the end i think it was a pretty good film.,
903,27 April 2020,rilemadi,9, What is reality?,"If a child is told that the sky is purple, they will believe that it is purple, until they figure out that it is blue. I feel that this analogy rings true to life, as it is the previous views, that often corrupt the present ones, that are yet to be known. But what if the context of this analogy wasn't political? What if this analogy referred to every day of your life? We see this all the time in movies, but I believe, that the best example of this, is through the film The Truman Show. Personally, I would call this production a film as you come out of it with a slightly altered view of the world. Not only do you start to look at things differently, but I found myself second guessing if the things that I have always known were real. Although this was not my first time watching the film, I would rate it a 9/10. I have always really enjoyed the film because I love its concept and its play on reality. Above this, I believe that the Truman Show is in fact an incredible mixture of cinematography, and the perfect story. As previously mentioned, I love the films concept, but the film wouldn't be the same without its unique cinematography, as the camera often times takes the place of those that are filming Truman for the show. This is something that you rarely see in movies, and I think that it added an extra sense of individuality to the concept. To further push the main message of the film, each element of the production comes together to confirm the concept that we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. Personally, I highly agree with this statement. This goes along with upbringing, to simply believing in the facts that we as a society have presented as our truth. That being said, sometimes reality can be a toxic thing. In the past, people were told that certain individuals were not equal to others due to their sexuality, gender, or race. Unfortunately, this implementation of reality has stuck in the brains of many, and admitting the wrong in what we previously saw as true proves to be a challenging thing to overcome as a society. This is ultimately the danger of reality. That being said, sometimes it's not up to us to shift reality. Sometimes reality shifts on us. The Covid-19 crisis has changed our world and ultimately changed our version of reality for the remaining months this year. Although terrible, this crisis isn't all bad, as urging people to stay inside has started to help heal the planet and put an end to our on going environmental issues. As seen in the film, many bad things can be seen with two sides. I feel as though the film does the best job in showing this through the incorporation the character Christof, who is the creator of the Truman show. Christof is seen as a hero to the viewers and marketers of the show, as he has provided them with 24/7 entertainment, and sponsored several products in the process, their for taking the place of adds that would normally be on television. On the contrary, he is seen as a villain to Truman, and those who do not agree with the show. As Truman sees it, he has stolen his life and forced him to live a lie for over 30 years. Ultimately, not only does the movie come down to reality, but perspective. Everything, and anything can be seen in different ways. So, what is reality really?",

The relevant philosophers are even less accessible to lay persons.

How come the IMDb plot and storyline give this to the viewer and actually declare that he is already in a T.V. show. It is so much more enjoyable to watch this not knowing anything and discovering it for the first time. As I really like the film I have watched it more than once but the first time being clueless about the T.V. show made the film highly memorable and much more entertaining.

There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor.

It's creepy, very much so, in the way that The Original Stepford Wives is but more so in a way, and I wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently, instead of the late 90's when reality TV was just starting to cause a ripple. I first started changing my thoughts on Carey after Bruce Almighty, a great movie (and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for.)

For the romantics there is a love story between Truman and Sylvia, Lauren, for the comedians Jim Carrey hilariously portrays Truman Burbank, and for the dramatics it tells the all too sad story of how a young child is taken at birth and raised by a corporation for profit.

920,27 February 2018,katiecaswell,8, The Truman Show Review,"The Truman Show, a heartwarming film yet disturbing image of the ideal American life revolves around a man, Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey, who lives his life unknowingly on a giant television set where his life is and has been broadcasting live ever since he was born, 30 years ago. 
Throughout the film, the director, Peter Weir, uses many shots that have a faded black circle around it or use a fisheye lens. This is a constant reminder to the audience that Truman is secretly being watched and televised. There are many other techniques used to help reinforce this idea that Truman is trapped in a false world such as unnatural lighting where a spotlight is seen coming from the moon. Many of the characters will also look directly into the camera, which is known as ""breaking the fourth wall"". This is seen when Truman is talking and looking at the camera through his mirror making it seem as if he is trying to communicate with the audience. There are also subtle comedic references that would hint at the fact that they are in a TV show such as Truman's closest friend, Marlon, and wife, Meryl, having names that resemble famous actors. 
Jim Carrey balances comedy and drama well in the film, very different from his well-known roles played in Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Overall, Peter Weir does a very good job at portraying how Truman's world has been manipulated and controlled throughout his whole life, forcing the audience to question their own world and the control they have on it.",

Life in ""Seahaven,"" the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such '50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Show's satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).",

We are shown that every turn he makes, every attempt to escape is blocked by malevolent simulators and high tech manipulators intent on keeping him inside. He is watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week and his life televised as a form of entertainment. Paralyzed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident, Truman still feels he is missing something.

But in The Truman Show it really came through. The drama and comedy were perfectly balanced. The one thing that really was astonishing was that I found myself doing precisely what I thought was morally wrong. I was sitting there and following his entire life to every detail and wanted more. I almost wished that I was there in that ""movie-world"" watching the TV, following his every move. When I realized that, I really loved the movie. It sucked me in and spat me out again.

I enjoyed the movie on just about every level, and I found the story line to be easy to understand and very meaningful as well.  Jim Carrey did a superb job in his character; I was pleased to see that he could perform a serious role so well.  I also loved the details in the movie, like the ways Omnicam ""manufactured ways to keep Truman on the island"".  It's an amazing plot, the way all of Truman's life was viewed by millions without him being aware. The only weak points I found involved the movie being a bit far-fetched (only in the effects, like being able to create artificial thunderstorms in a man-made dome).  I also thought that the ending could have been a bit longer. But, as a whole, it was brilliant. I was very disappointed it did not receive more Oscar nominations.",

944,9 January 2005,bmwonderyears,10, genius movie that strongly applies to todays society,"The Truman Show is an original and brilliant idea. It is a satire for how the media consumes us. Truman is a metaphor for the public. He is born into a false reality of life which is controlled by a corporation (christof). This relates to us because most of us grow up glued to the television, and hanging onto every word the media tells us. Most people don't realize the power of the media. It can run your entire life, as it did Truman's. The media shapes who we are in real life. We are shaped by about 5 or 6 major corporations, which own everything around us. In Trumans case, he is controlled by one corporation. Christof will go to any extreme to give the fans what they want. At the end of the movie, he makes the whether so stormy that he almost kills his movie star for the sake of ratings. This is only a slight exaggeration of the extremes that the real corporations will go to for higher ratings. The real corporations tell you everything wrong with you, and they tell you the exact way you have to be in order to be acceptable to society, just so you will buy their products or watch their t.v shows. All of these ideas about the media are expressed in the Truman Show. Their are so many subtle, but important details about the media that are overlooked, so you pay close attention and watch it over and over if you need to.",

946,2 October 1999,James-207,10, Something different for a change,"At last, something a little (not completely) different from the movie whorehouse that is Hollywood today. The Truman Show is such a wonderful movie it just has to be seen to be believed. I have read many comments made about this and there are flaws, but we don't watch movies to look out for flaws. If they are obvious ones then fair enough, but this film is consistent and true to itself and paints a good enough picture of a world in which one man is put on a stage without him knowing it. But the true success of this film is how you cannot help but root for the guy (one of my personal top qualities of a successful film). You feel his pain and you just want him to get the hell outta there!!! I don't really like Christof much, he is a little one dimensional and a bit too on the evil side...a bit sick. But that aside, there is not much else at fault. I love the way we see Truman as the viewers would see him, ALL the time...because they have cameras everywhere..that is so clever. Anyway, enough about the film - i'm going to watch it again right now. Bye!",

948,10 September 2006,sparklesgirl,10, Wow.......It really changed my mind,"It really changed my mind about Jim Carrey. Now I'm not a big fan of Jim, I think he is witty, stupid, and quite irresponsible. I always find that in every movie he is in he does something stupid. Not in this one though. This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Who thought up this scenario, I don't know but it was an amazing piece to watch. I must tell you I cried near the end. I usually never cry over movies unless they are sad; but it had the music too and it was really good. Jim Carrey showed me that he can be sensible in one movie and I'm sure if you ask people ""What is one of Jim's best performances?"" They'd say ""The Trueman Show"" right back at you. I remember the scenes so well even though i have only seen it twice since it was released. I guess what they say it true: A good movie stays with you forever. Now I would recommend this movie to any of you out there, I gave it a 10/10 which is quite unusual for me. But i really did love this masterpiece, so if your considering it please do.",

Seahaven is a town that is portrayed as picture perfect in fact the set of a TV show. As a dramatic set of events occur Truman starts to uncover some clues and test his boundaries with things. I liked this movie because it always kept you on your feet with what is going to happen next. Multiple times throughout you just want to cheer on the underdog to unveil his ignorance and help him be enlightened of what is happening. Other times you are chanting on the other side wanting the story to continue. I would definitely want to watch this movie again and recommend it to other people due to its creative story line and way to portray the message they are trying to get across.

I didn't know the secret when I saw the film, and was able to enjoy the little doubts and wondering that the filmmakers so carefully planted. Truman's world is controlled by a TV producer named Christof (Ed Harris), whose control room is high in the artificial dome that provides the sky and horizon of Seahaven. He discusses his programming on talk shows, and dismisses the protests of those (including Sylvia) who believe Truman is the victim of a cruel deception.

It was interesting to see how Truman got pushed against posters for advertisement, even his own wide did a hot cocoa add in his house. It was funny to see how far people would go just to get a product out in the public, since they know that people were always watching. In a way I don't think that it was fair that Truman had to go through his life thinking that his father died in a horrible accident, but the movie has a good ending since Truman comes to realization and finds out that his father is still alive.",

You get all the emotions and drama that makes a movie good. How they come up with this idea for a movie is incredible. If this were a true t.v.show it would definitely be the ultimate reality t.v. show. There isn't a person out there who I think could say that they didn't like this movie.

I think since he became really successful through comedic movies like ""The Mask"" or ""Ace Ventura"" he was categorized as a comedic actor. I think if he didn't accept those roles, he would be offered more serious roles today and I think he would be successful at it. I liked all of the irony in the movie, like all the scenes that were related to the bible. This is one of the movies I really paid attention to the detail and not just the entertainment aspect of the film. I'd like to see Jim Carrey in more serious roles in the future.

Truman making a photograph of his lost love Sylvia out of mag zines was also quite good. Personality of Truman could have been explored in a better way. They way he starts doubting everything happening around and deducing was not rightly justified.Many faults can be ignored if this movie was made as a light humor with fantasy.The whole idea of incorporating different characters in Truman life is quite creative in same ways.

And of course, Jim Carrey is phenomenal as Truman Burbank--comedic, dramatic, wonderful.  I hope he does more films like this.

I was not deceived: it is an excellent film, with an good plot, and good actors. The only thing I find bad is that Jim Carrey has not been able to change completely his way of playing his rule.

I have also seen some of his other films, such as Ace Ventura, Pet Detective and When Nature Calls, Dumb and Dumber and Once Bitten. In The Truman Show, as in Liar Liar, he shows a different style of acting which is extremely good - he shows that he can actually be serious!! I think this was a very challenging role for him, because he has done so many comedy roles in the past. He should maybe make more movies like this one, although comedy is really his scene, but The Truman Show is a real winner for me. The story line is fantastic and the acting was really well done. I give it 9 out of 10.",
990,30 May 2000,tom.glorieux18,9, Original and intellectual,"Maybe the biggest mistake of the makers of The Truman Show was bringing the film in the theatres almost at the same time Ed Tv was playing or was going to play. This is no Ed Tv, but I think many people actually think that. The Truman Show is more interesting and especially genius in style. Maybe the best part of the film is that the viewer actually feels with the character. Also it's one of the most original movies I have seen in years. The way the story unfolds is wonderful to see. I will not tell you how the story goes because then I will say things that uncover already basic elements of the movie. You just have to see it for yourself. Jim Carrey is amazing to watch and Ed Harris is his usually self, that means brilliant without stealing the show. That part is for Carrey and he doesn't use his gags or funny faces to amuse us.

994,14 April 2021,liamkelly-65678,9, Surprisingly watchable,Very good film. Philosophical and the actors were given a lot of space to explore their characters but it manages to keep things moving a long. Carrey and Emmerichs scenes were among my favorites. Holds up very well thematically. One of the best films from that era.,
995,31 May 2020,Abhigyan_Datta,10, One of the best in the history of films,"The concept explored in this film is completely unknown and unthinkable to most people. As a result it becomes paranoia inducing. The uniqueness in the story hits us so hard that we start questioning the reality around us.
A man whose whole life is a reality show, all he does is shown live to the rest of the world. He has been trapped inside a set which is made to look like a city. Everyone except Truman is an actor who plays a part in his life and makes the show interesting. Truman is seen to have a perfectly normal life with his friends and his wife. Not even for a moment does he realise that his whole life has been a setup, a reality show. It is the arrival of Lauren Garland who tries to bring the reality in front of him. She couldn't put up with the fact that a man's whole life was nothing a hoax, a show to entertain people. She condemned the usage of human lives as lab rats. Eventually Truman realises the reality and goes all-out in breaking the barrier of the set and escape from this show.
It hits us with the paranoia of happening the same with us. The audience starts questioning their reality , whether they are in a reality show as well.
In my opinion, it also brings up a surprising fact.
""We accept the reality with which we are presented"".
The fact that Truman saw the same people everyday and they all did the same thing over and over again didn't bother him ever. That is true for all of us. We all are so habituated to our daily lives, which contains performing the same routine over and over again. This film shows us that our lives can be a reality show and it still wouldn't bother us as our perception of living a ""normal"" life has so narrow prospects.
Jim Carrey delivered a marvellous performance in the film, as always. His signature laughs along with the insane ability to express emotions shone throughout the film.
The film deserved all the awards it bagged, if not more. To me it is a creative and unique masterpiece forcing us to question our reality.

This movie can be represented as a clear example that many times we live in a delusion. This could also be seen like we live in a bubble ande we don't want to look outside of it. The feature film in my opinion is too long but it is well developed. I really like the soundtrack and of course Jim Carry as the protagonist he handles great the paper.",

Those looking for Dumb and Dumber should look elsewhere.  I can still remember the inappropriate laughter from those in the theatre during a very profound scene in which Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) actually touches the limits of his known world for the first time.  Those who were looking for Ace Ventura were just dying to laugh at something - those who weren't saw the scene for the philosophical statement it really was.",

Not a trully ""American"" classic at all, in reality an unusual prospect of life.

At the same time, it has been a very good criticism for the ever-increasing human life, especially the commodification of private life and human relations. The film has taken up the growing television madness during the filming period and has drawn attention to a possible danger, and when it says that it will be so in the future in the future, the television madness is suddenly replaced by computer internet and social media madness. While the film really makes people think about this kind of things, it also feels the happiness that being free to live on their own (again free and according to what is free and how it is discussed), but the play of Jim Carrey, who can directly convey these happiness and feelings to us, Even the seeing of Jim Carrey's face in the Wild Animal Detective Jim Carrey is causing people to grin or I said to myself that most movie stars are actually a bit of a Truman movie.",

1015,15 May 2005,avfcaira,10, Disturbing and wonderful,"I've seen many movies - and of course - many Hollywood movies. Although of other descent - I usually favour European film - yet - more and more - and so often in the past - the US makes the most wonderful and deeply moving films - yet does not recognise its own art for its worth. Especially in terms of awards. But - they - the awards, are just objects - the celluloid evidence lives on and time proves the 'real' worth of films. Well - lets move beyond that issue. This is a disturbing and wonderful film. So well directed, so insightful, so moving. I am so sure this will stand the test of time. Have you ever thought - in a Shakesperean/Hamlet/clichéd sense that 'all of life is but a stage'? Have you ever thought of a 'Play within a play'?. Of course. We all question our existence - our god, our creator, our boundaries, limits, loves, the things we think we remember? This film addresses all those issues in a fun, deep, and very sensitive way. Moreover - in this age of 'reality TV' this film takes us to what surely must be the natural conclusion of this trend. The absolute and utter abandonment of the viewer to an existence of vicariously living through the 'idiots lantern' in the corner of the room. Any film that makes us think, that poses more questions than it answers is wonderful. Any film of that kind sensitively directed, wonderfully shot and with incredible casting, script and acting - is more than wonderful. Thanks Mr Wier et al for a masterful creation - I would recommend anyone to watch this - it works on many levels and will appeal to many people from all vestiges of society. Watch out for the boundaries in your life...watch and you'll see what I'm talking about.. AC",

It has an awesome twist at the end and a unique plot. Its a film that no one has thought of and different from any other film. Its originality and cute humor in the film makes you smile and think at the same time. I enjoyed this film and Jim Carrey is the perfect actor to play Truman. It really makes you think!The Truman Show is rated 8 in my mind because it was mind filling and humors. It makes you wonder if maybe your life is just one big television show. I give it two thumbs up and a smile because i LOVED Jim Carey in this film. ""And in case i don't see you...Good afternoon, Good evening, and Good night!""",

1019,6 January 2021,bertino87,8, An Original Provocation on the role of Television,"Truman Burbank lives a repetitive life in which his ambitions to break with his routine and explore the world are constantly thwarted by his personal fears and by external accidents. He will soon realize that this is all part of a fiction in which he is, inadvertently, the main character. An original film in which Peter Weir forces the spectators to face up their eagerness to watch. With saturated colors and fiction acting, the movie is shot in a television style which reinforces well the sensation of watching a live drama . There are moments in which the narration develops too fast and leaves some question marks (what happens to Truman marriage?). But the film has aged perfectly well in more than 20 years and it is still posing several uneasy questions about our relationships with the media which are still more than valid in the era of social networks.",

Now that being said i went into this film expecting to laugh the entire time. Half way through I realized that was not going to happen, and I was OK with that. The way that this film puts a focus on love as well as the concept of being trapped in you own world is amazing. At the end after crying a little laughing a little You have to ask yourself, ""Am I the focus of this world that I live in?"" In conclusion I would recommend this film to any variety of spectators Young, old and anything in between",

1026,18 January 2016,kmanthegamer-92537,9, Jim Carrey at his absolute finest,"If your looking for a Jim Carrey comedy, you have looked at the wrong film. The Truman show is funny, yes, but the jokes are not the whole film. This movie dives head first into the mind of a person who just wants to be free of his life and yes there is a twist, he's in a TV show, but even if we are not in a TV show like that, we still want to be free and this movie really makes us think about our freedom. There was no problems with this movie, it is a underrated masterpiece that everyone should watch. I cannot believe that this movie was not given a best picture nomination at the Oscars. But the true crime of the Oscars is not giving Jim Carrey the love he deserves as an actor. This should have been his Oscar. Jim Carrey gives us a complex character with layers of depth to him but at the same time, he makes a character that we can all relate to, a man who just wants to be free.",
1027,30 January 2018,tyedyedbeaniebaby,9, Great Movie that's Deeper than Expected..,"This was the second time I watched this movie, and I like it. Directed by Peter Weir and with Jim Carrey cast as Truman, this is a surprisingly deep and thought-provoking film for having the leading role be a comedian. The concept is that this man, Truman, who is a hardworking family man, is, completely unbeknownst to him, the star of a widely televised, live series all about his life. He slowly learns throughout the movie that his entire life, quite literally from birth, has been a setup, and that the creators of the tv show were always watching him with cameras everywhere, controlling and influencing his every move. Even his wife and best friend play along with the script of the show... what horrible loyalty! By the end, though, Truman realizes his entrapment and ends the show by leaving the bubble/set made for him as his world by the television directors, and it ends up being the grand finale to the show, as well as his personal escape.
This film could be paralleled to some of the ""conspiracy theories"" of today. Many people think that the government is constantly surveying its citizens, and this idea was made famous by the term, ""Big Brother"". Many people, including scientists, agree that what we know may not be all there truly is to Reality, as there is still so much left to discover in the vastness of the Universe. Like Truman, we may be only seeing the tip of the iceberg, only seeing what those with more control and power want us to see at this point and time. Maybe, like Truman, our true reality will be discovered by us eventually, before our ""creators"", essentially being the government, realize that we are aware of the set/ matrix and how to break free from it. In the movie, the television show film crew and directors utilized citizens in all areas of employment to attempt to stay one step ahead of Truman finding out the true nature of his reality. His entire life was orchestrated from birth, his parents essentially allowing him to be this project of sorts, for all the world to watch, until he figured out that he was the rat in the experiment, and put an end to the show. There are moral concepts that come into play, both with this film and how we can parallel it to our own possible reality. For one, the idea of using someone as a guinea pig, basically, and manipulating their whole existence and everyday happenings so that events unfold as the director of the show wishes, is crossing the moral boundaries of that person's very right to privacy...The Truman Show aired twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The second major moral dilemma, in my opinion, that ties in with this is that the directors are using this man to earn their own incomes with this television show, so of course they want the show to be ""successful""... so to achieve their means, and to have the script play out how they need it to for the best viewer response, in their view, they went as far as to ""kill off"" Truman's father with an artificially-generated storm, forcing the boy to grow up thinking that he had lost his father, when in fact, the directors had faked the entire thing... to the entertainment and profit of the viewers and tv directors, but to the detriment of this human being, this boy who experienced this real human loss. They are essentially manipulating his entire world, until he becomes aware of this, and chooses to leave the set, ending the show, and freeing himself. 
How interesting it is to think, what if, this kind of thing could really happen to citizens by the government? What if the parallel to this movie could be a reality? It's a scary thought, but Truman also broke free, once he took the time to become aware and notice that he was in this set, and to step outside of it into a reality created by only himself.",

The metaphoric meaning of Truman Fairbanks is phenomenal, as are all of the performances in it. Although it was mainly recognized for Jim Carrey's first dramatic venture, the movie itself is so much more, and he perfectly fits into his role in what is truly an ensemble piece. Carrey has an amazing ability to relate to his audience, especially for one who's comic movies are incredibly over the top. He reminds of a young Jimmy Stuart in how amazingly likable he always is.

1040,22 February 2007,lee89,10, A Brilliant Film!,"Lets just say that 'The Truman show' is one of the best films I have ever seen! it has drama and it has comedy...what more can you want, and hey, it stars Jim Carey, one of the greatest funny actors ever to act. The film is basically about a guy called 'Truman Burbank'(Jim carrey) who is put into a town since he was a baby, this town is actually a film set! and everyone around him are all acting! The whole world are watching on TV at his every move! Thats what I love about the film, it has a great story, it adds lots of suspense to the film where Truman starts finding out that he's in a fake world created by a master genius 'Christof'. My favourate part is where on the radio it starts saying everything he is doing and Truman is getting suspicious, it has great music at that part and puts suspense into the scene, I like the way that the creators of the show made 'Truman's' father fall into the storm when he was on the boat, because of that he doesn't like water, at the end of the film he escapes by going into a boat across the water, but no one looks for him there because he is scared of water, when they see him in the water christof trys to stop him with any means necessary, but in the end Truman escapes and I love the line at the end where Christof says 'say something, your on TV' to Truman and Truman replies 'If I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night' and then he leaves, its great! It would have been better though if you could see what happens when he goes into the real world, but oh well its still a great film. The other funny part is where hes going mad in the car, hes spinning around the roundabout in the car and shouts 'Help me! Im being spontaneous!' I also love the way that he is in a perfect world created just for him, its nothing like the real world, Its great! I think that the Creators of the Film have done a fantastic job of making a Film with a great storyline and a new concept completely different than other films! Well done! Excellent work!",

Do you wonder how many times Truman has almost drowned? Always differently, of course, according to the script for that episode. I'm not a movie critic obviously. I don't like to ""review"" movies. I like to talk about movies, without injecting a great deal of scholarship into the discussion. I have lots of education; an MBA and everything. But, some of these plots in new films are quite interesting. Who hasn't had experiences time that mirror some of these plots? I myself, have tried my hand at various occupations, like Truman's. I have been an insurance agent, and a real estate agent. All of us who have worked at these things know that fellow that gives Truman the seasickness. All of us no longer able to even ""eek"" any more. But there's is prosperity everywhere! The people are happy! The media is not complaining about anything! They're all too busy with the presidential scandals I guess. I wonder where Sylvia will take Truman. May she is going to take him to school, where they'll be happier in some sort bohemian limbo, not noticing their squalor. Truman is a bit old for it. I  don't think he'll be happy. I like Hollywood movies better than ever sometimes. But one has to wonder if the public understands them. I guess the public has no choice but to accept and tolerate. I wonder how many Trumans there are. How could Truman become a member of the tavern? Maybe all he needs to do is pick up a mild alcoholism habit. Well, at least is nice to know that the people at the tavern speak up for Truman. Poor Truman! Do you think Mr. Birbank Sr. was also an actor? Before he became a hobo, that is. Did he join the people at the tavern or not? Well if you haven't seen The Truman Show, you are missing out on a much better movie than Titanic.",

We all know, that Jim Carrey has played (before this film) just a bunch of brainless dicks. e.t.c Ace Ventura (which was funny though), but this movie shows that he can act.

1047,18 October 1998,zog-2,8, Could this happen,"While watching this film, the whole time I was thinking could this happen. The premise of this movie is a man in a goldfish bowl.  Television programmes have been fly-on-the-wall, but this tells the story of a prisoner not knowing he lives a fantasy.  Curiosity kills and thus it kills the world that Truman lives in, asking the question why can't we just accept things the way they are, when we question it things go wrong.  I loved this movie, it has the tightness within the conventions of the film that makes films like Die Hard so good, the camera hardly ever moves out of the confines of the ""studio"" that is Burbanks world.  From watching this we should question the morality of television, does it have the right to invade our lives, or has it become second nature to our lives and we should simply accept it as the normality of the way we live today.  The only real problem I have with this film is it ends too quickly, I would have enjoyed an extra 30-40 minutes at the end to conclude the film satisfactorily.",

Maybe there was too much humor  in Truman Show, it was too unreal or simply this style is better for  TV-series, but while I watched the movie Truman entertained me and only the idea behind the movie made me think.

This film is sinister. It will leave you feeling monitored and paranoid, if you think about it properly. The premise that your world could be entirely manufactured and that your every move could be being watched intently by thousands upon thousands of people (Big Brother, anyone) genuinely scares me. The film also manages to strike at the concepts of advertising ( the scenes which involve this, with the two guys pinning Carey to a billboard, are hilarious) and product placement and places it more in line with the anti-capitalist, anti-consumer society message which flows from both American Beauty and Fight Club. All in all it is a great movie and is very moving, with an excellent performance from Carey.",

1072,11 September 2019,aavi-88892,7, The Truman Show Review,"THIS POST CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS ABOUT THE TRUMAN SHOW:
The movie The Truman Show has a huge satirical theme. The whole movie (and show) is about Truman, who is unaware that he is constantly being watched through secret cameras, and that everyone in his life is actually just an actor, and every event in his entire life has been staged.
This movie is still very relevant today, and might even be more significant. Since technology has improved since 1998, it's even more possible that there are small, nearly invisible cameras watching us. And there will always be the possibility that you're constantly being recorded, even if it's common knowledge that you are, such as cameras in traffic lights.
The Truman Show inflates the issue of cameras being just about everywhere by putting cameras everywhere in Truman's town, and it can be argued that Truman's character represents deflation. He's way too oblivious to his surroundings for way too long, which seems like a deflation of basic human intelligence.
This movie also uses connotation very well. In the beginning, strong, powerful words aren't really used that often, but after the movie reaches its climax, connotative words begin to appear a lot more frequently.
The audience of this movie is everyone in developed, fairly technologically advanced countries, and the target is likely the government or other institutions who may use cameras without permission or knowledge of the subjects.
The persona of the show is Truman himself, and is very effective as Truman realizes that he's being watched, and that everything in his life has been staged.
The Truman Show is practically based around a hyperbole. Everything that occurs in the movie, from the cameras themselves to Truman not being allowed off the island, are extremely overdramatized.
This movie also uses praise by blame and blame by praise to help get the satirical intent of the movie across. It ""blames"" Sylvia for trying to tell Truman what is happening. About a third of the way through the movie, the director/writer of The Truman Show is seen praising the show, and the entire movie shows watchers of the show completely invested in watching Truman.

A few things i disliked were when the actors were advertising products they over did it, giving it away to Truman that they were talking to someone else. I think that the director wanted to show what a ""perfect world"" would be like and what it would drive people to do, I think that he successful in doing this.

I think the Truman show is a strange and interesting film which makes you think about reality TV shows. This is also a very different sort of role for Jim Carrey to play, instead of being out of control and crazy he plays a quite normal average joe trying to live an everyday life. I think the director and writer were trying to show how interesting normal peoples lives can be.

I started off the movie trying to make myself pay attention but this movie quickly drew me in. The plot was insane, I would've never imagined anything like that. The story got progressively better and I found myself screaming for Truman to keep going at the end. It was an extremely interesting plot line. The only thing I didn't like is kinda the ending because I thought it would be so difficult for him to live his life after his life being a simulation. They tied everything together so well. Amazing acting from Jim Carey. The plot thickened as the movie went on and it took so man turns. It was a beautiful story and it was told very well.

Until one day, the big spotlight fall down to the ground. And a lot of strange stuff happened to him. Then he started to realize and try to escape the island.
For the acting skill I just thought Jim Carrey played just Rom-Com movies. But this one on the drama scene. He did it so well so touched my feeling. Every character, they are in to it.
I really like when they put the border in the picture to be the camera frame. It made a feeling, we are the audience in Truman show
I think the music in this movie is really ear catchy. While in the movie, I just felt like I've heard this soundtrack before even it's my first time watching this movie.
Ending is really sarcasm, they watch Truman for all of their whole life. But when he get out from that world, they just change the channel. Watching another movie
I don't know what to say, This is one of the best movie I've ever seen. I like this movie a lot. The end just made the audience felt empty. Like the audience watching him for so long. When he's a child. When he steps the first time. But the end is right. He needs to have his own life, he needs to get out and live his own life. Not just the Truman show but in Truman the human.",

Peter Weir has taken on many subjects to portray (reality TV shows, commerce, Christian allegories etc.)but he handles this excellently and leaves it up to the audience to decide their own views. My favourite two scenes are: when Truman's father is reintroduced and the event is 'orchestrated' by Christof; and also at the end when Truman is sailing and hits the edge of the studio. The acting was top notch: in particular Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed Harris' performances were stunning. I must also mention the music- it captured the moods perfectly. In short, The Truman Show is a brilliant film: I can't recommend it enough. And yes, Jim was robbed at the Oscars :)",

As society is more and more relying on the digital world of television and media to entertain themselves, it's a good step back to see how it can affect others. Especially now, I think that we often place our own desire to be entertained above the well being of actors, with our view of the actors as just that- actors, with little to no regard of their own personal lives as fellow citizens of the world. With Truman, although viewers related to him and truly cared about him, the directors controlled his life from the moment he was born, caring very little for what Truman himself would have thought about it. I loved the way that they transitioned the storyline and how, at the end, everything was both neatly wrapped up, but also left for interpretation regarding Truman and his life outside of the TV set, as it should be.",

It gives him the chance to really shine as an actor, combining the comedic and the dramatic to get an extremely likable character. Its his best role, in my opinion. And, honestly, he is the reason to see this film because I don't think it would be as interesting with another actor. I really liked the soundtrack to this film as well, it was very moving at times. The rest of the cast also did a fantastic job. The Utopian scenery blends in perfectly into this film and makes it all the more interesting.

Truman is told what to do, who to be and where to go through the people around him, to make good television, just like the public are told the same things through the media and through government. i think if you look closer than the exterior of this film, the viewer can find a much more interesting concept than just a story of a guy stuck in a TV show",
1127,3 September 2014,mayankgupta_in,10, Simply Brilliant,A movie is worth watching if it shakes you or simply remains in your mind hours and hours after the show ends. The Truman show is one such thought-provoking piece of artwork that remains with you for long after the curtain falls. It is not a comedy but a satire on the life of a common man; the man that does not look beyond the obvious; the man who continues to live within artificial boundaries; the man who does not open his eyes and seeks the truth; the man who does not see that this world is fake; the man on whose expense the world is having a laugh. We all have planted ourselves in the fake daily routines and have stopped looking beyond. Perhaps it is time to book the flight to Fiji.,

However, ""The Truman Show"" truly shows how brilliant he can be. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) has lived his entire life, literally, in a virtual reality. His entire life is broadcast on television, completely without his knowledge. His wife, friends, co-workers, everyone on the street are all actors. His existence is essentially created by a producer named Christof (Ed Harris, showing his own brilliance). The theme of ""appearance versus reality"" is apparent throughout the entire movie. Truman believes his life to be real, when it fact it is very controlled. The ""townspeople"" are all linked by radio earpiece to the producers so that they may receive instructions to keep Truman from discovering the truth about his world, the smallest cameras ever made are utilized to capture Truman's every move and the show even has its own satellite in order to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

But the other day, I realized something else about him that is quite fantastic. He has taken several actors who are known for playing a certain type of role, and put them in challenging roles that have changed their careers, such as Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and Harrison Ford. I watched Ace Ventura the other day, and was blown away by how annoying Carrey was in it. Almost all of his films before Truman Show were equally annoying. Yet Weir was able to turn him from a one-trick pony into someone that delivered one of the best performances i have ever seen. The same can be said for Williams, who was not known for his dramatic acting abilities, yet Weir cast him in a role that was quite touching. Ford was known mainly as an action star before starring in Witness, but in that movie he gave a realistic, brilliant performance. All i can say is WEIR IS THE MAN",

1138,13 December 2012,bullnaomi,6, The Truman Show by Naomi,"The Truman Show Have you ever wondered 'what if my life is actually a film?' Well, for Truman Burbank, that thought is a reality.... As the camera starts rolling and our 103 minute journey begins, we meet Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a man who has been filmed since the day he was born. He lives in a made-up world with a made-up family in a made-up town full of actors. Meryl (Truman's wife) is an advertising 'perfect' wife as far as the eye can see. Many other reviews that I have read of this film (I do my research you see), have praised Laura Linney (Meryl) as a star actress. While the part is played to perfection, the fake demeanour is so obvious to viewers and so unclear to the gullible character of Truman. I however, find Meryl's character the only blemish in this film. I am not criticising Linney's acting skills, but the personality of her character. I find the fake and false charade grates on me and I find myself wanting to slap the practised-in-the-mirror smile right off her face. So while I can tell you the flaws of this film, I can also tell you its highlights. It's a funny, happy comedy in a sort of could-be-a-pantomime way. I liked it, I didn't love it, but it's a family film all the way through. My criticisms are trumped vaguely, by the staggering figure of $125 Million box-office takings (It started with a $60 Million budget). This film takes an unusual and unique approach to the family film market, no princesses or castles and while you could say it has a happy-ever-after ending, the cliff-hanger toned it down. It may not be the best film, it may not be the funniest but it was good. Kids will like it. 3 out of 5 Stars.",

Alex Charlton now is paranoid and is always looking for hidden cameras after watching 'The Truman Show ' starring Jim Carrey Plot: The whole world is pretty much watching Truman's every move but he doesn't realise. His friends and family are actors as his life is made up. Truman tries to go on adventures but the under cover actors around him persuade him out of it. In the end Truman starts to be aware that it's all lies. Review: In my opinion, the film is funny and entertaining. The acting was believable and it's a great story line. At the beginning you have to pay more attention to understand what's going on and what's happened to Truman. Ed Harris, who played Christof, was nominated for 3 Oscars as best supporting actor, best director and best writing/ screen play. The Truman Show is a PG certificate and the genre is comedy and drama. Also it was first realised in October 1998 but still really popular and still good quality. The budget of the film was $60 million and the box office takings were $125 million, just from the cinema takings alone, which is a great achievement and great fro the show. It helped that the producers of this show was paramount pictures, a very popular company and it was directed by the amazing, Peter Weir.

It was the first proper 'adult' movie I'd ever seen (being only about nine) and I was a bit skeptical, but the story line intrigued me so I gave it a go and loved it! Truman's character is truly suited to Carrey's acting style, a seemingly effortless portrayal is pulled off which gets the audience laughing and crying along with him. A must see movie for anyone of any age. Peter Weir made it the perfect balance of funny, disturbing, heart-breaking and hopeful, and Carrey's portrayal of Burbank is phenomenal. The concept was one that had not been explored very much before the movie came out, and is one that has intrigued people and made us all wonder about our very existence, with other TV shows and movies adopting a similar concept and doing well.

It's also fun seeing the ""goofs"" that are posted at IMDb and elsewhere- how can they be goofs-they're all scripted into a TV show? What a work of genius, the story of a man whose every moment of life was broadcast to millions. In a way, it was predictive of the future, today seven years later, with the multitudes of ""reality"" TV shows! This ""original""reality show is even better than when I first saw it. Time has actually raised it from a work of art to a masterpiece",
1158,9 September 2014,ldan5222,9," A young man is constantly filmed and stars in a national television show, although he doesn't know it.","The Truman Show is a 1998 film starring Jim Carrey that emphasizes the unfortunate circumstance of our own views of a perfect world. The main character, Truman Burbank, stars in a wildly popular television show about the picture-perfect little town of Seahaven, which resides inside a large dome in Hollywood, California. The ultimate goal is to entertain the general public by filming the life of one citizen's entire life without having been given consent to do so. Therefore, everyone in the town is an actor, and everyone in the world knows about it Except Truman. The Truman Show is an example of many satirical aspects, including a central problem, irony, and connotation. The movie goes into great depth about how Truman's life seemed so perfect to everyone, until he finds out and he does not find it so perfect. In our society, everyone believes everyone else's lives are so much more perfect than their own. This is highlighted in the way that the movie directors have no idea why Truman is so anxious to get out once he starts to uncover the truth. Additionally, we find ourselves heavily identifying with Truman, and feeling his same pain as he struggles to break free of the world that was created around him. The world revolved around him, and it was all that he wanted to escape. The directors of the The Truman Show in the movie often disregard the fact that Truman is human, not a caged animal to be observed. They also fail to realize that his fighting for his freedom is more ethical than them trying to keep it away from him. Indeed, they often make it seem like the end of the Truman Show is the end of the world, but it's only the end of Truman Burbank's involvement in a world that was never real. The Truman Show is an excellent outlet for realizing and correcting our own human flaws of ideas of perfection and the lengths to which we will go to quench our own entertainment needs.",
1159,8 September 2014,khei9798,9, Truman Show & Satire,"The Truman Show sheds light on the flaws in the ""perfect society"" conceived by many people throughout time. It shows how this kind of ""utopia"" is not what the human race needs and in a way how when we have all the things we need, we find issues with it and other things to desire. The film possessed various elements of satire, using a strong persona, tone, hyperbole and irony. Truman's tone and view at the beginning was basically the view of people that think this society is possible and a good idea. Towards the end, his tone changes which propels the audience to continue to agree with the movie's creators or to change their mind completely. In the film they also use hyperbole in the case of how much all these people care about this random guy's life, and they over exaggerate the perfect sunshiny place that Truman lives in. Although this movie is about sixteen years old, it definitely still applicable to our society today. Now it relates to not only watching people's lives on TV (like Keeping Up With The Kardashians) but with social media, whether you are ""watching"" people you know on Instagram, Twitter etc or if you are following the lives of people you do not know on YouTube or Vine. Although this takes on a much different purpose, The Truman Show could be related to the Hunger Games in the way that there is a central power that controls everything, and the weather-controlled, camera monitored dome is very similar to the arena used in the Hunger Games. Overall, I liked The Truman Show and it shows how these seemingly perfect utopias cannot exist, while being a fun light-hearted film.",
1160,9 September 2014,gmad8332,9," The Truman Show is a great satire, worth rewatching today","The Truman Show tells the story of Truman Burbank, who unknowingly plays the main character in a TV show all about his life. Themes of the movie, including how the media influences our thinking, the perversity of advertisements, and the lack of privacy we have in our day to day lives (although inflated) draws many parallels to our lives today, making it more watchable now than when the film first came out. The direction that the producers want to send Truman in is made clear through thinly masked dialog. When Truman starts to reach his mid-life crisis and want to travel, his friend, Marlon, tells him that, ""You don't have to leave home to find out what life is all about."" Today's news stories are being targeted here, based on how they typically lean in one direction or another, rather than report only facts. The Truman Show airs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With a broadcast schedule like this, there is no time for advertisements, so advertisements are worked into Truman's life. Marlon is never present without a beer in hand, and Truman's wife is constantly promoting kitchen and gardening tools right in front of him. To see this on the show seems a little ridiculous, but from giant billboards to short ads before youtube videos, there aren't a whole lot of ad-free places in our lives today. As the main character of The Truman Show, Truman Burbank is on camera a lot, meaning he doesn't have a whole lot of privacy. When the show's creator, Christof, is being interviewed, the interviewer thanks him for the opportunity, saying, ""We know how much you value your privacy."" It's ironic how this man values his own privacy so much, but can allow Truman to go on without any. Today we have a lot of issues with privacy, namely with the NSA monitoring scandals. These reasons are why I would suggest watching the movie if you haven't seen it and why I would suggest re-watching it now if you haven't recently.",
1161,9 September 2014,klam5305,8, Eye opening,"The Truman Show is a very entertaining and eye-opening satirical movie about a man whose life has been secretly recorded and broadcasted to the world 24 hours a day. This film targets reality TV stars, producers, and its audience. The star of the show, Truman Burbank, has no idea that his life has been recorded and televised since the day he was born and that his entire life, including the very city he has grown up in, is a lie. The Truman Show inflates the scale of reality TV today, but not by that much, honestly. Though this movie was created a while ago now, but it is still just as relevant in today's society as it was then, if not even more pertinent. With shows like Jersey Shore and Big Brother, reality TV has become a large part of our lives today, but we never really stop to think about the people on TV's privacy. Our generation has become so desensitized to knowing everything about celebrities that we never stop to think about how the celebrities must feel. These stars are no less of people than the rest of us, and The Truman Show really opens your eyes to that fact.",
1162,9 September 2014,esee2132,8, Manufactured by Media,The Truman Show was about a man that has lived his whole life in front of a live audience.

The only thing is that Truman doesn't know it. ,
1163,10 September 2014,kpet2333,10, The Truman Show is a Perfect Satire,"The goal of this piece is to point out how violating reality television can be. The movie shows a great example of inflation, as Truman was essentially a prisoner that was used for entertainment. This movie is extremely satirical, as it has dark undertones throughout. Even the way the actors had product placement was slightly unnerving. A good example of the unnerving feeling the audience gets, as well as of irony, was when Truman's ""best friend"" was being fed lines and said ""I would never lie to you, Truman."" It also is there to emphasize just how cruel the entertainment community can be.This satire also shows that not everyone can be trusted, as even Truman's supposed ""loved ones"" were just actors being paid to interact with him. It makes the audience think about who is in their life and if they're really there for them. The target for this move is people who watch reality shows or shows that exploit the ignorance of one or more participants. These shows, however entertaining, still are using the ignorance of one participant to entertain the masses. There was an illusion to God at the end, when the creator started talking to Truman. I'm not quite sure if the purpose was to cause an existential crises, but that is how it affected me as an individual. It was very powerful, because the man who had protected Truman since the beginning was the only thing standing between his escape. Lastly, the most powerful and well used instance of irony was that all of the people who religiously watched the Truman show were the ones who cheered when he escaped.",
1164,10 September 2014,tmil8909,8, Calling Out the Media Through Satire,"Jim Carrey plays the perfect persona for a problem that has become even more pertinent since this movie came out in 1998. Playing a man growing up in a made up city run by a TV show that broadcasts his life is the much more literal and inflated idea of the media controlling everything the public sees. Weir targets the media and how they never give anyone any privacy. He shows this very literally in Truman's world, by showing his every movement and letting the whole world see it. The plot is a great use of Horatian satire to add the right amount of funny and light- heartedness, while also addressing the very real problem. It makes you laugh, but also cheer for Truman while he tries to find out the real truth of his world. The emotional connotations bring you closer to what Truman feels and how life changing an experience he is going through. You can see the fear and anger going through Truman as he finds out more and more about world. You can also see this fear in the director of the Truman Show, but for a very different reason; the fear he might lose the person he has grown up controlling and directing. The deflation of Truman's right to privacy can go hand in hand with what can happen in todays world. It may not be on the same level of the public watching your every move, but today, people can always be in contact with each other and see what everyone else is doing through social media and cell phones. Overall, the Truman show is a fantastic story that can be enjoyed at a simple level while you can laugh at Truman's world, but also enjoy it at a much much deeper level where his predicament can stand for much more serious real world problems that have become even more true 16 years after it was made.",

1166,10 September 2014,beva5748,9," Great Movie, But Also Ironic","The Truman Show is an amazing movie that makes you think of how we live our lives differently. With the main problem being that the main character is trapped in the same town by a fear of water where the whole world watches the every second of his life, the purpose of the film is to show how the media can manipulate people's lives. It's ironic how Hollywood would be displaying promoting this message, when they do the opposite. The movie really inflates the importance of being yourself, while deflating the idea of having a life where you act on the will of others. It targets other sources of media who manipulate events of people's lives, including plenty of bias on their opinions. The audience of this movie could be the general public, to raise awareness of the problem, but also other mediums of media to show them how they can affect people in an extreme way. The satirical technique of ethos and pathos are used very often in the film, such as how the viewers see the wrongness of how Seahaven is using him without consent to make lots of money and popularity from a TV show. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie's point of view on the subject and how the director portrays the message as a movie taking place on an enormous movie set.",
1167,10 September 2014,ramos-bluejay12,10, A short review of the movie including the satirical evidences that are in the film,"The movie ""The Truman Show"" is a satire about media and how self absorbed people get in it and how much it can become their entire life. Truman the star of this film is a literal example of this. Trumans life is a reality show. Everything about him, and everything he does gets broad casted to the entire world. Becoming peoples topic of obsession. The people who watch the show follow it habitually. The purpose of this movie is to target the entertainment industry and show them how ridiculous they are getting. It inflates the overall obsession of people to this show, to reveal that people do this regularly without thinking about it and without realizing how deep their obsession runs. This movie is still pertinent today because no matter how crazy it seems the way people follow TV shows has gotten worse. To where they follow them almost religiously. We have so many shows that are like this it is a major feat to count how many there are. TV has become an addiction worse than any drug and no one really realizes how bad it is until something like ""The Truman Show"" comes around and throws it in your face and says 'you're gonna take this and you're gonna enjoy it'.",

The movie pokes fun at reality t.v. and how they can change what really happens to something that would be interesting to viewers. It made you feel bad for Truman because he was trapped in a little town built inside a studio for the whole world to watch on a television screen.

His neighbors and co- workers are all great colleagues and friends, and he appears to have no enemies. After multiple uncanny events, he soon becomes paranoid and believes that he is being watched (which is dramatically ironic considering the circumstances that he is being watched). As he learns more and more about the reality of his world, he is quick to attempt an escape. Consequently, the actors playing as the rest of the inhabitants of the island try to sway him away from his beliefs, but fail in their efforts. Towards the end of the movie, he flees from the view of the cameras, and tries to sail to freedom.

Stars can't go anywhere without something being tweeted, posted, or a news report about the latest thing they've done. Overall I enjoyed this satire and I think it really helped open my eyes to just how much stress today's and past celebrities are put under to keep up their appearances for the media. Not only was The Truman Show a good satire but it was a good movie as well. I was entertained throughout the whole thing trying to unravel the mystery behind Truman's life and what was really going on. It was fun trying to piece it all together and it never got boring. I also really liked that it was comical and lighthearted without being childish. I would recommend The Truman Show to anyone looking for a fun and witty movie.",
1177,14 September 2015,owoh,7, A Satire About Truth,"The Truman Show is a satirical piece about reality television. The satire has a bit of merit today because lots of people today watch at least one reality television show. People who watch reality television often do not think about the effects that this show has on its stars. The Truman Show is a good satire because it uses many satirical techniques. The Truman Show uses connotation when the lady is calling the show to try and free Truman. She uses the word, cell, to try and convince people that the director of The Truman Show is holding Truman captive, and that Truman would want to leave. The Truman Show is targeting the watchers and developers of reality television and saying that they should stop making reality television. The Truman Show is a hyperbole of the making of reality television because they greatly exaggerate the number of people and the amount on equipment that they need. In the show, the director says it takes the work force of a small country to run the show. The show, also, has a good bit of comedy. There are multiple lines that make the story seem very funny. Truman has lots of funny little jokes to keep the mood lighthearted. The Truman Show did have its worse moments. The show was not the best in the beginning because at first the story doesn't make tons of sense. The beginning has the director introducing the show, but it's the director of The Truman Show, which is watched by people in the movie. If you do not previously know that the movie is a satire, then you will have trouble understanding the beginning. The story does not make much sense until about halfway through the movie. Also, some of the people watching the show seemed very out of place. People today watch lots of reality television shows. Some examples are Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Dance Moms, and The Bachelor. These are some highly viewed shows. The Truman Show is still relevant today because of these shows. This satire is something that might need to be remade with today's technology because lots of younger kids will dismiss it. The real thing that makes it something worth remaking is really just the technology, the fashion, and the lifestyle. The Truman Show is relevant today, but just could use some modernizing for younger people, who are too young to understand this lifestyle.",

The setup of the actors and the camera angles really did make it feel like there was something weird going on behind the scenes. There wasn't a moment where I was bored watching it. The moment I realized what was going on I was astonished. It's amazing how the satirical intent of the movie is very modern and can still be applied to today's entertainment industry. It made me re-evaluate how I saw the industry as a whole, as well as the media that surrounds it. The movie redefined what a ""private life"" was, and targeted the entertainment industry, and reporters that broadcast the private lives of those who are famous for a living. The movie made me realize that those involved in the entertainment industry don't really have a private life that they can hide from the world. Satirical elements such as irony was used when things in The Truman Show were described to be ""real"" and ""not staged"", there was inflation when they portrayed the idea of having no private life, because in real life, no one is actually filmed 24/7, and deflation was used to build the world, making The Truman Show, seem like a normal thing.

Besides being funny, The Truman Show pokes light-hearted fun at society and while the movie was released in 1988, the satire is still very pertinent today. In the movie, it is clear how The Truman Show captivates the world to the point where it is all the people can focus on. This targets not just people from the past, but our own society today. The ongoing question throughout the movie is: Will Truman find his way out? Shouldn't he get to have a choice whether he stays or leaves? That is what makes the Truman Show so enthralling.

1180,14 September 2015,kewe-27556,6, It was a show about Truman,"This movie is a satire of modern media and its encapsulating effect on the general public. At the beginning, it is mentioned that the Truman Show is not just a job; it is a way of life. This is true for the audience of the show, as they are seen spending all their lives watching this show. One man is watching it in the bath. A whole bar is dedicated to the show, running it all day, every day. People have Truman Show memorabilia. People freak when the show stops airing for a small while when Truman is first found to have escaped. Even when the show does come to an end, they just decide to watch something else. Their lives revolve around the T.V. The show sucks them into this world. You are even shown this by the problem itself. You want Truman to leave, as do the people in the movie. You feel what Truman feels, want what Truman wants, and see what Truman sees. This movie is an example of the thing it's satirizing. The audience in the movie is a mirror of yourself when you watch it. The issue of the humanity (or lack thereof) in the movie is deflated, making you not think about how Truman is practically a zoo animal. We do this to unwilling T.V. stars all the time. When someone gets famous, we want to know everything they do. We make them an exhibit for us to watch. That was Truman's entire life, yet the issue is glossed over until it is brought up by his lost love. Of course, the entire piece is an inflation of T.V. in general. It takes the ideas of reality television and the money-hungry industry and takes it to an extreme. It takes a few well-placed jabs at the entire television industry and at the viewers, but it does fall a bit short. First of all, it is a movie. It is the media that it wants to bring attention to. This makes you wonder if the movie was actually made to bring attention to the corruptness of the industry or if it simply found another way to make money off of us and bring attention to itself. Second of all, the movie itself is not that satirical. You have to dig to find it, and even when you do, the satire never goes very deep. You, the viewer, have to add your own thoughts to make it truly satirical. The movie never blatantly states that is has issues with anything. This could just be a well-written story that just so happens to be satirical at times. Finally, this is just another work following a generic storyline we've heard countless times before. A character grows up in a Utopian, controlling society. He slowly learns about some major flaw in this Utopian world and his wish to leave is brought about. As he learns about how corrupt the world he lives in is, his wish grows. He eventually tries to leave, only to be stopped by those he loves, the society itself, and the creator or ruler of said society. He will overcome this and leave, only to join the real world or start their own modeled after today. This movie is a conversation piece, but one you'll soon forget about if it is not constantly brought up.",

It relates so highly to society today and how we constantly want to see famous people and catch them in their everyday life and paparazzi and tabloids make their reality, our entertainment, which is the main problem of this satire. This movie definitely seems to be more closely a Horatian satire rather than Juvenalian mainly because it is very upbeat and laid back. There are lots of innuendos that relate to the things we do in our everyday life. The author uses a type of irony called blame by praise by showing that the world he lives in is derived to be this happy perfect place when, in comparison to real life, it's not. The target of this film is most likely paparazzi and the people all around the world who get too caught up in knowing every little thing about every famous person's life. The film catches Truman living his everyday life, unaware of the fact that everyone is watching. It is a remarkably entertaining movie which sparks a lot of questions in your mind.

1182,15 September 2015,jwit-94904,7, Truman show analysis,"The Truman show is an interesting example of satire, that is interesting, and entertaining. The movie is about a man who was raised on the set of a TV show, and knows of nothing else. I found the beginning confusing, as did others I know, but after half an hour to an hour, it will all fall into place and make sense. The satire in this piece is several layers thick, and much can be drawn from it. One of the main points is the comment on television. One of the things mentioned about what makes the show so entertaining is that Truman isn't acting and is thus very real to watch. This says some stuff into how TV at least at the time was not too relatable. Another comment was about how if it was too real, that can be weird, and not relatable. Some of the deeper stuff later, without spoiling too much, a comment is made by the director about how the real world is the twisted sick place, and the studio where Truman is is what the world should be like. This is a comment on how people perceive the world, and how people look at their own work. It is interesting he sees the world he created as the perfect version of the world, a vision of how it should be. Another message I drew from it was a comment on big brother spying. Whether it was intended I saw in the presence of so many cameras a comment on privacy invasions made by the government. I'm not sure if I'm drawing conclusions that aren't there, but as well as being entertained, I drew a good number of comments on society from this movie.",

Throughout the film, he tests his boundaries and tries to understand his surroundings. This movie is incredibly frustrating the first time that you watch it. But the next time and the next time it is amazing. Once you understand the story then there are so many minute details that are hilarious. Being a satire, this movie is most enjoyable once you figure out the deeper meaning. This movie demonstrates irony throughout; one of (if not) the first lines talks about how everything is completely real and what not. But in reality the only real thing is Truman. The film aims to change the lack of privacy given to celebrities and reality TV show stars.",
1184,15 September 2015,acab-75700,9, Satirical analysis,"This movie in my opinions is an example of Horatian satire. It plays off of two human follies, the want to control everything and our interest in things we have no business knowing things about. It uses deflation to make the incessant need for control seem normal by making it a TV show that everybody watches and also inflation at the same time by controlling every aspect of a man's life. But this also displays another human folly by showing that people often have an interest things they have shouldn't know about just because they are human and that is just a part of human nature. This is still prevalent to today because these issues are part of human nature and likely will never go away but people might eventually learn to control themselves and suppress these aspects. But in all this is the message that humans are messed up beings that we all have our faults and that we will never change.",
1185,15 September 2015,nbur,8, A Great Satirical Movie,"One of the most sinister, but still humorous, satirical movies to date, The Truman Show shows an actual world of reality TV. With an obvious target of reality TV shows and their viewing audience, this movie uses numbers of satirical tools to take stabs at what is a problem in the US and the world. From inflating the idea of advertisement in shows to the immense amount of irony, including a show filled with actors pretending not to be actors, The Truman Show carefully pinpoints the silliness of reality TV. This movie is also still extremely significant to today's world of reality TV. One show that comes to mind is The Bachelor. The Bachelor is viewed with much the same fanaticism as the Truman Show is viewed with in the movie. The Bachelor even has much the same concept as the Truman Show. People trying to do normal things in front of millions of people. The Truman Show even ends with a scene that is very similar to my sisters after the season end of the Bachelor.

Ironically, Peter Weir reveals this to you from the Media in the movie. During the movie their is a live interview with the creator of the show, and when questioned on the morality of the show he replies with ""We accept the world we are presented."" This is a huge line in the movie as it is a clue to the underlying theme. During the interview there is deflation because he is saying something such as power of the media doesn't have much power but it actually has a lot of power. Another literary device seen would be the use of would be blame by praise. The Truman show, although having some people against it, mostly has an audience in love with the show. The show is praised along with the idea of the media. All this praise is once again just another clever mask that Weir uses to cover up the blame he is actually intending. This movie can very easily be tied to today's world. Media has more input on our decisions more than ever. So many news channels have reports and studies meant to influence the public's thoughts on their world around them. We are seeing this a whole lot right now as there is a presidential debate going on. It seems like every day there's a different poll on who is ""leading"" and has more supporters.",

In reality TV shows, things happen that wouldn't normally happen in somebody in normal, day to day life. The target then would be the people who run these reality TV show, and change the way events happen on the show for ratings. For instance, there is product placement in Truman's ""life."" These show how the world is fake, and this addresses the fact that TV is fake. Commercials that talk about how great their product is, when in reality, the person is payed to say what they do. Another thing, is the deflation of all the problems in the world. The only problems that usually happen are minor, but when Truman goes to leave the town for Fiji, all sorts of problems arrive. I think that this is attacking the fact that reality shows start problems when things start to drag. There is a lot of deflation when it comes to the fact that they essentially are keeping a human in captivity for entertainment, which obviously immoral. There is also lots of irony, when Truman sees the elevator is fake, there is an elevator crash the next day. As well as that his wife is a nurse but she is grossed out by surgery. With his whole life a lie, we can see the impact not only of the lies on television, but the impact every action we make on other people's lives, whether the impact was good, or bad. This is still relevant to us today, not only because TV is still around, and these things constantly happen there, but because humans still interact with each other. With their actions impacting those around them and their lives', making this a must see for all.",

At first you're happy with Truman and his life being a TV show star but soon after you realize Truman's whole life is a lie and you become overwhelmed with the hope that Truman will soon see past his false life and realize what is really out there beyond this fake TV show life. You also realize how bad it is that they are allowed to adopt Truman when he's born and make his life a TV show. This will most likely infuriate you as you realize what there doing here is completely wrong and shouldn't have ever happened. Then you have to consider what I believe to be is a satirical piece in this movie. I believe the satire part show how the government is in control of all of us and we are all Truman. Only by questioning what is right and what is wrong will we actually find the truth. The director is like the government. They want us to to stay in what they think is a nice place to shelter us from the real world. Even if we want to escape they will try to keep us in here for what they claim is our good. But really all they want is for us to stay here so that they can profit of us and live the cushy lives that they want to live.,

Hats off to peter weir. The concept of fear which with this world is controlled has been brought beautifully with a subjective p.o.v., I think that was simply too good. Again the concept of creator or metaphoric to god, was impressive.I think similar stage comes in everyones life where one feels that all this world is false and our existence doesn't matter to all out there, someway or other they are hear to earn (that)per day from us.

1195,27 May 2006,ninagrant,9, A timely film with many legal truths inserted,"The Truman Show has come at a time when cloning and identity theft are subjects which are so often raised. It is now that these subjects penetrate our every day lives involving us,not just fictional characters in movies. There have been many attempts by multinational corporations to 'register' a life form as intellectual property so they can do what they please with what is their 'property' and so the cloning world has begun. This would allow a child to be genetically altered for medical reasons (to avoid spina-bifida or another ailment) and in the process be registered as the corporations intellectual property. They can then 'use' that child throughout its life to harvest blood or tissue without any legal limitations. All pie-in-the-sky stuff but this has been an issue discussed by governments and pharmaceutical corporations all around the world for over a decade. I loved The Truman Show for its humour and skillful use of present-day technology. It was a late night viewing choice of this movie on TV or our latest version of Big Brother on another channel here in Britain, which made me realise how prescient this movie had been in 1998. The other coincidence is that of a book written years ago about a woman who was diagnosed as schizophrenic and had delusions that her whole life had been run by people called ""Operators"" and she was just their""Thing"" to be tested and manipulated for their amusement and curiosity. They revealed to her that Operators had been around since the dawn of Man and had constantly set tasks for their Things, which inadvertently caused Man to evolve. They said, ""If it hadn't been for us, you humans would still be bumping into each other in caves."" Her life was a series of struggles to break free from this observing and testing by the Operators. Christof could slip straight into the guise of Operator in The Truman Show for it was his setting of tasks and emotional tests that caused Truman to grow and mature in the way he did. A great movie on many levels but a good piece of entertainment too. Hollywood doing it the way it should.",

As the movie went on the more things started clicking together. It was really well thought out. When you really watch it, you can see what they want to change. The message is still relevant, if not more now. The media is all around us, and sometimes it's hard to tell if they're real or not and if they're for us or against us.

I thought this was a great idea for a movie, because he is living in a studio with hidden cameras everywhere and everyone around him are actors playing their role while Truman has no idea. The Truman Show has everyone around the world watching. Truman thinks he is a normal man living a normal life and he has no idea that he is being filmed. This film can be seen as a satire because they are targeting the falseness of modern entertainment. Truman simply lives his life but just like the popular TV shows, Survivor or Big Brother, everything on set is fake. Since the power of media is so strong, the audience of The Truman Show or a show like Survivor think that everything is real. This movie is trying to show us how fake modern entertainment can actually be but the power of the media makes us think it is real. The whole time I watched the movie, I wanted Truman to break free of this false media. I never thought he would until one day, Truman finds out something is wrong. What will he do?",

As you root for him to discover the truth and break free of his prison, you find yourself disgusted at the people who enjoy his show. Yet as you think about it, it's what everyone does with their reality TV shows. This movie was able to criticize the media, yet still keep the story somewhat light, by adding humorous bits throughout. Walking away from the film, I felt conflicted on whether or not it was funny or not, but isn't that the point of satire? To entertain, but also provoke thought. This movie perfectly achieved this. Overall, this movie was able to provide a gripping story as we try and see Truman escape from the only home he's ever known, but make us question ourselves, and what we prioritize in life. This is a movie that I would recommend for anyone who needs a laugh, or is looking for a little soul searching.",
1201,11 September 2016,thay-30097,8, The Truman Show is amazing satire and fun to watch!,"The Truman Show is a satirical movie that attacks the concept of reality TV as well as the media. The film begins with the seemingly average life of Truman Burbank but begins to make you as well as Truman question the reality of it all. It becomes clear that Truman's whole life is a TV show and has been watched by millions of viewers since the moment he was born. This satire appears to be attacking reality TV and how foolish it is. It seems to provide no purpose and the film constantly shows people all over spending their lives watching somebody else's. Although it exaggerates as the show is on 24/7 and no one is shown doing anything else, it even shows policemen who are continually ignoring their job to watch the Truman Show. Even though this movie came out in 1998, it also attacks the media we have today because it depicts Truman as someone who is caged, someone who has zero privacy and is unaware his entire life is always on display. Just as the media constantly follows celebrities and pries into their personal lives un-relentlessly. The creator of the show responds to a call from an angry viewer saying that what they've done to Truman is not right by telling her that Truman is free to leave at any time. In spite of this, every time Truman attempts escape he is stopped by measures that get more extreme each time, leading up to his car being set on fire and the producers' attempt to drown him. It makes it clear that they don't want Truman to leave but they didn't seem to care if he died, showing that producers of reality TV as well as the media do not care about who they are exploiting as long as they get a good story with lots of views. I feel that this movie was effective and fun to watch. Even if someone is to watch this without any thought to the satirical side of the movie, it would still be an enjoyable experience.",

The moral and tone of the story targets liars and judge mental people, as well as people who choose to sit back and watch things unfold rather than get involved. It also teaches us a very important lesson about not exploiting others for your own personal gain. This movie is a horatian satire, lots of laughs and a light-heartedness to it that makes viewers unable to look away. It uses many satirical devices to further the plot, such as inflation and loads of irony. Even though this movie is over a decade old, it can still resonate with today's audience because reality TV is more popular now than ever, and watching every second of somebody else's life has been a rather disappointing norm in our society. However, our love for reality TV bridges the gap between us and the Truman Show, and really connects with the young viewers of the world.

We go through the life of Truman Burbank, following him along oblivious to the fact that he is being watched by millions of people on a television show, and watch his conquest to find out what is going on around him. The creator of this TV show in an interview said, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented"" as the explanation to why he hadn't sought out the truth before, and I think that speaks miles about what is going on in this show and the meaning in general. This movie shows that we as people should always try and question the world around us and always be adventurous and quizzical, because had Truman never tried to figure out the truth for the reasons he did, he could have gone his whole life in blissful ignorance in a world that wasn't what it seemed. This movie showed that ignorance is not bliss, and the truth is out there somewhere just waiting to be uncovered.

1210,12 September 2016,grya-62964,10, Thought Provoking Satire,"The Truman Show is a thought provoking and satirical movie about the unrealistic expectations that the media puts into our lives. As a satire the movie completely inflates the ""perfection"" of a reality TV show, but hits hard on how you cannot compare your life to a show because it is not necessarily always true. Throughout the movie Truman slowly starts realizing that something isn't right. That life isn't supposed to be always perfect seeming and there had to be more outside of his little town that he could never seem to leave. Many of us sit at home and watch reality TV shows thinking that it is real life. That everything in the lives of the actors are perfect and we wonder why our lives aren't that way. But through the movie you start to understand the concept that behind the scenes may not be at all what you think it is. There is so much more going on behind the camera than what you see on the television screen. The movie uses connotation playing into the emotions of the audience members to help them sympathize with Truman. This helps the people viewing the movie to comprehend the harsh realities and connect to the theme and characters. In the end taking away the intended purpose of the movie. We see this in the world today through TV shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians. On the screen they seem to have it made for them. They can travel anywhere, anytime, not have to worry about money and all of their problems may seem minimal or even humorous to the audience. But what we don't see is all of the behind the scenes. All of the real world family problems that happen or the fact that one or more may not want their lives broadcasted for the entire population to see.

1211,12 September 2016,gkee-05315,8, The Truman Show - a Satire about Media,"The Truman Show is an example of satire, and though the use of satire, it shows how media has affected our everyday lives, and has influenced us in ways that it probably shouldn't. In this movie, we follow the life of Truman Burbank- who lives in the community of Seahaven (which is actually a giant domed television studio). In Seahaven, Truman is the star. He is recorded, observed, and judged. Everyone else is actors- only Truman is real, and he doesn't know it. Right away you can link the Truman Show to what media does to us today. You can see the satirical tool inflation being used to get the point of the Truman Show across. The problem of being lied today in media is conveyed by making lies a much bigger issue in Truman's society. The ""dome"" that is Seahaven feeds Truman lies about his whole life- just as media does to us today. We don't know what to believe, just as Truman didn't know the truth about his life. Christof (the creator of Seahaven) put it best when he said: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that."". And isn't it? People believe what they are told to believe, and this satire highlights that perfectly. The Truman Show also brings to light the issue of morality in the media- which takes place at the very end of the movie; when Truman finds out about his ""fake"" life, he asks Christof to explain. Christof states: ""There's no more truth out there than there is in the world I created for you. The same lies, the same deceit"". This can be compared to our society today. Just like Truman, we don't know what our beliefs are until we are forced to question them. I think that the Truman show is an effective satire that is able to pinpoint an issue that is still present in our society today. We are still looking for ways to solve this problem, but- In case we don't solve it, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!",

We soon learn, however, that Truman is the most famous man in the world, without even his knowledge. Truman lives on the sunny island of Seahaven, a man- made island rigged with cameras that are broadcasting live 24-7 to a TV audience. Every person in Truman's life is an actor paid to record him and to create good television. This movie seems to be a satiric commentary on several things, specifically the control and influence that the media has on our society. Throughout the movie there are various product placements and references to things the consumers of the show will see. It was also a satire over the treatment of zoo animals and prisoners, as well as the control the Government puts on our lives. Truman is completely controlled, and although he is treated fairly, he lacks free choice. He only has the illusion of free choice, which many believe to be a God-given right to men.

The show constantly keeps you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. The fact that it follows Truman's life without him knowing but then cuts to the other side of the camera where the TV show is being created makes it really interesting. Perhaps my favorite part is when Truman starts being ""unpredictable"" and the T.V. show producers have to scramble to fix it and make sure that Truman doesn't notice anything. Once Truman does start noticing stuff you almost feel excited/nervous for him because the movie really makes you feel like you're in there with him and figuring out the mystery for yourself. You definitely find yourself rooting for him to find his way out and it made me very much dislike the people behind the T.V. show who were trying to keep him in the show and oblivious to the entire world. Another aspect of the movie that I think the creators did well is adding in scenes now and then that showed other people outside of the dome in which Truman lives reacting to the show and experiences that Truman is having. Towards the end when Truman is faced with a decision on whether to leave the ""perfect world"" as said by the creator, or leave and go into the real world really puts the audience on edge because you really don't know what he will do. All in all The Truman Show is a very well made movie that keeps you entertained and on edge the entire time.",

Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances as he acts more serious than usual. I am not a fan of other Carrey movies, and do not appreciate his sense of humor the way most people do. But that aside I loved him in this movie. Parts of the Truman Show give you chills up the side, and you really get a feel for the characters involved. The scope of scenery and the dome the movie is shot in is magnificent. The movie is also logical in its design and one gets the feeling that this could really happen. I would describe this movie's genre as a light drama that has comedy, but not slapstick humor. One of my favorite movies of all time.",
1221,8 September 2017,pste-47603,8, Satirical Components,"There are many innuendos that can show that they are in a TV show, but Truman's the only one that doesn't know it like at the beginning where the wife has a small commercial for a new mower. It is a great example of a satire because it shows that people can be very blind to things happening around them if they don't want to believe something. When Lauren tells him that it's just a big show, he doesn't quite understand and tries to make sense of it by just thinking she must've been crazy. There is deflation when people are talking about how keeping Truman locked up in a giant studio his whole life isn't that bad, because he doesn't even know it. There is also a lot of irony in which everyone is watching him, but he doesn't even see any of the people he truly knows. The target of this satirical movie is people who will believe anything that a person says just because they have only known one thing their entire lives. The target can be someone who doesn't listen to anything else because they only know one thing and try to block everything else out because they don't want to know the truth. It is still significant to people today because it talks about how people can be so blind to people around them because they refuse to look for something deeper, or the actual truth as to who they are.",
1222,9 September 2017,lbro-93643,8," An Enjoyable, Entertaining, and Thought-Provoking Movie","Hollywood is many times known for making movie after movie in search of a profit. In doing so, some of the movies churned out often have overused and cliché ideas. The Truman Show is an example of what directors in the movie industry should strive for. The idea this movie is something that is unique and unseen before. Using satire and thought-provoking visions The Truman Show makes for an entertaining and enjoyable film. Jim Carrey, unsurprisingly, does amazingly in his role. While some may not realize it, it takes just as much talent to portray comedy as it does drama, and even more to switch between. Carrey's excellent acting helped to bring the film up another level, he has good comedic timing and performs the script very well. The script is another element of the movie which helps to add to its acclaimed status. It is written very well and uses satire in subtle ways throughout the entire film. The script helps to express the underlying themes of the immoral ways of the media, as well as the obsession with those in the public eye. While Hollywood is often known for repetitive remakes and sequels to once popular movies, The Truman Show is a definite exception. ",
1223,8 September 2017,crog-89662,7, This review shows how The Truman Show shows satire,"The Truman Show is a very clear picture of what a satirical film represents. This satirical film represents how crazy a ""reality"" television show can be or set out to be. The Truman Show was made quite a bit ago but, it is still very relevant to today. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives in a community that is completely domed over. There is no leaving this community for Truman. Truman lives a life where everyone knows and revolves around him. Truman is not only a known person inside the domed community but also around the world. He is a star on a television show, The Truman Show, and he is the only one who has no idea about. There are over 3,000 cameras around town and everywhere that he goes. Every single individual in the dome are actors or actresses, even his family and close friends. The Truman Show is targeting what a lot of Americans are obsessed with, reality television. These include Keeping up with the Kardashians, Jersey Shore, Dance Moms, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and many more. What we think we would be able to have from a ""reality"" show, since it is ""real life and daily lives"", we will never be able to have. It seems to be that these so called ""reality shows"" are now beginning to be staged and no where near the real life they actually live behind the cameras. The Truman Show is a real reality show. Truman has no idea he is no camera and lives life normally doing his normal daily activities. This movie is very enjoyable with the dramatic plot and humor put into it. Although this movie is enjoyable, it does require more thought about how the society works and how it is portrayed in the film.",
1224,9 September 2017,tcoo-20326,7, Truman show it is about a man named Truman how has been on television his entire life without his knowledge.,"The Truman show was an exciting and all together enjoyable experience that makes people question whether or not they are being watched by others or by a higher authority. For those who have never seen the Truman show it is about a man named Truman how has been on television broadcast his entire life without his knowledge. To add to the fact all his friends and loved ones are actors hired and payed to be his friend and family they are all scripted to like or dislike him. This movie uses irony exceptional well in the format of Blame by Praise. It is praising the use of surveillance technology to monitor people without their knowledge. Just like big brother not the reality TV show but the government surveillance, but it is real condemning surveillance of people against their knowledge. That is one of the reasons I liked this movie so much it had many different levels. The base level of funny humor and how that situation could never happen, but then it gets into levels where it makes you think about whether or not with the increasing technology it could real happen or if someone is already doing it. There are other meanings that are explored like that of free will and whether or not people want to make there own choices or to have them made for them. Or is ignorance bliss and the more knowledge you gain the more you become suspicious of the world and others. The Truman show is a great commentary on the nature of surveillance and what are humans really like without putting up a front.",
1225,9 September 2017,omcc-95017,9," ""The Truman Show"" is a satire about a man named Truman Burbank, whose life is the world's most popular television show.","Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey) has lived in the small town of Seahaven his entire life. He has a supportive mother, a loving wife, a fun best friend, and a tragic backstory; his life is practically a television show, complete with product placement, too-enthusiastic actors, and the fact that, no matter how hard he tries, Truman can't leave his hometown. Eventually, he begins to realize exactly what's going on. Christof, a producer, comes up with the genius idea to create a reality show centering around Truman's staged, perfectly drama-filled life. Everybody in Seahaven is an actor, except for Truman. It takes him years to figure out what exactly is going on, but once he discovers the truth about his life, he begins trying to escape his utopia. This satirical film shines a light on the objectification that media stars are exposed to every single day. Truman's television show is broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week every day since he was born. This is a direct hit at how celebrities are constantly being observed and analyzed by the general public. There is a clear audience being targeted by the making of this film, and it is, ironically enough, everybody watching the film. The movie is meant to show audiences just how detrimental their objectification of television and movie stars really is to the people in front of the camera. The film gets this message across extraordinarily well, many thanks to Jim Carrey, who has audiences both in the film and real life rooting for him to leave the world his producers created for him, and start making his own.",
1226,10 September 2017,kmcm-41966,9, Uses Satirical Techniques and Issues Relevant Today,"Along with using satirical techniques very effectively throughout the film, this movie deals with a subject that is still very relevant today. Though the methods through which most people now receive media have changed, lots of people, especially kids, struggle with being pressured to change through media. In the film, Truman experiences what the creator of the show thinks is ""a perfect life"", though once Truman finds out about the T.V. show, he wants to be as far away from his old life as he can get. This film does a good job of exposing the illusion of perfection that people can create for themselves using media, social media specifically. As this was a problem more focused in the television and movie industry at the time of this film, today, social media has become the center of this issue. People can essentially create a brand new life for themselves through social media, and this film shows how carried away a person can get without even realizing the issue. Overall, this film utilizes satirical techniques in a way that enhance the film and its meaning, while dealing with an issue that is still relevant today.",
1227,10 September 2017,fbur,8, The Truman Show is a satire that only gets better with time.,"In a time of reality television and social media, we have become more entertained by real people rather than scripted stories. The amount of people who prefer the Kardashians to a scripted television program is growing by the day. This movie is something that has become more relatable and closer to reality as time has gone by. Truman is the first child to be adopted by a corporation. He lives in a safe bubble of a town called Seahaven. Every day in Seahaven is a day with predictable but comforting story lines that all have a clean and tidy ending. Truman lives an extremely cookie cutter life, the only catch is that none of it is real. Every step he takes is televised live to the world and everyone knows but him. His closest secrets, that are only to be shared with his mother, are broadcasted for an eager audience. Truman's family and friends are all casted and their words come from their earpieces. Every turn and twist has been perfectly manufactured to shape a planned storyline for his show. The idea is that he would be televised from his birth to his death, but what would happen if the wholesome and family friendly Truman became unpredictable? In The Truman Show, be ready to experience the humor of Truman's world and also the darker themes of satire about the entertainment industry. This tackles the issues of exploitation in television and shows the irony of viewing people in staged and outrageous situations as ""relatable"" and somehow ""normal."" I couldn't help but feel that I, a sucker for reality television, could be part of the problem. The horatian like absurdity of so many watching Truman do monotonous tasks as sleeping and brushing his teeth, made me reflect on what the message really was. As I lived through Truman's eyes I couldn't help but wonder, is it real life if I'm the only one really living it?",
1228,10 September 2017,zboy-98420,9, Thought Provoking,"The Truman show is an awesome satirical movie with a lot of humor and some seriousness. I believe that this movie is awesome because it kind of gets you thinking about the world around you. For me I think about this movie quite often because, (potential spoiler alert if you don't know what this movie is about), what if the world around me is all staged and nothing is real. A quote from the movie struck me relatively hard, when the character of the show's creator, Christof, said ""We accept the reality of the world which we're presented"". This struck me because of how true it is, we go through our daily lives every day and do the same things over and over again, without questioning anything, and I think it is good to question things every once in a while. Enough of the philosophical stuff, the comedy in this movie is also great. It isn't a comedy movie but the humor is sprinkled in at the right places to create some comic relief. My favorite scene in the movie is when, (spoiler alert!), the very end when he denies Christof's offer to stay on the show and he uses his ""classic"" line, ""And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night"". Overall this is a great movie and would give it a 9/10.",
1229,10 September 2017,cwri-14967,10, Truman Show Review,"The Truman Show is absolutely one of the most thoughtful, well-written movies of the twentieth century. The purpose of this satirical film is especially pertinent in modern times as television and reality shows have become a central part of pop culture. From Keeping Up With the Kardashians to Duck Dynasty, we all seem to have that one television program that we just can't get enough of. But are these ""reality"" television shows actually real? The Truman Show is an impactful Horatian satire as a result of the effective use of light-hearted humor and satirical tools such as a clear target and audience, irony, inflation, and deflation. While The Truman Show is a relatively cheerful movie that people of all ages can enjoy, it provides a lense through which modern people can analyze reality television and how it impacts our lives.",
1230,11 September 2017,mjoh-26969,8," A review on the satirical movie, The Truman Show","The Truman Show, a satirical movie about a man who is very confused about his life, and what his purpose is, has several beneficial and specific messages to take from it. As Truman, the main character, goes throughout his repetitive day, he runs into situations that nag at him, and get him thinking about what he wants to do, and how he feels like he can't accomplish them. Christof, the T.V. show's producer in the movie, has convinced himself and those watching and working for him that he has done this all to benefit Truman, rather than holding him back from the world he could be apart of. The love story in this very complicated, because of a sort of forbidden love that Truman is in. His feelings for a woman cause him to have a mission to find her, by planning to go to Fiji, where he believes she is. His journey to find this woman brings him to discover many important things about his life.",
1231,11 September 2017,este-00979,8, How The Truman Show shows satire.,"A compelling, humorous and exhilarating film, The Truman Show by Peter Weir, describes the life of Truman Burbank. Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life but what he doesn't know is he is being watched by millions of people. This is dramatic irony because we know that Truman is on a TV show but he doesn't. In his day to day life of being a businessman, Truman is being filmed by numerous, strategically placed cameras, 24 hours every day. Inflation is shown because reality television is extremely exaggerated. Truman believes he is living a normal life so people see his real life and not anything fake. The target of The Truman Show is people that are involved in TV shows and appear fake for the sake of looking better than they are. He was born on camera and raised on the world's largest television set with cameras on him constantly and actors all around him, which he is unaware of. Through his ""wanna be"" crush and a series of crazy events, he begins to discover that his life may not be what he always thought it was. Innuendo is shown when the girl he is interested in tells him that he is on TV. This makes him question his life and want to discover what she really means. He goes on the adventure of his life where he is challenged by the masters and makers of the ""perfect"" world he belongs in. By facing his fears and showing incredible perseverance, Truman finally reaches the edge of the world he has lived in forever. Here he is required to make the decision of his life, should he leave everything he has ever known and jump into the real world, or should he stay in the comfortable and safe world that he is told he always belonged in.",
1232,11 September 2017,rmat-12411,9, Gret Movie,"The movie 'The Truman Show' was a very enjoyable movie to watch. I really enjoyed the plot and the acting of Jim Carrey as he plays the main character Truman in the movie. I really liked how real they made the movie feel and how they didn't reveal the entire plot until about halfway through the movie. The whole point that the movie was trying to get across to people was a very good point that applies very well to our lives now with all of the advancements in technology and the large growth of social media. You can some what tell that this story is satirical because of how inflated the concept of the movie is but it is more of a horatian satire than a juvenalian because of the humor that occurs in the story and that there is no direct target that the movie goes after. There wasn't really any movies or television shows that this movie reminded me of because most of the other satirical shows and parodies are either juvenalian satires or just comedic parodies that don't really suggest change like 'The Truman Movie' does, I believe that this is why the movie won so many awards. In conclusion I really enjoyed watching 'The Truman Movie and I think it is a very good movie to watch because of how relevant it is in our world today.",
1233,11 September 2017,sekl-70528,9, Wonderful satire,"I felt the main target of this movie is modern entertainment. We are obsessed with ""reality"" TV and celebrity drama. The Truman Show was the ultimate reality TV show. The stereotypes in the movie made it more humorous. It is comical to a viewer that Truman is unaware of the cookie-cutter, stereotypical life he lives, as he has not been exposed to real culture, he lives only inside his bubble. There are many examples of sarcasm in The Truman Show. Truman himself is often sarcastic, for example when he is pretending to act normal. I do find it ironic that Hollywood made a movie about how obsessive and idolizing celebrities is so normalized in society, but they are the ones promoting that because it makes them money, just like Christof in The Truman Show. All in all, I believe The Truman Show to be an excellent piece of satire and a wonderful movie.",
1234,28 May 2006,lucyfretwell,10, Very Moving (really!),"I only came across this film around 2004 so I am well behind the times but was extremely impressed.Really at a loss for words.But there was a point in the film that reminded me of an idea that was going the rounds when I was at University and people were smoking pot and dreaming of changing the world via CounterCulture.In fact 2 ideas came back:2 pictures I remember that seem to have cropped up in the film to opposite effect . The first (chronologically later) was in the French film ""L'an 01"" which was based on the idea of a sudden change of perspective and life reality that would supposedly take effect when people all around would suddenly just ""get it"" and everything would start from scratch ""from year One"" so to speak.By the way this film occurred around the time of the events in Cambodia and I sometimes wonder whether old Pol Pot was a fan of it as there were a lot of those bastards in Paris (Ho Chi Ming,Khomeini )etc Anyway the other thing I remember was a cartoon in a ""counterculture"" magazine and the idea was that the character would be living in the mundane ,regulated monochrome environment of society when he would suddenly make a contact with a fellow human being and hey presto! they would notice a little crack appear in the wall.Of course on closer inspection it is revealed that they can look through the crack and even go through it .On the other side of the crack the cartoonist has painted in the alternative view of the world -Lots of cows I seem to recall and rivers.Maybe you get the picture?! So when I see the bowsprit of Carey's boat pierce the edge of the ocean sky it reminds me of that image but in an opposite kind of a way. Its back to reality and not some kind of a pipe dream!",
1235,1 October 2017,kwhitmore-27277,10, Best Psychological Thriller!,"The Truman Show is one of the best psychological thrillers because of its concept, choice of actors, filming and script. As I watched this movie I was blown away by how interesting it actually was. I find psychology incredibly interesting so this movie was great to me. The entire concept of this movie is about a man, Truman, who has spent his whole life growing up on a ""movie set"". His parents aren't his real parents, his lovers aren't his real lovers and his house isn't his own house. Yet, he has no idea that these people around him are all actresses and he's living in a fake world. The real outside world is watching through hidden cameras placed everywhere on this movie set that he calls his life. His entire life, Truman is being watched 24/7 and the outside world watches him as a reality TV show. Every move he makes, every emotion he feels and everything he sees and experiences is purely for the outside world's entertainment. The reason he was placed in this fake world, purely for entertainment, was because he was chosen from an unwanted pregnancy. There were six unwanted pregnancies and he was the first born, so he was the first chosen by the corporation producing the Truman Show.",
