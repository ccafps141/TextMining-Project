0,3 April 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""When a person grows up, do his dreams become smaller?""","I'm gradually becoming less and less surprised when I see a foreign film that's every bit as good as those produced by Americans or the Brits. This was my first Turkish film, and for those of you struggling to find it, I would direct you to Youtube where you can find it in it's entirety with English subtitles. As the translated title suggests, the story is about a man struggling to come to terms with a father who disowned him, and his feelings of growing away from his own seven year old son. The back story of Sadik's (Fikret Kuskan) personal history does not fully come to light until well into the picture, when we learn that he became an anarchist journalist, much to the dismay of his father, who had designs for his son to take over the family farm upon attaining an agricultural degree. For viewers with a Turkish background, the conflict that resulted in Sadik's jail time and torture will probably be understood better within the context of that country's history, so for someone like myself, a lot of that perspective is lost. However that doesn't affect the impact of the story when it's finally revealed that Sadik's reconciliation with his father occurred because of his impending death due to a pulmonary edema condition. The man did a noble thing for his own son Deniz (Ege Tanman) by returning him to the village of Sadik's childhood to remain with family and friends. I would challenge the viewer to maintain a dry eye as the mystery of father/grandfather Huseyin's (Çetin Tekindor) 'secret room' reveals Sadim's happy and hopeful youth before he left his family. One comes away from the film with a serene sense of family bond that transcends nationality, as in the end, we are all humans subject to the same emotions of love and loyalty.",/

2,5 December 2005,ydurgut,8, One of the best Turkish movies ever,"The movie starts on the days of military government, which started Sep.12th, 1980, and lasted 3 years (Effects of this action against democracy lasted more than 15 years). A young socialist newspaper writer (Fikret Kuskan) loses his wife on birth of his only son on the very first day of the military action, because he can not find any help for delivery of the child. After 6 years past, the father was desperate to find any jobs on the papers, which are now supporters of the new order, and decides to return his father (Çetin Tekindor)'s home in a small village near Izmir: A house that he has left years ago fighting his father's wills to make him a person that his father would like him to be.",e

4,12 December 2005,ethernaldreams,10, An Incredible Movie,"As I watched that movie, I saw the Turkish relationships in the best way that it could be shown. A very good choice of cast is the most powerful criterion of the success of the movie. Humeyra, the grandmother is a very talented woman in acting. Emotional scenes become more frequent while we see the movie to get to the end. Unfortunate events make the Turkish people get closer to each other. The movie shows that perfectly. Hospitality, love, grief, laughs... Everything is included in this movie. An emotional breakthrough. The movie also points on the elderly reality -now an impossibility- the torture, made by the cops.",i
5,28 December 2005,scanan,10," Clever, poignant, brilliant and ""human""..","A simple story becomes a sad and poignant movie about ordinary people.. Every person I know who had the chance to watch this wonderful movie have cried -especially during the second half.. I applause everyone involved in the production of this magnificent piece of work.. Really brilliant work, presenting some top-notch performances (esp by Humeyra and Cetin Tekindor) and a clever collection of spectacular moments. No special effects, no superhuman strengths no fantastic landscapes.. Just human and the ordinary feelings. I felt some rush to call my mom and dad just after the movie to be sure that they are OK and to make them know once again that I really care about them. This movie makes you think deeper on values that make us human and also etches itself irreversibly to your memory by touching the deepest possible regions of your soul.. Highly recommended; a must-see! Do not forget your tissue papers because you probably will not be able to keep your tears from flowing...",e

During the recent years there have been made some movies that clarifying Turkey's 70s - 80s. As a person who has been experienced those years, the film became a very big sentimental burden for me. Those were the tough days for many. It is a very touchy story..",4
11,27 January 2006,bane_13,7, Simple and Remarkable,"Anyone who watches ""My father and my son"" will eventually relate the movie to a family relationship they have lived. It is a perfect visualization of what people do because of their ego and what can actually destroy that ego. The movie makes the viewer ask ""what if"" questions about almost everything and the answers will be different for everyone. The acting is definitely remarkable with less experienced characters (including the little kids) putting on a display to remember when aiding patriots of Turkish movie industry. Overall I can say that ""Babam ve Oglum"" is a blending of great acting, wonderful script, and a real life story.",4

Achingly sad and sincere, riven with sorrow and emotion, the tragic effects on a rural family in Turkey in the1980s as a result of tyranny, despotism and control. Be prepared to bleed tears into a bucket as your outrage, sorrows and disbelief take hold, in a wholly believable story that could be retold in far too many places around the world, still is unfortunately and, most sadly, still will be while true democracy is ignored - although it is particular poignant the way it's performed here.",4
14,30 March 2006,deg-12,9, Life as it is...,"This film was a real surprise for me. I only saw one other Turkish film before this one (Vizontele Tuuba). The story may not be all that original but the way it is told is just wonderful. Lot's of humor (we laughed a lot) and real tragedy (we really needed that handkerchief at the end). I love the parts where you get carried away in the little boy's dreams. That surreal view shows us the differences in thinking between an adult and a child. The music is what you can expect from a Turkish film. You either like it or you don't. But it's never overwhelming. I really recommend this movie to everyone. And no, I am not Turkish!",3
15,19 December 2005,onel,9, Great acting in an entertaining drama,"The acting was perfect in this movie from the kid (Deniz) to Çetin Tekindor (Hüseyin Aga). All player did their job in a great performance. Also the places the film shot was great. My grandfather lives in a similar village, and I used to go to there in summers in my early ages. I went to back again to my childhood when I was watching the movie. It reflects the life style of those places in a very good manner and reality. No detail was skipped. Also the director mixed the drama and joy in the movie very well so that you can laugh suddenly when you pity for something you see in the movie. This was, I think, a great directing success for the new generation director, Çagan Irmak. So, this a ""must to see"" film I think, especially for the Turkish viewers (It includes so much domestic features). But international viewers can also get a real good taste of it, because main themes (such as family bonds, love of son) in the movie are humane things.",9

18,22 May 2011,princebansal1982,5, An intense emotional drama,"At its core ""My Father and My Son"" is another old man - young kid story done just right. While it is not as amazing or as stunning as many reviews proclaim it is still a very good movie. It is prone to sentimentality sometimes, but that is more of a cultural thing. While acting wasn't spot on in a couple of places, mostly everybody has done a very good job and though it may appear that the actors are overacting you have to keep in mind that different cultures have different norms and different ways of expressing emotions.",?
19,23 February 2007,bbuysal,10," Simply amazing, drama at its best!","It's one of those films which really affect you deep. The movie somehow makes ordinary places, ordinary people and ordinary events become interesting. I think it's due to the way Cagan Irmak (writer and director) cleverly and carefully blends everything. The movie is definitely not like a Hollywood production, maybe more like a European film. The film has many enjoyable moments but it's mainly emotional. The actings are magnificent, the story is heart-breaking and the places are so real. All performances were remarkable, but I should say I was over impressed by Cetin Tekindor's (Huseyin Aga) acting. While the bitter truths about life and family relations are portrayed perfectly, the movie also reflects life from the innocent eyes of a child. Personally, the local rural village life took me back to my some good memories. There is no need to tell what happens in the film as enough is said in the plot summary. More would only spoil it. But, it should be noted that even though the plot may sound political, the film is actually not.",r

32,19 March 2006,dr_mleysi,10," A spectacular movie which deserves to be seen all over the world. , our hats are taken off !","Although that I am an Egyptian and I was not a fan of the Turkish movies until I watched this movie, I felt while watching the movie that I was in Egypt. The village life and the relations between the family members which are sometimes full of contradictions between the old and young generations of the same family. The role of the strong mother (Hümeyra) who is trying to do her best to retain the relation between her husband and her son into its normal course and how she is keen to get her family back together was brilliant that she make you cry and laugh in the same time. The father (Çetin Tekindor) whose sorrow when he lost his son made me cry although I tried to control myself. The oldest brother (Çetin Tekindor) his natural simplicity which he conducted in his role of a loving older brother whose ill youngest brother was being fed by his own hands while he is waiting for his destiny at the hospital. The little boy (Ege Tanman), no one can deny the ability of this young boy who is living in his dreams that his father is his hero even after his death, his maturity in acting is quite spectacular. Finally, I would like to that the brilliant director and the writer (Çagan Irmak), his control over his cameras and conducting the actors accordingly was above imagination. Sincerely, all the members who worked in this movies deserves our hats to be taken off for them. It will be a pity if that movie is not nominated for Oscars. Simply a spectacular movie which deserves to be seen all over the world.",

Almost all cast has strong background of theater of cinema. Huseyin (father of rebellious men) and his naive brother really acted worldwide quality. Especially naive brother was played so naturally. I wish, if it were nominee for Oscar as best film. In Turkey film awarded so many prizes in film festivals as best film, best actor, best actress, best supporting role ...etc. I think this film is really a milestone of a Turkish Film Industry.

I mean both of the movies try to explicate father and son disagreement. Big Fish contains much more fantastical components then Babam V Oglum.

His first short-cut film was also quite remarkable called bana old and wise i cal.

A story which is an ode to family bonds. The movie is a superb mixture of splendid acting, touching script, divine melodies and unspoiled landscapes. Although it is closely related to the last 20 years of Turkey's realities and Aegean culture of the country, the story is highly above any borders, a true universal praise of humanity. Both laughter and tears exist and are very deeply knitted in almost every scene, resembling real life: you can find something of yourself in every character of the movie, you can watch your childhood within the eyes of Denis and realize that you have lived similar pains, sorrows and joys.

49,27 October 2018,krenaras,7, This movie will pull your emotional strings.,"The beginning of this movie wasnt so great for me, it seemed like a cheap drama series. The music was overbearing trying to make you emotional, and it felt kinda cheesy. But as that was over and the movie started you got an actual feeling of the movie that was more authentic than the first part. Even then the music could sometimes be overbearing but it fitted more since we got to know the characters and things had more weight for us. Overall it was well shot, the acting was good. I expected this movie to be more political but it was mostly family drama about relationship between father and son. Although some things were exaggerated for the sake of emotional impact, the movie still held together without being a typical spanish or turkish soap opera, but it still has elements of them none the less. Although it pulled my emotions, I cant rate it very high overall. It gets 10/10 for emotional manipulation but it falls on other parts. Its a 7/10 for me.",

Although it may not affect a foreigner in the same way, for people who lived the era described in the film are moved. The film focus on the coup d'etat of 1980, and how it ruined the lives of idealist people, especially leftist. However, there is more than that... The drama of the small family is based on a contradiction between the traditions of the Turkish rural families and the thoughts of the youngsters of these families. This contradiction is in the minds of these young people as much as it is in their relationship with their parents. Thus, the film both judges and defends the Turkish traditional family structure, first by showing how cruel they can be when a family member is against the ""tradition"", and secondly by showing how compassionate they are when the same member of the family is in trouble. Consequently, the film may not mean much for foreigners but I should mention the fact that I have cried first time watching a movie in my 28 year long life!",

Both groups went as far as to do bombing (or they say it was the work of the Western ideologies in play along with the secret state in Turkey). Then the Army staged a coup on September the 12 in 1980 and made thousands of arrests and significant amount of torture went on in the prisons... They even hanged 50 people that were found guilty(!) as they tortured hundreds of people (at least 171, proved) to death... And to this day the good people of Turkey suffers the consequences... Now, if we say that this movie tells one of the many stories of that era, it is absolutely true as ""the father"" had seen the torture and mistreat in the prison for what he had done nothing wrong... His heartbreaking story also reveals so many levels of the culture of Turkey and the bigheartedness of its people...

126,31 March 2017,kaankiska,10, Beauty of being plain pure and sincere...,Great loss if still didn't watch... Art is in the most cases hidden in the reality. It is mostly diversity that makes the cast attractive. İf that makes you lough a second after you cry it is something. A very kind approach to human kind. A clue to hold back to cultural ties. A movie never been boring for even a second.,
