0,12 December 2005,dbdumonteil,10, the American thriller of the nineties,"One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: ""the movies of the nineties"" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). For others it will be ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) while others will praise to the skies ""Se7en"" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, ""the Usual Suspects"" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.",/
1,8 December 2009,Hitchcoc,9, I'm Glad I Finally Got a Chance to See It,"I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a ""gimp."" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying.",r
2,12 July 2007,thinker1691,9," "" The Greatest Trick The Devil Ever Pulled""","Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****",e
3,8 September 2004,TIDQ,10, The most enjoyment you'll have seeing a movie for the *second* time,"Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.",v
4,23 April 2021,briancham1994,6, Relies too much on its twist,"The Usual Suspects only works because of its infamous twist ending. Until then, it is simply a convoluted mess that does not offer any ways to resolve its twisting and unreliable plot threads. Films with plot twists work well if they are enjoyable up until the revelation, like The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Prestige (2006). They offer enough mystery to tease a potential revelation and enough clues to figure it out. The Usual Suspects, however, revels in sheer incomprehensibility and hollowness that necessarily demands an explanation to appreciate even at a basic level. Even afterwards, the revelation clearly exists more for the audience's emotional reaction rather than making any sense within the scenario of the film. Gimmicky storytelling aside, the acting, production values and sense of suspense were all handled quite well for a low budget film.",i
5,1 June 2002,Agent10,10, Not enough good things to say,"Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.",e

I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.,w

Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotine-driven low-life 'usual suspects' of this film - Soze - remains unseen, fantastic, just outside of the camera's view, and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless, he is the central character in the film, and the single force of will driving the entire film.

After the second time i watched it, i realised this is a Superb movie with a fabulous twist. I have now seen this film about 20 times and seems to get better every time i watch it. Kevin Spacey delivers the greatest performance in his career. Gabriel is great, Benecio delivers a great performance with humour. Stephen is quite good in his best film.

23,17 May 2014,tomgillespie2002,8," Riveting stuff, even after its umpteenth viewing","Thanks mainly to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), the 1990's saw the re-emergence of crime noir - talky, violent thrillers packed with colourful characters and even more colourful language. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects was one of the best of the bunch, thanks mainly to the director taking influence from past masters such as Hitchcock, Lang and Kurosawa, rather than the many Tarantino copycats that flooded the 90's cinema market, who did little but poorly imitate the big-chinned one's chatty screenplays and outlandish, darkly humorous violence. It also had a killer twist; one that will baffle as much as it will surprise, or possibly induce cries of cheap manipulation.",=
24,23 May 2020,dillylamar,10, The Usual Suspects,"The Usual Suspects remains a style of it's own. It a masterpiece of suspense and putting wonder into the audience. This film has great performances, dialogue, and story elements. The film's twist is the perfect. It makes the viewer unlearn everything they have learned throughout the film, as most of it fabricated, coming from an unreliable source, who is thought to be the man behind it all.
Is Verbal Kint actually Keyzer Soze? Or is Verbal Kint one of Keyzer Soze's men. Or did Verbal use the myth of Keyzer Soze to get away? Or is Kobayashi Keyzer Soze? Even Keaton could be Keyzer Soze? It's not definitive. This film is a high achievement, it entertains with dialogue, flashbacks, suspense, shocking moments of realization followed by more shocking moments of realization. Most of the plot relys on the flashbacks told by Verbal Kint, leaving the audience stunned after viewing it. As Keyzer Soze is the myth the criminals fear, and may or may not be real.",t

28,17 April 2008,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,10, Composition,"Subtlety is a very important thing in any good thriller. Not only does subtlety reduce the ridiculous amount of ""in-your-face-quality"" that today's thrillers seem to love, which effectively makes then just plain old action movies, subtlety shows that a film has respect for its audience. It doesn't feel like it has to explain everything at every step of the way since it knows that an interested audience will be on the lookout for hints as to what is going on. That's what makes films like this enjoyable. In fact, that what makes any film enjoyable. It isn't just a barrage of images, but rather an engaging sequence of them. This sequence can be unchronologically organized or in any number of ways obscured to create suspense, but as long as it is engaging, the audience will be happy.",r

31,20 September 2013,Horst_In_Translation,6, Perfect example on how a twist makes the movie,"After the fairly unknown ""Public Access"", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup.",
32,6 August 2022,toseale,10, You'll Never See it Coming,"As I was watching The Usual Suspects, I found it enjoyable, but not quite at a 5 star rating. But as it progressed, I changed my mind. It's an airtight movie with so many small details and clues that create a sense of misdirection to the twist near the end, and the storytelling itself is amazing. And that twist gets twisted with more details and clues, ultimately making this the perfect crime/mystery. The comedy lands correctly when its needed. Every character is great, and the actors all sell their roles perfectly. I love this movie, and it's a major recommendation from me.",

34,23 May 2007,drystyx,7, total of all stereotypes in formula routine film with no assets,"Lets see. There's a kaiser who is considered a real bad ass because he gunned down his wife and little kids. Real macho, yes? He doesn't exist, but he does? He can't be killed (like we haven't seen this before). His imagination and creativity are so bad he can't even come up with names or stories, but has to take them off of coffee cups and posters. Add to this, the entire story. He orders a police line up, but the police don't know who ordered the line up. Now, we all know most police departments are incompetent, but this belongs on the NAKED GUN series. Then there are the characters. According to the narrator, they can't be broken, because they are hoodlums. Talk about your street myth that people in power would love to have you believe! But it doesn't wash. It isn't even remotely credible. And no one cares. I happen to be watching it while working on something else, and was in a public place where they showed it twice. I naturally assumed it was some sort of ""Worst films"" festival, which it might have been. I was stunned to see it ranked so high on any critic's list. ",
35,5 February 2022,bypeterfenton,8, Really masterful ending; a touch difficult to watch in the present day,"I went into watching this movie knowing only two things about it: I knew it was a project that launched Kevin Spacey's career (and say what you will about him as a human being, but he did a damn good job acting in this movie), and that there's a mind-blowing twist at the end that is pretty much the dictionary definition of a twist ending. And I will say, it's very difficult to discuss the film at any length without giving away the ending. The script is good, the visuals are fantastic at points (that shot of the shattering coffee mug will live rent-free in my head for quite some time), and the acting is pretty spot on. You can tell these boys had a fun time making this movie. I will say though-some gripes that I'm not faulting the movie itself for, since it was made in 1995-it's difficult in the year 2022 to watch a movie with so much unchecked casual homophobia, and it's genuinely a little hard to differentiate five individual main characters when they are all white men.",

Even though I know the ending I still feel myself being caught up in the plot.  It is possibly one of the greatest scripts of all time.  I can't remember another movie in which I was completely astonished at the finale.  The cast gives a tremendous performance.  Kevin Spacey gives one of his two best performances (the other being as John Doe in Se7en) in my opinion.  That is probably why he was awarded Best Actor for this role.  It was truly deserved.  Gabriel Byrne also gives a great performance.  It may be the best character Stephen Baldwin has ever played.  In all, this is a must for any movie collector or enthusiast.",

A film that is so involved and so smart and engaging in its delivery that it drops several clues to its ending while simultaneously not entirely making them obvious for first time viewers. In fact the series of clues; ideas and the overall ending is so famous, it's been referenced and spoofed in so many other pieces of text that these days it would be almost impossible to watch without knowing what everything revolves around.

47,7 May 2016,PredragReviews,10," ""I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze""","Wait a minute... five criminals in one lineup? There's something wrong here, right? Right... In ""The Usual Suspects,"" not only every line but every gesture, every facial expression and every camera cut counts. Even if you distrust the story being told, you can't exactly pin down everything that's wrong with it. The plot unfolds through the tale extracted from Kint, one of two survivors of a massacre and subsequent explosion on a boat docked in San Pedro Harbor, by U.S. Customs agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). And at the same time as Kint is spinning his yarn, in a nearby hospital the other survivor (badly injured and fresh out of a coma) helps a police sketch artist draw a picture of the mastermind behind the scheme - ""the devil,"" Keyser SÃ¶ze. You can watch this movie countless times, and you will still discover new subtleties every single time. Not only will you find that it still makes sense after the story line has been unraveled at the end (which therefore is a plot twist, not a non-sequitur). You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance. You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist - the very act which brought them together in the initial lineup, and which they have all come to believe to have been a trumped-up charge - as Hockney's latest sin against Keyser SÃ¶ze, now forming part of the debt to be repaid by participating in the suicide mission in San Pedro Harbor. And at some point you'll also have figured out all of Fenster's lines (not being a native English speaker, I am relieved to find that I wasn't the only one struggling with them at first)... although the mumbling is of course part of his character, and is as excellently delivered as every other aspect of Benicio del Toro's acting, his lines are so funny and to the point you almost wish he'd speak more clearly so you wouldn't miss half his punch lines the first time around.

The ""Usual Suspects"" is a solid journey that explodes as the film comes to a close. With many hints portrayed as the film progresses, Bryan Singer smartly presents this fiction through Verbal, primarily filmed in a police station. Kevin Spacey's performance of Verbal deserves the Academy Award that it won for Best Supporting Actor in 1996; I would consider it one of the best performances of a character in film history. Brilliant execution from the rest of the cast, each bringing their piece to the table.

For starters, the cinematography, editing, and acting are captured perfectly to not only portray a story, but involve the audience as though they were to experience the story themselves.

98,27 October 2007,from_christmas_past,8, Gripping!!,"The problems with movies like ""The usual Suspects"" is that they are taken too seriously. People flock to identify a hidden meaning, a socially relevant message or a reflection of time when it was made. While a good movie may and, sometimes, does have one or more of these attributes, still the basic point of every good movie is to entertain. If the movie has involved me in it, made me suspend my disbelief to move along enthusiastically with the story, it has done its job. The Usual Suspects does just that. You may sit comfortably long after the movie is over and think about how some parts make no sense or are improbable. But, while watching it just sweeps you, partly because of its same improbability and also because of its pace. The pace is just right, not fast enough to make you lose track of what is happening, or slow enough to second-guess the motives and figure out the plot twists. The way the movie unfolded and ended was enough to keep me interested throughout. The ending is a classic, even if you guess it a little before you are expected. Of course, the delight in watching it the second time is immense as armed with the revelation at the end, you can view a lot of scenes with an investigative interest and come off totally consumed. Besides its plot, TUS has brilliant performances to keep you entertained and some great dialogs.

Perhaps I have a short attention span, but I did have some trouble following the plot at first. My biggest complaint is that a lot of the characters were underdeveloped. Most of the people generally did not have any traits to distinguish themselves from each other.  I was rather bored. When I saw this movie I had already heard there was a big ""twist"". So when people were discussing the identity of this Keyser Soze, I couldn't help but think to myself ""hmm... wouldn't it be wild if the cop giving the interrogation was Keyser, or maybe Verbal Kint, or maybe...."".  You just find yourself going through the ropes imagining wild possibilities, and so when Verbal's leg straightens out and we see his sketched face coming out of the fax machine, it failed to have any impact with me. I'm sure that if I had been unaware that there was some kind of twist in the film, this ending would have hit me a little harder- but I'm skeptical that would have made me admire the preceding 100 minutes much more.    I'm sure if I saw this again, I might find other things to appreciate. No doubt, throughout the movie there must have been clever clues to Keyser's identity that I did not pick up on the first time around.

You see, the very first one to use this idea was Agatha Christie back in 1926. Her novel ""Who killed Roger Ackroyd"" caused a scandal in England. Her readers felt betrayed. The second one was a crime novel (forgotten the title and author) woven around the characters of Punch and Judy. Well, I did not feel betrayed while watching The usual suspects.

Colorfully profane screenplay done a disservice by the rather lackluster cast (particularly Chazz Palminteri, who does nothing fresh playing a smug investigator, and Stephen Baldwin as a cocky cut-up). Similarly, the direction also takes a while to warm up, although Kevin Spacey overcomes the awkward handling and won a Supporting Actor Oscar. Spacey, who often strikes an indifferent presence on-screen, is eerily haughty here and almost removed from the surroundings, yet his actorly tics are colorful and he works his hypnotic eyes with quiet drive.

No, this is one of those movies with a great ending, which  really distorts your perception of the entire movie. The plot is lame. Many parts of the film lack even a remote sense of reality. In retrospect, this movies looks like the work of a first year film student. It just was more silly than good.

129,4 December 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10, and just like that...hes gone,"No matter how many times I watch The Usual Suspects, and believe me it's been many, I still get the same diabolical thrill, the same rapturous excitement and the same rush of storytelling and dramatic payoff as I did the very first time I saw it. Every performance from the vast and diverse cast is a devilish creation packed with red herrings, juicy dialogue and bushels of menace, every scene piles on the mysticism of the criminal underworld beat by beat, until the characters begin to pick it apart and the whole thing unravels like a great serpent coiling forth bit by bit, scale by scale, swerving toward the shocking, disarming third act that has since become as legendary as it's elusive and terrifying antagonist. In the crime/mystery corner of cinema, there's no arguing that this delicious piece of hard boiled intrigue reigns supreme, and it's easy to see why. In a seemingly random police lineup, five career criminals are harassed by an unseen hand, pushed into carrying out dangerous heists and violent manoeuvres by a shadowy campfire tale among the world of organized crime, a Boogeyman called Keyser Soze, if he even exists at all. Slick and sleazy ex cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) heads up this dysfunctional crew of vagabonds which includes hothead McManus (Stephen Baldwin in a role originally intended for Michael Biehn, which kills me to this day), weirdo Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, using an indecipherable mishmash of an accent that would be the first of many), spitfire Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) the runt of the litter. The lot of them are intimidated into performing risky enterprises by lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) until the climate of their actions reaches a boiling point and answers emerge from the darkness. This is all told in retrospect by Spacey, to a rabid customs agent (Chazz Palminteri) who has designs on ensnaring Soze. Spacey scored Oscar gold for his heavy work here, spinning a tale whose layers interweave and pull the wool over our eyes time and time again before offering any glimpses of truth. Byrne is a fiercely guarded storm as Keaton, a man with secrets so deep even he doesn't know who he is anymore, letting the anger set and smoulder in those glacial eyes of his. The supporting cast adds to the class and confusion terrifically, with fine work pouring in from Dan Hedeya, Suzy Amis, Giancarlo Esposito and a wicked cameo from Peter Greene, who provides a moment of inspired improv. The score of the film rarely relies on dips and swells until all is said and done, keeping a tight lid on the orchestra and feeding us nervous little riffs of anxious portent that keeps tension on a tightrope and anticipation on call. A mystery this tantalizing is irresistible the first time around, but the trick is to make your story re-watchable, and I've seen this thing over a dozen times. Every viewing provides some new angle to the story I didn't see before, or I notice a subtle interaction in the very naturalistic and funny dialogue which escaped me in the past. My favourite thing to do is watch films with someone who hasn't seen them before, observe their reactions and opinions on every little story beat and cinematic flourish, it's almost more fun for me than the actual film itself. The Usual Suspects is a showcase piece for that activity, because you get to see this very complex revelation unfold through new eyes as you watch them experience the revelations. Whether your first viewing or your fiftieth, it never loses its power, and the spell it casts just doesn't dim. Masterpiece",

The pacing is good, though the jumping back and forth between past/present isn't handled as well as it is in some other movies. Fantastic use of a leitmotif in the music as well.

Well, people in the first camp MIGHT think that `The Usual Suspects' is clever, fair and satisfying, even though it's even more of an outrageous cheat.  If you want a good twist, stick to old Agatha, or to those of her works that play fair - `Witness for the Prosecution' (1957) and `Endless Night' (1971) are particularly good screen versions - or try ... I don't know, any number of things.  `The Spanish Prisoner' (1997), for instance. It not only plays fair: it also paces itself correctly.  For that's the other problem with `The Usual Suspects' - we are fed no intriguing information whatever as we go along.  Even referring to the few surprises as `twists' is generous.  The film opens with a confrontation, followed by an explosion, on a boat, and from then on we listen to one of the characters narrating events leading up to this explosion - and he takes FOREVER.  It feels as if he's saying, `And then we had to kill a bit more time before we got to the boat exploding, so we robbed a bank.  Then we went to the beach.'

In essence, it becomes as pointless as trying to dazzle yourself at a magic show when you already know all the secrets behind every trick.

This is fiction, anyway. I love David Lynch and he certainly likes to lie with his camera. No, I don't mind that Verbal was lying. It was obvious that he was the main mover, but there was no motive for his killing of the other 4 and the crew. I suppose they must have done him wrong somehow. But since Verbal is telling his tale to someone obsessed with another character, we couldn't know his reasons without breaking the narrative. The acting was obvious, too. I mean, it seemed acted, not natural, esp Spacey. I saw him in one good TV movie, but since I have been amazed at his Streep-like obvious acting. All the ticks and verbal hiccups learned in conservatory, kinda reminds me of Day Lewis, another actor whose charms elude me. Put that Method away, boys! The others are passable, but just. I can see why this film is popular, why some people love it; what I can't see is why this film is considered the 23rd best film made. I think some people need to see some more films. Well, Inception is fairly high up there too, so the only twisted conclusion I can make it that lots of people need to see lots more films before they start giving out 10 stars here.

The cinematography felt straightforward even if it did have a couple of creative shots, and the music was forgettable. Overall the only saving grace I see for this film is the cast, Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro are both excellent, I loved their performances and to help matters they were surrounded by a good ensemble.

Gabriel Byrne is supposed to be the center of the story, the character we're supposed to care the most about, but he's such a bland guy that I personally didn't really care about him at all. And then there's the ""shocking"" ending where it all comes together. First of all, simple logic would determine that it was the only possible ending - and knowing that this mysterious villain had to be one of the five protagonists made it even easier. Simple math, ladies and gentlemen. Plus, if that ending were true, much of what came before it doesn't fit. I know, I know - you're saying  ""That's the whole point!"" Even considering that, it falls apart under closer scrutiny. And this is the type of film that should not fall apart. It should be as tight as an oil drum.

The script is amazing, one of my favourites ever. So quotable. it weaves together so well and there's so much call back, moving in an almost cyclical structure. The dialogue feels authentic and witty, especially how people like that usually would talk.
Kevin Spacey has got all the talent in the world, genuinely one of the greatest actors of his generation, possibly of all time. This movie shows that as not once does he break character for not even a shred. He shows every emotion through the course of the movie and portrays that slight angst that something isn't quite right, which ultimately there is.
The other actors are top notch as well. Namely Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kajun) as he portrays the thoughts and methodical actions of his work. I would say Benicio Del Toro smashes it, which he does, but it is a pain to try and understand what he is saying, and ultimately reading subtitles can suck you out if a movie (At least for me anyway).
The uncertainty throughout makes us question everything in the movie. This perfectly sets up the final act, in which there is one of the best plot twists for any movie.

The Argentines and Hungarians were no strangers to illegal narcotics, but there was no ""coke on that boat."" Was the mysterious criminal overlord Kaiser Soze involved and, if so, then who is Kaiser Soze? Agent Kujan tries to find the answers to all these questions by conducting an interrogation of the lowlife survivor Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey). Verbal then tells an epic saga about how he and his companions MacManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benecio del Toro), Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Dean Keaton (Gabriel Bryne) got involved with Kaiser Soze and were forced to do his bidding.

You bet a lot of people must have spilled out their popcorn. Today, however, some of its riveting effect has subsided as the twist is so well-known and anticipated for new viewers.

The suspects include a strong cast consisting of Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, and Kevin Spacey. The film is strong in every area: soundtrack, sound effects, visual effects, etc., but its legend comes from its superb writing, both in dialogue and plot.

Yes, it's cleverly constructed. No, it's not a good film. I'm sorry, but it just isn't. It's a joke, and as funny and entertaining as that joke is, it's not worth sitting through the long and laborious trek, waiting for the punchline. Frankly, I am amazed that it's done so well for itself, and equally amazed that Kevin Spacey (great actor though he is)won an Academy Award for it. Sure, he deserves it as an actor - but the character and the film doesn't. After suffering through this film (three times in total, desperate to try and see a glimpse of the beautiful clothes everyone says the Emperor s wearing), I resolved never to watch another Spacey film again.

I know the first time i saw it i was watching for the left hander. Another thing that i don't understand is why does Kobayashi have such a strange accent in the movie? He's an English guy and i think it's mentioned in the movie that he is English/British. I just couldn't make out where the accent was supposed to be from and why he would have it, so you think he may be Soze? Turkish nationality? Before i leave i want to say i really love this movie, but let's think about the plot for a moment. This is Soze's plan all along to get rid of an eye witness on board the vessil right? He goes to ALL that trouble to shoot the witness and in the end the police, everyone knows what Soze looks like anyway as they had the sketch faxed while he was being questioned.

That being said, it isn't a bad movie, just an overstuffed film- with some other obvious issues as well. The film is very cool with its atmospheric tones, and intriguing with its large cast of interesting criminal characters, all of which provide excellent performances while on screen. The film is largely relying on the performance of Kevin Spacey, and he is more than up to the task, providing a nearly perfect performance for the role allotted. Gabriel Byrne also gives a very notable performance, and besides Spacey, is the obvious standout in the film, and he truly does give the role his all. The direction in the film is very well crafted, as well as the score and cinematography. To sum it up, the film looks good, acts good, and sounds good- but what it lacks is anything of much better value. At the center of it, the film feels empty, relying on plot twists, a convoluted plot, and a screenplay that doesn't seem to really be going anywhere =- or at least anywhere of any importance. The film can be very entertaining to watch at times, but it's the times where everything is getting set up and explained that is truly boring. I don't care for films that feed you information, I want to understand and see the story. In the end, The Usual Suspects may be a better time around the second time, but as well crafted as it can be at times, it has plenty of flaws that make it far messier than it has any right to be. Kevin Spacey gives a great performance and the film has a cool concept, but not much is delivered in the grand scheme of things, which will leave you feeling more satisfied than awed when the film finally reaches its long awaited conclusion.",

The movie was boring for most of its running time and didn't feel any better than a mediocre crime film.

The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible.

After they are taken into custody by the New York Police Department to appear in a line-up, five criminals conspire together to carry out a couple of high risk heists. Actually, an enigmatic individual has recruited this quintet because each of them has either stolen from or interfered with him. At the heart of this slick but sophisticated thriller is a super criminal named Keyser Soze. Meantime, a dedicated Customs official, Dave Kujan is in hot pursuit of one of these five, a former cop, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) who did time in jail for murdering several people. Initially, Dave (Chazz Palminteri) thought that Keaton was dead when he found him in a restaurant bargaining with two other business men. The other men who spent a time in jail with Keaton are Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Kint (Kevin Spacey), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and McManus (Stephen Baldwin), and before the night is over, they plan to hit an illegal NYPD courier service.",

301,9 February 2012,kjarvis1212,10, Possibly The Greatest Crime Drama Ever Made,"Rarely does a film of any genre rise to the level of perfection achieved in The Usual Suspects. The ultimate goal of any whodunit is to keep the audience guessing right up until the very end, perhaps even never quite answering the question with absolute certainty. This movie hits the proverbial bullseye with mind boggling precision. Someone jacks a truck loaded with guns in New York City but police have no leads. So they bring in five of the Big Apple's best known thieves to shake the underworld's tree. But unbeknownst to the police, or our ""suspects,"" there are greater forces at play. When it's all said and done, LAPD, NYPD, and the feds are left sifting through an abandoned cargo ship in an L.A. harbor with lots of bodies but not much else. All they have to go on is the shaky story of a talkative small-time crook named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for the role), and a dying victim of the shootout who claims to have seen the devil incarnate on the ship, a legendary criminal kingpin whose name sends shivers up the spines of police and lawbreakers alike. It may not sound like much, but every aspect of this film comes off so astoundingly well, from the morose cinematography and foreboding score, to the impeccable performances by its stars (Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro as the ""suspects"" and Chazz Palminteri as the federal agent trying to piece their story together), The Usual Suspects concludes with a classic stunner that only adds to its reputation as one of the greatest crime dramas ever filmed, if not the best ever.",

324,31 March 2017,iollann,9, Review-The Usual Suspects,"Review: The Usual Suspects 'The Usual Suspects' a crime-drama mystery about a survivor telling a policeman about the events leading up to a shootout on a boat, which all started when five criminals met in a supposedly random police line-up. Directed by Bryan Singer and starring Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Posthlewaite, Steven Baldwin and Kevin Spacey. Released in 1995 it is a film with great characters and a very engaging story. The usual suspects starts out with 'Verbal' excellently played by Kevin Spacey' who is being grilled by a U.S customs agent after being one of two survivors of a catastrophic shootout on a boat. Verbal reluctantly recounts how he came to be on the boat starting with him meeting 4 other criminals in a seemingly random police line-up. Firstly what makes this film great is the acting especially Kevin Spacey's acting. My favourite scene in the film is the police line- up. It is a very iconic, well known scene. It is very funny. What makes it funny is that apparently it was supposed to be a serious scene but the actors were messing around and injecting a bit of humour into it. Even director Brian Singer adlibbed in a line: 'In English please?' I love the acting in this film. Benicio Del Toro's mumbling is appreciated. I enjoyed seeing Kevin Spacey's fast talking' innocent and shy manner is extremely captivating. Gabriel Byrne has a very convincing role as an ex-criminal trying to start fresh. Stephen Baldwin does a great job of playing the smart mouth, cocky professional of the group. Bryan Singer expertly uses tension and suspense to deliver a mind blowing twist at the end. I would absolutely recommend watching this film for a second time. Watching it again and seeing all the hints that the director had subtly snuck in is a very satisfying thing and enhances the overall experience. What I think makes this film great is the fact that it didn't have a huge budget, there's not any over the top special effects, the acting is great, it has a relatively easy to follow story line and then the ending is like the cherry on top.

Christopher McQuarrie (who also worked with Singer on his first film) also comes out of nowhere to write a script so well thought out and put together its sad to think he's only turned out an indie and Way of the Gun since. And lastly, the cast are terrific. Top to bottom (even Baldwin) are great. Benicio Del Toro steals every scene he is in with his awkward, mumbling way of talking.

The first time I watched it, I paid more attention to the development of the story and the guess of the murderer, while the second time I watched it, I appreciated the performance of the actors and the director's skills. At the beginning of the film, a vague dialogue between a suspected behind-the-scenes boss and keaton, who asks him ""what time is it? Does anyone care when they die? At the end of the film, you will find that the lame kint gets his things back before he walks out of the police station. ""a gold lighter and a gold watch"" are both seen in the scene at the beginning of the film. What follows is a close-up of the lame man's walking leg, which becomes a good leg as he walks, and the film is almost over.",

It opens up with the tail end of a massacre on boat just before being lit up to flames. We then end up in interrogation room with Verbal Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) telling the cops how he ended up on the boat. At this point the movie seems to pick up the events (mostly) in the order they happened until those crucial moments on the horrific ship. As Verbal goes into detail how him and four other ex-cons were wrongfully detained for questioning 6 weeks earlier and ended up working together 'taking jobs.' There's Keeton (Gabriel Byrne) who is looking for way out and go straight, Finster (Benicio Del Toro who really started his career here literally) whose horrible accent brings a lot of laughs but basically pals around his convict hot headed buddy McMannis(Stephen Baldwin). Then there's Hockney(Kevin Pollock)whose comedic input serves the tone well especially since he really plays the angry smart ass of the gang. I really don't want to type too much else cause either A most of you know the story even if you haven't seen it or B you've seen it. What I really wanted to say about this movie is that people who don't like it are people who never really got it or people who have not seen the whole thing from the beginning.

Some people may like it because it breaks barriers, sets a new trend blah blah....., but fact is it was not wise on the part of the director to make the film in this way. I probably would have liked this movie if the movie scenes were not cock-and-bull stories of a character and instead actually represented the plot earnestly. Maybe I'm a purist, but the 'surprise' ending is not actually a surprise, it was deceit; the audience is out right deceived. And thats the final word.

379,24 July 2003,lllinggg,4, Distinct Though Overrated,"Distinct within its genre, though alarmingly overrated, 'The Usual Suspects' is a popular film whose reputation is likely to prove ephemeral. A group of east coast rogues use their unexpected gathering in a routine law enforcement roundup to plan a series of high-profile jobs, only to realize that forces higher than themselves are in control of their plans. Guided by a largely unpolished script, the film's numerous characters -only some of whom appear visually convincing- engage in a dialogue-based interplay that satisfies less than it entertains. Well-trained American actors like Chazz Palminteri and Kevin Spacey seem to have left their vast acting reservoirs essentially untouched, while even the Europeans Gabriel Byrne and Pete Postlethwaite, though refreshingly decent, appear to have their eyes primarily set on payday. The film's much talked about ending is somewhat predictable within its unpredictability, and the directorial and musical inputs, which can ideally salvage conventional visual sequences, are not much help either. Overall, 'The Usual Suspects' deserves to be watched in the context of Hollywood's increasingly sterile fascination with the criminal underworld. Veteran spectators, however, should restrain their expectations far below the over-exultant levels of most reviews.",

381,23 September 2005,jboothmillard,8, The Usual Suspects,"I remember seeing this film once before, I obviously didn't understand it properly and only remember bits and pieces, so I was definitely up for seeing it again to judge it more efficiently, from director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns). Basically there was an explosion on the waterfront of New York, and criminal Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Spacey) was the only witness, and FBI Agent Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) and U.S. Customs special agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) wants him to answer their questions about what happened. Through flashbacks Verbal, who suffers cerebral palsy, tells the story of how he and four other con-men were brought into custody as ""the usual suspects"" that could have carried out a truck hijack. In the lineup were former police police officer seemingly giving up crime, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), short-tempered professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), his partner Fred Fenster (Licence to Kill's Benicio Del Toro), hijacker Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal. None of the five men are found guilty of th crime after questioning, and afterwards to get some kind of revenge McManus convinces the others to take part in a robbery targeting the city's finest taxi service. After this they sell the loot in Los Angeles to Redfoot the Fence (Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene), who talks them into doing another job, and even though Keaton said the previous one would be his last he agrees anyway. The robbery goes well despite the fact that it was heroin rather than money or jewels, and Redfoot reveals the job came from lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who the five thieves meet, he says that he works for Keyser Soze, a renowned but unseen criminal mastermind. Kobayashi blackmails them due to the fact that Soze has been associated with their crimes in the past, he wants them to attack a ship on the San Pedro harbour filled with cocaine. In the present Verbal tells about the legend of Keyser Soze, a criminal feared like the devil who apparently killed his own family when they were threatened, and who no-one has ever seen the face of. Back in flashback, Fenster was killed earlier on when he dropped out, and the four remaining criminals go ahead with this job on the docks, only to realise it is some kind of trap and they are killed one by one, with Verbal and Keaton the last two alive. Of course Verbal explains that he supposedly watched Keaton being shot and burned before the explosion by the mysterious and unseen stranger, possibly Soze, but the officers aren't sure he saw anything properly. Verbal seems to be upset that they believe Keaton is Keyser Soze and may still be out there, and with his bail posted they let Verbal go with his possessions, and he limps away. The ending however is the big bang, when the police officers are relaxing one gazes at the wall of newspaper and photo clippings in the room Kint was being interviewed, and he drops his mug realising everything the conman had been saying was built up around the various words and names on the wall, Verbal as well in seen with his limp disappearing and left arm restored, and diving away with ""Mr. Kobayashi"". The final quote of the film is a repeat of the words Verbal said to the police, and where we realise he really was Keyser Soze, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" ""And like that, he's gone."" Also starring Suzy Amis as Edie Finneran and Dan Hedaya as Sgt. Jeffrey 'Jeff' Rabin. All the performances are fantastic, including Byrne and Postlethwaite, but especially of course the mesmerising Spacey who was not a big star back at the time, only known for small roles like Glengarry Glen Ross, he deserved the Oscar, the story is clever with a witty script and some exciting gun play and explosive moments, a good old fashioned and engaging crime thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film. Kevin Spacey was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Verbal Kint was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",

That it was still immensely effective should provide an idea of how well-made this is. This was Singer and McQuarrie's second feature, together and at all, and they both do incredible in it. The direction is beyond reproach. The writing is spot-on, in all areas. The dialog, which is also well-delivered, the characters, all of them treated to perfect portrayals, and the plot, that develops impeccably. The acting is excellent, there's not a single performance that can particularly be criticized. Cinematography in this is gorgeous. The editing is sharp and marvelous. This is film-making at its finest. I understand the arguments for the twist of this being cheap, and thus the overall movie, undeserving of the praise it receives. I don't agree, however. As the ending unfolds before our eyes, the point of this becomes clear. Highly interesting use of the concept made famous on celluloid in RashÃ´mon. A certain aspect of this, I don't know if it was intentional, or a sacrifice necessary by virtue of the fact that this was made in Hollywood, and for the mainstream crowd, but while it is unfortunate, you can't have everything. There is little to no visual sexuality, various disturbing content, some relatively mild violence and plenty of strong language.

Although their maybe a lot of people that may disagree, I thought it was slightly similar. This is a cool and clever, film that build suspense and interest as it goes. This is more of a mystery movie, but it's not a mystery movie where the audiences will try to piece together all the puzzle pieces. Instead it's a intricately woven mystery crime thriller that gets more interesting as it goes. Maybe because of the multilayered direction, the really well done editing and clever storytelling. So the story is told from Roger ""Verbal"" Kint about what went down on the before, during the ship heist. With him and his dysfunctional and yet effective crew getting set up for a task and how they went about it. And what the motives of each of the crew members were and so on. The lighting and camera work was also really good and it felt like you were following the heist crew and following through with the process to a slight degree.

402,10 September 2006,Robert_duder,8, The character actors ultimate epic...sure to become a classic of cinema,"The Usual Suspects ironically calls itself that and casts itself with some of Hollywood's biggest recognizable character actors. What is a character actor exactly?? Is that truly another word for an actor who doesn't make it as a leading man or woman?? NO. I don't think so at all. A character actor is a very versatile actor who takes on a mix of roles and appears in many, many film after film popping up everywhere. Sometimes they may get a lead role, sometimes not but they don't need to be at the top of the credits to make an appearance and they play important and significant roles and get many more parts than other actors. The Usual Suspects is jammed full of these character actors led of course by the incomparable Kevin Spacey who I must say has become much, much more of a leading man now than a character actor but at the time he was the best at playing these offbeat roles. The Usual Suspects is not exactly a brain science of a film, it doesn't really offer anything incredibly unique to the ""heist"" genre of films, it's almost stereotypical and yet it has this feel, it has this quality about it that makes it an unmistakable classic. I expected from what I heard of it that it would be gritty, violent, bloody, horrifying and it is gritty but everything else kind of just fits in with most films but it still has that unmistakable must see quality.",

411,12 July 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,9," Never believe appearances, or how you can fool the police","It is not a recent film, indeed. The Twin Towers are still standing. We are entering the profiling era and it was tempting for criminals to return the favor, though they have always done that. They here profile the police and their investigative methods. If you satisfy the police's way of thinking you will go through their net with no difficulty. You just have to convince the cop that a certain criminal does not exist, that this criminal projects you in some kind of legend or saga, is a bogeyman under the bed or in the closet. If the cops are convinced that this bogeyman is a pure collective invention, some folklore in another word, they will just shrug their shoulders and consider the one who is telling the story is, like all the others, haunted or possessed by a phantasm. And it works. He is the only survivor, or nearly, and he convinces them that his criminal persona is a myth. They are dubious, suspicious, skeptical and many other things, but they cannot imagine you are that myth, that criminal and that you are fooling them massively. To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise. They are ready to buy a lot but not that someone who is a coward, a weak person, a subservient non-entity, what's more a cripple, can be that ruthless, pitiless and unwavering mastermind of crime. Of course the punch line of the film is that the cop realizes he has been fooled because this cripple being the mastermind is the only explanation why he knows all he knows: he knows too much to just be an accidental witness. And the punch line is doubled with the composite picture of this fantasized criminal as seen by the other survivor who should not have survived and the criminal does not know he is still alive who has seen him very distinctly. This composite picture, a very sketchy image, is arriving on the fax machine as the cripple straightens up and gets into the car that was waiting for him outside the police station. Too late. This tactic has been used by other thrillers, but in this case it is very persuasive and the film works very well provided we do not profile the thriller-maker, otherwise we would know the end before the film ever starts.",

He is terrific in this movie. I also enjoyed Benicio del Toro although his character dies way to soon. The background music is your typical 90s suspense theme, but seeing this movie 15 years after its making you can say it is timeless nonetheless. This thriller is one of my favorites along with Seven, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs. After I finished watching this film I felt the same way as I did with all those cult classic movies. I was expecting the plot twist because that is what everyone talks about all the time, but I still loved that twist it was great. I love movies that slowly build up to a great ending. That boat shootout scene was just excellent. The movie had me hooked from the opening scene, Kevin Spacey is just great when he narrates a film. Excellent film, one of my favorites from the 90s and has a good twist at the end almost as good as The Sixth Sense. Very well constructed movie and great job by Bryan Singer as a director.

The movie is your conventional crime drama with a strong cast and some sharp writing that prevent it from fading into obscurity. It begins in the aftermath of a boat explosion where three career criminals were killed and evidence of a rumored multimillion dollar drug deal is no where to be found. What brought these criminals together and what went wrong on that boat? Only one man might hold the answers: Verbal Kint, a smalltime criminal with cerebral palsy and one of only two survivors from the botched operation. In an interrogation with Agent Kujan of US Customs, Kint will explain how it all came together: how five con-men with their own agendas were brought together with the help of a police lineup and eventually found themselves employed by the mysterious Keyser SÃ¶ze.

The 1990's, a strange sort-of transitional period in American culture, brought forth many a modern day classic. Films such as Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"", David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" and Wes Craven's ""Scream"" revolutionized then-modern cinema and showed a degree of class and complexity within their given genres unlike any we had seen before. And of course, another of these now iconic films was this one... director Bryan Singer's mind-warping and electrifying crime thriller ""The Usual Suspects.""

If you watch it objectively, it is just a damn entertaining, complex, well-plotted film noir piece with an exciting climax. If you take the subjective route, which you pretty much have to because of the ending, then what you've got is perhaps the most puzzling film ever made, one that even with multiple repeated viewings will make you second (and third and fourth, etc.) guess yourself.

But in fact Spacey is closer to being the principal actor in this film and his work, while good, is certainly not outstanding in my opinion. If anyone in this movie deserved a Supporting Actor Oscar it should have gone to Pete Postelthwaite, a graduate (as I recall) of the Royal Shakespeare Company, who makes a great villain with a foreign accent that can't quite be placed. I would certainly void the Oscar that went to the script writer. This movie is fine until the ending which goes beyond implausibility to the absolutely ridiculous. Many ""caper"" movies have implausible endings. (David Mamet's caper films come to mind.) But this one goes beyond beyond beyond. I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie but the ending dragged my rating down several notches. I think -- pardon the insult guys and girls -- it testifies to the youth of most contributors to this website that they are prepared to treat as a ""classic"" a movie that ranks far below gangster films of yesteryear that ended more believably. This is what used to be called a B Movie when double bills were common. It's enjoyable, but that's the most that can be said for it.",
461,13 June 2002,MaxL,3, Are we watching the same movie?,"Should be on the 100 WORST list.  The only thing good in this movie is Kevin Spacey, but even he cannot make this movie worth watching.  As far as the other actors, acting like this reminds me of Coyote Ugly (2000).  This movie is so dry it is hard to sit through more than 30 minutes of it.  There is nothing in this movie that makes me want to finish watching it.  The part of Kobayashi could be bettered by one of ""Saturday Night Live's""  worst performers.  This accent sounds so stupid and painfully fake it makes me wish I wasn't watching this garbage (again, like Coyote Ugly (2000)). This film is a waste.  I don't know how so many people can think differently. Watch it for yourself, but be forewarned, it stinks.",

464,23 July 2008,spk07,10," Funny, wicked, scary, and intelligent; a brilliant mystery","This has essentially every thing you want in a crime drama: interesting and fun anti-heroes, a wicked sense of humor, well thought-out plot, and an intriguing atmosphere. The performances are all outstanding. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Siegel gives the appropriate hues of light and dark in every scene. John Ottman's score is a true classic noir piece; brilliant especially compared to his more recent mediocre efforts but I'll save that for another review.",
465,13 January 2007,joachimokeefe,7, Doesn't quite pull off the trick ending,"The Usual Suspects is a great caper movie; stylish, exciting, intelligent and all that. The problem I had with it was that it's too easy to guess the ending. By the final scenes, the upshot is that the only mystery is Keyser Soze's true identity. Then you've really only got one character out of the main four that fits. It's too obvious for it to be Keaton; the other two aren't fleshed out enough for it to matter; Kint it has to be, the only mystery is how they explain it. So the final revelation is an anticlimax. The scene where the cop pieces together Kint's lie from the chaotic evidence in the office is great, but just to have Kevin Spacey walk off with no further twist is a letdown. Maybe if it had been Fenster back from the dead, or one of the cops, or even Pete 'Nice Try at Japanese Accent but It Goes Scottish Occasionally' Postlethwaite, who might shoot Spacey from the car, or maybe even the girlfriend - and this movie is very light on females - there would have been a final extra twist to make this movie more than just good. As it is, you think this super-duper master criminal seems to have made things extremely difficult for himself for no reason. Too much like 'and it was all a dream, The End'.",
466,4 February 2001,Rinho18,8, Very boring,"IÂ´ve heard first about this movie when it was ranked on IMDBs Top250. I think it was ranked #9. So I thought that this movie could be good, or at least, watchable. Boy was I wrong. When I rented The Usual Suspects, I kept myself awake by thinking why anyone could like this movie. It was just very bad and very boring. Maybe I did not like it, because I have just seen half of it. But then I watched it twice again, and I still did not like it. It is not THAT bad, but it is not worth being ranked as #15 of all time, and this is above ÂSaving Private Ryan"" or ÂThe silence of the lambs"" ?!? Why ?!?",
467,18 April 2014,petarmatic,6, I was not impressed except for Kevin Specey*s acting.,"I was very surprised to find out that this film received such a high grades. Yes, the plot is interesting, it was funny during line up and acting by Kevin Spacey. All acting by Kevin Spacey is excellent. In every film I watched Kevin Spacey I was astonished to see how excellent actor he is.",
468,15 June 1999,Movie-12,10, Great Film that could have been Greater. **** out of ****,"""The Usual Suspects"" is like a giant across movie landscape. Throughout film history no other thriller has so thoroughly captured an audience's attention and then massacres their predictions of something they never knew to begin with, then placing them into a state of wondering just what has happened here. I'll tell you what, I see over one hundred movies a year and this is one of the best, most imaginative and involving I have seen in my life.",
469,14 July 2011,gigan-92,10," ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""","A+ I haven't looked much into the mystery genre, but I must say this film drew me in with ease and intrigued me even more so once the credits rolled. I definitely recommend viewing it more than once, because seeing it just one time is nowhere enough to soak up all the details. With each viewing you pick up more, and, as I have, garner a greater appreciation for this movie. It is helmed by Bryan Singer, who directs his films by focusing on atmosphere and character.",
470,12 February 2012,Maniac-9,9, Great mystery/suspense movie,"Such an underrated movie, I went into the movie expecting a good but not spectacular movie and I can tell you that the movie is a must see. Kevin Spacey totally rocks his character. Spacey plays Verbal Kint the only survivor of a heist gone wrong. He's being interrogated by Dave Kujan(played by Chazz Palminteri) and the story that Kint is telling so detailed you think that it must be correct. Why wouldn't you believe Kint he has immunity, why would he lie. But as it's too late you find out what he had been telling Kujan this whole time just might not be right. It's one of those movies you need to go back and watch more then 1 time to see what you missed the first time around.",
471,14 November 2010,Keyska2004,10, Usual Suspects is a very Unusual Movie,"I am a Kevin Spacey fan, so yes I love this film. I wonder if this film inspired M. Night Shyamalan and his style of film producing. I had no idea what was going to happen at the end of the film before it hit me like a Mack Truck! Wow, what an experience that was for me. I have introduced my friends children who were high school students to this film, explaining that the street language used (very often in the film) throughout this film creates a believable story but is not to be taken as everyday language that they could use in life. They understand it very well and agree that it fits the film and makes the film so much better. Kevin Spacey has such a fantastic ability to morph into his characters that you forget that he isn't that cripple that you see in the movie. Accept the vulgar language because to tell a story about the low life street characters, you need to see them as they exist.",
472,6 January 2017,Andres-Camara,3, Attempt to do more than just action movies,"The question is, have you got it? Not for me. The film is entertaining, takes well, looks and enjoys some things, but the problem is that like many others, treats the viewer as someone who does not think and at that time spoils it, I explain in the spoiler.",
473,29 April 2014,RossRivero99,10, Terrific Entertainment,"Perhaps Bryan Singer's most well known film The Usual Suspects was inspired from a line a line in the 1943 movie Casablanca which says ""Round up the Usual Suspects."". Basically this movie is more of a crime, comedy, mystery, more than a drama film. The movie tells the story about five men who end up getting arrested and get brought up together for questioning. Then they plan an operation of revenge against the NYPD. But for them the operation goes well, but the influence of a so called Hungarian Gangster by the name of Keyser Soze is felt by every single one of them. The movie stars Stephen Baldwin as one of the suspects whose name in Michael McManus one of the suspects who gets brought up for questioning along with the other suspects played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Benicio Del Toro, and Kevin Pollak. What I found kind of funny about this movie is that when you first watch it you think that you know what is going on when you really don't. This movie was a great movie but with one of the most confusing plot lines of all time.",
474,3 July 2006,Batterupdp,10, one of my favorite movies!!!,"The Usual Suspects is hands down one of the best movies ever. It is one of those movies where you don't realize what you've seen until the end. The story is flawless and leaves you on the edge of your seat, which explains why it won a best original screenplay Oscar. The film is Directed by Bryan Singer (in his second picture).",
475,18 May 2016,Horror-yo,8," Very good 'classic' flick, a tad overrated","This is one of these seminal films and whether it's truly the first to accomplish its main feature, it's at least the bigger film to do it this early. A film that's had Scary Movie utilize one of its premises. A movie that influential that it's completely infiltrated the collective unconscious. A movie you'd call: ""classic"". Overall, the qualities are as follows: the acting especially from Palmintieri and Spacey, but also Byrnes and the Lord Kobayashi guy. The concept and its execution globally close to flawless. The irony behind it all, and of course the twist at the end. The flaws: there's too much talking, and the film seems like it draws towards the ending more than stands on its own, it feels like the movie-makers gave the ending so much importance they unknowingly neglected the rest of it. It's not a particularly enticing film to watch in its entirety, and it only gets interesting starting at a certain later point.",
476,21 April 2005,OriginalMovieBuff21,9, An intelligent thriller that makes you wonder after the film,"I rented this film on Friday because I heard this film was twist turning and very intelligent or I might add maybe because it got an 8.7 rating on IMDb. So I was willing to watch the film to see if it lived up to the test. I liked it and it was very suspenseful. It reminded me a lot of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" because of its rat in the heist business. The film sure did have brains too and the script was well designed. After the movie, your going to keep thinking about it because of its twist at the end and you won't even know it's coming which was a very good twist ending. Overall, a good film, not the greatest but still very intelligent and I liked the performances very much, especially Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro. I recommend the movie. ",

479,11 December 2018,andrewroy-04316,8, A thrilling work of absolute cinematic genius,"I've been excited to watch The Usual Suspects for a while now, and it did not disappoint at all. Any complaints of plot holes or confusing things that don't make sense to the viewer I think are absolute bullshit - everything that happens in the movie is very clearly laid out, you just have to know that Verbal is an unreliable narrator. As soon as they started discussing and Verbal began to be questioned about Soze, I was convinced that he was Verbal. How would Verbal get out alive and be the only survivor if he wasn't? It's likely we already know Soze given his reputation and influence on the group, and with Verbal as the only survivor, it just makes sense to be him, especially thinking about the opening scene with Keaton being killed. His limp is a great cover as well, and he was always the guy planning everything. I did think the bit at the end with all his names and stories coming from the board behind him was brilliant and adds to his covering of his tracks. I didn't think there was any ambiguity in the plot - Verbal has always been Keyser Soze, and orchestrated this to tie up loose ends.
While the intelligence of the twist is indisputable and the success of the movie certainly comes from this misdirection from Verbal, it's tough for me to decide whether this is truly an all-time great or just a really good movie. The point of the movie is to draw you in and show you the brilliance of Verbal, and it literally could not have done a better job of that (aside from maybe offering more red herrings or making it less obvious, but it seems like it tricked almost everyone who watched it, so maybe I just came in looking for it). You don't really connect or deeply understand the other characters beyond a very simple, flat personality. The plot is definitely complex and fascinating to unravel, and it is exciting throughout. Even when I saw the ending coming the whole time, I was still so excited and gulping down every detail of each scene, and Spacey's performance is truly brilliant. I think I'm leaning towards it being a 10 because it's so satisfying and electric, and succeeds to such a great degree in developing this complex thread which unravels to show Verbal's character, but may change it to a 9 due to the lack of strong secondary elements beyond the brilliant plot orchestrated by Verbal and, to some degree, its predictability to me. Either way, a brilliant movie that must be seen.",
