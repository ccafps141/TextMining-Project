0,18 June 2004,Galina_movie_fan,10, 'The human face is the great subject of the cinema. Everything is there',"When talking of Bergman, critics and viewers usually name Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, Cries and Whispers ahead of Persona. While those films are all amazing and stay very high on my list of all time favorites, for me, the truly unique and inspirational s 'Persona' - Bergman's enigmatic masterpiece.",/
1,21 April 2005,gftbiloxi,10, A Masterpiece,"PERSONA may well be Ingmar Bergman's most complex film--yet, like many Bergman films, the story it tells is superficially simple. Actress Elizabeth Volger has suddenly stopped speaking in what appears to be an effort to cease all communication with the external world. She is taken to a hospital, where nurse Alma is assigned to care for her. After some time, Elisabeth's doctor feels the hospital is of little use to her; the doctor accordingly lends her seaside home to Elisabeth, who goes there with Alma in attendance. Although Elisabeth remains silent, the relationship between the women is a pleasant one--until a rainy day, too much alcohol, and Elisabeth's silence drives Alma into a series of highly charged personal revelations.",r
2,18 May 2019,dromasca,8, the enigmas of 'Persona',"'Persona' is one of the most enigmatic movies in the history of cinema. Those who read the chronicles written right after the 1966 release of the film or the articles dedicated to it in the books of cinema history will encounter as many interpretations as authors. The same happens if we read the opinions written by film lovers on sites like IMDB, or we discuss the film between us. Ingmar Bergman had the inspiration not only of not talking a lot about this film (even less than about his other films) but he also avoided sharing too much of his personal thoughts or ideas even with the actresses or the other members of the production team. The result is an enigma. Each of us who sees or sees again this movie has his own Persona'.",e

4,22 February 2005,nycritic,10, Who Am I?,"When I viewed PERSONA recently, I didn't know what exactly to make of it: what was it telling me, what was its intentions, its ultimate meaning. Not being a conventional director by far, I felt that Bergman had deliberately left all this 81 minute of storytelling to me to figure out... and I may have been right, but I either wasn't getting it or this was too much of an abstract film to merit any analysis, so my review was at face value and even ended with the sentence ""this is exactly how Bergman wants it."" Seeing it later more emerges, and the deeper story takes place even if it still seems linear: Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) loses her speech midway through Electra and will not speak again (except once throughout the entire film, and in an imagined sequence). There is no apparent reason as to why she has lost her speech, and the only hint is the horror she witnesses on the television as war, genocide, and destruction rage on. Other than that it is never alluded to, her muteness.",i
5,5 September 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10," A brilliant film, but is not for everybody I don't think","I can understand the viewpoints of those who loved and were moved by Persona and those who were confused or frustrated by it. I personally love it, but I was underwhelmed by it first time. Persona is definitely not the most accessible of Ingmar Bergman's films, Wild Strawberries and The Magic Flute were much more in that regard, and it is also not an easy film to talk about or review. I have seen those who didn't like Persona finding that the story structure is disjointed. In a way it is, but what also made it fascinating in my view was how it explored the nature of art and reality in an ever thought-provoking(by Bergman standards) manner. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is fantastic, the melting frame was an interesting and well-done technique here, as is the scenery, and it is not a Bergman film with a memorable image or two. Persona definitely has those, with the disturbing and somewhat daring images at the start, the immortal image of the two main characters' faces becoming an entity and the more retrospective one with Alma reminiscing with the sexual encounter. The score is hauntingly beautiful, and the way it's written Persona comes across(like Cries and Whispers) as emotionally complex, somewhat disturbing and very moving, and as ever thoughtful also. The inclusion of off-screen voices are well-incorporated. Bergman's direction I cannot fault, and it's the same with the two leading ladies. Liv Ullman proves that a performance where actions and gestures speak louder than words can still move you, and she does that splendidly. But for me it is Bibbi Andersson's film, she is just heart-breaking in her loyalty and compassion. Overall, a brilliant film but understandably not the easiest of films to watch or review. 10/10 Bethany Cox",e
6,12 April 2008,ackstasis,7," ""Your hiding place isn't watertight. Life trickles in from the outside, and you're forced to react.""","Ingmar Bergman's 'Persona (1966)' opens with a bewildering montage of sounds and images, a frenzied newsreel of sex, death, cinema and comedy. The sequence is so far removed from my previous experience with the director that its effect is jarring, shocking; I momentarily wondered if I'd hit a wrong button and started playing Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou (1929)' by mistake. I question Bergman's motives for including such an uncharacteristic opening, for it appears to have very little to do with the narrative that follows. Is this montage - an account of the sickening and concealed horrors and desires of society - a possible explanation for Elisabeth's continued silence? Even so, it all seems somewhat exploitative, as though Bergman was simply going for shock-value, obliterating any notions of subtlety with which I had begun to associate him {though I'll admit that the strength of 'The Seventh Seal (1957)' arose from its not-so-subtle representation of Death}. The opening scene concludes with a young boy awakening in the morgue, his hand outstretched towards the vague image of a woman's face. Elisabeth's unloved child? Alma's aborted fetus?",w
7,5 February 2005,Quinoa1984,10," The most ambiguous, inviting, surreal, whatever-you-can-think philosophical experiment by Bergman","Writing from a hospital bed (as he did with Wild Strawberries, two of these being films strung out from anguish), Ingmar Bergman put down almost anything that was in his head to start with (the first five minutes- some of the most startling and thoroughly symbolic minutes he's ever directed), then transposed into a story of two women, or one. This was one of the landmark 'art-films' of the 1960's, with hints of the horrors of war (in one memorable scene, Elisabeth looks at a television screen at images of death), introspection regarding sex and identity, existentialism, and what it means to be an actor.

8,20 November 2022,reelreviewsandrecommendations,7," Intriguing, Abstract & Unique","There are few directors whose films have sparked as much rumination and analysis as Ingmar Bergman. His cinematic creations, utterly unique in style and tone, have been and shall continue to be debated and critiqued for decades. Many consider him the master of minimalism, whose work subtly exposes the truth of the human condition, while others hail his films as unnecessarily abstruse and pretentious. Whatever one's feelings on Bergman, it must be said that his films are certainly intriguing; and perhaps none more so than 'Persona.'",r

10,10 February 2023,AlsExGal,9, Persona is a women's' picture in the best sense of the term.,"This is one of the most studied and challenging films in history, inviting analysis from historians, critics and psychiatrists. I find it not dramatically different from other Ingmar Bergman films. The internal dialogue, frank discussions on sex, confusion about one's place in the universe, brutally harsh judgements of the artist - these were present before Persona, and after. When asked about the film, Bergman said he trusted audiences to form their own conclusions. An answer I found refreshing. I don't think Bergman, who also wrote the screenplay, was out to create a puzzle that must be ""solved"". There's no gamesmanship.",3
11,28 June 2005,planktonrules,3, Huh???!!!!,"To quote Colin Mochrie of Whose Line is it Anyway, ""it's CRAP""!!! To put this into perspective, I love foreign films--and I'd rather see them than most Hollywood films. I have seen perhaps as many as two thousand foreign films--and most of the ""must see"" films of directors such as Bergman, Truffaut, De Sica, Kurasawa, Fellini, Bunuel, etc. So, my strong opinion is not without some experience--I am not just some jerk who knocks Bergman's films because they don't have explosions or toga parties!!!! My contention is that SOME of this wonderful directors (or at least some of their films) are incredibly overrated, and are seemingly above criticism. Well, not from me--I love to stir the pot of controversy and call it like I see it. Check out some of my other reviews--I had ADORED some foreign films (such as The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) or directors (Akira Kurasawa) yet been unimpressed by other films (Such as several of Fellini's films--Satyricon and Juliet of the Spirits).",2
12,19 December 2009,preppy-3,5, If I knew WHAT I was watching I might have liked it more,"A nurse (Bibi Andersson) is hired to take care of an actress (Liv Ullmann) who has stopped speaking. They are all alone on an isolated island and begin to become each other...or something. To be totally honest I haven't a clue on what I just saw! I'm not a Bergman fan but I have nothing against him either. I like some of his movies but find others boring, obvious and wildly overrated (like ""Wild Strawberries""). This falls somewhere in between. It has some wonderful moments but the narrative seems to completely overhaul itself at least three times during the film. Just as it seems to be making sense something happens and you're flung into another version of the story with the same actors! Some people may find this intriguing but I found it annoying. Also some of the psychological points Bergman makes here are laughably obvious...but I suppose they were considered profound in 1966. Also there's one long monologue that is delivered TWICE! Yes--it lets us know what's going on but twice???? Complaints aside it was beautifully acted by Andersson and Ullmann and there were a few very interesting moments but the vague plot got maddening. Also I'm surprised that Bergman actually got a shot of an erect penis in the movie--that HAD to be quite daring for 1966. So, as it stands, I can only give this a 5.",3

Hear me bore!,"I was hesitant to write anything about this film at first because I wasn't sure if my negative reaction was from moodiness or the result of disappointed expectations. I haven't seen too many Bergman films, but most of the ones I've seen present interesting ideas, but as though they were the most earth-shattering profound concepts ever conceived. It can be a bit much. ",3

17,19 September 2005,Nazi_Fighter_David,8, A modernist masterpiece...,"In the early '60s, Bergman's visual and narrative style became ever more austere in focusing on tormented souls seeking guidance and comfort from an empty heaven, thus paving the way for a stark foray into extreme close-up in the enigmatic ""Persona.""

19,30 December 2011,kenjha,3, Pretentious,"An actress who has stopped talking is cared for by a nurse. Perhaps disturbed that Fellini and Godard had overtaken him for the title of the most pretentious filmmaker in the world, Bergman shot back with this much-praised drama. The film opens with random images of a movie projector, a cartoon, an animal getting disemboweled, an aroused male organ, etc. that leave most viewers bowing to the pure genius of Bergman. The film was probably cathartic for Bergman, saving him some money on therapy sessions, but viewers should not be subjected to such heavy-handed nonsense. Andersson and Ullmann are good actresses and the only reason for watching this.",r

21,23 October 2009,Hitchcoc,10, Those Bergman Females Could Act,"Bergman has it all here. He gives us a film about two incredibly complex women. He throws in the emotional baggage his people often have and he finds a milieu for them to participate in. Liv Ullman has had a breakdown of sorts, leaving her mute. Bibi Andersson is a chatty nurse, whose role is to take her to an island and simply watch over her. As time goes by, we begin to see that she is herself a tormented soul. Ullman's character doesn't vary much. She has established a being. She doesn't speak, but she doesn't shy away. She is sensitive and smiles. The young nurse can't stop talking, telling her innermost secrets. At one point, she reads a letter that was supposed to be mailed and finds out that her charge doesn't respect her much. This sets up a rift and only bad things can come out of it. This picture is so much more, however, because Bergman plays with quick cut images, superimposed on the screen. We are aware that this is a movie because of a projector that we see in the beginning and end. There are surreal elements all over the place, images dominating the screen. If Sven Nyquist has ever done a better job, I don't know when it would have been. I have to watch this again.",f

25,5 November 2005,sol-,10, My extended review of the film,"After my first viewing of 'Persona' I was unsure what exactly to make of it. Even after a second viewing, it is still hard to say what exactly 'Persona' is about. This is not a negative trait though, but rather a curious characteristic. In fact, the overall film is perhaps best described as ""curious"". I would not call 'Persona' a flawless film, but regardless of whether Bergman's film is flawed or flawless, it stimulates one to think, and that is certainly a good quality. I will now provide some thoughts on the film, in light of having viewed it a second time. I do not know how valid all of my comments are - they are just some thoughts on the material. Unfortunately it is hard to discuss the film without possible spoilers, so be warned: my review may spoil a fresh experience of the movie.",t

And even after the runtime, it's not exactly easy to interpret the message behind Bergman's psychological thriller. I almost feel like Bergman's films are films you experience and not necessarily ones you understand, am I right? He was essentially David Lynch before Lynch existed. And I can see how he inspired dozens of filmmakers to this day, but I'm not sure how effective his films may be on a viewer like me.",u

30,14 August 2021,ivanmessimilos,4, Didnt like it,"Unpopular opinion. I really think about what and how to write about this film that I wanted to watch for a very long time. In the end I am really not satisfied. Too much remains unexplained, and I really don't like that when there's a lot left for personal interpretation. A lot of the shots look like redundancy because they don't bring anything new to the plot (my perspective). A very artistic film that pays too much attention to the way a particular scene or frame is shot instead of concentrating on the action in the film itself. It's clear to me that the plot may not be that important here, but it bothered me a lot. Precisely because it's artistic (which I don't like this word for, but I don't know a better term) a lot of the scenes were illogical and weird. The unusual ending, just like almost the whole film, has no point or I haven't seen or understood it, a lot left to the viewer to explain what it means, unrelated scenes, a beginning that has nothing to do with the rest of the film and the film didn't evoke any emotion. . I don't want to say that I'm some smartass or omniscient, in fact I'm an ordinary spectator, and Bergman is a movie legend. Just my personal opinion and experience of the film. I am ready to defend all this to the death. And beyond that.",
31,30 August 2008,johnnyboyz,7, The film is bound to attract as well as confuse any sorts of people that track down this sort of thing.,"For all its bizarreness; avant-garde feel and totally disorientating visual style at points, Persona actually tells rather a straight forward narrative and adopts a relatively simple visual approach. The camera work is sly and unspectacular, relying on the film itself and its various bursts of disturbance to get across more of a 'bang' in the viewers mind and its story, with particular attention to the manner in which a relatively routine love story-come-psychoanalytical tale is told, is shot and unfolded using gentle camera-work and soft female voices to aid the visuals. Such a juxtaposition between visuals and timbre are the hallmarks of someone who knows what they're doing especially given the other visuals elements director Bergman includes.",

34,23 December 2008,shaham,9, Persona is an inclination to have an ideal personality.,"Persona is a commendable movie by Bergman. It's not a simple movie to be seen just one time. This film should be commented in many aspects: cinematography, acting, directing, and lightening besides the theme. In this film I could see so much about visual elements of film making. You can easily mute this film and understand the scenes without the monologues. On the other hand you can just listen to the monologues of the nurse (Bibi An.) without watching the movie and that is also admirable. Here I just try to focus on main theme of the movie.",

36,2 September 2002,moonspinner55,6, Nothing if not bizarre,"Appropriately (and predictably) moody Swedish drama from Ingmar Bergman examines intricate relationship between mute woman and her bright, sensitive nurse from a psychological stand-point. The plot takes some fascinating turns, but Bergman is hardly a compassionate man. A character's plight or a tender look is always undercut by bitterness or cynicism, and the bizarre opening montage may send many viewers packing before the picture ever gets going. At the heart of the piece, however, are two very fine performances by Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, who never reveal a false thought or emotion (even in the tightest of close-ups).

40,22 November 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""But somehow..., I think I could change myself into you if I tried.""","The movie opens with a series of unconnected and somewhat disturbing images - the shearing of a sheep, a nail pounded into a victim's hand a la the crucifixion, dead people on slabs in a mortuary. Quick edits over the opening credits additionally lend a surreal flavor to the picture, so that we have no idea what's coming.

45,27 June 2001,DennisLittrell,10, Beyond Interpretation,"Someone who has read a biography of Ingmar Bergman would probably be able to offer an intelligent interpretation of this very personal film by the great Swedish director. Since it stars his two most famous proteges, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, and is an intense focus on their faces as though to look into their souls, and further since during the film their personas merge as one--given all this, perhaps it could be speculated that Bergman is suggesting that his perfect love would be a composite of the two. Certainly part of the erotic power of this stunningly filmed masterwork (black and white cinematography by the gifted Sven Nykvist) is the evocative display of the two Swedish actresses, who were respectively, 30- and 26-years-old, when the film was made. It is curious however that Bergman is very deliberate in downplaying their sexuality. They are never coquettish, nor openly sexual. Very little skin is exposed and that only incidentally. It is their differing power as actresses that is explored with some, no doubt, deliberate and unavoidable revelation of their real life personalities.",

48,6 May 2005,selfparody,6, Neat looking but hollow,"My take on this film is that Bergman didn't make it: Sven Nyvist did. The story frankly isn't interesting: an actress can't talk, and meets with a boring nurse who won't shut up, and allegedly, they strike up a relationship. Bergman himself said he didn't know what his point was. The good stuff is happening off to the side of that, but is good only if you like looking at footage. A hand being nailed through, the footage of the Buddhist monks in Vietnam burning themselves, etc. Those are the things that you remember, but that's really not much better than the video shown in Ringu in terms of film-making, to be blunt. I have heard some good reviews of that monologue where the nurse talks about her sexual encounter on the beach, but I frankly was saying ""they have sex with random guys who walk up to them on the beach? Wow, I'VE got to go to Sweden.""",

Franz Kafka said of books that the best ones should be 'the axe for the frozen sea within us,' meaning that books should hit us hard and make us reevaluate our lives and how we're living; this is a film that does that to me. Every time I watch it, it makes me want to take a step back from my life and reevaluate my persona, and ask myself: Why do I do the things I do? What do I believe about the world?

If we are to assume that everything is a lie based on the fact that all of our existence is merely our brains interpreting signals sent by our senses, the truthfulness of which we have no way of confirming, is it then the most truthful thing of all to stop interacting with the world so as to not add to the lie?

It is an absolute masterpiece in some aspects bringing reminiscences of antic tragedies (in terms of gestures mostly - vide Maria Callas in Pasolini's Medea). But most of all this movie, as almost all Bergman's movies, touches humanity of a man and asks us questions that hardly none of directors was able to present in such a clear manner. The story can be read in many ways, but for me the symbolic one is probably the most fruitful. Persona, the face, mask, in a physical meaning as used in Greek tragedies, the way to become someone else, depict and reenact myths. On higher level, symbolic meaning of persona in Jung's psychology together with all his theories about ego. Simply, a 100% must see for every thinking man.",

It is usually seen in college film courses (where I saw it first) or by discerning filmgoers with a passion for foreign films.  What I see in this truly haunting film is the definition of surrealistic cinema.  Like Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's classic short UN CHIEN ANDALOU suggests, our eyes are about to see into a portion of the unconscious mind.

While she won't talk the nurse spills her soul to her and ends up feeling betrayed by what the actress writes in a letter to the doctor. That causes friction in what looked like a friendship brewing.

The story explores a woman's life and awakening as her personality begins to merge with another woman. Starring Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, Persona opens with disjointed images of camera equipment, animal slaughter, and a boy in a hospital bed next to corpses, which pulls the audience in immediately. Initially, the audience has no idea what's going on, which is precisely my kind of film. The film seemed to have touches of the emerging French New Wave, which was also fun for me, as that is my favorite film genre. Having seen Mulholland Drive before Persona, I couldn't help but see the many similarities the two films share.

Everything that we see in its way of communication, its dialect, its structure of implications are completely apparent. Its only mere evocations are of hidden realities, and we lose hope of finding them. It is about motherhood, or abandoning it.

76,18 April 2001,barberoux,8, Vague but engaging.,"Persona was too confusing or vague or you could say deep to give a straight forward comment about.  Since it was so vague it leaves itself open to many interpretations.  Well here's mine.  I think Alma and Elisabeth were the same person.  Elisabeth suffered a psychotic episode on stage and was hospitalized afterwards.  There she developed another personality of a young nurse named Alma.  Her Doctor figured that some peaceful isolation at her cabin would help Elisabeth integrate the split personality.  At the cabin Alma/Elisabeth talked out the mental issues causing the split. The scene with the glass was a realization by Alma/Elisabeth that the behavior she was engaging in was destructive and it caused a crisis.  After the glass scene the conversations turned to arguments, the mental split disintegrating, that culminated in the soliloquy about her child.  The child and Alma/Elisabeth's reaction to it was the thing causing mental anguish. That realization, by both personalities, caused the two personalities to merge into one, Alma's. OR, Alma may have had a psychotic episode and developed a older, wiser personality of Elisabeth.  Either way the end personality was Alma seen cleaning up the cabin, putting things in order, physically and mentally, and leaving on a Bus back to society OR, away into another mental world.  What was so great about the movie was the multitude of interpretations available. The inclusion of the film effects were meant to remind us that we all play roles.  Alma and Elisabeth were just two roles of the same person.  Some lingering thoughts still entertain me. Was the child a result of the beach episode? Did Alma feel guilt over the beach scene? Was Alma abandoned by the father of the child?  Did Alma feel used by men who couldn't see, (the dark glasses), who she was or what was going on inside her?  The movie has stayed with me, affected me, as a good movie should.  The photography was wonderful with a beautiful use of light on the actresses faces.",

As they spend a lot of time together, Alma talks to her, mostly about herself and her opinions, never receiving an answers or replies from Elisabeth. Alma eventually decides to confess some secrets to the seemingly sympathetic Elisabeth, and she slowly finds she is submerging into Elisabeth's persona.

As an enormous fan of 3 Women, which Robert Altman openly admitted he drew a lot of inspiration from this for, it was a natural way for me to introduce myself to Bergman, and the parallels between the two studies were evident almost immediately. As with Altman's film, Persona explores deep themes of female identity, utilizing the contrast between it's two characters to draw out a fascinating study. The set up is brilliant, as nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson) is tasked with caring for actress Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann), who has voluntarily given up the ability to speak. This simple act of making her mute creates that contrast between the two that Bergman uses to it's fullest capacity.",

It will leave you awestruck!,"Long before ""Muholland Drive"" there was another masterpiece that left viewers confused and awestruck. It also dealt with two beautiful women. ""Persona"" is a film that kept me glued to the screen. It has to be Ingmar Bergman's best film. I'm not just saying that because every critic has said that since the mid sixties. I'm saying that because it is a surreal mind puzzle that made me dive into my subconscious. ""Persona"" is filmed in gorgeous black and white and at an 85 minute running time it never wears out it's welcome. The montage in the beginning is sooooooooo bizarre, don't sit to close to the screen you might hallucinate. The story concerns Alma (Bibi Anderson), a nurse who is taking care of Elizabeth, played mysteriously by the sexy Liv Ullman. Elisabeth refuses to speak, she stopped talking in the middle of a play. For some reason Alma feels very comfortable around her and starts to tell her personal things. She even moves in with Elisabeth to help out. Alma explicitly talks about a sexual escapade that her and her friend experienced on the beach. The scene shows nothing sexual, but the vivid language and sexy Swedish dialog turns this moment into one of the hottest most arousing scenes in cinema history. (something almost popped up for me... spring-boing!!!) Elisabeth still remains silent. There characters eventually merge as one person. Alma also finds out that Elisabeth has betrayed her when she reads a letter she wrote telling a friend about her personal intimate secrets. Oh no! This is when the film turns into a crazed decent into madness as only Bergman could bring you. He even films one scene twice but at a different angle. Now if only Bergman was more optimistic; poor guy. All kidding aside, Persona is an amazing experience that breaks the fourth wall between film and reality. Images are only representational of life, Bergman shows viewers this as the camera runs out of film. This is just my interpretation. Oh heck, I think I'll have two watch this a couple more times, and not just for the explicit conversation about Alma's orgasms. I think both ""Persona"" and ""Muholland Drive"" would make a great double feature. I don't think there is any film that is like ""Persona"". In fact there probably never will be.

It is a black and white movie from 1966 and is about a nurse, who is put in charge of a mute actress. That summary seems to be a little short, but you probably will enjoy the movie way more, when you don't know anything about it. If someone would ask me about my favourite movie, I'd probably reply with Persona. I wouldn't consider many movies flawless, but I just can't find anything bad about the movie. Although I probably didn't even get all of it, but that doesn't even matter, because Persona has so many great ideas concerning film-making. The idea of filming the ending monologue first with one shot, in which the viewer only sees the person who is talking and then repeating the exact same monologue but this time letting the viewer only see the person who is listening, is amazing. The cinematography fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the lighting and the framing are often used in a very creative way to elaborate the story. The Story works very well, although it doesn't need much characters and runtime to tell its story. Liv Ullman and Bibi Andersson both were a very good casting choice and give incredible perfomances. The opening credits alone are the best ones I've ever seen and I was immediately amazed.",

My last attempt at watching an art film was not interesting(Cache) and quite a chore to sit through. So I was quite wary of watching this movie. But I wasn't disappointed. The one special thing about this movie is the detailed depiction of its characters. That is the speciality of Bergman. In his own words, he wants the audience to feel passionately for his characters. Unlike other ""art"" movies where the characters leave you cold, his movies have a certain humanity to them and the characters in his movies are usually disturbed individuals who can connect to the audience. The whole movie is like a character study with the two women going through a variety of emotions as they deal with each other. We understand the reasons for their behaviour and begin to empathise with their problems. So I would place this movie above other art films I have seen till now, except maybe 8 1/2.

104,21 February 2008,bandw,10," Transfixing, no matter what you make of the story","This is the account of an intense relationship between two women: Elisabeth (Liv Ullman), an actress who stopped talking in the middle of a performance of ""Electra"" and withdrew from life, and Alma (Bibi Anderson) who is a nurse assigned to her care. The two of them wind up in a cottage on a lonely island and that is where things gets interesting, but more than a little ambiguous. I'm sure there are many film studies theses written on various interpretations of this film. Where the two women really just two sides of the same woman? Was theirs a lesbian relationship? Was their relationship a power struggle? Was it a dream? Was it a battle of egos? What parts were imagined and what real? Is the film primarily a study of how two strong personalities affect each other? Did Elisabeth retreat in response to the horrors of the world? Was her withdrawal a rational response to the lack of meaning in life? And so on, with almost an infinite number of interpretations. For me, it is a study of how it is virtually impossible for people to know each other, or perhaps to know anything. ",

An actress, struck mute, is sent to recuperate at an island house with her nurse. The women slowly become psychologically intertwined...or do they? The film manages to seem impenetrable and highly simplistic at the same time. Abetted by Sven Nykvist's stunning B&W cinematography, this was and is Bergman's greatest achievement. It's haunting, frustrating, and at times even funny. Liv Ullmann, as the actress, and Bibi Andersson as the nurse, give performances that have justifiably become legendary. Andersson appears to do most of the heavy lifting as she has nearly all of the dialog and while her performance is tremendous, Ullmann is just as good projecting some pretty hideous angst from her silent face.",

I will agree that this film is great if you wish to learn more about Film Theory... However, I personally didn't find the movie very entertaining. The movie tries to say how the two main leads are supposed to be a representation of a mirror reflection of themselves. I didn't get that. Certain scenes where it's supposed to represent the melding of identity, I got more sexual tension out of. Overall, I think the movie is trying to be to artsy. The Film understands the idea of self reflexive nature of film, but tries to make you understand by beating you over the head a hundred times while saying ""LOOK HOW CREATIVE I AM!"" If you like the film, that's great, you were able to get something I wasn't able to. However if you are more like me, It's only worth watching once for the theories and that's it.",
109,19 January 2021,jromanbaker,10, The Silence of the World,"I like many of Bergman's films and mainly his earlier ones. It is because of this that I have resisted watching his later films, or to be more exact those that came after ' Persona '. I have even resisted watching ' Persona ' which I admit to being a mistake, but on reflection perhaps it is more ' modern ' than it was in 1966 and more accessible in 2021, so the timing for me is right. Like the retreat into silence many of us are doing, fearful of others and isolating Liv Ullman's retreat is ours. We watch in horror as she sees the terrible images on her television screen as we do now.. In 1966 it was the image of a man burning himself alive as the crowd surges by, and the terror and incomprehension of a child at gunpoint, hands pitifully held up and being led to a concentration camp. This is the world, and its fairly recent past that she shrinks from, as we do out of perhaps personal necessity ourselves when we gaze at our present images with equal terror. Too much has been written of Bergman's coldness as if this was just a Modernist exercise in abstraction. I take the opposite view; it sears and burns with passion, as she is confronted by Bibi Andersson playing her nurse who speaks too much first in friendship then in hostility. I will not give away more, and this is not a thriller but a profound examination on states of mind living in the vital world of human communication and being remote from it. Bergman shows with precision how this can lead to the ' nothing ' which is the one word Liv Ullman is forced to say. Is ' Persona ' one of the ten best films ever made ? I think we can all make our lists, but we should resist what is told us and not be over reverent of critic's choices. Objectively the film is incredibly well made and visually as near to perfect as it can be. The great Sven Nykvist was responsible for the visual excellence, but Berman, magician that he could be is the creator and for me it is the apotheosis of all that he achieved. The true greatness of it is that it is open to so many interpretations, and although I deny some written here I respect them and choose my own. The silence of not speaking, and the silence of talking too much can both open Pandora's box, and the demons within are let loose. Our freedom is to choose a balance, which the silence of the tormented child led away is forced to endure, and that brings us to today. Let readers of this review draw their own conclusions.",

113,11 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,4, Did very little for me in the end,"""Persona"" is a Swedish black-and-white film from 1966, so this one had its 50th anniversary not too long ago and of course it was made by Ingmar Bergman who is considered being one of the most defining filmmakers of all time. Sadly, I cannot agree judging by what I have seen from him so far and this film here certainly did not change it. Rather the opposite was the case that I think he is even more overrated. Bergman was in his 40s when he wrote and directed this one, so it is neother an early or late career effort from him. The manw as nominated for no less than nine Oscars, but even if this one here is certainly among his most known, most seen and most famous (as you can see from the almost 100k votes here on imdb, which is not a given at all for such an old film), it did not get in at the Oscars. Swedish lead actress Bibi Andersson managed to score a nomination though with the BAFTAs, maybe the biggest success of her career, even if she lost out to Anouk Aimée. The latter is still alive, but Andersson died not too long ago. She was 30 when this movie here was made. Her co-lead is played by Liv Ullmann, who managed the bigger career from the two and was minimally younger than Andersson when this was made, but of course physically very different with her dark hair and Andersson being blonde. These two are at the very center of the film. There are sipporting players, but their impact and screen time are really minimal and also not too many supporting players, which is why I believe this film is also really suitable for being turned into a stage play. You also don't need many different locations as the prologue is set at a hospital somehow where the two women meet each other and basically get to know each other, but immediately afterwards the action switches to the seaside where Ullmann's character is being sent, so her health gets better, which also happens indeed. But I will get to that later. At comfortably under 1.5 hours, this is not a long film by any means and I am actually pretty glad that it was not because I cannot say I was well-entertained here at all when I was lucky enough to see this one on the big screen tonight. Or ""lucky"" enough. I must say I am a bit baffled by how high the rating is here on imdb and that this film sits comfortably in the biggest movie site's top250. It deserves none of that and in the next paragraph I want to explain why I think so.",

Sure, it is not your run of the mill flick and it has some very interesting plot points but a movie isn't excused of being a good movie just because it is smart. This is not a good movie. The story is shallow, the plot barely moves and a lot of it is there simply as an ""I'm very smart"" filler.
Yes, the philosophical questions raised are interesting but are not enough to hold the movie on its own. In the end, Persona is just that, a series of philosophical themes one after the other (with some great shots scattered across the movie).

The drama that unfolds however has more to offer than what is apparent on the surface. Frequently it constitutes an introspection made explicit with the elements shown to the viewer catering effectively in support of this basic idea. This approach might make Bergman's film less accessible and look dated to modern audiences despite an interesting theme at the core, regardless of the obviously commendable cinematography, the exquisite lightening and direction.

I think it is the tragedy she sees around her that makes Liv Ullman fall into silence, an actor who sees while performing ' Elektra ' that all theatre and perhaps artistic interpretaion are essentially false. When the superb actor Bibi Andersson as her nurse takes care of her she listens to stories of ' life,' especially the confessions the nurse makes about her past. Is she studying the nurse or is the nurse just draining her ? Set on an island they are divorced from the world and friendship ( silent though Liv Ullman remains ) turns into hostility and violence. It is a gruelling, magnificent film. I think it is the highest point in Ingmar Berman's work and a film that is to be watched many times. Sven Nykvist is behind the camera. A great artist in himself who added radiance to many films, and that I for one miss in the world of cinema. Another interpretation.

Not in the subject matter, but in that both works of art perfectly marry their messages with their forms, and both say so much with so little a narrative spine. In that sense, both are great works of art that transcend any of the discomfit their often dubious artistic and social claims make. Persona has only four main actors, two of which dominate the film, and only one of which speaks. That would be a 25 year old nurse, sister Alma (Bibi Andersson), who is hired to take care of a famous stage actress who has had a nervous breakdown and refuses to speak. This is Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullman). The other two actors who appear and speak are Mr. Vogler (Gunnar Björnstrand), who makes a brief hallucinatory appearance late in the film, and the doctor of the asylum where Elisabet is housed and where Alma works (Margaretha Krook). The title, also, given that Elisabet is an actress, has been endlessly argued over, even though it's perhaps the most manifest part of the film. In his defense, I think Bergman realized that he could not make too long a film out of this material, lest be charged with filmic narcissism, so wisely it only clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes, for there are loads of people willing to overpraise this film for Bergman, without relying on himself to do so. That said, Bergman does give a little bit of narration, to most manifestly inject himself into the proceedings, as he does in shots where Elisabet is his surrogate, physically guiding Alma in her scenes with Mr. Vogler.",

The meaning of the film (if there is one) seems very allusive and shrouded in symbolism. The movie is very bleak and despairing. It seems to say that life and art are ultimately futile and disconnected, commonplace themes, or anti-themes, for post-modern expression. That being said, the movie is beautifully shot and intelligently constructed. No director is better than Bergman at composing shots. This movie to me was like a T.S. Elliot poem. I wasn't sure what he was saying, but I enjoyed the way he said it. There seems to be hundreds of shades of white and black and gray throughout the picture, all used to the utmost effect. This movie could be considered a study of the human face. I have not seen a film that better utilizes the close-up. I detest movies that use extreme close-ups for no reason other than because they can. Bergman shows more human emotion in one close up--the shot of Elizabet listening to the music on the radio toward the beginning, for example--than in all Jerry Bruckhiemer-produced films combined. It certainly helps that the actresses perform with uncanny realism. This is a stunning film, one that haunts you for days following",

In fact, the second one is mute: with this method, the nurse starts to feel the patient (actress) and body as an instrument to talk about her past and her problems, until to feel rage and hate against her because of her silence. It is the play of double character and of identification with other people (in fact ""Persona"" refers to the Latin word that indicates theatrical mask and also to the etymological meaning if voice's amplifier), that can happen in the silence of this relation (also with subtile homo-erotical tensions) until the delirium of impossibility of language (and communication) and impossibility of understand the past.

I can go as far as to say that this is the best female performance I have ever seen. Truly mesmerizing. Bibi Anderssan also gives a stupendous performance as the happy-go-lucky nurse Alma. Bergman's solid direction couldn't've been better, and here, proves again that he is the greatest filmmaker who has ever lived. The gorgeous cinematography by Sven Nykvist also helps to create the film's oppressive, claustrophobic sense of dread, building the tension to a maximum. The film is filled with disturbing images and sound effects, that stay with you for a long while after you watched the film. Some of these moments are so shocking they could even be from a horror movie (some of these ideas he would use to a maximum in 1968's Vargitmmen, his only horror movie which, coincidentally is very similar to Persona).

Verbal language simply cannot describe the emotional piano Persona plays.  Along with 2001: A Space odyssey, it is the single most disturbing and mind opening film I have ever seen.    While in the middle of performing the last act of Electra, Elizabeth Vogler suddenly freezes, and from then on ceases to speak.  She is in perfect health both mentally and physically, but for reasons unknown has simply retreated into herself.  Sister Alma, a young nurse, is sent to look after her.  They go together to a small remote Island, where Alma attempts to nurture her out of her silent facade.  At first, due to her silence, Alma cares for Elizabeth like an oversized doll.  But then, with the opportunity of real conversation, Elizabeth becomes to her an empty vessel into which she spills her soul.  And Elizabeth, hollow, becomes a sort of vampire, constantly taking in Alma, but at the same time giving herself up as well. Nestled together, without the interferences of the world, their personas begin to mesh, as they become the two sides of a single personality, one soul living amongst two bodies.  However, as a human body warns off a foreign intruder, the personas of Elizabeth and Alma become allergic to each other, engaging in a fierce battle for identity. Throughout, as if testing his own skills as a seducer, Bergman tries to remind his audience that it is just a movie they are watching, not experiencing.  But true to his form it becomes of no use... Persona is an experience.  Alluring, compelling, mind opening, and disturbing, Persona is all of these things.  It is a film that works on a multitude of complex levels.    In a sexual sense, not a stitch of clothing is removed, and yet the film permeates with eroticism.  It is on many stages completely surreal, but you don't realize that.

161,20 October 1998,RG-5,10, A film greater than the sum of its parts,"Deceptively simple on the surface, ""Persona"" may be one of cinema's most complex expressions.  Critic John Simon has gone so far as to say that ""'Persona' is to film what 'Ullysses' is to the novel."" The comparison is apt.  In capsule reviews Bergman's masterpiece is often reduced to something like... a story about an actress who stops talking and is sent to recuperate at a beach house with a talkative nurse at which time the two women's personalities mesh. (The self-referential elements, like the projector starting up, the film appearing to catch and burn, and the soundstage shot at the end, are usually not dealt with in these reviews.) But I think Bergman's working title for the film--""Cinematography""--gives a clue to what the film is REALLY about--or at least one of the things.  ""Persona"" is about film; it is about the duplicity of film (tricking the eye into seeing motion; creating an illusion of reality, etc.) And it is about the mind's willingness--even eagerness--to accept the duplicity. It is about the duplicity of art and the artist (is s/he a humane observor, a voyeur or vampire--sucking the life from those observed?) In fact, it could be said that ""Persona"" is about duplicity in its broadest sense--the dual nature of things and the western obsession with seeing the world broken down into black and white dualities. But what's black is also white. Who's really the nurse and who's the patient in ""Persona""? Who's the actress; who's playing a role? (If ever a film demanded to be made in black and white, this is it.) Yet ""Persona"" is much more than just a treatise on duality. It is a film that seems to be enriched with each viewing, and the viewer is enriched in the process.",

I don't think I understood it perfectly, and you would be lying if you said you did. Right off the bat I'm gonna have to say that I liked The Seventh Seal a bit better. This one was just too odd. Many consider this one of the best films of all time, which gives me a question: How the hell do y'all force yourselves to like these kinds of movies? There is NO way you're actually ENTERTAINED by this. Sure, it's an art film, and on a technical level is one of the ""best"" ones. But come on... I refuse to believe you genuinely ""enjoyed"" this. I put quotes around enjoy because sometimes you aren't supposed to necessarily enjoy a film, but feel emotion through its rich themes and style. I personally was not very entertained by this, but I was intrigued. That is why I give it an 8/10. Obviously factoring in the ""masterpiece factor"" this probably got a higher score than it deserved. This was a very interesting film, though. I will admit that it does really leave you thinking, and it does leave you to interpret what you just watched on your own. Ingmar Bergman knows this, he has stated that that is one of the main purposes of his films. Anyways, I don't think anyone will ever truly know what's going on in this film. Are Alma and Elisabet the same person? Is Elisabet just faking it/acting so she can study Alma's spiral into insanity? We may never know.

170,3 February 2015,Slime-3,8," Unique, Bizarre but Mesmerising Art House classic","CONTAINS SPOILERS. Bergman has such a daunting reputation that for many of us it's perhaps a leap of faith just to even chose one of his movies. The expectation is of something deep, brooding, obscure and rather slow. Comedy sketches have been written around the silences and menacing composition that are perceived to form the backbone of his films. There's a lingering aura of Bergman being 'only for the intellectuals'. Maybe some of this is, at times, true. Maybe not.It's a personal choice for each of us but the rewards for taking that leap and staying with a Bergman movie are well worth anyone's time and effort. None more so than PERSONA which combines a few famously bizarre surrealist sequences with a phenomenal piece of claustrophobic two-handed acting by Ullman and Andersson, the like of which I cannot honestly recall elsewhere. Their beautiful faces, often shot in ultra close-up are lit to emphasis every pore and minor blemish as if to highlight that however gorgeous as they are, these are human and imperfect faces on flawed personalities. The slightest twitch or tremor is given significance, the quasi-lesbian relationship they appear to develop is treated with an intense but chaste sensuality and the turns in the story are arresting and unsettling. The fact Ullman remains mute and Andersson does all the talking sounds like a recipe for some chronic naval-gazing. Not so. Introspective it is, self absorbed too, but Andersson's character has a secret or two which her initial prim, starched appearance belies. Her graphic description of a pivotal liaison in her past is truly unexpected in a movie of this vintage. It must have seemed alarmingly candid when first shown. It still does. It's also poetic and rather beautiful. I can only recall seeing one other movie, LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD,in which so much of the dialogue stems from just one of the characters and at times the direction PERSONA appears to take(or not, as the case may be)emphasises this similarity as do the striking monochrome photography and the exacting use of composition. Surrealist sequences aside, PERSONA is the more real of the two films, the least fanciful and at the denouement probably the more satisfying. ",

The film starts fantastically, as Bergman draws parallels with the film and the process of film-making. We are taken inside of the inner working of the camera, before Bergman slowly brings us into the room of a young boy. One of the great things about the film is the minimalist composition of the frames, lots of stark whites with no variation, and only a few items of furniture.

Reasons are many and I would like to start with the excellent photograph (as always) of Sven Nykvist. He is a genius and I can understand why Nykvist had been working with Bergman in 22 films and TV productions: when two geniuses collide the result is superb. He had been the cinematographer of Bergman's finest movies such as the excellent ""Cries and Whispers"", ""Fanny and Alexander"", ""Autumn Sonata"", ""The hour of the wolf"", ""Face to face"" and many more. In a sequence of Persona, almost at the end we can see the two of them (Bergman and Nykvist) behind the camera, preparing a scene with Liv Ullman. A silent recognition from the director to his friend. They been working together since 1953. How important is Nykvist in Bergman's work? Well I couldn't find better answer that Persona film. The use of light and shadows is one of the key elements on the plot. In the climax scene, when Alma (Bibi Anderson) is talking with Elisabeth (Liv Ullman) about her son's dark history, we basically see the same conversation twice; one focus the camera on Ullman and the other one, on Anderson. In the first sequence half of the face is on the shadows, when we see the other sequence, Andersonn's face have the same peculiarity, except for the side, is the opposite. At the end of the two sequences, Bergman overlap the two lighted sides of the faces to create one single face. An extraordinary and beautiful result, visually speaking.",

It is one of the best psychological thrillers ever made and sets a standard for future psychological thrillers to be judged by. The emphasis in this film is more on psychology and less on thrills or suspense. Persona explores some of the fundamental psychological issues that most humans experience as they mature and addresses these issues in a chilling way that should impact most viewers of this classic film. This approach results in a film that will be very compelling to some viewers and very uncomfortable for other viewers. This is fundamentally a two woman screenplay and the interplay of the two female leads provides the substance of the film. Both female leads deliver unforgettable performances. Any fan of cerebral films should enjoy Persona.,

213,17 July 2012,rodrigvirgolini-985-508630,10," Experience the intensity of an authentic psychological thriller, beautiful in every way possible. Intriguing, mysterious, confusing... A diamond among films.","It is films such as ""Persona"" that give testament to the profound beauty of which cinema is capable of achieving, of which art is capable of achieving. Only a handful of times does one come across a motion picture that can truly reach one's deepest emotions, to a level in which it can, almost scarily, manipulate them. Ingmar Bergman once again proves his genius providing us with yet another unforgettable experience, from beginning to end. Throughout the entire movie, we are witnesses of a disturbing story of mental corruption. Bergman exposes the ambiguity and fragility of the human mind in a sublime way, utilizing an exquisite repertoire of resources. An intensity unmatched, constant, however with peaks so high that they are able to create extreme emotions. There is a sentiment of confusion that accompanies every scene portrayed by the beautiful Bibi Andersson, and her dazzling co-star Liv Ullman. Andersson is magnificent, as always, in her role of the soft and gentle Alma, nurse who is in charge of Elisabet (Ullman). Liv Ullman plays the role of an actress who is under treatment for her constant refusal to speak, and she does it fantastically, managing to display a vast set of emotions uttering hardly a single word. At times, Bergman manages to contradict Ullman's breathtaking beauty with a sense of what I could identify only as authentic fear. She gradually becomes truly frightening, in an enigmatic, sinister way. Legendary Sven Nykvist captures the images awesomely, as customary. Pure cinematographic brilliance, it is hard to conceive any possible improvement. The music, as well, contributes perfectly to the film's essence. There are sequences that combine resources in a manner in which surrealism is almost suggested, but only to generate feelings corresponding to the inner reality of the characters, in the most subtle of fashions. The conflict transcends the screen and crawls into the viewer's mind. The closeups, the use of lighting, shadows, the beauty of the places selected, make ""Persona"" a genuine masterpiece. Ultimately, one does not fully understand the meaning of the events, or even if they actually took place as originally perceived, giving way to a huge variety of interpretations. But such is the human condition, and that is why Bergman feels no need to explain either. Intriguing, mysterious, fascinating. A psychological thriller in its truest form. A jewel of the cinematographic industry. A work of art. I'm grateful I will one day die, having watched Bergman's ""Persona"".",

216,14 August 2018,sanspakeryuksel,10, The Two Personas of the Same Women,"From what I understood, this movie is about the two personas of the same women- the actress and the silent, isolated. Coming to the summer home is a means for this person to deal over the inner conflicts (supposedly unwillingly giving birth to a boy - one side of the women wants to prove she can be the epitome of motherliness and the other not wanting to deal with the responsibilities that arise from having the baby and leaving aside her theatre life.) In reality, this women really loves the theatre, but is also shocked by the love that the boy gives despite her lack of attention. The main reason her inner conflict arises is guilt - due partly to both her neglecting to give attention to her son and the guilt of receiving tenderness and love from his son. She believes that if she does submit to her son's love, she will also feel guilty because she does not deserve it. So, in terms of psychology, she projects the two conflicting sides of her into two characters - the nurse and the silent patient in order to solve these inner conflicts. At the end, I assume, the one and only person being Bibi Andersson, overcomes this inner conflict and supposedly submits to the love of her husband and son. I read reviews where it is the other extent (where the actress persona of the women overcomes the motherliness which I cannot agree with). My reasoning is that the scene where the husband supposedly comes back (we do not know what is real and what is not real {surrealism}) - the women in her mind believes that the motherliness persona has overcome her other persona. When trying to analyze this movie - one has to ignore the beginning plot. Essentially, there is no nurse and there is no patient - the patient is herself and she is trying to cure herself by contemplating over her life at the summer house. Bibi Andersson (assuming this is the real physical copy of the two personas because she is seen going on the bus home) creates this situation of {nurse helping patient} for her to make sense of reality.

With a totally non-standard relationship, where both spend a lot of time together by Dr. Psychologist / Psychiatrist from ELISABETH, in fact they spend all their time one talking and the other listening and we see that what in principle were different people can end up becoming the same.

Perhaps we're witnessing an act of psychic vampirism. In the end, it doesn't matter. There are no barriers. Searching for an explanation only serves to remove the cloud of unknowing that is essential to one of cinema's true masterpieces. Two of the most beautiful faces ever captured on film trapped in a mysterious war of identity. The nature of their existential longing isolated to the sundrenched island where their personalities splinter into reflective shards. There is no better example of black and white cinematography as far as I'm concerned. Bergman and Nykvist create a universe of light and shadow that is nothing short of breathtaking. On my latest revisit, I found myself genuinely unnerved by what I was witnessing and wondered to myself if Persona was the greatest psychological horror film ever made. That's a stupid question, of course. It's simply the greatest film ever made.",

It is the defining film in Bergman's career (although I tend to vote Wild Strawberries as his best), although it received little commercial success in the US, not that many Bergman films do receive much commercial success in the US. The first thing one must remember before seeing Persona is the basic theme behind the film. This is a film that draws more on technique than plot.  As properly put by a previous critic, Persona is to film what Ulysses is to literature. A correct analysis.  Persona's plot seems simple enough: a famous actress loses the ability to speak and a nurse takes care of her.  Simple plot- almost too simple for that is what Bergman intends.  He made Persona as a statement towards art and film.  The true identity of art and how it becomes our lives and encompasses all of what we are.  Aestheticism.  Persona is Bergman's description, and indictment, of aestheticism.  Whatever talent as a filmmaker Bergman lacks (which is not much), he makes up for as a philosopher.  Persona is art. Persona is the anti-art.  Persona is a philosophy about itself and the world.",

231,6 January 2015,natalyseifert,10," Breaking the ""frame"" in Bergman's 'Persona'","It's essential to always believe that what you see on a movie screen is trustworthy. We go to the cinema to watch a movie. We know how to act in this situation. We buy tickets, sit comfortably in the chair and wait until the film grabs us inside its reality. We see a complete product, forgetting about the camera that filmed it for us. We build this ""frame"" (G. Bateson) and play according to the rules until the lights are turned on again. Bergman in 'Persona' on the other hand wants us to know that we are watching a film. He breaks the ""frame"", showing the technical side of a movie. These are the light in the projector, an actual film reel, a boy that touches the screen/camera in front of us, Elisabet (Liv Ullmann) taking picture of us, a cameraman and his team in the last scene. These elements drag us out of the reality of this movie. But why does he do this? Breaking the ""frame"" can be seen as an attempt to make us feel the emotional state of Liv Ullmann's heroine Elisabet. The boy that we seen at the beginning is her son. At first he appears to be dead but suddenly for us he wakes up and starts to interact with the large screen that shows pictures of his mom (the screen shows pictures of both the main heroines but it's not clear whether Alma (Bibi Andersson) and Elisabet are two different people). His mother is on the other side of his reality – in a world where she doesn't have to play anymore. By the time we see another shot of a film reel, the relationship between Alma and Elisabet had reached its peak. Alma knowingly hurts another woman – film burns. When the ""frame"" breaks something goes wrong with the viewer as well. Elizabeth stops speaking with an intention not to lie anymore. She is tired of playing different roles. She doesn't want to sound fake. She breaks almost every ""frame"" therefore we see a film reel.",

And I don't like the sense of directing alone, and I prefer to watch a movie that ends at the end of the storyline. Taking a sequence from two angles and twice with two creative faces was innovative and new in my eyes, but it was also a waste of time, which can be ignored due to the short time of the film.

We didn't even have to turn on the volume, just watching the camera guide us through out the film was enough.  Those of you who never have seen it,  imagine a movie(such as Steel Magnolias, femine based drama, such as Persona).  In this movie the dialogue takes place. In nearly directly middle of the movie it stops, and breaks up.  We see the cast and crew working on it.  We then see a eyeball which we then enter. We are taken back into the movie.

244,10 February 2003,mikehakata,8, identity crisis in the 20th century,"The most lasting feature of Persona is Sven Nykvist's incredibly beautiful low- contrast photography. truly unforgettable, and worth the ticket alone. However, this is also one of the film's failings. The story and the ideas are dwarfed by the images. The story is actually a simple melodrama, based on emotional betrayal. The ideas date the film, since its preoccupation with Existentialism is no longer as relevant now as it was in the Sixties. The concerns of the film don't carry as much weight now, and the fact that the drama takes place apart from the rest of the world is telling. This is a film that speaks to itself. It is a closed world, a beautiful one certainly, but it is not the world of  directors like Ozu, Fellini, Tarkovsky, Bunuel (worlds that speak beyond their time and place). It is not surprising that most of Persona takes place indoors. There is no outside world. The images and sounds of the Vietnam war are so distant, so cold, that they could be of any war. Having said that, Persona works on many levels. It certainly is rich in visual ideas, and it is  has an incredibly controlled rhythm. Any lover of film must see this film, although, on a human level I would recommend Through a Glass Darkly, Cries and Whispers, The Silence more. After watching it, I felt that I had seen a great work of photography, not of Cinema. In fact it was like beautifully shot theatre.",

It is not just a story about two women and the closeness which they encounter in those circumstances, but a lot more than that. Maybe we can see it as psychological pattern of human behavior and reactions in situations, really ordinary and normal but not open enough for discussion. A mixture of such expressions of reality and acting portraying a film that really leaves you breathless. The way it takes the natural lines of the face and puts them in the sight of a camera that can literally eat your fear at any moment makes it that hard to not envision this film as a masterpiece. ",
