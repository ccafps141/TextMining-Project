0,11 January 2003,OttoVonB,10," ""Only when he learned he would die did he start to live!""","Ikiru (""to live"")is a Kurosawa film devoid of samurai or Toshiro Mifune. It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...",/
1,19 May 2004,Quinoa1984,10," a cinematic experience that's a near-nexus of existentialism- life, living, dying, death, and can be done while alive- remarkable","Akira Kurosawa knew how to get in touch with human nature through his art. With his visual expressiveness and storytelling, he could pierce through his subjects, even in his big and occasionally comical samurai films, and find the elemental things do work. What he probably learned off of Rashomon probably helped out with Ikiru (To Live), a story of an old man who finds out he will die within a year, as both stories deal with perceptions of the significance of a life spent and a life wasted. Though that was to a different degree in Rashomon, with Ikiru Kurosawa expands into full-on existentialism. ",r
2,12 October 2009,Hitchcoc,9," The Older You Get, the More It Means","I too have seen all the Samurai films. It was gratifying to watch this tender little film. How would we act if we knew when the end was coming? There are so many terrifying and tender moments in this film. The scenes with the young office mate went from charming to cold-- we knew there was no more than companionship, but she can't really even give him that anymore. The scene when he is about to tell his son about his condition and the young man goes off on a rant about how embarrassingly his father has been acting actually brought me to tears. Of course, it's the price he pays for his cold distance all those years. Then there's the whole bureaucratic nightmare of the office. Even at the wake they don't want to give credit. All the buck passers want a share of his legacy. Maybe families who are living on the edge should watch this movie. Even after more than 50 years, it wears extremely well.",e
3,16 December 2004,The_Void,8, Complex and thought-provoking masterpiece,"Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life's limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe, the most unlikely 'hero' of all time. He works in a dreary city office, where nothing happens and it's all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring, which has lead to him being nicknamed 'The Mummy' by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years, and now that he's learned that his life has a limit; it's time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.",v
4,2 February 2017,lee_eisenberg,10," death exposes life and bureaucracy, showing why Kurosawa was one of the greatest","Any film buff is bound to have heard of Akira Kurosawa, and likely knows his most famous movies (""Rashomon"", ""Seven Samurai"", etc). But there's a lesser known one that's just as good. 1952's ""Ikiru"" focuses on the approaching death of government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe, and how it turns into a quest for his life's meaning. After an introduction in which the protagonist's cancer gets addressed - complete with an X ray of it - we see a sequence where several people try to bring attention to a cesspool that they want cleared, but the sheer level of bureaucracy prevents any action (and Japan is supposed to be the most well run country in the world). But probably the most important scene is at the Watanabe's wake. The attendees are supposed to praise him, but one person addresses an unpleasant topic and gets chastised by his peers. Even as these men vow to live their lives with the same dedication that the deceased did, it's clear that the bureaucracy will continue to plague their lives.",i
5,11 June 2004,Serge_Zehnder,10, To Live in Death,"Probably one of the most difficult aspects a film like ""Ikiru"" has to overcome is the very rough march of time. To actually find someone these days, let's say a crowd of regular movie-goers to sit down and watch a film about an old Japanese man dying of cancer would be too much to ask.",e
6,21 October 2002,will_butler,10, The most moving and human film I have ever seen.,"I can safely say that I have seen no finer film than Kurosawa's true masterpiece, Ikiru.  The story of a dying petty bureaucrat in 1950's Japan, Ikiru is as uncompromisingly honest and beautiful a film as has ever been made on the subject of life.  Kurosawa elevates a story that could have been simple melodrama to the level of masterwork with a genuine love of his characters, and with an incredible technical direction.  The film's structure accentuates and deepens its many, many lessons on life, and the performances, including a heartbreakingly earnest turn by Shimura are all flawless.",w
7,17 June 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Kurasawa's most moving film,"As a great fan of Akira Kurasawa, Ikiru is not just Kurasawa's most moving film it is one of his very finest alongside Seven Samurai and Ran. It is as always beautifully made, sumptuous in look and the cinematography simple yet interesting. Kurasawa's direction is at its most delicate, making a story that could easily be mawkish and manipulative into a genuinely moving, powerful and quite inspiring one instead, and making us also care every step of the way for the dignified central character of Watanabe. Together with a hypnotic score, a thought-provoking script and a powerful, yet in a discreet and heart-wrenching way, lead performance from Takeshi Shimura, and you have a fantastic film.",/

Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a clerk who has been living a dull, unsatisfying life working in the government's offices who is diagnosed with cancer and is given one year to live. He tries to enjoy his days by picking up a former co-worker (Miki Odagiri) and taking her out on the town. She finally convinces him that this is not the way to spend the rest of his life. He soon realizes that he has a strong desire to do something with his life so that it will not have been a total waste.

13,5 January 2014,tomgillespie2002,10, Kurosawa's greatest achievement,"As difficult as some Japanese films can be, Akira Kurosawa was always welcomed by Western audiences due to the director's embracing of the cinematic, as opposed to, say, the static, conversation-heavy work of Yasujiro Ozu. Still known primarily for his samurai action films and his film noir homages, Kurosawa's movies were action-packed and grandiose, shot beautifully through a lens that brings to mind the great American westerns or the shadowy mise-en-scene of Orson Welles, making them almost Western in tone. Ikiru, one of Kurosawa's most spiritual and tonally dark films, took a few years to make it across Pacific Ocean, and it's not hard to see why. Although, in my opinion, this is probably Kurosawa's greatest achievement, the subject matter is sobering, it's satire alarming and it's story-telling techniques unconventional.",7

But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" (To Live), 1952, is one of them. The film of rare humanity, profoundly moving and often funny ""Ikiru"" tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph, the best thing he had ever done in his life; something he will be remembered for. The film reveals both absurdity of life and the ability of man to find meaning in it through selfless action.",2

The pacing is lethargic throughout, but the film practically comes to a halt during the wake scene of the last hour. After the central character dies, it drags on for nearly an hour. As is usually the case with Kurosawa, he has his cast engage in theatrical acting. Perpetually wide-eyed and depressed, Shimura mumbles his lines while barely opening his mouth or moving his lips. It's a one-dimensional performance that saps the film of whatever potential it had. On the other hand, Odagiri is charming as a young lady who's everything Shimura is not: good-humored and spirited, enjoying life to the fullest.",=

And usually the first thing to come to mind, especially in case of lives as Watanabe's, is our regrets. It is good that even one action can undo all those regrets. The film is painfully real. Also it is unbelievable to see that the political regime has not changed even after all those years.

27,20 February 2007,Andy-296,5, Overrated,"This 1952 film by Akira Kurosawa, about a civil servant learning he has terminal stomach cancer, and trying to do something socially meaningful in the last months of his life to redeem his boring and uneventful life, has become a bit overrated. Some people has even called this film a masterpiece. The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer. Realistic movies were not Kurosawa's forte. One cannot help but notice that at about the same time Ikiru came out such directors as Ozu and Naruse were making much stronger, fluid and unmawkish movies dealing with the everyday life in postwar Japan.",u

29,18 September 2021,briancham1994,5, Extremely slow and empty,"This tedious plodder of a film attempts to express some touching and philosophical truths about the meaning of one's life, told through the story of an old bureaucrat who is dying of stomach cancer. However, the result is very thin and feels empty. There are a few moments that hint at something deeper, like the episodes with the man at the bar, the young woman and his own son. The reminiscence of the song from his youth is definitely a memorable scene. However, these get repetitive and don't add up to much. By the end, we've been served a trite idea that life is short, fleeting pleasures aren't the way to live and true service to others can give us meaning. If only it didn't take two and a half hours to get there (especially the incessant praise from his drunken colleagues which padded the runtime to no effect).",v
30,21 March 2011,Eternality,7, The second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first.,"Looking back at Akira Kurosawa's impressive fifty-year career in filmmaking, it's impossible to determine which film was his best.

And I mean impressive not as a melodrama, as a Russian pastiche, for murky sentimental reasonsbut as a radically achieved worksomething radically valid and achieved. It has vision; this is obvious from the first frame, or from the very beginning; also, it signals itself as the movie of someone who sets himself up for something.",
32,30 March 2019,alansabljakovic-39044,10, Pure art,Akira Kurosawa does it again and I really didn't expect Ikiru to become one of my favorite films. Kurosawa nails the point of death and cancer to ordinary human being. This film shows everything wrong with institutions and how we treat each other. Kurosawa is the best director ever to walk this Earth. The lead actor played Watanabe so perfectly well that Oscar is nothing for him. The score from the start of the movie is so incredible and strong that I can't describe it. This is must watch for every movie lover out there. Total masterpiece.,
33,22 November 2007,Steffi_P,10," ""Misfortune has its good side  misfortune leads to truth""","The majority of film directors seem to have more trouble getting to grip with directing emotion than they do with acting, and often ability to convey poignancy is a sign of a director's maturity.

There were any number of points in the latter part of the story when it could have, maybe even should have ended, and it managed to drone on with one bureaucrat after another opining on Watanabe's (Takashi Shimura) role in establishing the children's park in Kuroe. At least the payoff there was cleverly done; when all the administrators fell well under the influence of their Saki, it was at that point they were able to think clearly, and admire Watanabe's ability to work outside the system where protecting one's turf was the primary objective.",

I had read Roger Ebert?s wonderful commentary at his ""The Great Movies"" page and told myself many times that I must get it and never quite got around to it.  I had purchased ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Hidden Fortress"" and found both of them delightful.  The former is probably the greatest action movie ever made and the latter has scenes as intense as anything modern directors ever put on celluloid.  But somehow while I figured Ikiru to be more my type of movie than any of the samurai flicks, I still held off buying it.

51,12 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,10, Masterpiece,"Ikiru (To Live), by Akira Kurosawa, is sort of a 'lost' film. No, it was never really lost, but it is unlike the archetypal Kurosawa film Western audiences think of him making, and thereby lost in his canon. It is not some historical epic filled with honor, samurais, and swordplay. It is more in line with the genre of retrospective life films in the vein of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane or Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, in that we drop in the on the life of an ordinary man- in this case lifelong low level Tokyo city bureaucrat office head Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a few months before his death by stomach cancer, and witness how this 'living mummy', as his co-workers chide him (one of the nicer things they say about him), reclaims meaning in a life long since blanched of it.

It's really a pity that most cinema lovers today will never take the time to watch this masterpiece from one of the greatest directors ever. Honestly, I myself was very skeptical about this movie and felt that it would be very sad & sappy. For once i'm actually glad to have been proved wrong. While some would say that the movie should've had a faster pace, i feel that the slow pace compliments the storyline really well. Ikiru is one of those films that make us realize the value of the things that we take for granted.

53,28 June 2005,joel-280,10, A Kurasawa masterwork,"Superb acting, camera work, cutting, blending of past and present -- Kurasawa and his team take what could be a hokey, sentimental story and create a masterpiece about (sorry to be so trite, but...) the meaning of life. It may be a bit far fetched but this movie recalled to my mind Homer's Odyssey, in the sense that it too is about ""doing the right thing"" -- honor -- heroic response to challenge. In the case of the movie, this is set in a banal, ""everyman"" context of the timid petty bureaucrat Watanabi. The B&W photography, perhaps not deliberately since that was still common in the early '50s, emphasizes the metaphorical aspects of the story.",

While filmed very much in the style of the post-war Italian neo-realists, the narrative feels more like a ""fable"" designed for moral edification.

56,9 August 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6, Strong lead performance and writing turn this into a quality watch,"""Ikiru"" is a Japanese movie from 1952, so already over 65 years old directed by Akira Kurosawa and he is also one of the writers here. This one's in black-and-white not too surprising for the year or for the filmmaker. Also at easily over two hours it is a common running time for Kurosawa and far from his longest. But you should not expect an eastern movie here in the traditional sense of swordfighting, which is what maybe made Kurosawa most famous when he elaborated on samurai. This one we have here is much more current and human from beginning to end and actually the story depicted in here could also somewhat take place like this in the year 2019. I'll get into detail about that later. First of all I would like to mention lead actor Takashi Shimura here who has worked with Kurosawa on other occasions. And he scored a BAFTA nomination for his turn here, which is really really unusual from a certain perspective, namely that he got nominated no less than eight years after this film was released originally, now that is a long time. Funnily before his nomination for Ikiru he was also nominated for another BAFTA for another more famous Kurosawa film that was released two years after this one. Release dates can be strange if films are involved from countries/regions that are far away from the western world.",

This is a brilliant film from an incredible filmmaker and I honestly can't recommend it enough. It's a celebration of life alongside death, for the two cannot exist without each other. This is a film that preaches one of the greater truths I've seen displayed in cinema: live a good life and your death won't be meaningless.

58,5 April 2000,gga,10, Kurosawa's overlooked masterpiece,"There's no doubt that Kurosawa was one of the best storytellers of the 20th century, appreciated by critics and audiences alike. Still, when mentioning his greatest achievements, most people place ""Rashomon"", ""Ran"" and ""The Seven Samurai"" as his most notable pieces.  Only a few will remember this little film that has so much more significance than those others. ""Ikiru"" is a movie that can bring you to tears with very little manipulation.  It's a movie you will not forget, a life lesson.  It's a movie that will forever change how you think about movies.  It is a social criticism.  It is a discourse on bureaucracy. Improving on Rashomon's non-linear way of storytelling, this is a film that forces you to pay attention.  There are no samurai fights here.  There are no melodramatic dialogues where characters scream at the top of their lungs. There are no forced tears in the character's cheeks. This is a movie of very subtle, inner conflict, with a very simple premise: What would you do if you had three months to live? Kurosawa's answer is so devastatingly powerful, smart and original that it will change you forever.  Or maybe, it won't, proving that the director's pessimistic view of humanity was correct.",
59,13 March 2014,Leofwine_draca,6," Poignant, heartfelt, slow","An epic-length movie sure to test the patience of most viewers weaned on modern, short-attention-span fare, IKIRU is a very different change of pace for Akira Kurosawa in comparison to his period samurai action films. It's a slow, poignant and utterly heartfelt tale about a bureaucrat who discovers he has terminal cancer. The film takes that as a starting point and we the viewer proceed to watch as he undergoes a journey of discovery.",
60,29 April 2020,ma-cortes,7," A big story of a little man which will grip your soul , being Kurosawa's masterpiece which created a sensation in the United States","One of the Great Films of Our Time and heartbreaking drama dealing with a humble civil servant (Takashi Shimura , who is superb in the central character as an intrinsic noble public official) who suffers cancer , following a drunken bout of panic , aimless wandering and odd encounters on learning that he is dying ; eventually discovers a meaning to his empty life patiently pushing through a project to become a city dump into a kiddies' playground , though at the end the sense of desolation remains complete .What can a heart filled with despair grab on to? This isn't it. It isn't here either. I want to do something. There is something I must do. Frivolous human beings who only contemplate the meaning of life when suddenly faced with death.",
61,28 July 2014,dee.reid,10," ""Ikiru"" means ""to live""...","There is something to be said about the five-decade-long career of the late Japanese cinematic master craftsman Akira Kurosawa. I've only seen a few of his master-works, but every film I have seen of his is a brilliant, breathtaking exercise in cinematic master craftsmanship. Case in point: his 1952 dramatic masterpiece ""Ikiru"" (which when translated from Japanese, means ""to live"").",

64,13 December 2005,EUyeshima,8, A Life Unfulfilled Poignantly Observed by Kurosawa at His Quietest,"I wonder if it's a coincidence that Yasujiro Ozu's 1953 ""Tokyo Story"" and this 1952 masterwork from Akira Kurosawa were released just months apart in Japan, as both deal with the disappointments between parents and children in similarly penetrating ways. It's likely that post-WWII Japan, especially after the Allied occupation ended in 1951, saw an overall deterioration of the family unit as Western influences took hold of the socioeconomic structure. This one goes even further in adding local government bureaucracy as a key factor in diminishing the self-worth of those who sacrificed their lives in meaningless jobs. A particularly effective sequence early in the film involves the local bureau's reaction to a proposal to build a park with each department representative claiming that its hands are tied and passing the buck to another department in ceaseless red tape.",
65,4 August 2005,seventhsamurai1954,10, Heartbreaking,"As a person that can boast about having seen over 3,000 films, I have to say that Ikiru ranks up there in the top five. It is a story about a man that has to face what most humans fear to even talk about the most: death. It is his journey to cherish the last days of his life that he felt he took for granted all these years. Ikiru is only one of two films that I have ever cried to. Kurasawa makes you feel for this man with the greatest empathy. He takes you into the movie and really makes you question what life is all about and the importance of it. I close this review by saying this: if you only have to see five films in your entire life, let Ikiru be one of them.",
66,13 December 2008,valleyjohn,9, Masterful!,In the last three months i have discovered the films of Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa. Thanks to some superb recommendations my movie watching experiences has been broadened and enlightened . Kurosawa's is a masterful story teller and although his films aren't perfect they leave an indelible mark on your brain that will forever be there. Ikiru is my favourite of his films that i have seen so far and i urge anyone who is thinking about discovering Akira Kurosawa's movies to make this one the first. ,
67,17 September 2001,BenGW1,9, An extraordinary film about an ordinary man,"IKIRU is a great film, and a universal one as well. It could translate to any society where there are individuals who live their lives in jobs that are meaningless, who have little personal joy, who don't really know how to enjoy the blessing of life that they have. They won't die homeless but they often die alone and unrecognized. The message of IKIRU is amazing in that it's about the difference one man can make without being preachy or contrived. ",
68,28 April 2019,daryopeek,10, A simple and moving picture about life and live,"A great picture. Ikiru leaves me in silence when it ends, a genuinely moving film. The depiction about life and death, in any genre possible, has been done in so many ways, but who thought that a simple drama could change it all?",
69,16 October 2015,The_TJT,5, Ikiru - Doesn't quite live up to its reputation,"Can't say I agree with critical acclaim for Ikiru, all critics seem to be in perfect unison that it's a masterpiece. Perhaps, but also a very tedious one.",
70,11 August 2007,GyatsoLa,10, swinging,"I first saw part of this movie in unusual circumstances - while eating noodles with a friend in a Japanese restaurant. It was playing (no sound) in the background on the opposite side of the restaurant. I couldn't keep my eyes off it (no offense to my friend), especially the scene where the main character is dragged on a tour of the night hot spots of post war Tokyo. The editing and photography was dazzling - I knew immediately it had to be Kurosawa, and I had to see the movie. At the time, i was only interested in seeing his samurai and historic epics.",
71,25 October 2002,knuddelholic,10, A timeless classic about values and meaning of life,"All right, I have to confess in advance that I might be called prejudice as I think that Akira Kurosawa is one of the great moviemakers ever as he is an artist.",
72,3 July 2021,gab-14712,9, Kurosawa's Most Intimate Film!,"Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru is an emotional, moving portrait of what it is like to live life. This film really makes you ponder about your life. It asks simple, but important questions such, ""What are you doing with your life?"" Honestly, this film made me contemplate my own life and made some important changes. You only live once, so let's live the best life you can. Based on reviews I have seen from all different ages, this film truly resonated with everyone. Even though Kurosawa constantly mentions death or cancer, this movie never truly felt depressing. I felt happy for the main character because he was finding the will to live despite the diagnosis of terminal cancer. The film is a robust two-and-a-half hours, but you never feel the time passing by thanks to Kurosawa's steady direction, strong visuals and camerawork, and a humane story that invests your mind. Also, Takashi Shimura's performance spoke to me on many levels.",
73,8 March 2021,montferrato,5, Long Moralistic Tale,"Overrated, as many movies from Kurosawa. It is very long, the performance of the lead actor is not the best. A lot of Moralistic interference. It looks like a Frank Capra movie. Some people like this type of stories. I prefer doing the judgement myself, instead of being administered "" Moraline Pills"".",
74,20 May 2001,Dark Eye,10, There will be no film like this one ever again,"Anyone who is lucky enough to watch this beautiful masterpiece and not be touched must be made of stone.  Such is the genius of Kurosawa who didn't held anything back, as he shot every scene lovingly and truthfully.  A truly profound experience.",
75,21 September 2010,KnightsofNi11,8, Fact: Akira Kurosawa was a genius,"It's no surprise that this is another beautiful film from legendary Akira Kurosawa. Only this time we move away from the samurai genre and move into modern (1952) times. Ikiru is about a bureaucrat in the city office named Kanji Watanabe. He has worked in the same building, at the same desk, with the same papers for over 30 years. And then one day he finds out he has terminal stomach cancer, left with only six months to live. Upon learning this, Watanabe reflects on his life, coming to the realization that he has no close ties to friends or family. His life is empty. In the six months he has left, Watanabe attempts to fill his life with the things he never experienced in his dull life. From the get-go we expect a strong centralized character development story, and Kurosawa delivers just such a thing in his own beautiful aesthetic.",
76,24 December 2013,aamilsyed,10, A classic and a masterful work of art.,"There's little that I need to say about Akira Kurosawa, one of the greatest film-makers to have walked the earth. This is perhaps his simplest and most stirring movie. A simple setting, a very straightforward story line and very real characters. There was nothing extraordinary about this movie, except the journey that it will take you on.",

78,1 August 2019,filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,10, IS THERE LIFE BEFORE DEATH?,"The big concern of movie reviewers, which is to play spoilers, seems inevitable in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, which begins with an x-ray of the story's protagonist's stomach and a warning that ""at this point, he still doesn't know he has cancer"".",
79,15 November 2015,SnoopyStyle,8, compelling everyman,Kanji Watanabe is a widowed bureaucrat as the city's public affairs section chief. The bureaucratic machine has ground any ambition out of him. He has slowly climbed up the ladder by doing nothing and therefore doing nothing wrong. He discovers that he has stomach cancer and probably only six months to live. He is lost. He doesn't go to work and takes out his life savings. His son is shocked. He spends a wild night with a writer but he feels empty. He spends some time with a young exuberant female staffer. Eventually he decides to make a difference through his work.,
80,8 January 2006,jdoan-4,10, How shall we than live?,"I suppose it isn't truly a spoiler to say the main character, Watanabe, dies of cancer at the end of the film. For most directors, this probably would have been a overly sentimental death drama. Kurosawa is far to talented and sophisticated for such triteness. This is a rich, meaningful, touching story of a man's attempt to live. The themes of this film are so universal, we can access it even 50 years after its release. Several good films have been made along similar themes. ""Wild Strawberries"" is one of the best. I have not seen ""Umberto D."", but I understand it is very similar. Bergman and Kirusawa are very similar filmmakers. Bergman seems to me to be more metaphorical and Kirusawa is more aesthetic. They are both superb writers/directors. ""Ikiru"" is a heavy layered film. After listening to the commentary on the Criterion Edition, you learn that this film makes many significant social comments on Japanese life. At the same time, as I said earlier, the emotions and themes of this film are ubiquitous. You don't have to possess a knowledge of 1950s Japanese politics to understand it. You simply have to be human and possess a desire to live a meaningful life. There are many images from the film that linger with you. Kirusawa, like Bergman and Hitchcock, was so good a composition. His films are so visually active that you can know everything you need to know without the dialogue. However, the dialogue is simple and very effective. The characters talk the way normal people talk, yet the say things normal people don't say. That to me is great dialogue. I was disappointed in the film stock from which the DVD came. It was not in good condition. That is a real shame. I am not sure why that is. Criterion does great work with the classics. They must not have been able to obtain anywhere near pristine stock. This is such a beautiful film. It would great to see it from the original negatives.",
81,11 August 2020,ssssgelojun,9, IKiru,"""Maiden, let's fall in love and not waste time.""
In every corner of the earth, there is a terrible and precious thing, that is time.
Everyone has it, but everyone wastes it!
We put off doing what we want to do for survival, career, family. In the end, we ask ourselves what have we gained? Only to find that we had wasted our time with empty hands.
Do what you want to do and don't give yourself any excuses.
Love thyself, not for thy son's sake;
Don't stop for fear of losing your place;
Don't let work stop you from enjoying yourself.
""Fall in love now, maiden.""
Now is the best time to let your fears stop you.
Right now, do whatever comes to mind!",
82,2 December 1999,Tim-230,10, Kurosawa's symphony to the lived life,"After seeing this wonderful film for only the second time in thirty-five years, I was reminded of how much it resembles Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich.  Both stories are efforts to grapple with the the imminence of death when it finally arrives for a believably human person who touches us deeply because we so readily recognize our own weaknesses and strengths in his. Much in both stories can also be connected with theories on death developed later by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.",
83,15 January 2002,poe426,10, Bittersweet...,"The remarkable Takashi Shimura takes center stage in this bittersweet tale of a minor official whose life in microcosm is the drudgery of maintaining the status quo. In the capable hands of the greatest filmmaker of the twentieth century, Watanabe's story slowly unfolds and we are along for the ride. It's a one way ride, to be sure (there are no easy answers here, and Watanabe is cast adrift like a man stunned by the hammer), and Kurosawa never loses focus, never flinches; never opts for an easy out; we FEEL for this man who must come to terms with his own mortality (which he does, in break-your-heart fashion). There are lessons to be learned here, for all of us must (at some point in our lives) learn ""to live...""",

The family standards, even though we have achieved a lot with each generation, we maybe have achieved that on expense of family ties. The wall between the relations is so large we dont even bear to look at it. Sometimes I wonder is it worth it. The system is so broken that you cannot change it from inside. Always the people who takes credit for doing nothing. The vermin of the society. It also leaves you with the question, will your life be any different if you knew you have some months left? So whats stopping you from living that life. The tears are so real, you fall to your knees. Having achieved what one dreamt of? How does it feel! So many more words to say...",

In the final analysis, a director -- even the greatest one who ever lived -- is never so manipulative as when he chooses a cancer victim for the subject of his film. We all know someone who has, or has had, cancer, and we all know just how horrible it can be for those it strikes.  Therefore, Kurosawa has already plunged the knife in our hearts from the first frame, which shows us an X-ray of our protagonist's cancerous stomach.  All Kurosawa has to do from here on out is twist the handle.",
86,9 April 2010,TheUnknown837-1,7, a movie I shall undoubtedly come to understand and cherish more and more as I grow older,"Some people consider ""Ikiru"" (""To Live"") as the greatest movie that Japanese director Akira Kurosawa ever made. And remember, this is the same man who also directed acclaimed masterworks such as ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Yojimbo,"" and ""Rashomon."" Many of Kurosawa's movies also touched on a human level amongst their scenes of gritty, visceral violence and the brilliance of ""Ikiru"" is that its emotional levels outscore all of those without one clip of actual, physical barbarism unless you count a death threat scene near the end of the picture.",

The topic in question here is Akira Kurosawa – hereafter referred to as the ""lesser"" Kurosawa, primarily because when one hears the name Kurosawa one should immediately think of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who is superior in almost every respect to this ""lesser"" Kurosawa, a director artificially propped up on an undeserving pedestal by a group of disillusioned followers. Sure, he had one solid film in Seven Samurai (1954), but every time I see his other movies I wonder how the hell anyone could think that this guy was a great director. It befuddles me, even though I am a huge fan of other directors from the same time period.",

92,18 November 2005,ShiiStyle,10, A modern version of a timeless theme,"Ikiru is unafraid to set itself in contemporary Japan, with the modern threats of bureaucracy and sloth (as opposed to The Seven Samurai, which was guised in a historical setting). The characters are more recognizable and real to the viewer because of this, and Kurosawa exploits their personalities to the fullest. We have the novelist, who can comment on everything but practice nothing; the businessmen, who do their jobs; and the young and vibrant girl, who just lives, and doesn't even understand how Watanabe can envy her. This movie is one of a very few that leave a lasting impression behind, and push the viewer to further pursuits. What is motivation? Is it possible to meet Watanabe's standard, or your own, without the threat of death directly in front of you? Few other movies can express this theme so realistically.",

Classic form structure: the first half of the mummy alone to find the meaning of life, the second half of sublimation after quietly overlooking the death of all living beings (and thus the meaning of life and death from the individual to the whole society), as if the order of death and life reversed, and the theme.

It just might be...,"A terminally ill civil worker lives out his last 6 months as a changed man, with a new found urge to live as he realises his life has been wasting away for the past 30 years. In other words, he was a mummy; a corpse. Sitting on the same desk everyday, looking busy but not accomplishing anything of substance. This film really touched a nerve with me although you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it. I could especially relate to Watanabe sacrificing his own life for his motherless son, something my dad had to do when my mother passed. One scene that especially moved me was when he requested a song at a bar, and to everyone's surprise he started singing it himself. Similarly, the scene near the end where he was on a swing, singing the same haunting song, was heart wrenching. For the last quarter of the film, after Watanabe has died, we witness his wake as various co-workers discuss his life and piece together what made him change so drastically. Through the scenes at the wake, Kurosawa manages to provide an excellent critique of bureaucracy in post-war Japan but we also get to see how others viewed Watanabe through their rose tinted glasses. A masterpiece, and quite possibly, Kurosawa's best film.",

It's about that hole that suddenly emerges when our time inevitably draws to an end, that hole that we couldn't fill with meaning. For the old civil servant Kanji Watanabe (played by one of Kurosawa's favorites, Takashi Shimura) it's a pretty big hole. He moved papers around for years and years in his stuffy office, got awards for the monotony he got used to, never questioned what he did and why, was satisfied with what he was and never got the idea to change. But he is ultimately alone when he understands that he will die soon.

99,16 December 2012,maximkong,10, Cannot afford the time to hate this movie - A timeless masterpiece!,"Along with Red Beard, Ikiru still stands amongst my all-time top favourite movie, and it has proved me wrong for underestimating classics just because of the fear of being outdated and dull as the movie is over 50 years old. The script, the acting, the direction, the cinematics..and...most importantly, its level of depth is equal to even the most thought-provoking movies of all time. Utterly deep, depressing, sentimental, but inspiring, positive and life-changing...as a classic they don't even need an epic sad music score or narration to deliver the message. Many movies emulated Ikiru in terms of the issue and involving older actors that somehow had their characters reminiscing some parts of their pasts that they regret, or looking towards the remainder parts of their lives with sentimentality, but none of these hit the spot as well as Ikiru did. I will never forget the main character's words, when he said 'i cannot afford time to hate people' it just forced my tears to flow right away..powerful!

There have been few films that explain what is like to be old and alone as well as this film does. Only DeSica's ""Umberto D"" and Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" even come near it psychologically. Kurosawa's hero is more than a passive observant, regretful of the life that has passed them by. Here the civil-servant is hell-bent on living the life that he might have had, had he the courage to live. Has there ever been anything in cinema as touching and pathetic as this old man's attraction to the simple, self-absorbed and not too bright office worker whom he befriends and entertains only to be rejected by her as a creep. Emil Jannings in ""Blue Angel"" gets caught in the net of self-hatred and self-abuse, but Kurosawa's hero learns from what's left of life, moves on and does something positive, only to die without due credit for his act. It is a supremely ironic story, devoid of sentimentality. Has there even been a Western director who has told the story of old age with such clear-eyed honesty???",

And while Seven Samurai -- a far more popular film, if IMDB rating totals are a useful indicator -- now seems a touch predictable, even tedious, Ikiru was as compelling as before. (I don't dismiss my advancing age may be a factor.) The one element that didn't ring TOTALLY true was a Japanese bureaucracy dedicated to accomplishing nothing. After all, the movie was produced in the middle of postwar Japan achieving an historic national recovery in record time. But it could also be argued that -- as the movie shows -- this bureaucracy was responsive to corporate and powerful interests and not the public good. At any rate, scene after scene is a pleasure, and I found the ending well conceived and executed. Essential viewing.",

He can't stop it. What can he do with the time he has left? For thirty years he's worked in one of those Kafkaesque bureaucracies where everyone is buried in sheafs of papers. The shelves are full of binders and folders. The desks overflow with petitions. And when a citizen's committee of poor housewives show up to complain about a sewer in their neighborhood -- it smells terrible, the water tastes awful, it breeds mosquitoes, the children are sick -- they get shuffled from one minor bureaucrat to another, from the Parks Department to Pest Control to Sewage Disposal to the Transit Authority, until they wind up where they started.

While the details of ""modern Japan"" depicted in the film are from around 50 years ago, the content and message are just as relevant for today's audience.  Perhaps more relevant than ever. This is NOT a ""feel good"" film.  There is no Hollywood happy ending, no easy resolution of the conflict portrayed.  The director and prime author, Akira Kurosawa, is very passionate about how people need to wake up and get out of the ruts they have fallen into and perhaps have followed for decades.  He also is astute to the limitations people may have or have set up for themselves, how such limitations blind them to what goes on around them, how becoming more aware of such things and of possibilities outside their limitations can be so painful and hard to grasp, and, sadly, how often they are not grasped or acted on at all. Real life is on display in this film. The film is structured as a two part invention with a coda, to borrow musical terms.  Both parts deal with discovery.  The first part, besides introducing almost all the characters and setting up the plot mechanics (very economically done!), shows how the protagonist, a long time city government employee and low level manager, comes to realize (indirectly!) that he doesn't have long to live, shows how he (in several, painful missteps and poor communication) comes to terms with the situation, and what he decides to do with the remaining time left. This part is lively, bounces around from scene to scene, jarring the viewer with new scenes, situations and points of view that keeps one concentrating on what comes next.  They are filled with irony.  With so much activity occurring in the moment, the viewer is not given time to get caught up in bathos or maudlin sentiments. The second part reveals the Japanese way for reflecting on the life of ""the recently departed.""  It is very regimented with the most important people positioned closest to the memorial, with those of lower status trailing away from it.  It is typical for the comments about the deceased to be cool, measured, not completely laudatory at first.  After a few drinks of sake, when people loosen up and become less inhibited, praise for the individual begins to appear, then take over the talk or conversation.  It is in this setting, with these rituals and conventions in mores, where Kurosawa's sense of irony and rage (outrage?) are ratcheted up further.  For all of them are trying in their own way to understand what the protagonist accomplished and what was his motivation.  He had become a mystery to them during his last months of life and want to solve that mystery, especially after the citizens of the district - whose focus was the deceased's last public act - enter to pay their respects.  (It is an amazing scene to behold, which must be seen, savored and internalized.)  The viewer wants to know what happened as well.  Stories are told (and acted out for the viewer) which demonstrate that what was said early in the wake clearly did not do justice to deceased.  This section is much more static, and greatly, subtly depends on what the viewer has seen in the first part. The coda shows who understands the mystery and reveals how life can be so frustrating and miserable along with its possibilities.  The irony and rage are at their highest fever pitch in these few short final scenes. Within this structure and plot, Kurosawa is able to touch on many aspects basic to modern life.  They include: office politics, social status, the generation gap, poor communication, youthful aspirations, parental aspirations, gossip, children living at home, group dynamics. In addition, he shows specifics of Japanese culture of the early 1950's: American influence (music, shows, though no Americans are seen in the film), third world medical practices, wakes, proper gestures and bowing, etc.  All these aspects are shown in context, are not unduly emphasized, and make their nonchalant contribution to the plot.  Viewing the film with these in mind becomes a richer experience. By making this film, Kurosawa shows how the world could be altered and made better, that the status quo can be overcome.  Yet it also shows, when someone embodies such attitudes in his/her life, how they can be so easily misunderstood and, worse, readily ignored by others.  It demonstrates how so much effort is often required to accomplish so little in return.  Life as it is has never been portrayed any better than in this marvelous, extraordinary film. Quite simply, it is the greatest film ever made. Technical notes: This film was made in 1952 by Toho and it shows in the poor sound quality (the shot of the protagonist heading home from the doctor's office being a special, wonderful exception), the shakiness of certain images, and the overall wear of the print.  The negative for the film does not exist; it was destroyed in a fire.  The film cries out for restoration, but it would be a costly undertaking.  The film is 141 minutes long on the video, not 143 as printed.  The English subtitles on the video are from the 1960 Brandon Films release.  They need to be revised: there are some scenes where important information is not translated.",
110,16 May 2020,jamesrupert2014,10," Poignant, melancholy end-of-life parable","Senior bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) searches for meaning and purpose in life after finding out that he has only a few months to live. Kurosawa's film is a beautiful, sad masterpiece and Takashi Shimura is excellent as the soft-spoken man who belatedly realises that his life has become meaningless. The film is structured episodically as first Watanabe and a dissipated writer (Yunosuke Ito) explore the seamier side of Tokyo's nightlife, finding no answer in there, he spends time with a vivacious young co-worker (Miki Odagiri) whose joy in life he admires but ultimately cannot be part of, and finally the development of the children's park, in which he finally finds solace and meaning. Kurosawa expertly switches from linear narrative to a flashback structure halfway through the film, and viewers move from Watanabe's perspective to those of his bureaucratic co-workers, as they drink sake at his wake and discuss the changes in the man over his dying days. The scenes of the increasingly drunk men reminiscing are similar to the director's earlier classic Rashomon (1950), as each man tells an aspect of the story from a different perspective. Kurosawa also uses the film to skewer a stultified Japanese bureaucracy, especially self-serving public 'servants' and their sycophants, the wasteful redundancy and resulting zealous turf-guarding, and the endless, worthless 'busywork'. The final scene of Watanabe, serene and satisfied, is beautiful. A flawless, timeless classic.",
111,14 February 2007,jrf2,10, My favorite Kurosawa film,"Sandwiched in between the international breakthrough of Rashomon and the momentous Seven Samurai, Ikiru is a smaller, more personal film from the master. It's an involving meditation on humanity, isolation, and change. Poor Watanabe is diagnosed with terminal cancer and must find some meaning in his life, something that will give it value before time runs out. Unlike Rashomon or Samurai, this picture is set in a more modern Japan, post WWII, instantly making it more relatable, even to those foreign to Japanese culture. The film is almost two and half hours, but Watanabe is so sympathetic that you can't take your eyes off his almost pathetic figure, even when the film shifts to others' perspectives in the second half. This film is highly recommended for all fans of excellent cinema!",
112,10 May 2012,Koundinya,10, To leave and yet 'To Live',"One of Akira Kurosawa's brilliantly-directed films. Kanji, Chief of Public Affairs, is a hard-working man who spares no time for leisure throughout his career. He's a cagey, aging man who is the butt of jokes in his office. He gets diagnosed with cancer and that leaves him shell-shocked. The scene after he leaves the hospital is where Kurosawa's true direction comes into play. He has brilliantly shown a dejected, depressed Kanji walking in the streets, lost in oblivion. The sepulchral silence is interrupted by the honking of a truck and Kanji snaps back to reality. Kanji leaves his home trying to find the meaning of life. He enjoys all the earthly pleasures instead of succumbing to the fact that he would die soon. He doesn't let the cancer make him immobile and his brain quiescent. He approves a long-pending project of setting up a park that would improve the lives of the people living with poor sanitation facilities. He not only approves the project as the Chief of Public Affairs, but also makes sure every single department concerned with and involved in the project nod their heads for the project. He endures the pain and ensures work on the park is done and finally dies on a bench in the park. After his death, his co-workers and family members discuss how and what brought a change in the behavior of Kanji. They first assume he was unaware of the fact that he had cancer. But after detailed discussion and citing of instances, everyone agree he did know that he had cancer and yet fought for the betterment of the lives of slum-dwellers. They think better of him after his death and take him as an inspiration.",

119,12 September 2009,gentendo,9, Live the Cosmic Wow Right Now,"Our leadsman in Ikiru, Kanji Watanabe, is an older, exhaustive looking man caught up in the rat race of everyday, robotic living. Exuberance stripped, joy absent, utterly banal. It is only when he learns he's contracted an incurable stomach cancer that he begins to suffer from an existential crisis, plagued by frustration and the dread of approaching death. His language becomes almost ineffable, his soul harrowed up with an array of unwanted emotions, his memory elusive and soon to ""vanish away."" Realizing his life is near expired and with no significant contributions etched into the hallmark of the living, something inside him changes; the instinctive will ""to live"" overwhelms him. As the disenchanted novelist he meets puts it, ""We don't realize how beautiful (or precious) life is until we chance upon death."" The words resonate in Watanabe's mind. He seems to understand Sartre's credo, ""Death must enter life only to define it."" Suddenly, he fearfully and frantically yearns to define his life, overcome the petty existence he's wasted and atone for the quality of life and gratification he's lost, thus rendering death ineffectual. It is a message not only for Watanabe, but for all of humanity—to live the cosmic wow right now without reserve or fear of death.",

I think it is this reconnection with his character after learning of his death that causes the scene to have such emotional weight. That and the fact that he finally achieved something with his life, finally found some purpose.

135,17 July 2016,net_orders,2," Depressing, Long, and Boring.","Viewed on DVD. Restoration = seven (7) stars. To say this is a film that ""deep dives depression"" would be an understatement. How to confront living with a terminal disease tied to the aftermath of nuclear fallout may have been especially relevant for Japanese audiences in the early 1950's. And profitable at the box-office. But when viewed today, the theme remains relevant, but it is obvious that the movie itself is depressing in it's conception and execution. In short, what we have here is a depiction of depression that is, well, depressing. The script and direction relentlessly milk the sad subject matter resulting in tedious monotony quickly followed by boredom. The film seems to come alive only after the protagonist has died (starting with the scenes at his wake). But by then, most viewers may be beyond the point of caring or long departed. To provide comedy relief (and to keep theater audiences in their seats?), the director has mixed in some hilarious depictions of the inherent dysfunction of contemporary, local-level bureaucracies. But the impact of these scenes is insufficient to prevent being buried under the unrelenting, repetitious plodding that depicts the depressing subject matter. All of this makes for a film that is much too long by half. (If cut back by starting with, say, the wake and using more flashbacks, it might be more tolerable and a bit better at holding the viewer's interest.) Restoration is adequate, but still a work in progress. Vertical wear lines appear through out the first half of the movie, and some scenes remain just too dark to see much of anything. Music is heard sporadically (the best accomplices the opening credits). The voice over is gratuitous (and distracting). Subtitles are fine and especially needed to decipher the muttering and slurred dialog delivered by the lead actor (Takashi Shimura). Sound stage ""exteriors"" look pretty phony.

138,10 August 2011,jboothmillard,8, Ikiru,"I found this Japanese film (the title which translates ""to live"") featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was highly rated by critics and it certainly sounded like a worthwhile watch, directed by Akira Kurosawa (Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Dersu Uzala, Ran). Basically, set in post-war Tokyo, Japan, Kanji Watanabe (BAFTA nominated Takashi Shimura) has worked in the same monotonous position as a bureaucrat in an office for thirty years and is near his retirement. His wife is dead and his son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko) and daughter-in-law Kazue (Kyôko Seki), who live with him, seem to care mainly about Watanabe's pension and their future inheritance. At work, his office is full of bureaucratic inaction, including one case where a group of parents want a cesspool cleared out and replaced by a children's playground. One day, Watanabe goes to hospital for a check-up, where a doctor confirms that he has a tumour in his stomach, which is cancerous and incurable, and he has less than a year to live. Watanabe attempts to come to terms with having terminal cancer and with his impending death. He plans to tell his son about the cancer but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to distract himself with some of Tokyo's nightlife. During the night, he meets an eccentric novelist (Yunosuke Ito), who guides him. They go to a nightclub, where Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings ""Gondola no Uta"" with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. But after one night indulging in the nightlife, Watanabe realises this is not the solution. The following day, Watanabe encounters Toyo Odagiri (Miki Odagiri), a young female employee at his office who needs his signature to confirm her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm and tries to spend as much time as possible with her. Toyo eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows weary of him. After convincing her to join him for the last time, he tells her the truth about his health and asks for the secret to her love of life. Toyo says that she does not know, but that she found happiness in her new job making toys and knowing that they will bring happiness to all the children of Japan. Inspired by her, Watanabe realises that it is not too late for him to do something significant. Like Toyo, he wants to make something, and through the city bureaucracy he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises his colleagues returning to work after a long absence and begins pushing for the site to be cleaned and for a playground to be built. He has concerns that he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments but is determined to get it finished before he dies. Sometime later, Watanabe dies, with his former co-workers gathering at his wake, following the opening of the playground, and try to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behaviour. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realise that Watanabe must have known he was dying, even when his son denied this, as he was unaware of his father's condition. They also hear from a witness that in the last few moments of his life, Watanabe sat on the playground swing at the park he built whilst it was snowing. He was heard singing ""Gondola no Uta"". The bureaucrats vow to live their lives with the same dedication and passion as he did. But back at work, they lack the courage of their newfound conviction. Also starring Makoto Kobori as Kiichi Watanabe, Kanji's brother, and Kumeko Urabe as Tatsu Watanabe, Kiichi's wife. Shimura gives a credible performance as the old man struggling to find a meaning and purpose for his life, after years as a civil servant doing almost nothing, there are many moving parts and a terrific score by Fumio Hayasaka, it is an intimate story of mortality, self-reflection and redemption, certainly a must-see foreign language drama.

I don't say this lightly, but Ikiru can truly be a movie that changes your whole perspective on life. The plot has been outlined by other reviewers, so I won't repeat it here, but suffice to say Kurosawa highlights how it sometimes takes something as wrenching as knowing you have only a short time to live, to shake you out of your complacency and make you change your whole outlook and actions. Yes our protagonist engages in some self reflection tinged with regret for the time wasted, but as a result, he also finds a cause to dedicate the short amount of time left to him to make a difference in the lives of others and finally give some meaning to his life.

Of all of films Kurosawa made, this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on an universal level, because at its core it is about one of the basic truths of life- death.",

159,20 July 2022,DisinterestedWisdom,7," Good Film, Not Great","I think some of the gushing reactions to this film may be just a tad overdone. I mean, it's a good film, entertaining, but also at times tedious and lacking in any kind of real character development. Takashi Shimura as Watanabe tends to lay the angst on heavy without actually expressing the sentiment or emotion that one would expect from a man in his situation, especially as it relates to his son. His son and wife are mere caricatures, central to the plot but given short shrift as the film spends an inordinate amount of time on unnecessary development, for example the wild binge night that he spends with the novelist and his relationship with Miki. It does speak to issues of life and death in some roundabout way, and it can be forgiven for being a bit mawkish in terms of Watanabe's transformation; that would be standard for cinema of the period. Still, it is just a tiny bit trite to think that a man who's sold himself so completely into a life of oblivion suddenly finds a passion for service, because... well we aren't sure why. It seems to be the influence of Miki, but hers is anything but an example of service. Its a sweet thought, if not a bit saccharine, but ultimately dubious. In addition, in taking on as much as it does it doesn't always succeed. The critique of Japanese society is always present and reinforced in various ways, but sends the narrative off in too many directions, ultimately diluting the central story line. Enjoyable in many ways, but often discursive, it's a good film but not a great one.",

He is going to die, it was told to the viewers back at the beginning through a remarkable use of narration (Pay attention, Hollywood). The sad part is that he didn't really live all the years his heart beat. I, also, don't think this movie is meant for everyone. It's pretty old (Almost 65 years) and has subtitles. The character isn't that connectible if you weren't in his position a long time ago and the plot develops pretty slowly. But, actually, none of these are flaws. They make the movie as good as it is. They make ""Ikiru"" the masterpiece it truly is. Back at the beginning, when we first meet Watanabe-san in his daily work routine, we may feel sorry for him (if you've been at his place) or even something that remembers pity. Because, and this is a sign of how brilliant Kurosawa was as a director, with a single take we can understand most of the character. Shimura acts brilliantly, as usual, as a every-day-man who has nothing really special. I don't think i've seen character development as amazing as this one in any other movie, not even a Kurosawa one.

It is a message that bridges the gap between despair and hope. The main character Watanabe, upon finding out he will be dying of stomach cancer (in a vague, clearly paternalistic way as far as the medical system is concerned), puts his life into perspective and struggles with how to proceed during his final days. This struggle is seen very viscerally during the night club scene, when everyone around him is dancing with reckless abandon, ""living their lives"", as it was, yet they do so without direct recognition of their own mortality. When the idea of death comes piercing through the night in the guise of the melancholic tune Watanabe sings, dancing stops and what is translated is how difficult it really is to enjoy life when its end becomes transparent.",

198,24 January 2020,m-86637,10, Finding A Reason To Live In A Life Full Of Nothingness,"Ikiru, or ""To Live"", is a 1952 Japanese movie made by the legendary director, Akira Kurosawa. Considered by many to be Kurosawa's magnum opus, this film dives deep into what it means to live a fruitful life and what one's purpose should be. Ikiru is another film that just further contributes to Akira Kurosawa's legacy as it is another masterpiece. Keeping up the consistency of excellent works, Ikiru is nothing less than magnificent as it creates such strong feelings of despair and an overarching idea on what it means to truly live.
Ikiru is based off the Leo Tolstoy book, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, which portrays a high-court judge who is struck with a terminal disease and knows he will die soon. Ikiru follows Mr. Watanabe, an eldery bureaucrat who has been diagnosed with stomach cancer and is only given 6 months left to live. Falling into despair over the fact that he knows when he will die, he reflects on his life and realizes he has never experienced life for what it would be. The journey of the movie is Mr. Watanabe trying to find a purpose in a life full of regret and despair before he meets his unfortunate end.
The beginning scene of this film is one of my favorites. It shows the roundabout way the government deals with problems as women who come in with a complaint are referred to branch after branch until they eventually give up their request and go home. They never show anyone in the government doing actual work for people but simply muddling around their workplace. A disdain for bureaucracy is one of the primary themes Kurosawa employs in this film as Mr. Watanabe cannot even seem to remember anything he has accomplished while working. After Mr. Watanabe finally finds out what it means ""to live"", every bureaucrat sees the opportunity to rise in social status and tries to take credit for what Mr. Watanabe had accomplished. This film's depiction of bureaucracy is nothing less than bleak, ineffective, greedy, apathetic, and almost criminal.
Mr. Watanabe journey to find meaning in his life starts in his own indulgences. After he finds no satisfaction in partying or alcohol, he begins to try and make friendships that he once saw as pointless. He feels nothing until he comes to the realization of his worth. Mr. Watanabe, and Kurowsawa, both exert that the best way ""to live"" is to help others who are in need of assistance and compassion. Mr. Watanabe finally begins to push for something in the government to help out the local people. He is met with heavy resistance and everyone seems to be in the way. Mr. Watanabe shows incredible determination and is what Kurosawa expects people to be, the ones who show compassion to others and try to provoke chance and growth in a community.
Takashi Shimura, well known for his portrayal of Kambei in Seven Samurai, is nothing less than impeccable in the emotions he is able to express and make the audience feel. The pure loneliness and despair is almost tangible. An incredible performance that is nothing less than making one come to tears at points in Mr. Watanabe's life.
The direction of Akira Kurosawa is breathtaking as usual. My favorite use of using all of the frame is a scene in a restaurant where Mr. Watanabe has his self-actualization of a goal. In the time that Mr. Watanabe is coming to the realization of his meaning in life, a birthday party is celebrated in the background. This symbolizes the rebirth of Mr. Watanabe and his renewed interest in staying alive. Just a beautiful use of symbolism and the superior direction of Kurosawa.
Some might find the first half of the film mundane or uninteresting. There is nothing but unadulterated loneliness and sets up a very desperate feeling for the movie. There is no overarching conflict or problem that must be solved but simply following a man in his day to day life. This is like the works of directors such as Sergio Leone or Quentin Tarantino as the film simply follows the characters in his day to day life without some broad goal.
An audience must be vigilant as this movie is in Japanese so be okay with reading subtitles (you are missing out on a lot if you do not). Ikiru's overarching message is applicable to anyone as it tries to answer what is truly the purpose of one's life. Come into the film with an open mind and find a clear masterpiece in cinematic history.",

Despite its serious premise, Ikiru balances sorrow with clever touches of humor, such as an early scene demonstrating effectively the bureaucracy at which Watanabe works.

211,1 February 2023,freethinkingworld,10, After Thoughts,"Wow, what a masterpiece to start my watching experience with Akira Kurosawa off with! I loved this movie and is a perfect film to me with only one problem I could see anyone having. I could see how some viewers would not like some of the acting in this as some people I've talked to that Watched this thought some of the expressions and reactions were quote ""too much"". I didn't see that at all, I think the proformances by Takashi Shimura and Miki Odagiri were especially amazing! The Theme of this movie is also one that resonated with me a whole bunch! With working and just getting caught up in the low expectations at your job and never experiencing or doing anything with your life. It was a great wake up call to anyone watching this film and with the way his coworker acted at the funeral, it gives you the motivation to not just be someone that says they want to change like Kanji, but to actually do it!",

213,24 April 2020,f-57307,8, great!,"""Ikiru"" is a great movie, even aside from the analysis and criticism of the numb reality of the Japanese government at that time. From the perspective of human awakening, it is equally great, and the film structure alone is enough to be a great movie.",
214,12 September 2002,ukcritic,8," Touching, thought-provoking, with surprising moments of wit","At the centre of ""Ikiru"" are the massive issue of mortality and the thoughtful, poignant performance by Takashi Shimura, but Kurosawa's direction also managed to find moments of humour in the oddest places. The wake sequence is brilliant in the way it gets laughs both sad and pure out of drunkenness and bad logic, satirises bureaucracy and its servants, and also lets us think about the meaning of life, whether a wasted life can secure a legacy by attempting to redeem itself near the end, and whether those attempts at redemption, if successful, actually qualify a life as meaningful.",

220,20 May 2020,hikerhetav,7," Very picturesque, yet sad.","Well, this film was a bit more complicated than I anticipated. The first half is purely amazing, showing us the introduction of the character we are going to witness for the rest of the film. It shows how a character can transform from one situation to another, one mindset to another and how a single piece of information can change altogether of how a person has lived until that moment, and how he starts living post gathering the information.
What I observed here is the person who discovers he has a cancer, doesn't share it with those who he has blood relations with, rather he shares it with an unknown lady in whom he finds solace. However, he actually starts living after knowing he has a cancer, all he is shown to do is go with strangers and have food/drinks at affluent places. But he just never feel confident enough to share those moments with his son.
The later half is a bit weird where his life is shown as perceived by people he knew at his workplace. Those last 40 minutes converge with mixed opinions about Kenji Watanabe. As his life is analysed by others, it gives us contradictory views upon his life which ask us questions with tough answers. We are made to feel that if Kenji Watanabe was alive, we would have gotten the answers so easily. But this is what it is all about life.",

224,5 April 2006,mervei,7," life, death and bureaucracy","Ikiru is a film about life and death. It told through our hero Kanji Watanabe who is a symbol of people who work in a jaded office. I believe everyone who is not happy with his job will identify himself with Watanabe. Ikiru shows us no matter how boring our job or how meaningless and loveless our lives are, we should live a good life and make good changes in our lives long before we consider the day we die. I do not believe Watanabe is particularly boring or a ""mummy"" since his friends and his children do not seem to love him. That is why he is feeling outcast and he can not identify himself with his environment.Ikiru also tells us about the dis-functionality of bureaucracy. After Watanabe learns that he has six months, he not only tries to change his thirty-year life, but also the mechanism of the things at the office. This makes Watanabe a hero.",

It was hard to tell who the main character was at times. The cinematography was absolutely awful and the old Japanese men are simply not interesting to enough to make a 3 hour movie about. How am I supposed to connect with the characters when I can't even understand what they are saying? even with the subtitles on it was impossible most of the time. The story is about a guy who lives a boring life, well the director sure managed to project that onto the presentation of the film. Hands down one of the slowest moving films ever made, this crap was made in 1952. maybe people then found enjoyment in this tedious wreck.",

229,20 March 2002,jerschwab,9, Touching Film!,"Like many other people who have had the benefit of watching this fine piece from Kurosawa, I was touched and found that alot that goes on is still true in our society.  It's pathetic to see how much bureaucracy there is in this world today and how much time is wasted doing nothing.  This happens everywhere you look.  People filling out forms, following absurd procedures, following the status quo.  This film will make you want to make a change in your own way and perhaps put a little more effort into helping others. This film is about finding happiness... the ultimate goal in life.  I give it 9/10.",
230,18 September 2022,charlesturner-75605,7, A very melancholy film,"I found Ikiru to be a very sad film. The main character is very shy and always slow to speak. The movie makes you feel sorry for the main character and how he has to deal with his stomach cancer. But it also gives you this perspective on life. How you must enjoy the little things in life because you never know when you might be living in your final days. Ikiru is brilliant in showing that in the film. I love his outings with the younger female character and how it brightens his spirit. But overall a very sad film, and a depressing outlook on just how sad life can be. I would recommend watching Ikiru.",

This film I think had a very decent beginning, and even second act, but as soon as it felt it would go somewhere... it switched. I appreciate the way Kurosawa decided to structure the story like he did, but it did feel like it took me out of the film, and paid less attention to the man and more on the bureaucracy. Perhaps that was the intent, but I wish it had a more impactful ending, though the themes and development of certain characters were impactful, I can't help but feel it fell short of expectations.",
