0,27 August 2020,ansharora-12638,9, Joel and Tom are magical.,"At first, I thought, ""man, should have shown a little more backstory, why so much hate among the family and whatever"". But then I understood, that would have made it just another family drama movie, which it cannot be. This movie is about the raw unsaid emotion of a family that always remains there. No matter what.",/
1,4 November 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.""","There aren't many fight movies I'd rate as high as a '10', and by fight movies I'm talking about boxing as the subject. ""Rocky"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are the only two I can think of off hand. But this movie transcends the genre and is so much more than a film about a pair of brothers reaching for the gold ring in the arena of mixed martial arts. There's a lot of human drama on display, and the three principals in the story pull off some of the most incredible performances one is likely to see in a film like this.",r

Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, Grave of the Fireflies, Requiem for a Dream, The Green Mile, It's a Wonderful Life, and most recently I Lost my Body. But this is the one that finally cracked me, and for the first time in my life, I've cried to a movie.

3,27 July 2021,severindringel,10, A powerful masterpiece about desperate men,"Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton feud as estranged brothers at the Pentagon. Nick Nolte plays a rehabilitating father with deep-seated demons. From these dynamics emerges a family drama that on the surface dances to the usual Rocky schema - but again, not at all. Warrior is, in fact, a very special sports film. Not just because of its specific sport (MMA is unlikely to play a role on the big screen anytime soon), but the storytelling of how director Gavin O'Connor manages to weave together the emotional facets of this masculine world.",v

8,3 October 2011,jon.h.ochiai,10, What You Fight For,"""Warrior"" may be one of the best movies of the year that no one sees. That in itself is puzzling. Mixed martial arts and UFC are in the cultural mainstream; in fact MMA is more popular than professional boxing. Director and writer Gavin O'Connor did the amazing ""Miracle"" a few years back about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. So he has the touch for inspirational sports stories. In ""Warrior"" estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) fight each other in the finals of the winner take all mixed martial arts tournament Sparta in Atlantic City. ""Warrior"" is an inspired story of family, honor, and redemption. I applauded at the end of the movie along with the rest of the audience.",r

11,19 December 2020,Floated2,9, More than just a fighting film,"Quite a compelling and interesting story unfolded with the main topic of mma fighting in ""Warrior"". Lead by a great cast and great acting from its leads, this film is quite a step above simply a fighting film. There is more depth than expected as it has a great buildup to its characters- and they seem like real people rather than just one dimensional caricatures.",3
12,5 August 2014,kosmasp,9, Fighting,"A movie called Warrior, well you know where this is heading. Even if there is also a philosophical side to the title (a more spiritual one so to speak). Tom Hardy got a lot of recognition for this, but Nick Nolte and our other main character are as good in this. We have two people who will engage each other, having a common issue.

13,31 August 2019,mattyt_tmf,10," One of the most heart-breaking, emotional films I have ever seen.","It's really hard to start with this movie. It basically covers two estranged brothers - One who has embraced a quiet, family life; the other, dedicated his time to the United States military. Through a series of events, they come in contact with each other again during a MMA tournament. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton capture the hearts of the fans with their emotional, tear-wrenching performances, with Nick Nolte as their father delivering the most emotional performance of them all. With the film being a MMA movie, it's strange to think that drama would be so prevalent but essentially it is the backbone of the story.",6
14,4 March 2017,zkonedog,8, A New Fight Movie For A New Fight Generation,"Over the years, the sport of boxing has provided film-goers with undeniably great films like ""Rocky"", ""The Champ"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", and ""The Fighter"". In today's culture, though, boxing has largely been replaced by mixed martial arts as the fight game of choice. This was never more apparent than in the early 2010s when this film was released. While ""Warrior"" is by no means a perfect film, it easily does enough to speak to this new culture of combat films.",6

The movie was great, story held up and really felt engaging the entire way through, i liked the way the movie was made where we switch between each character, it really helps the character development get underway and this movie excells in that aspect, along with being one of the best fighter movies I've seen in this day and age.",9

Boy, was I wrong!",/
18,9 February 2012,zetes,6, Clichéd sports movie with some good points,"A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great. But it's not.",?

20,1 September 2011,cervantese,10, Loved IT!,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie last night. I went since its a ""guy"" movie my husband was the one excited about it more than I was. I must say I was more than impressed with the leading men in this film. It has been a long time since a movie has had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails as this movie did during the fighting scenes. If you are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes than this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn't stop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comes out. We really enjoyed it! Nick Nolte was amazing, and even my husband I think cried in a few scenes, (last time that happened was during Marley and Me) so I must say this movie is a MUST SEE!",e

27,10 September 2015,temrok9,7, Angry,"It is not that Warrior is not a good film;in fact, from a point on it grabs you in continuous commitment with your heart pumping fast and helplessly.The truth is that at the start it looks like it wants to be something more than another fighting movie, with the roles of Nolte and Hardy, and the reading of Mobby Dick, some kind of elegy.And it could succeed at it, as the Hardy character-in one of Hardy's best performances-is built masterfully;yet, the other characters of the film gradually become banal, and whats worst-please do not read further if you have not seen the movie-at the end there is the most conservative choice one could imagine, as the winner is the family man who fights in order to pay for the home of his family, whereas the heroic-and anti heroic-veteran, looses everything.One could argue that the end is about reconciliation and the return to the unity of the family;in my opinion, it is a total fiasco that let me down and made me really angry. There should be some other way to discourage violence without letting down the most interesting character of the movie.His defeat is the failure of the film to be anything more than a family fighting movie to watch at home.Yet, for Hardy alone, I would very much like to watch it again.",u

29,30 August 2017,conmech,9, Don't Watch The Trailer - And Don't Read the Plot on IMDb,"I get that companies have to show some cool stuff to attract the audience. But the trailer gives some key plot elements (as does the ""PLOT"" section on IMDb), as well as some MAJOR SPOILERS. For the first time, we have a movie, where there are 2 protagonists and 2 antagonists, which means the final fight, and the winner is not determined, and could be anyone. The only problem is, they show A LOT on the trailer, that you pretty much know how the end will be. Just watch it without the trailer, IMO finally we have a more evolved version of Rocky here.",v
30,11 November 2011,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: Warrior,"Enough of Boxing films already. Warrior brings us to the world of Mixed Martial Arts, which has been around for years, but never really making it to a notable big screen interpretation save for the Hong Kong film Flashpoint starring Donnie Yen taking down a string of bandits led by Collin Chou in the film's climatic finale. Perhaps its more contemporary slant meant a little less understanding of the art to effectively bring it to the cinemas, but Gavin O'Connor's film will open doors for MMA to work, and work well.",

32,3 February 2012,evanston_dad,8, I Was Totally Sucker Punched,"The only thing ""Warrior"" could have added to make its shamelessly manipulative screenplay even more emotionally manipulative would have been a three-legged dog dying of cancer. This movie makes ""Rocky"" look as austere as an Ingmar Bergman film.",
33,2 April 2022,stimpy_tr,4, What a waste of time!,"Every single scene of this film is overloaded with sentimentality. The characters are unrealistic and unrelatable. I didn't feel for any of them. Storytelling is so weird. People speak in a whispering voice to augment the mawkishness. All that family drama overwhelms the whole film. That drama is strangely mixed with an MMA tournament. I didn't get any direct or subtle messages from the film. I think it reflects personal issues of the director. For me, it was a waste of time.",
34,8 January 2021,zach-68987,10," Epic tale of family disintegration, loss and connection","The backdrop of UFC provides a perfect expression of the the rage and chaos existing between an violent and abusive father and his now two grown up sons. I found this a masterful and compelling film that I have been drawn back to watch many times. I captures an inspiring tale of men in enormous pain trying to confront and recover from family violence and abuse. The momentum of the characters and the ability of the writers, director and actors to portray the journey of barely restrained rage, rejection, and reconciliation carries the story with powerful momentum. Tom Hardy's depiction of Tommy is truely inspired - his rage seems to be unstoppable - the flashes to his real vulnerability are managed so well. Nick Nolte also delivers a career highlight as the reformed abusive father who cannot change the past. He is trapped in a small world devoid of any real connection trying to confront his past listening to endless loops of Captain Ahab who destroyed everything in his arrogant pursuit of the great White Whale. Joel Edgerton too delivers an exceptional portrayal of the brother who has tried to forget and live a normal life only to find he has unfinished business that must be addressed. He has a younger brother who needs him and cannot forgiveness him for abandoning him all those years ago. What a movie! One of my favourites of all time. Thank you for making this film. It tells my story (minus the UFC)",
35,3 January 2016,ironhorse_iv,8, Warrior is on a Warpath! What an awesome movie! It was a knockout!,"This amazing family drama movie from 2011 made megastars out of then-unknown actors, Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy. Both really put great performances in and out of the ring. Both really took a beaten, to make the cage fighting seem real. Edgerton suffer from a torn MCL, while Tom Hardy suffered a broken toe, broken ribs, and a broken finger. It takes a lot of guts just to do that. Not only does Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, make very brutality and believable gritty fights, but I love how both were able to touch the heart-strings as well. The intensity from both of them, made this movie, very entertaining. Directed by Gavin O'Connor, the movie tells the stories of two estranged brothers, Troubled Iraq vet, Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) & unemployed and indebt teacher, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) who enter a Mixed Martial Arts tournament to compete with each other, for their own good moral reasons. Who is going to win? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I love the fact, that the movie doesn't make, a bad seed out of Tommy or Brendan. Both characters have their faults, and their good side. However, I do believe that their one-dimensional fighting styles, don't really match up with their personality. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to see, Tom Hardy all buff out and knocking people out, with his striking ability, but it makes little to no sense in the context of the character's history. After all, wasn't this man once a former wrestling prodigy? Wouldn't he be, doing more takes down, and arm holds than his brother, Brendan!? I don't get it! Another problem with the film is the huge gaps in logic within the story structure. A good example is how Tommy even got back to the US, if he supposedly went AWOL in Iraq. You would think, that wouldn't be easy. Another problem with the film is how the film, has no epilogue, so we never see the repercussions of Tommy's desertion nor find out what becomes of the family he promised to support. What happen to them!? Brendan's story arch isn't any better. Brendan being forced into fighting by economic reasons, to supplement his income is bit of a joke. It doesn't make any sense, since most amateur fighters make little to no money at all. Most of them, pursuit this dangerous career, because it's their dream job. Brendan had no reason to go back into fighting; after all, he was a physic teacher! Colleges would pay, good money for his teaching ability. Brendan's main flaw is his pride. His absolute refusal to file for bankruptcy or move to a smaller house, even though his wife, Tess (Jennifer Morrison) would rather take that option than watch him risk his life in the ring is be too selfish than inspiring to watch. I know, that Brendan Conlon was based off, real-life math teacher turn UFC fighter, Rich Franklin, but unlike Brendan in the film, Franklin went from teaching math to fighting, because his love for the sport, not economic reason. In my opinion, it would make more sense that Brendan went back into fighting, because that's what he wanted to do; not because he had to. Another thing that seem a bit illogically in the film is how both men whom seem, a bit amateurism in their fighting records, were able to get into the Sparta winner-takes-all competition at all. You would think, that a high-profile, winner-takes-all competition with a $5 million purse would be fill with more season trained fighters than amateur fighters. The mixer of amateurs with mostly unsanctioned fighting records with pro-fighters seem a bit too jarring to be taken seriously. It's like if Daniel LaRusso from 1984's Karate Kid was against Martial Arts Master, Bruce Lee. It's kinda unbelievable to see that ever happening in real life. Although the competition action sequences takes itself pretty realistically; there were too many terrible calls from the ref and judges to make any the fights in this film, seem 100% realistic in real fighting accuracy. I give the movie, more like 75% in that. Still, the idea that a MMA sport event is a brutal blood sport where competitors are able to continue to fight with a broken arm is also a highly doubtful probability. I know that it was played up for dramatic effect, but in reality, getting your arm broken would result in an immediate stoppage, no matter how much you want to continue fighting. While, I have to say, the performances in the ring were really great, despite some flaws, I have to say, that the performances out of the ring, were a little better. Most of the best parts in the film, are the interactions between the family members. The movie deals with some weighty mature content that most people might find, a little too uneasily, to watch. The conflicted relationship between fathers and sons, the estrangement of brothers, PTSD, alcoholism, inferiority, abandonment issues and family debts are all melodrama clichés used at its best. Nick Nolte as the boys' father, Paddy, a retired, recovering alcoholic boxer is outstanding. I was really glad, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for this role, that year. His recovery and his will to redeem himself, made for a very inspiring side story. Another great part of this film is the soundtrack by Mark Isham. The track 'Listening to the Beethoven', is amazing. Not only that, but the music that came along with it, such as the band, the Natural's song 'About Today"" was gripping to hear. Overall: This underdog emotional fighting story was a major hit for me. Tons of manly tears from me. A great inspiring punch, to knock some sense in you, if you're feeling out of the fight. A must-watch.",
36,22 October 2014,juneebuggy,10, One of the best movies I've seen in a long time,"I'm not even an MMA fan but I was totally engrossed in this and even moved to tears more than once. Heartbreaking and compelling, I guess you could say the story is also somewhat predictable (we've seen similar done in other sports themed movies before) its even far fetched, especially when it comes to the schoolteachers storyline, but the thing is, it just doesn't matter because it's such a great movie.",

One of the best iv ever seen. First movie iv ever cried during, and i cried twice lol. Whether your a guy who likes fighting movies or a girl who doesn't know what MMA stands for, this movie will blow you away. Seriously, I don't know how anyone could watch this and think it wasn't at the very least, a Very Good movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and its also more realistic the most fighting movies. Watching rocky and most box office fighting films, there tends to be over-dramatized punching noises and the boxers seem to fight without attempting to guard themselves. Aside from the realistic fight however, is a very emotional drama which is sure to move anyone who pays attention to the film.",

43,4 August 2012,Radu_A,1, well if this isn't the American Nightmare,"OK, actually this is a decent sports drama, and I would rate it 6.5-7 if it wasn't for an utterly horrifying plot element that seems to have escaped most people: The main hero of the story is forced into foreclosure of his home by an arrogant banker who weaseled him into his loan in the first place, and now refuses to extend it. His only way out is to participate in a no-holds-barred fight tournament organized and financed by - an arrogant Wall Street banker! Just how sick is that? The people who force ordinary Americans into bankruptcy get the additional kick of watching said Americans get their heads bashed in - and be grateful for the wads of cash they may receive if they make it. Exactly like 'Hunger Games', only there it's criticized and in a SciFi setting, whereas 'Warrior' glorifies this state of things and is set in the present day! Almost as if the US today were some sort of Ancient Rome, where the impoverished should be thankful for their chance to prove their merit in the arena like the gladiators of yore.",
44,31 December 2019,sniffynixon-33443,8, Ludicrous plot but great performances,"Warrior is one of the better fighting movies put to celluloid, but like it's other better known relatives it suffers from ludicrous plotting. Nevertheless if you can look beyond the unlikeliness, there is a very entertaining film simmering underneath underpinned by some truly brilliant performances by all three of the leads. Egerton in particular is brilliant as the the elder brother trying to hold his family together. So is Hardy as the younger brother dealing with some serious issues caused by his abusive alcoholic father and the impace that had on his childhood. The fight scenes are also very well chereographed so if you are interested in fighting then this film comes highly recommended.",

Brilliant in all senses.,"It's a shame that in the past they gave all the Oscars to ""Rocky"" but they couldn't recognize a wonderful job like ""Warrior"". That movie is good but completely egoistical in terms of story, just a man and his will to fight and survive; ""Warrior"" is about two men, their will and fight to survive AND help others. That's important, very noble and what really defines the greatness of the film.",

I find this film to be a tad better than 2010's The Fighter, another great movie. I find it a crime that this movie was overlooked by moviegoers and the Academy. Why it did so poor at the box office is beyond me. I saw this film knowing what it was and I was rewarded with a tense sports drama that features many important themes on family and hard work.",
47,11 August 2012,baberchik,2, Overrated classical American feelgood movie,"First off - great camera-work, hence the 2. Now for the core of the movie - brother vs brother is a fun plot that can be twisted every which way. However as soon as some obviously fake Russian character is introduced with the completely out of place Visotski song playing in the background... the pieces start falling in place. This is a classical American tearjerker feelgood movie. The idea alone of a classic underdog has been made into film 100 times better in Rocky, where not the selfish victory but ""all-in"" attempt at it is what really counts. A battle that could not be won, yet one does not give up. This is the opposite. What could have been a very dramatic (and believable! and almost heartbreaking!) plot of two brothers pitted against each other is washed down the tubes. For someone who has a moderate interest in MMA it is clear the the ending was completely unrealistic and would have never taken place. This is not 1900's, today people are not beaten to within an inch of their life in the ring. To contrast this to any VanDamme flick - think of this movie being a much better attempt at a fighter movie, minus actual fighters who have no acting skills, but add to it American superiority complex and you have the ""warrior"". Overrated, and sad to say this ""warrior"" won in the ring but lost to idealism.",

Still, I know a good film when I see one and WARRIOR is more than that: it's excellent. Befitting a film that deals with MMA and despite the PG-13 rating, it doesn't pull its punches physically or emotionally. This is probably one of the most intense movies I've seen from a visceral standpoint and on an emotional level. Without getting into too many specifics, the story is about two brothers who have been separated and on the outs for quite a long time. Due to personal circumstances, they both (inadvertently) enter the same MMA tournament and deal with relationship issues that have gone long unaddressed. The two leads, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, both do an awesome job with the dramatic material while also bringing a believable physicality to their fight scenes. Although they are filmed and edited in a rather chaotic style, I thought that it worked here even if it came with the slight loss of comprehensibility. For the most part, however, you get to see all of the punches, throws and takedowns from a variety of perspectives. Also lending some dramatic heft to the film was veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays the brothers' father, also on bad terms with his sons for a variety of reasons. He was as fleshed out as were the two siblings and even gets a couple moments that seemed Oscar-worthy. In general, this wasn't some mindless story with a bunch of fight scenes strung together. Every fight had a purpose for the overall story, and there was plenty of back story for each main character to get you fully invested. So much so, that by the time the end comes around you don't know who to root for because they both have such strong motivations. It's like the Sophie's Choice of fight films. My only complaint, which is minor at best, is that once it does come around to the conclusion it lays on the melodrama a bit thick, and the final moment in the ring which was backed by an acoustic song had me rolling my eyes a little bit. Still, this was a powerful drama with incredibly brutal fight scenes that actually meant something. Even if you don't normally go for sports movies, this is one of the few that transcends that genre's limitations and manages to be inspirational without pandering. Highly recommended.",

Great performances from all the leads, particularly Nolte and Hardy, and I would recommend this movie to anyone, even those who don't care for fighting movies because the fighting is only a plot device, and it's not what the movie is about.

When they make one sort of movie, you can pretty much guarantee there will be many more soon after. Back in the 1930s, it was gangster films...one after another. The 1950s and early 60s, it was nothing but westerns. In the late 70s, it was roller skating and CB radio films. Now, in the 2010s, it's fight films. First was ""The Wrestler"" and then ""The Fighter"" and then ""The Warrior"". So, from this standpoint, ""The Warrior"" isn't exactly original--it's one in a string of similar films. Is it any good?

86,8 June 2016,jboothmillard,7, Warrior,"All I knew about this film was the leading British actor, and that it was something to do with fighting, I didn't know if it was boxing or wrestling, turned out to be something sort of in-between the two, I was looking forward to watching it anyway. Basically Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a former U.S. Marine haunted by a tragic past, he returns to his hometown in Pittsburgh, he has never fully forgiven his father Paddy Conlon (Oscar nominated Nick Nolte) for his alcohol-driven abuse, Paddy has now returned to being Catholic. Paddy was formerly Tommy's coach, he enlists his father to train him for a winner-takes-all MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) tournament called Sparta, awarding $5,000,000, the biggest prize in the history of the sport, but Tommy does want Paddy to attempt to reconcile their relationship. Tommy trains hard and blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is struggling to make ends meet as a public school teacher, he is a former MMA fighter, he decides to return to the ring at an amateur level to provide for his family. Years may have passed, but recriminations and betrayals in the past have kept Brendan bitterly estranged from both his brother Tommy and his father Paddy, but Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog draws them closer together. The brothers are set on a collision course to confront each other, Tommy and Brendan must face their demons that tore them apart, and eventually of course comes the final intense battle, it is unclear who will win in the fight between the brothers, but after it is all over they do reconcile as their father looks on smiling. Also starring Jennifer Morrison as Tess Conlon, The Grey's Frank Grillo as Frank Campana, Small Soldiers' Kevin Dunn as Principal Zito, Bryan Callen as Bryan Callen, Kurt Angle as Koba and The Truman Show's Noah Emmerich as Dan Taylor. Hardy definitely makes a great impression as the aggressive fighter who tries to separate himself from his family, Edgerton is as compelling as his tough brother and eventually competitor, and I can see why Nolte was nominated the Oscar for his performance. Mixed martial arts has increased in popularity and really rivals boxing and professional wrestling, this is probably the first film I've seen that really covers it, the fighting sequences certainly grab your attention with their brutality, besides that it works well as a story of a broken family slowly coming back together through, all in all it is a most watchable sports drama.

Tommy's walking away from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene.¨ Warrior is one of my favorite films of the year along with Drive and the final Harry Potter movie. This film really caught me by surprise. I'm generally not a huge fan of sports movies; don't get me wrong, I like them, but they usually are very predictable and never end up among my favorites. However, Warrior is really a terrific movie that had me routing for both fighters at the end. What really stands out however in this movie aren't the actual fighting scenes, but the entire family drama that goes on. Warrior makes The Fighter look like a silly movie and I really enjoyed that one, but the performances in this film (apart from Bale's excellent performance) and the script are much better. The family in Warrior is a totally broken one, and although there are some clichés and corny moments, I really had a great time with this emotionally strong sports drama written and directed by Gavin O'Connor who also directed the 2004 sports film: Miracle. The fighting scenes are really well choreographed and the actors all look like real fighters. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are great as the lead characters and they really buffed out for this movie. The true surprise of Warrior however was Nick Nolte's powerful performance as the broken father who is looking for redemption and forgiveness from his estranged sons. There are really some powerful and emotional dramatic scenes, but there are also plenty of strong fighting scenes so you will be satisfied whatever it is you are looking for. This movie deserves some Oscar buzz, it is just that good, and it really hasn't received as much recognition as it should.",

I think I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that things being drawn around an old and worn formula like this isn't always bad thing, and a movie like this is a prime example of that. It's hard to make a sports film in any other formula, so why screw around with something when it's already so tried and true?

Inconsistencies pound away at credibility throughout the plot, while the film follows a predictable path but I must admit, even at 139 min, you don't have a feeling of its long runtime. The credit largely goes to a extraordinary performance by Tom Hardy, very solid by Frank Grillo and solid by Nick Nolte. On the other hand, for me, Joel Edgerton, Maximiliano Hernández and Gavin O'Connor (who is filmmaker too) are all miscasted here. I really can't see J. Edgerton as a teacher during the day and MMA fighter during the night. Plus, he is somehow always the same - in the bank, in the school, at the gym, at home, with his father/brother/sparing partner, etc. The other problem with this film is its structure - at the start, the narrative follows Tom Hardy and his story, but towards the end it feels like director has attempted to turn the focus right around, making J. Edgerton (T.H. movie brother) the main player. To conclude, no matter issues with the script and director so and so execution, the ""Warrior"" is solidly entertaining while the movie is better than its trailer implies. Not to mention that the ending brought my wife to tears :)",

Warrior has some decent fighting scenes in it but thats where it ends which unfortunately isn't enough to make an entertaining movie. The acting was below average and the way the entire story was put together was a train wreck. This one just drags on and on and on and it's so unbelievably boring that you would have to be a warrior to stay awake. I think spending 2 hours watching grass grow would have a better plot. The fact that the story in a way tries to rip off Rocky makes it pretty pathetic as well but I would still never dare compare this to Rocky.

Oh, I almost forgot about a good dose of American flag waiving with the US military (reminded me a little of Transformers 3's disgusting false patriotism).

129,20 August 2012,mark-d-jordan1,6, How Could this Movie get a High Rating on IMDb,"""Warrior"" was pretty good, not badly filmed and not badly acted. But that is it. That also describes many films that got less then 7.0 ratings at IMDb. I'm not sure why in the heck people are rating this as high as it is. Either a bunch of studio people got on here and posted ratings or a bunch of numb skulls who simply rate any fighting movie high did. Don't simply rate a movie high because you like the subject. Thats not really the point of the rating system. As others suggested this movie never did develop the three main characters much. There did not appear to be a deep enough reason for all the animosity that took place between the characters. Most of the movie was taken up by fight scenes. The creators of this movie needed to watch ""Rocky"" better as it had the formula correct for this type of movie. It was also kind of stupid that Tommy was still fighting with one arm in the end. The film was a little degraded due to that. Lets have votes from people who know all kinds of movies and not just action films.",

If you blink you could miss the training portion and the Segway going into the final fight.

Not Oscar worthy, if you ask me, but Nick Nolte MIGHT be nominated, as this is his best acting in years and kind of reminds me of James Coburn in ""Affliction (1997)"" (with Nick Nolte, incidentally) - a performance that I felt was less deserving of an Oscar than his performance in ""American Gun (2002)"". Tom Hardy, who I came to appreciate since seeing ""Bronson (2008)"", is great as usual and Joel Edgerton was hard for me to judge, since I'm not really familiar with his work (although as I now check IMDb, he was great in ""Smokin' Aces"", just like the rest of the cast there).",

Among other things, the competition between the two brothers leads them to hate each other, hatred fueled by the father who has preferences for one over the other. This is the guideline on which the director Gavin O'Connor makes an excellent film, supported by effective acting, with a splendid Tom Hardy (the younger brother) and an old wolf like Nick Nolte (the father). Parent-child drama is a must always present in both American literature and filmography, but the originality in this film is to have included the (non) sporting competition as a metaphor for complex interpersonal relationships.

159,1 November 2011,Troy_Campbell,10," Stirring, enthralling and absorbing. In one word: brilliant.","One of the best cinema releases of the year – and so far only the third to get my 5 star rating – this MMA-centric motion picture has been compared to the likes of Rocky, Bloodsport and almost every other movie featuring some form of competition ""fighting"". Not only is that a lazy association, it's also inaccurate, as writer-director Gavin O'Connor's sophomore feature effort is foremost a relationship drama, with the brutal MMA (Mixed Martial Arts for those not up to speed) supplying a suitably hard-hitting format for conflicted brothers Tommy and Brendan (played with gravitas by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton respectively) to work out their differences. The story is emotionally powerful; the combat sport is superbly staged; and the acting is awards-worthy from the major trio of Hardy, Edgerton and Nick Nolte as their repentant ex-alcoholic father. The physically commanding Hardy is already bursting onto the A-list scene with fantastic performances in Inception and Bronson (and an upcoming role in The Dark Knight Rises) but, if there's any justice in Hollywood, Warrior should also see local boy Edgerton hit the big time. Terms like ""stirring"", ""enthralling"" and ""absorbing"" barely do justice to just how moving this film really is.",

162,22 February 2017,xara-59700,1, Fantastic Jean-Claude Van Damme movie from the early 90's!,"I think IMDb made a mistake writing this movie was made in 2011. It clearly is made in the early 1990's- the story, moral and World view proves that it is an early remake of every Jean- Claude Van Damme movie ever made up until that time. Also- it features a scary communist man from the threatening country of the Soviet union. This movie concentrates on telling the fantastic story of two American (the only nation that counts) brothers- sportsmen who go to war every time they step out on ""stage"", much like when Serena Williams or Roger Federer steps out on court in the U.S. Open and the chair umpire yells ""Fight!"" right before they open 1st set (Mortal Kombat later borrowed the idea). In the movie one of the brothers is a kind and good man (..actually they both are.. all men are good men.. wait- well they usually are in movies, right..?) and a loving husband and father, who doesn't want to fight but is left no option since an evil bank has ripped him off. Luckily he's American because in America regular people like that can moonlight (like Walter White does in Breaking Bad- to pay his medical bills in a country that saves its people from the evil grips of socialism) as one of the 16 BEST fighters in the world- which he luckily happens to be although he's hidden it for many years. The other brother who also happens to be one of the 16 BEST fighters in the world is an ex-soldier in that country of Iraq, where he bravely saved an American soldier and was considered a war hero (this I find confusing- don't you get to be a war hero when you kill people..? otherwise any like doctor could be a hero, right..?). He is very modest and a true Christian, because he does not care about fortune and fame. In fact, he changes his name and gets out of Iraq and into America under false pretenses (when you're American you don't need a passport- all you need to do is say you're American) so no one knows who he is. They both enter the greatest MMA tournament of the World (in America). Since the soldier brother doesn't have any family that he cares about or friends it's a good thing that he doesn't win the fighting tournament that occupies the last 1h of the movie, but his loving and fatherly brother does, the one who actually needs the money for his children and wife (who is useless, but looks like a supermodel- a typical American woman). The ending I really haven't seen in any other Hollywood movie except a Jean-Clause Van Damme movie or perhaps anything remotely related to Disney... or Steven Spielberg.. or anything from Hollywood that slightly resembles any of the previously mentioned. The movie is really great for people who are vacuum cleaning while watching it or simply has the level of a general American high- school education recently graduated or likes the story line in MacGyver (again, 80's).",
163,10 January 2013,richcarter1962,9, Best Underdog Movie since Rocky,"I ran across this movie while looking at movies rated 8.0 or higher by IMDb users. I have had very good luck with this system and I am now running out of titles. Despite the lack of big name stars the acting in this movie was Very Good. Both of the brothers and Nick Nolte does an excellent job portraying the recovering alcoholic father. Most of best scenes that define this movie occur in interactions between the Nolte and his sons, (always 1 at a time). The plot is predictable but still manages to hold your attention even though pretty sure how things will turn out. The fight scenes are INCREDIBLE they are almost painful to watch. I ma not big fan of MMA but I have watched a few matches and it's my opinion that this movie shows very well the brutality that takes place in these fights. If you liked ""The Fighter"" or ""Rocky"" you will almost certainly find this an entertaining movie.",
164,8 July 2012,HelenMary,10, the fight film that makes Rocky look like Disney,"Flawless, absolutely flawless. The (British) demi-god that is Tom Hardy has done it again... a superb performance as the broken embittered younger son returning ""home"" to fight against the wreckage of his early years, and quite predictably (it's in the trailer so not a spoiler) his brother, quite literally. Nick Nolte (who I have never liked up until now - although I knew he was a great actor) is the regretful sorrowful ex-drunk of a father trying to reunite with his sons, who presides over the unravelling feud. Joel Edgerton is a relatively up and coming actor and I think this is his first shot at the mega-big leagues... and what a trial by fire working alongside Hardy and Nolte (in that order IMHO)! This is a brutal fight film - mixed martial arts (MMA) where anything goes; what you would be arrested for outside the cage for GBH is par for the course inside it, where you have no idea how it will end (although you can guess at scenarios) and it keeps you pinned up against the fence until the last, the bloody action interspersed with story of incredible depth, sensitivity and heart. The characters were so finely drawn - Hardy playing a man who's past is revealed bit by bit and despite his animalistic (boy is he like a crazed cornered tiger) hate and fear driven madness you love him. Frank Grillo and Jennifer Morrison were great supporting cast and really add to the drama. But the genius of this film is that there is no damnable Hollywood ending - you are left, tears running down your cheeks, feeling as ragged as if you had just gone a round with Kobo, raw, and spent, heart in pieces with no tidy conclusion when it fades to black. I couldn't have coped with this at the cinema!!",

Then I saw the cast. If you see Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, and Nick Nolte in any cast, that is a clear sign that there is likely to be greatness in the production. These performers, and pretty much everyone else in this astonishing masterpiece are in pitch-perfect top form in a movie that, based on the number of ""seen it all before"" cliches, should not work; however, it is all so beautifully written, directed, photographed, edited, and scored that no serious movie buff should miss it. Beside the brilliantly pulse-pounding action highlights, the movie is loaded with deep, brilliantly drawn characters and their very human relationships, which make the outcome of the tale a matter of passionate concern for the viewer. Why this picture is not better known, and the recipient of many rewards and accolades, is a great mystery. See it on the biggest screen possible, with a good sound system, and you will be blown away. It has one of the most soul-stirring, cathartic finishes I have seen in many years. Director, Gavin O'Connor, who also co-wrote the script should be eternally proud of such a glorious accomplishment.

Warrior also give lotta attention to the fight itself, and half of the movie they're doing just that: fighting.

184,10 February 2017,sol-,6, Brothers,"Tensions flare up even further between two estranged brothers when they discover that they are both competing in the same mixed martial arts tournament in this frequently rousing if rather predictable sports drama. It is not hard to guess early on which two competitors will end fighting for first place and the whole idea of the brothers being brought back together after so many years to erase the bad blood between them is hardly spectacular. The performances are, however, solid throughout with Joel Edgerton crafting a highly sympathetic character out of his high school science teacher turned fighter, set on the top prize to pay off the bank and preventing them repossessing his house. Jennifer Morrison is pretty good as his wife too, even if she is reduced to mere reaction shots towards the end. As the other brother, Tom Hardy's reasons for fighting are not quite as compelling, but he delivers well too, though the best of the very best performance of the film comes from Oscar nominated Nick Nolte as the recovering alcoholic father of the two men who sees an opportunity to get his family back, if only his two sons do not kill themselves in the ring. The fight scenes are compelling too, though they only occur in the second half of the movie and clocking in at almost two and a half hours, this is not a light and breezy affair. It is, however, more encapsulating than one might imagine given the formulaic premise and familiar sibling rivalry themes, which really goes to show how much can be achieved simply by casting all pivotal roles exceptionally well.",

We've seen it dozens of times, from the originals that started it all : Rocky and Raging Bull, to Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man and the more recent Southpaw and Creed.

204,7 August 2017,Screen_Blitz,9, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are the revelations of this superbly riveting exploration of family dynamics and mixed martial arts,"This mixed martial arts drama is not your average everyday drama following an underdog rising from your average fighter to the holder of the championship title, it is a superbly riveting exploration of family and a brotherly bond that is tested to the limits. In other words, it is a film that does not try to level up with classics like 'Rocky', but simply being something with a heart and soul blossoming through the electrifying nature of its story. Plus, one of the few things differentiating from the Sylvestor Stallone classic is the sport in focus of his drama is mixed martial arts fighting instead of boxing. But the emotional core of the story lies not within the action inside the ring but what happens outside that defines the action following the bell ring. Even if there are a few moments that feel burnt up emotional manipulation, there is hardly a minute in its slightly overlong runtime that feels squandered. The movie is orchestrated by director Gavin O'Connor who has a solid cast by his side, ranging from Joel Edgerton, to Tom Hardy, to Oscar nominee Nick Nolte. This film follows Tommy Conlon (played by Tom Hardy), a disconcerted Iraq war veteran who returns to his hometown in Pittsburgh to meet his father (played by Nick Nolte) who is a recovering alcoholic after the abuse and neglect he laid on his family years ago. With his goal on entering a MMA tournament to the win $50,000 championship prize, Tommy asked his father to be his trainer. Meanwhile, his estranged brother Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton), a former MMA fighter, has retired and is now a high school physics teacher who's family is in danger on losing their house in foreclosure. After a night of MMA fighting gets him suspended on his job, Brendan goes against his wife's (played by Jennifer Morrison) wishes and enters the tournament with his old friend Frank (played by Frank Grillo) as his coach. When this puts him on a collision course with Tommy, the two estranged brothers must come to terms with their dark pasts perpetrated by their father. ",

From the AWAL Marine who becomes a hero on his way out from IRAQ,who all of a sudden becomes an MMA killer? to the moonlighting Teacher who beats down an undefeated MMA fighter? or How about the two brothers fighting each other for the finale? what are the odds of that happening?

213,22 January 2016,e-addis,9, It's not just MMA that makes this different.,"What amazes me most about this film is that it perfectly develops the relationship between Tommy, Brendan and their Father without ever using flashbacks or long exposition sequences explaining why their relationship was where it was. You understand the complexities of their relationship by attaining a few details of the story during each sequence allowing you to slowly piece together the past so you can better understand the present. By doing this, the viewer feels an emotional connection to each character. Part of me cheered for Brendan while feeling like Tommy was unnecessarily cruel to his Father. But then later in the film I became much more sympathetic to Tommy in part because the pieces of history provided throughout the film allowed me to better understand that character. As a result, I was connected to every character in this film making the finale that much more emotional.",

It was powerful, emotional, and had amazing fight scenes in it. I actually didn't know how it was going to end, which was a nice change of pace. The most brilliant thing about this movie was the amount of emotion it was able to convey with the simplest of actions. Tommy lying with his drunk dad. A nod that Paddy gives to Brendan.

218,18 December 2011,cosmo_tiger,8, A very good movie that deserves to be compared with Rocky. My expectations were just a little too high I think. I say B+,"""You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home."" After being away from home for a long long time Tommy (Hardy) comes back to see his father Paddy (Nolte). Across town his brother Brendan (Edgerton) is having financial troubles. The only way the two brothers can find a way to make the money they need is by fighting in an MMA tournament. Tommy asks his father to train him and the family dysfunction grows until the tournament. Regardless of what I say here this is a great movie. My problem with this is that I think my expectations were too high. Any movie that draws comparisons to ""Rocky"" gets my hopes up (like ""The Fighter""). Much like ""Rocky"" though, this movie has the fighting as a secondary plot to the family struggles that are going on. This movie is very interesting in the way that you are not sure who is the ""good"" brother and are not really sure who to root for the entire time. If you have seen ""The Fighter"" you may agree with me when I say that the movie was good but Christian Bale's performance made the movie. Nick Nolte gives that kind of performance in this one. He takes a part that could get glossed over and makes it stand out enough that to me he is the front runner for an Oscar. Overall, a very good movie but my expectations were too high to love it as much as I wanted. Of the last ""fighting"" movies to come out I would have to say this is 3rd on my list. After ""The Wrestler"" and ""The Fighter"". Still very much worth watching though. I give it a B+.",

221,21 December 2011,Willie-12,8, One Of The Best This Year,"For me, Warrior was one of the best surprises of this entire year in film. It's not very often you find a movie that, in all actuality, was about as formulaic as you can get within the context of it's genre, and yet was still a very good film. There really isn't anything new that Warrior brings to the table as far as films about fighters are concerned, except it centers on Mixed Martial Arts instead of boxing. But it really doesn't matter because the story, screenplay, and acting make this one of the best movies I've seen in 2011. And no performance was more compelling than that of Nick Nolte's. I'm not really sure what's been going on with Nolte in the last few years or so, other than some minor film roles and some legal problems. But in Warrior, he delivers what may be the best performance of his career, and certainly a performance that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. I have a sneaky suspicion that some of the demons that haunt his character here hit a little too close to home for him. But it's also probably some of those negative experiences that helped him deliver such a mesmerizing performance. It should be noted that the film starts to drag just a bit in the second half. But all is forgiven in one of the best conclusions to a film I've seen in a very long time. If you're a little gun shy about this one because you may not be the biggest MMA fan in the world, don't let that keep you from seeing this film. Don't get me wrong. The MMA aspect is definitely on full display here. But it's what surrounds the fight scenes that makes Warrior a very satisfying movie. And it's what surrounds the fight scenes that also makes Warrior one of the best films of the year.",

223,24 September 2015,anaconda-40658,8, Edgerton / Hardy / Warriors.,"Warrior (2011): Dir: Gavin O'Connor / Cast: Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison, Frank Grillo: This film seems inspired by the popularity of Ultimate Fighting Championship with mixed martial arts skill is put to the test. Joel Edgerton plays a physics professor who is barely able to make ends meet. He has a wife and son as well as a past that involved fighting. Returning to the cage for fighting he hopes to reap a victory over his debts as well as gain respect. Tom Hardy plays his vile tempered brother who returns home after serving in the war, and seeks training from his father, a former boxer. Nick Nolte plays their father whose relationship with his sons has been damaged by alcohol. He desperately wants to gain forgiveness and attempt to heal the damage caused. Both brothers are destine to meet in this tournament. Edgerton is the underdog who defeated the predicted Russian winner. Hardy mashes up an opponent he had beaten before upon arriving home. What makes this film work is not whether the brothers meet in the ring, it regards how the fight will determine the future of their family. Nolte is very good as a father who can only stand by and hope that life will show him favor. Frank Grillo plays Edgerton's trainer who will obviously whip him into shape for the climax. The film has two big weaknesses. One is Jennifer Morrison as Edgerton's wife whose role is predictable and cardboard. The other is the corny reactions to town folks rooting, including a school principal who elevates hypocrisy. It serves as a look into the decision to engage in such a career. Score: 8 ½ / 10",

Everything was so unpredictable, fights, tournament and what an end, totally unexpected, two brothers in the final. What a story!!! Really, I think this film is in top 10, no top 5, worst sport-drama movies in last decade. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your time and money on this film. It is absolute mystery how Warrior reached 8.3 on IMDb. It should be in best case 5, so that people know that they cannot expect any intellectual challenge. So, I guess this is a movie for Ultimate fight fans, because that is the only that it can offer, fight scenes (pumped and not realistic). And believe, this has nothing with a fact that I am a female. I watched Warrior with my brother and husband, both of them shared my opinion. Nothing new, full of stereotypes. OK, I will admit one bright spot.

228,15 August 2015,troyputland,10, Warrior is Incredible Entertainment,"Wow, where to begin? It's hands down the finest sports film since the 80's. The two brother's story is just as enthralling as the mixed martial arts fighting. Clocking in at just over 140 minutes, Warrior distributes time evenly on developing its characters as its does on the fighting. The two brothers have incredible back stories, neither of which force the viewers bias in any shape or form, making the MMA tournament that they both enter enticing, fulfilling and aesthetic. Tommy Conlon (Hardy) trains under his father Paddy (Nick Nolte), learning discipline and eager to be the best. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) fights for his family and the money to stop his home from being repossessed. Polar opposite motives and personalities. Their one, common ground lies in their mistrust for their ex-alcoholic father. The Conlon brother's first on-screen meeting's even more suspenseful than De Niro and Pacino in Heat.

231,22 August 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,2, Emotional garbage for people who know nothing about MMA.,"This film was nothing like MMA in real life. It's enough to say alone of how unrealistic it is, if you break a limb during the fight it's automatically over. You can't continue the fight. Also Rumble would have beaten everyone with ease in real life. Sparring sessions were unrealistic, too much meatheads. Soviet atribute is just a joke... The story of two brothers getting to the top and fighting each other is just cheap emotional garbage, it does not happen in real life and even if it did it would have been nothing like that. Also if you skip interviews, fight promotions and stuff, you won't get to fight in the first place, it's just so stupid of a film. Casual movie goes must think this is so realistic and stuff, but in fact, this film is pathetic and disgrace to real MMA fighting. Did I mention that you don't make loud fighting sound when you fight? Well in this film all punches and kicks are have loud sounds. The only thing which I admire is that they got many MMA celebrities to be in this film. But the most important thing is I'm not even a fan of MMA, I know all this just from common knowledge, so wait till you hear the real fans talk about this garbage...",

In the style of Rocky, this is a combat sport movie, on the lives of two brothers- who set out on different paths that converge in one titanic fight in the ring, and the greatest thing about this movie is that you don't get to pick sides, you root for both of them till the very end.",

The ending was original but not bad, but seems rushed. if the movie had been built up to show their past more, maybe to show how the brothers used to be really close but then their drunken father drove them away and the death of their mother caused them to lose contact.

Hardy gives one his earliest best performances that you have seen since then in Mad Max, Dark Knight and Dunkirk. He is amazing with his stoic dark expressions and you can read his pain and torment without him saying a word. Edgerton and Nolte give strong performances that tells how even through deep dysfunction family love conquers in the end. The fight scenes are real and gritty filmed amazingly up close so you feel like your in the ring. The triumph is in the story and the characters that you feel for and are jumping out of your seat for as you root for them to conquer their openents which are hate, fear, and self worth.

250,4 May 2020,ryanwinning1,8, UFC fans will be disappointed. More for marines!,"If they could have gotten the fighting right this easily could have been the best sports movie ever. The director had an idea of the emotion he wanted from the MMA scenes and it was just so wrong. No strategy at all just going straight for the jugular, and then these huge flamboyant throws with no takedown defence whatsoever.....I think the director had more of an idea of the life of a marine and he wanted to tie that into this movie. MMA fighters are so much more loose in real life than what this film shows. In reality most former marines that have tried their luck at MMA get a rude awakening because they are so tight, and aggressive like Tommy's fighting style in this movie that they're predictable and get caught with counter-strikes by professional fighters. For Tommy to go into this tournament and just knock 3 world class fighters out in a row within seconds is along the lines of Neo dodging bullets for the first time in the matrix for realness. Fighting is more of an art form than just raw aggression the way this movie portrays it. The acting in Warrior is absolutely incredible and drew me in better than any other sports movie maybe besides Rocky. Nick Nolte so deserved to be nominated for an oscar for what he did. Shout out to Bryan Callen impersonating Joe Rogan for what he does ringside at UFC. I loved that part too especially since Joe and Bryan are buddies in real life. Great acting. Bad fighting. 8/10",

Please, be advised that this is a higher grade than for example 'Gone with a wind' has. I do agree that the movie as any other art should be the matter of taste as music for example, but I can't say that Justin Bieber's song deserves higher music grade than Mozart's Requiem only because I am impressed with it (I am not, that was only an example).

254,12 December 2011,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,10, It's anybody's fight.,"Warrior is an absolute juggernaut of a movie. It's a well built powerhouse that simply flawed me. Many may look at it as another fighting/sports movie, but Gavin O'Connor has the sense to delve much deeper. The biggest draw to this film are the two protagonists. Most films give us just one to follow, or a single team to root for. Here we are given two brothers that move closer and closer towards confronting each other. Hardy is exceptional as the emotionally damaged younger brother. A war hero and an absolute beast of a man, he tears his opponents apart in a matter of seconds. There are moments when it seems as though he has lost all control. His older estranged brother is fighting for his family. Now a physics teacher, he turned his back on fighting a long time ago. Unlike his destructive brother, Edgerton must wait for his moment to strike. Giving us two protagonists means we are not sure who to cheer on. During their individual scenes, they are the hero, but the final is obviously there for them to fight for the prize and get out the animosity they hold towards each other. We also have Nolte playing the reformed alcoholic wife-beater. He is stuck in purgatory, as Hardy allows him to train him, but cannot mention anything outside of fighting. Nolte cherishes this opportunity, but is knocked down by both sons. He is gradually taken to the brink, where his breakdown scene has Oscar slapped all over it. The fights are epic. Even though the trailer shows you who will be in the final, the journey is still powerful. Bringing tears of excitement and joy as well as clutching tightly to the arm of the chair. By the time these two face off, it's impossible to know for certain who will stand victorious. A dramatic and exciting film that uses the genre's conventions to its advantage.",

Everything is just awful. Just awful. I have been training in MMA and competed in wrestling for about 10 years now and this movie is so inaccurate it makes me sick. Its as if the producers and writers of this movie have never even watched a fight before in there life & have not a clue about the sport. This movie is 100% just to excite viewers who have no knowledge of the sport, but a complete insult to fans. The fight scenes are just unexplainable and stupid.

The performances are across-the-board phenomenal. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton give movie star turns and should be nominated for Best Actor, and Nick Nolte hasn't been this good since AFFLICTION and should win Best Supporting. He's the best American actor never to win an Oscar and that should change this winter. Edge of your seat excitement, raw emotion, humor--WARRIOR does everything. Expectations weren't high going in (the trailer is very pedestrian and makes it look like a genre sports movie, which it isn't), but I was completely floored and wiped out by the end (a song by The National plays over the film's final scene and if it doesn't make you cry you're tougher than I am).

284,3 February 2013,PapaRock145,8, Touching and exciting movie overall,"I am not a huge MMA fan, so I didn't know what I was getting into when I decided to watch Warrior (2011) I was pleasantly surprised to see such an entertaining story that really had heart to it. It is about two brothers who leave each other's life very early on. The result is a very tensioned relationship that lasted into their adulthood. The two brothers both end up in a competition together which pits them against each other (a little clichéd, yes) The fight scenes are very well done with enthusiastic commentary by Bryan Callen and Sam Sheridan that really kept the pace quick. Joel Edgerton does a fine job as the more straight-edged chemistry teacher brother but Tom Hardy really steals the show as Tommy, the more disturbed (ex- Marine) and troubled brother of the too. Hardy certainly has the ""crazed"" look down as it shows up many times during the film much to my amusement. Nolte is great also as the father although I would've liked to see more of a conclusion between him and his sons (although maybe it was better off this way...) The story isn't without it's flaws. The school children who set up a drive-thru theater to watch their chemistry teacher battle it out was a little cringe-worthy. The kids were just a little over-exaggerated with their ""Go Mr. C!"" signs and their over-sized golf shirts and high-fiving and hollering every time they are shown. The story is obviously ridiculously unrealistic for a couple different reasons but I think the film is not going for realism but trying to tell a heart-felt story.

What launched this movie into a ""favorite"" category for me was the heart and soul of the movie. There are lots of movies where fighters train and win the big fight, but usually there is a lack of connection to the characters. Not so with Warrior, we find a completely broken family with extreme baggage(drunk dad, bitter brothers, money problems) where the real fight takes place at home, not in the ring. The family must overcome hurt to be reconciled to one another. Not to worry, the movie is not monopolized by Hallmark moments or filled with cookie cutter sentimental moments. Its all rather gritty and not always comfortable to watch. In addition there is some radical fight scenes and awesome knockouts. Is it unlikely that two brothers end up fighting each other in a world wide fight competition?...yes. I am willing to overlook this unlikely possibility because of the wonderful execution and it should be known that the UFC does have brothers who are great fighters in the same weight class so stranger things have happened.",

It does deserve credit for bucking convention in a few ways, particularly in building to the inevitable finale with two potentially viable results. Typically the happy ending writes itself halfway through the picture and then just goes through the motions to get us there: in Warrior, we follow both perspectives for the whole of the film and either outcome would make for an appropriate, warm ride into the sunset. The fight scenes are fun, if highly exaggerated, takes on an in-vogue sport; it's about as realistic a portrayal of mixed martial arts as Rocky and The Replacements were to boxing and pro football. Nick Nolte deserves special mention for grizzling up and embracing his inner Burgess Meredith, but I didn't see anything above and beyond from leading men Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton.",

What ruined the movie for me is the fact that each fighter in the Championship fight, Tommy and Brenden Conlon, each had three fights prior to the Championship. Tommy never had a fight past 30 seconds never mind going into the second round, Brenden on the other hand goes to the third round and gets pummeled in almost every fight prior to the one against Tommy. Brenden would barely be able to stand let alone win, the Russian literally suplexed Brenden twice, yes WWE style. Other than the ending it was a great film, I just cant get over Tommy losing that fight, it's just not possible, even on film, but what was very realistic were all the gay Marine tribal tattoos Tommy had on his arms.",
314,19 March 2012,meeza,9, The Mixed Martial Artists get it done in this winning flick!,"Movie Warriors, come out and seeeeee ""Warrior"". You will not regret it! I am still dumbfounded how this movie did not make more money at the box office. ""Warrior"" is a gritty film starring Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as estranged brothers Tommy and Brendan Conlon. Tommy is an introverted, rage-filled former Marine who wants to make a return run to mixed martial arts and participate in a ""big money, winner takes all"" infamous tournament called Sparta. The elder Brendan is a devoted husband, father of two girls, and physics teacher; how is that for a white-picket fence physics equation. When Brendan cannot make the mortgage payments on his home and is on the brink of foreclosure, he decides to also make a return run to mixed martial arts to bring in the extra flow, and therefore also trains for Sparta. So yes, Tommy and Brendan do yell in unison in one of the movie's scenes ""We Are Sparta!!!""; OK, that did not happen but its just part of the close to ""300"" puns that I insert in each of my movie reviews. Nick Nolte co-stars as Paddy Conlon, the alcoholic father of Tommy and Brendan who definitely did not play ""paddy cake"" with his sons during their childhood. In other words, Brendan and Tommy do not take a liking to Paddy due to his past lush life. Tommy does ask Paddy to train him for Sparta in just a mere trainer-fighter relationship. Jennifer Morrison also co-stars as Tess, Brendan's supporting but scared wife; and Frank Grillo puts it in the acting grill with his supporting effort as Frank Campana, Brendan's friend and after some St. Brendan praying & begging to Frank, eventual trainer. I will not reveal too much what happens in the Sparta, but let's say that the Conlon brothers from the same father & mother, do make their match. Director Gavin O'Connor excelled in helming ""Warrior"" in all aspects of the movie including the fight scenes, the brother/father relationships, and in the sport that is mixed martial arts. O'Connor and fellow screenwriters Anthony Tambakis & Cliff Dorfman did not exactly pin down a perfect screenplay in ""Warrior"", but good enough to take worthy of. The uprising Tom Hardy, who delivered in my eyes one of the most astounding acting performances in the last 5 years with his bravado leading performance in ""Bronson"", continues to rise up the thespian charts with another strong performance here as Tommy. Joel Edgerton did not match Hardy's performance ""pound for pound"" but Edgerton's work as Brendan was mixed with more good than bad. But the granddaddy or at least daddy performance of them all was Nick Nolte's stellar work as the Moby Dick obsessed pop Paddy, who even garnered a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor nomination for his passionate thespian effort. I must cut now to the part of the brilliant editing of ""Warrior"". Unfortunately, the film's editing did not make the cut of the Best Editing Oscar nominated films but it sure deserved it. So get your kicks and thrills (and maybe a few punches) with the magnetism of ""Warrior"". ***** Excellent",

What is so impressive to me is that none of the three guys in the movie (Hardy, Edgerton, Nolte) seems to know a way to show their deep love to any of the others. They are wearing this ""fighter person suit"" (Hardy especially. brilliant) but are also able to show us the vulnerable child that was left behind. I thought it is only me but when I showed this gem of a film to my niece, who is a big movie fan and was only 18 years old at the time (I should mention she has also two brothers), I could observe my own first reaction to it multiplied by ten: she was crying so hard in the end (and also in between) that we needed to comfort her.

After all, the writer couldn't write a story well unless he had something in common with the people they were fighting? It's a shame that it's turned into a family drama because the subject matter is interesting. I think family dramas are easy to set up. That's because it's easy to explain the motivation of the main character. What do they fight for? For my family. Like. As soon as the story gets a little bit stuck, they turn it into a family drama. Well, from a business point of view, if it's a family drama, there might not be many mistakes, but as a movie fan, I'm tired of watching family dramas.
The director also made a movie called The Accountant. I like that movie better than this one. However, that movie also had a pretty big theme of brothers in the last part of the movie. I wonder if this director can only write about brothers? Normally, I'd think they'd try to avoid story overlap. If you haven't made a bunch of movies yet the story is similar, I have to suspect that your talent is already exhausted.

There is a beginning, a middle and and end. The story line is great!! There are these two main characters who are brothers. One of the brothers is Marine and really mad at the world. The big brother is a school teacher who is about to lose his home. They can both fight. Tommy is the younger brother and hits people so hard that he knocks them out with one punch! The older brother - Teacher, is good to but he is not that mean an angry. They both have Nick Nolte as a father - can you say Oscar? Nick was awesome as the father that for some reason they both hate. That is never really explained. I think it's because their Mom died of cancer and Nick was too busy drinking booze to care. Anyway, there is this one great scene where Nick can't take it anymore so he drinks booze and listens to Moby Dick with his walkman. He is crying and screaming the words to Moby Dick (the novel, not Led Zeppelin song). So, the fights are great. Teacher is at one point fired from his school for being a fighter by the principle - Mr. Z. One thing leads to another and in a match called Sparta - the two brother do so well that they eventually have to FIGHT Each other!!!! This final fight was better than Bloodsport, Enter the Dragon and Karate Kid all combined!! The two brothers also hate each other for some reason. Actually Teacher doesn't hate Tommy as much as Tommy hates Teacher. I can't figure that out either. All you need to do is watch this movie and be entertained with the great fighting scenes!

I was hoping for a good performance from Nick Nolte because I'm a steadfast fan, but I was not sure if Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton could make a good match with Nolte. They outdid themselves; they performed with the skills of veterans, not overreaching and maintaining their respective character's persona. Nolte was obviously perfect for the part; Hardy is far more versatile than I knew (I've seen several films in which he was supporting actor) and Edgerton did hold his own, not weakening the top tier cast (I'm not yet a fan, so am slightly reserved in my praise). The supporting cast, talented and hot looking Jennifer Morrison in particular, did as fine a job with her role as Amy Adam did in 'Fighter', and the rest helped make this movie as good as it is.",

I was equally impressed with the character of the the father, Nick Nolte. His own struggles with alcohol, the war, the family troubles and the distance created by all of it. The military aspect didn't quite tell a tale there and was far from accurate in legalities but the ideal affect was achieved, the government always reclaims what is theirs according to them. The script writing was a bit sluggish, like pulling teeth at times. I don't care for missed opportunities to say what should be said in any situation. When I write, nothing is left hanging unless it has to be. I believe in writing of true human emotion and not Hollywood style where you have conversation with huge emotional impact but never say all that should be said. Mostly, the human race is not like that. We feel it, we say it. This movie tends to leave too much hanging in the air. Thick pains of oppressed emotions. Still love the movie though.",

They both show the love real brothers will share in real life. One fighting for saving of his family (daughter and the house) and the other one to give the money to his best (dead) friend's wife. Tom Hardy really looked like a MMA fighter in this movie. He was bulky and strong and looked as if he can really kick some serious stuff. Joel on the other hand looks perfectly like a professor with a family. The ending scene kind of made me cry where Joel just lifted up Tom and started walking out of the ring without caring for the officials or anyone else.,

374,18 January 2012,nickmesafilms,10, Warrior (2011) - Fight for Family! Fight for Country!,"""Warrior"" is another of those classic boxing movies with powerful characters and strong fight scenes. This mixed-martial arts drama is a combination between ""Rocky"" and ""The Fighter"". This is half underdog story, half boxing movie, and half brotherhood tale. ""Warrior"" is set with an ex-Marine named Tommy, portrayed by Tom Hardy (starring in the upcoming ""Dark Knight Rises""), who teams up with his recovering alcoholic father, portrayed by Nick Nolte, to help him train for the biggest event in the history of the MMA. On the other half of the story, we meet Tommy's brother Brendan, portrayed by Joel Edgerton. He's a married man, a public high school teacher, and a former MMA fighter. But when he loses his money, and is about to lose his house, Brendan also enters the MMA competition to save his family. Then, when these two brothers team up for the same tournament, they have to finally confront each other, and the forces that tore them apart, in the biggest battle of their lives. All I have to say is this: ""this is awesome!"". This is a spectacular, amazing, exhilarating, powerful, and unforgettable movie, and this is one of the best movies of 2011. I was completely blown away by this movie. I was kept on the edge of my seat, wanting for more. Director Gavin O' Connor knows how to make an underdog boxing story. This movie has a bunch of well-written material, fine directing, and tons of powerful fight scenes. But it's the casting ensemble that really carries the movie. Tom Hardy does an amazing job playing such a powerful character, and I can't wait to see this guy in the final Batman movie. Joel Edgerton delivers the finest and underrated performance in this movie, and I really like this guy. But, it's Nick Nolte that deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work as Tommy and Brendan's ex-alcoholic and emotionally damaged father. I really thought that Nick Nolte steals the entire movie, because he makes the movie good, with all of his heartbreaking and dramatic moments, and he still has lot of charm in his heart. The cast is truly the best thing in the whole movie. The fight scenes are top-notch, the cast is well-acted, and the finale leaves you with jaw-dropping surprises, and edge-of-your-seat thrills. ""Warrior"" is one of the most entertaining boxing movies ever made, and it's truly one of the best of 2011. ""Warrior"", in my review, ""a dramatically powerful brotherhood story"".",

Warrior is Cliché in movie terms, but cliché in real life terms too which is not cliché but is. Make sense? Warrior is a movie where you know the direction it's heading in, but at the same time, it's a movie with some very real, disturbing and painful issues going on. The MMA fighting is what's going on on the surface, but beneath the surface, that's where the movie really lies, and that's what makes Warrior a truly great film and above most(if not all)films in this genre.

It is clearly visible dude. And what was his father doing in a taxi in the end (out of the stadium) and he was back in the end....there is no meaning you dumb A**. It looks like director was throwing away like giving the audience some thing 'UNEXPECTED'. I am watching the MMA since years. Most dumbest thing was the makeup. Who is the idiot (makeup artist). Did he ever saw any of the boxing or sports movies...!!! Look at the ROCKY movies dude and learn some thing from them. makeup was so unreal. Any one who will be the head of MMA will never award the 5M to the winner of that match. But in the end it was nothing but Bull S#!t. I was actually ready to rate this movie 9/10 before watching it. But after watching I thought 6 is more than enough. I don't understand why makers of the movies think that always making something different would satisfy the viewer.

Similar to A Knight's Tale, the movie far exceeds the simplicity or sometimes outright silliness of it's premise. It is further elevated by some symbolism and a few interpretations of events that other reviewers have already noted.

If you like UFC and have any spare time at all watch this film. I have watched films like circle of pain and never back down and this movie beats them hands down. It made me smile, laugh and even almost made me cry at the end. The two brother in this film are perfect, they played their part very well and the dad was FANTASTIC. He was the perfect actor for this role because of his previous role's which made the film that much better.

Howeve, this doesnt matter because the film is very engrossing and at the end moving also. The actors all many to portray their characters in a complex way as not to give away too much at once. Nick Nolte as the father is the most convincing, particularly at the end when he is finally forced to notice his forgotten son. The characters are developed perfectly. Their background stories are more functional and predictable than interesting. In general, the film is pretty good. However, the characters do get lost in the second half because far too much time is spent in the ring rather than actually focusing on the characters. Its a good film and I would reccommend that people watch this film ahead of other similar films, such as The Fighter. 7/10",

I mean, its a gritty underdog tale about second chances and punching people in a ring for pride, love, cash and redemption. It's also set in and around Philadelphia and features a growling old trainer, sweaty brutes, a training montage and a bunch of rousing scenes that'll send chills down your spine and tears down your cheek. If you're yet to fathom what I'm getting at, Warrior resembles that old 1970's classic Rocky. A truly unforgettable film that very few people still have on their ""to see"" list yet the unfortunate catalyst to countless amounts of barrel-chested fighting films that were just not worthy of John Avilsen's Oscar winning rock. Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Split Decisions, Fighting, Never Back Down, Best of the Best, the list goes on and on and on. All jokes aside, Warrior should fall into that category with consummate ease. It should be a superficial, clichéd piece of trash. It should be a terrible film. But it isn't. Not by a long shot.",

To a point i was right, none of the performances in this are as good as Christian Bales, but that being said, everyone did a great job in this movie. Nick Nolte gave a marvelous performance that should be worthy of a Best supporting actor nom. The previews let you know the gist of the story, two brothers enter a MMA tournament where they eventually face off. Even though they are brothers they are very different in character and the way they were raised, the only thing in common being their dislike for their father. The movie shows their current and past life struggles to get them to where they are in the movie and it all leads up to awesome finale.

We start out with him, he gets more screen time in the beginning, etc. The whole crowd, as well as us, the viewers has its preference on Tom. I was thinking, why this much hate to dad and Brandon. The longer I watched the more my preference switched to Brandon. Which almost feels like a fight in your head, like the fight between the brothers.

The interpersonal relationships displayed in this film are presented impeccably and with such precision that you cannot help but care about the results of every action through out. If you can watch this movie without building an emotional tie to at least one of the characters, then maybe your life has been to easy and you need to take a walk to the other side of the tracks and let this movie open your eyes to the complexity and development of unconditional love. Warrior leaves the question to the audience as to who the title is attributed and it is definitely something worth thinking about.

Overall the acting in this movie is textbook perfect. If Nick Nolte doesn't get an Oscar nomination - there is no justice. While both lead actors are in their mid 30's & thus seem a little old for the punishing fight scenes - they do pull it off. I understand that both of them suffered injuries during filming. No matter they are both great in their performances. I've seen them separately in other films & they remain two actors worth keeping an eye on. I don't see them doing too many romantic comedies however. But maybe they will pleasantly surprise us in the future.,

Finally saw this on blu ray and in a word wow. The story works well and newsflash here, both the stars can really act (Tom Hardy of course is Bane in the new Batman movie). The mma and choreography in general is crisp and sharp and you can't help but cheer as you watch. I really don't get why such a well made movie didn't do better at the box especially when you look at some of the rubbish that does well. Two brothers who went on very different journeys in life with an alcoholic father and nothing in common to unite them. I even love the contrasting styles. You have the former marine who blasts in short and sweet and finishes the job. His brother a school teacher on suspension for prizefighting mma (ironically). He is a thinker but former mma star in his own right and is a lot more technical and calculating for a better word.

In Warrior, it doesn't follow the traditions. The mixed martial arts tournament serves only as a backdrop to a broken family composed of two brothers and their father. You have the elder brother, Brendan who enters the tournament to save his home from foreclosure while the younger brother Tommy enters to make a promise to his fallen comrade by giving the prize money to the widowed. The father however, longs to redeem himself by reconciling with his children who also are...estranged. What's so unique about Warrior is that there is no clear protagonist and antagonist, it is about their own issues that they're up against, particularly Tommy who has this deep resentment towards his father and elder brother. It is a story about forgiveness and redemption from the sins of the past, I'm hoping that this film would get Oscar nominations. It's a highly recommended movie for the family and their teenage children as well.",

But i had a tear in this movie which was an unusual feeling for me.

Brendan wants the money to save his family's livelihood and Tommy is fighting to earn it just to give it all away to a widow of a fallen comrade. They are both portrayed as protagonists however to me it seemed that in the end Brendan came out looking like the selfish ass in the end. The final fight makes me so angry because there were so many opportunities for Brendan to do what he did during the fight before the fight. Tommy's lack of taking credit for his heroic actions and him taking responsibility for something that wasn't his fault makes him the selfless protagonist the one you root for because he is so selfless, honorable, and heroic. Brendan is the person you cheer for because he is the underdog. In my opinion Brendan only won the fight because he was a cheap and manipulative fighter not a better one.

Tom Hardy was good...nick was awesome....but the movie was very slow at times and kind of predictable since the very beginning...it was a movie about throwing punches that lacks the PUNCH itself....on the other hand, two rookies suddenly starting to beat up world's top ranked MMA fighters is just too much to digest, and kind of an insult to the sport itself! and i'm not even talking about the plot- holes...watch ""Crying Fist""instead and you'll see how characters can be built.",

Tom Hardy's acting was extremely unbelievable, in my opinion, and I couldn't connect with his character emotionally; what is up with the teenage boy attitude?

Just a little lack of daring on a story basis from a Hollywoodian perspective. But it's really all we can reproach to this piece of art. I cannot not think of the The Wrestler and the not yet disfigured Mickey Rourke (of 9 1/2 weeks) when I see the lost soul in this movie who grew up with the mother and left the army shamefully. Just a bit too American maybe... just maybe... The realization is sensational. At the end of the movie we really feel like getting out of reality. This movie was the best that UFC could expect. In 'Warrior' We are deep in the Greek empire as noticed by the father of our two heroes somewhere in the begging. This movie is an epic journey. Who know, maybe in two thousand years mythology will be about watching such movies... I can hardly grasp how awesome it will be to study history in 2000 years.",

Hardy, Nolte and Edgerton along with the rest of the cast, deliver such an emotional and powerful story in Warrior. The film may not please those who want all-out MMA action but what it does deliver is a real-life story that we can relate to and believe. This film hits hard, both physically and emotionally, as we are reminded of what really matters in life; the love we have for those close to us. I, personally, think that the acting from the characters is real and you can feel it.",
479,10 December 2011,rasull-ramad,8, almost a classic,"This is the best movie about MMA fighting. It is definitely not better than ""The Fighter"" or ""Rocky"". I wish it was the best but it wasn't. I'm sorry. Where did it fail? The weak script is partly to blame. Go back to ""Rocky"" and see what made it a classic. There's not enough establishing wide shot to make it a classic. If you watch spielberg's movie than you know what i'm talking about. The first half was good. But the second half started to play like a music video right up to the brothers duel. Not enough clever and powerful dialogues to fill the last 30 minutes. Even the fight announcements from the ring masters would help. Its just too silent for me towards the end. So that emotional ride for me got lost. A little bit more wide shot of the actual fight would be contribute would make it more real. See ""rocky"" and ""the fighter"" All in all a very good job! Make the sequel a classic please !! yay",

This is an illness I suffer from myself and could so relate to why he was like he is, It was shocking how realistic it made that character seem to me, and I have never experienced that emotion from any film I have ever watched. Putting all that aside this is a proper heartfelt sport/action/drama movie anyway and is well worth a watch, and will leave you feeling glad you gave up the time to do so. I started watching this movie with low expectations, as i wrongly assumed it would be another story-less waste of an hour and a half or more of my life, but was shocked and surprised how good it is.

I finally got to watch it and was pleasantly surprised on how well the whole movie was executed from start to end. The movie had many chances to slip into the ordinary but they carefully kept off that road and made a really convincing movie. The lead characters are neatly developed without overdoing any of their individual traits. The fights also had the right balance to it, thereby gelling with the rest of the movie rather than standing out and causing a distraction. 'Balance' is the right word to describe this movie as all the elements are carefully balanced to deliver a good movie. Definitely worth a watch.",

To do this movie justice, one must appreciate its beauty in all aspects. The acting is excellent; especially on Nick Nolte's part. The story progression was not cheesy. Everything was delivered in a subtle and seamless way. As the story goes on, you get to connect the dots and understand where every character is coming from. The direction is simply awesome. The ending might be considered cliche by some, but I find it different. ",

I can't believe that it didn't get a wider release in Canada, or somehow slipped by me. I am not a big UFC fan, or fight fan for that matter, and nor is my wife (who balled her eyes out in several emotional climaxes of the film); so don't believe that it's a film only for fight fans. It is in fact more of a family drama with UFC as the vehicle and backdrop in which to tell that story.",

It's incredibly intense, raw, and above all beautiful. The relationship between the main characters, their own personal fights that they take into the cage... Astounding. Just rewatched it and I still cannot believe what an incredible adventure this movie is each time you see it. Acting, music, camare angles... Incredible.",
491,30 May 2020,trgz,6," Good fight film, just not a great film.","For anyone like me who started to watch this and was concerned over the terrible first scene (so much back story shoe-horned into such awkward dialogue) and almost gave up right away - this is for you: I had this film queued up to watch for over a year or two now so I decided to stay with it.
Sure the acting is pretty wooden in places (Nolte nominated? laminated more like); the dialogue and plot are cliched; the fight montage is laughable; and some of the main characters fail to come across as anything but comical, but the film has something that keeps it going and there is some good acting (usually when Hardy gets a chance), and there are some good moments that aren't in the ring, just not many elsewhere.
It's not the great film that many would have you think but it's not terrible either. The fights are where it shines, and my pulse was racing during these, so if you're not a fight-film fan then set your sights a little on the low side if you want to get through the build-up to the final scene (which I'll avoid any comment at all about).",
492,18 January 2014,zeashana786,1, Brenden should have died,"The movie presented an obvious plot line and gave a new perspective to getting beaten up. Giving the blueprint for how to win UFC, just get beaten relentlessly for 3 rounds and then perform an camora and break one of your opponents limb's on the bell. Tommy had knocked out several fighters in the first round but remarkably his brother seems to be able to gain super- human abilities and defies the laws of UFC. As Brenden didn't punch for 3 rounds and was stuck in a full mount against a first round knockout artist by making a impenetrable guard impervious to the ground and pound. Overall the director should learn some UFC rules and tommy should have knocked out Brenden in the first round. The movie leaves a lot of questions unchecked at the end plus the fact that Brendon had a abandoned MMA for teaching seems to have helped him rather than doing the opposite. There is no logic to the final fight and has a predictable ending as the styles made it obvious that the submission had to win.",

I wasn't looking for the final fight to happen as it would mean either of the two protagonist to go down which I was so biased towards both of them at the same time.,
494,1 April 2012,rjfblu,10, You just can't ignore Beethoven in Warrior.,"With all due respect to the excellence of film artists amidst the hype of Hollywood stardom (even without having seen the other movies), this one, ""WARRIOR,"" I really wanted to get BEST PICTURE 2012, and I could see no other in its place. And far be it from me to say, but I think the voters kind of dissed Beethoven because he was too wonderful in this picture, but then again, I'm a musician. Nobody could have rightly fit Beethoven into personal tragedy in these times involving the effects of war rising out of decades of U.S. conflict in the Middle East—beginning back with Desert Storm and Kuwait and Iran, and then later Afghanistan and Iraq after 09/11, and God knows what after. Fittingly, the film brought much of this into play. Called ""Warrior,"" the story tells of two, warrior types, brothers in conflict affected by the unexplainable things that face our own human condition, just trying to grow up and raise a family in this world, and then with this utter senselessness of war pounding them further down. Immediately you pick up on the tension happening with the brothers. And Eegad! They're Irish! And thencatharsis takes you in—you begin to feel that purging, evolving steadily, slowly out of the Beethoven streaming ""Ode to Joy"" gloriously all throughout. And you felt this burliness too, of the fighters—despite the terribly awesome intensity of emotions the brothers were called to portray, their smash-down burliness served only to heighten an indescribable ""machismo"" in these two actors, whose names I did not register immediately, so much were they into their character—Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. Nick Nolte, on the other hand, was just coolly brilliant. Right at the beginning, you caught glimpses of his saddened eyes of repentance for his derelict ways, with just a wee smile of hidden pride in the boys. Aw jeez, I felt like I was almost watching ""Long Day's Journey into Night"" — seriously! The whole cast and crew should still be partying up! Amen?",

If Rocky was a movie that you liked , then I am pretty sure you'll like this even more. It has a few stories behind the story that are also very interesting. By the time 20 minutes goes by I knew I was going to like this movie. I originally put the movie in to fall asleep to, but as you might have guessed my interest level was so high there was no way I was going to sleep. After the movie I did sleep but I was probably throwing kicks and punches all night in my sleep. This movie has the right mixture of emotions. Nick Nolte plays a part well suited for him with high's and low's all through the movie. I do like fight movies but never gave one a 10 until this one came along. A must see.",

In this movie however, the acting was really really great. From Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and even Jennifer Morrison! Nick Nolte could very well be nominated for an Oscar. That's how great the acting was. And as a guy was I surprised it made me cry. Character development is so amazing too.

The fight scenes are very well conducted. Seem very real. It's extremely hard to find male actors who can fight AND act, I mean real act at the same time. Tom Hardy is brilliant. Joel Edgerton looks a lot like Conan O'Brian. It's a little weird for me to watch comedian 'Conan OBrian' do fight scenes. Tom Hardy is so sexy in this movie. I love strong men with something vulnerable and childish inside. The love between brothers and father/son is strong yet subtle. Men don't express their love for each other easily and often. I'm touched to the bottom of my heart when I see them communicate their love through fights and arguments. They can seem strong from the outside, harsh to each other. But the love is stronger. I think Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar.",
500,16 January 2012,nathan-276,9, Warrior- 5 Category Review,"Directing 8/10- Solid directing, intriguing shots and well paced. The fight scenes were phenomenally choreographed. Acting 9.5/10- Some of the acting from the extreme minor roles was cheesy but nick nolte, edgerton and hardy gave amazing heartfelt performances. It's sad to see that nolte, in particular, is not getting more recognition for his performance, his performance was riveting. Screenplay 8/10- The screenplay was rather cliché and predictable. However, I have yet to see another sports film a better and deeper character story line. I have also yet to see a mixed martial arts film this deep and heartfelt. So it's original in those aspects. Visual Effects 7/10- Nothing crazy at all visually, but its not needed with a film like this. The fight scenes were filmed with near perfection. Sound Effects/Music 9/10- The music throughout was solid, but what really lifted the film was the ending song. It tied the scene together in such a beautiful fashion. Overall, great film that might sadly be overlooked. Amazing storyline between the characters and definitely one of the best sports films of all time.",

War hero, Russian bad guy, school teacher MMA world champion ??? A broke war veteran, without PST, who will donate his prize money to the widow of his war buddy? The writers had totally NO idea where the story was supposed to be going to. Fragments of anonymous family biographies, desperately linked up to produce a script.

With a cast like this there is hardly anything bad you can say about it. It certainly has heart, certainly has a story, it makes you think, it makes you feel and it makes you relate..and it made me cry. It made me cry because when you look at just how much these men (the family) had been hurting by who did what, when and why which broke the family apart, and then what brings them together even if just about..you just can't help but to think and/or relate to it slightly and cry...or not.

507,6 February 2012,david-tsbernardino,8," The Fighter, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby mixed in one great movie","I was when I consulted the premieres of the week that I came across the despicable poster Warrior. See: two muscular men, naked trunk in a movie called ""Warrior"" and subtitled Portuguese is ""Fighting Between Brothers"". Well, let's say Warrior is buried deep with a picture of these for the first printing. It was when I saw some reviews and by high scores to the film that I thought maybe the thing was not so linear as this, because in almost all the film was held in high esteem, with high scores and the surprising rating of 8.3 on IMDb, that puts you in the top 250 films of all time. And it is confirmed: Warrior is a great movie. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton play two brothers separated for 14 years, created by an alcoholic father, played by Nick Nolte, who taught them to fight from a very young. The first became a lone Marine and a second physics teacher, married and father, which is currently in serious financial trouble. As for the father, this was abandoned by both sons, who ignore and cut off all relations with him, preferring to forget it. That's when Tommy (Tom Hardy) returns to her father's house 14 years after the plot develops, and the biggest tournament in mixed martial arts history will take place. More than a sports movie, Warrior is a great drama with brilliant performances by Nick Nolte (nominated for best supporting actor Oscar) and Tom Hardy, the British actor who had done a good role in Inception and is now preparing to play Bane, the villain of the next Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises, and that is undoubtedly establish itself as a rising star. All dialogues and scenes in which Nick Nolte appears are fantastic. The character of old father, abandoned and sorry that strives for the children to accept and to love again is superbly embodied by the actor, creating thin links between family relationships and the spectator who leaves no doubt moved. Tommy is also excellent. The actor Tom Hardy builds an unstoppable wrestler, dir would be invincible until, apparently almost no feelings, disgusted and enraged by the children he had. A fighter who is more like a rabid dog that a dark man. Already Brendan, played by Joel Edgerton, while also being well can not be at the other two. Perhaps because of its character is more ""normalized"" (Brendan is the underdog, a retired fighter competition in whom nobody believes) the player will eventually have less room to maneuver, or their abilities as an actor does not really go to meet their pairs. We tend more to this second option. The two brothers have to rest a single scene of dialogue throughout the film that reinforces the emotional charge and the separation between the two, this scene once again superb. The dialogues and dramatic aspects, but even very well exploited, in principle would be the highlight of the film. It would not be combat scenes also exceptional realism and movement of a camera that impresses us very original, as if we were to actually watch the UFC fights on Sic Radical, forgetting that those who are fighting are actually actors . Note also positive for the dedication of both actors in learning martial arts and especially for Tom Hardy and his rigorous physical training, appearing on the screen with a monstrous muscles, specifically for the film, causing us to remember ""method actors"" as Adrian Brody in Predators or Christian Bale in Dark Knight and Machinist. Highlight for further engaging soundtrack. Warrior However, despite being a film very dear, is not a bed of roses. There are some inconsistencies that can not be ignored, such as Tommy was fighting unbeatable champion Greco-Roman in his youth, only to have changed his nickname now enters the tournament as an anonymous, unknown if any data on it, which turns out to be ridiculous. The realism of the final scene also ends up leaving something to be desired. And unfortunately Warrior ends up suffering, though not of evil in a maddeningly combat films, this is the successive cuts of exciting fights to see the reaction of secondary characters, sometimes extremely annoying, irrelevant and end up being comical and in bad taste, which is following the fighting at home. Still nothing to compare with the heinous Cinderella Man, perhaps the most disgusting film's dramatic fight I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Warrior actually turns out to be an overview of the best that is done in The Fighter, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby, for all the reasons cited above, and not without a scent, but a little, feeling Hollywood (bloody cuts to Watch the reactions of secondary characters), but this is not necessarily bad, quite the contrary. Causes this is an interesting film, addictive and dare I say inspiring, with a dramatic charge well dosed and ultimately go positively different genres of cinema. Objectively Warrior hangs between good and very good, 3 and 4 stars. However, bearing in mind I have just my personal opinion, and with great satisfaction, to assign the top note and hope that justice is done and Nick Nolte is awarded.",

Movies of 2011 have been all the same, and much of a disappointment, if I may say so. But this one is different. The story of two troubled siblings, each fighting for it's own just cause, whilst avoiding the ghosts of the past. Their worlds will rumble as they will have to face each other, their father and their most well-kept secrets in a fight that will decide the life of the one or the redemption of the other. With every fight won, I cried tears of joy, with every punch taken, I feared for the brothers. This movie is so touching, even though it dwells in the primal sport of the MMA. A true masterpiece, probably the best that 2011 has given us so far.",

So Tommy the younger brother comes out of nowhere and beats the best fighters in the world easily without hesitation, I can buy that. There are always great fighters coming out of nowhere. Now the speed he beat people in was unrealistic but that wasn't what bothered me. What bothered me is his brother Brendan, not the character but what happened to the character. So he was out of fighting for awhile and all of the sudden he joins a contest with the best fighters in the world. He was obviously older than all of them and hadn't fought in years. In every fight he gets beat the crap out of but somehow in the last minutes he pulls off an amazing move and gets a tap out. Literally every fight of the tourney he gets beat up badly but wins. Nobody can take the beatings he took and pull out a win, maybe in the first fight but not in 4 fights in 2 days. And when he did fight in the past he wasn't even good, they mentioned he was a .500 fighter. I don't know that just kinda ruined a great movie for me. The movie as a whole was really good though.",

This is a fantastic movie the end fight with Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton is magnetic and it gives you a movie with 140 minutes of excellent acting and that is why you can watch till the end, that's why I think it is a movie worth watching and one of the most underrated movies ever made. This is a very realistic movie and there are some very upsetting scenes especially that the the father of Tom Hardy's character used to be an alcoholic and then at the start you see that he has been sober for three years but he you can also see that Tom Hardy has turned into and an alcoholic so there some upsetting scenes in this movie but this movie is also so inspirational and uplifting it's basically two brothers who are struggling with there with there life and they both do boxing and in the end they fight it out as two brothers trying to win 5 million dollars fighting for there own life I was crying in the at the end of the fight because it means you can do anything and that's why I think it's one of the best movies about MMA and everyone should see please go watch this movie you will not regret one single thing about this movie it is perfect so yeah go check out.",

Tommy, deeply resentful of his father (Nick Nolte) and brother, begrudgingly seeks his father's help to train for an upcoming MMA Tournament. He makes it clear to his father that he wants nothing to do with him, other than to train him just like he did when he was an up-and coming high school wrestling champion. Tommy has a lot of skeletons buried deep in his closet, all of which slowly start to come out as the film progresses.",

Where do I begin, this is a movie about a family and how fighting (MMA) affects their lives. Honestly, do not be misled by the title, while fighting is a part of the story this really is a movie about family. From the offset and from the trailers we know two brothers will be doing battle for money in the mixed martial arts arena. It sounds like a cheesy 80s movie but it is far from it. What makes this movie work is the fact that we come to understand how this dysfunctional family comes to fight for money. That's the core of the story, two brothers with history who can only settle it in one way. I won't say which brother wins but it is one hell of a thrill ride to get to that point. But more importantly this is a movie that just works, and I have to tell you it is an Oscar worthy story.",

Tom Hardy is a stand out in this film with his portrayal of a man with the bad boy look but when you see the film you know why. It's like all the Rocky movies put into one and it shows us why he is now a Hollywood star. Nick Nolte does amazing in his role as the father in the film and Joel Edgerton also gives a stunning performance in this film of determination and grit. The film starts out a bit slow and if you haven't seen the trailer then you probably aren't sure what it's about but within 30 minutes you pretty much know what the story is about and although in my eyes the ending was a bit shocking, I still feel that it ended well and the characters were given a good ending to the film.",

526,3 October 2011,scottramage313,10, More than a... 'fighting' movie.,"I don't often write reviews, but on this occasion I felt I must for the simple reason this movie really moved me. It's more than just a fighting movie. It's a movie of life. A broken home, a war vet, a family struggling to get by. A good.... no... fantastic all-round movie. Basically the story goes two brothers, one, the war vet, the other a teacher, not able to pay the bills and look after his family the way he wants to, compete in a mma contest. (That's mixed-martial-arts for those of you who don't know.) Yes it may be an obvious outcome, the brothers have to fight each other in the end. But the movie has so many more levels to it than that. All of the leading actors, Joel Edgerton, Nick Nolte, and of course Tom Hardy are all really on-form. Good to see Nick Nolte back on top after an unfortunate couple of years, and that may be why his performance is so good because he can relate to this in real life as he plays a troubled alcoholic. But for me Tom Hardy steals the show. This is an actor who is really on fire just now. It doesn't seem to matter what part he plays, whether it be a prisoner in Bronson (again a fantastic performance) or an mma/war vet he plays it like the part what made for him. He plays this part perfectly and I don't think there is a single actor at the moment who could have played the part better. Go see this. You will not be disappointed.",

It was so great, I am forced to make up a word for it.... Scrumtralessent! But really, this is a great movie. Nick Noltie gives the performance of his life in this movie (nearl bringing me to tears at points) and Tom Hardy and Jeol Edgerton give it there all in this Rocky-Esq movie. The level of emotion and power given in this movie is unbelievable!",
528,27 February 2014,midgetman0599,10, Very emotional and very moving,"Warrior depicted a great view on the every day lives of two brothers. The fact that they were both raised in a bad environment together really adds to the emotional feeling while i watched this movie. Brendan a man in his early forty's interpreted a struggling man with financial problems with a family to worry about. Tommy, the youngest brother, went A-Wall in the military and has been hiding out in his home town. Tommy had promised a friend that if anything happened to him, Tommy would take care of his friends family. With each brother having a need for a big pay day, the Sparta Tournament drew the brothers together. Their father, a former drunk, tries desperately to communicate with Brendan. Brendan wants nothing to do with the old man due to problems in the past. The boy's father ends up training Tommy for the Sparta Tourney. Both determined to win the tournament, the brothers end up in the finals, fighting each other for the prize money. The emotional spectrum of this event just overwhelms any person/persons watching this movie. Brendan desperately tries to get Tommy to tap out, but Tommy pushes on, determined to win. Brendan puts both of Tommy's arms out of their socket. After crippling his brother, Brendan finally becomes victorious...leading his brother out of the cage....even though Tommy is to be taken into custody by military personnel. The overall feeling that the brothers are finally back together after years of fighting and not talking..it is just outstanding!!! This movie shoots over my expectations for a MMA movie!!",
529,16 September 2011,bsteve2,9, Awestruck,"Awestruck Expected a good movie, got much more! Many blanks in storyline filled in so well with little dialog. Movie progresses without a pause, pulls you in on all levels. Emotions kept in check by the actors, run rampant throughout the audience. Movie is neither a ""Rocky"" nor a ""Raging Bull,"" but more like the ""The Great Santini"" on emotional steroids. It tears at your heart and mind beginning to end! Nick Nolte seems out of his element and somewhat awkward, until his drunken scene hits a grand slam with the unleashing of unsaid demons sequestered in Hell for so long. Facial and body expressions painted under a veil of what seems a still frame filled with only the sounds of ones thoughts, brings a forceful turning point of a dysfunctional father and son (Tom Hardy) to accept and grant absolution in a confessional of a surprising embrace.",
530,7 May 2014,soccerstars5,10, Breaking through typical MMA fight movies; the real fight is outside the cage,"Gavin O'Connor, the director of Warrior, does a fabulous job of making a long movie feel short by grabbing the audience in early scenes while still building suspense along the story line. While other movies follow the cliché 'sport/fight movie' protocol, Warrior puts its own twist on the fighting movie stereotype with extremely powerful acting and revelations of deep inner truths and demons within the characters. Most, if not all, sports films have the same goal; to win. Warrior is no different, it is the quest for a MMA title, but that goal almost comes second hand to other such goals in the movie.",

533,10 May 2014,robin_global,10, Acting is phenomenal!!,"Even if MMA is not your thing, the acting is especially good. Some have reviewed that the depth of the characters was insufficient, but the characters give enough depth to their characters played to keep the entire film gripping. Nick Nolte excels himself as a former drunk father, conflicted and looking for forgiveness. The dialogue in the living room scene between Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte was so intense and raw when he talks about running away from dad and how his mum lived with poor health with no insurance, you feel uncomfortable just listening to it!! Very touching. This is a movie you will watch time and time again, and with every viewing appreciate more and more the exceptional acting and superb directing. My only slight quibble is some lazy camera work with the fight scenes where the camera drifts onto other angles other than the fight which we all want to see, missing out on prime action. This is particularly true when Tom fights mad dog for the first time in the gym. Also a extended conclusion would of been nice to see the brothers progress to a more resolved setting with their father and each other. But by wanting more it shows how involving the film is.

The plot is extremely well written i kinda wish that they played around with the back story a little more... but that is if anything is being really picky and its not really needed. They fit in 2 points of view into this movie. It shows how different the 2 brothers are. Yet they both have a very good reason to be there. This movie really should win an award. ,

I hope it wins the Oscar for best ensemble acting....I am afraid that because two of the actors are so buff that some will not appreciate their amazing acting skills throughout this, too.....and it is such a relief to have a feature movie about the working class and not the upper middle class or super riches! Plus, I love the intimacy of the camera....you feel like you are brought so close to the characters so that you can read their nuance, you feel for and love them in all their complexity.. Even though you have to watch some serious bashing in the ring.....('tis why we have eye lids) , the fight scenes are not pulling you into the hurt of it though neither do they escape the physical realities....the sound tracks brings you right into the ring and arena....and they play with the camera work....in varieties of ways to show the story and it is a No BS story. I've seen a few others that had Mid-East Veterans in the story line (Sheridan's the Brothers was one & there is a simplicity and inauthenticity to those (am also thinking of Hurt Locker) or caricatures that are one dimensional) ....this one is complex by not interpreting just sharing the depths and contradictions and it is the best by miles.....no false notes.....despite the preposterousness of the conceit.....my one tiny criticism is that sometimes the back music was a little too crescendo-ish....just a couple of times it pulled you away with its drama....but only for a ""bitlet""...They did such interesting work with lens colors' too....darkly tones for the scenes that are emotionally that way....light and bright for others....without being in your face about it.....I really liked!!!!

Nevertheless, upon hearing about this film, I was worried that it would simply be a low-quality rehashing of ""The Fighter"". When I finally saw this film, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely impressed with everything that they had done.

I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of emotional weight that became present in the opening scenes and then persisted throughout the remainder of the film.

544,26 April 2021,escottwill,4, Try to do too much much?,"The movie tried to do too much. It feels like over half of the movie is dedicated to establishing each brother's background and all of the reasons you should be rooting for that brother--all with the Tom Hardy character barely saying a word. Yet you recognize all along that if either brother has a chance at realistically winning a tournament that includes these 2 brothers and 14 pro fighters, including apparently a couple of the top ones in the world, it's him. The teacher--the film clearly establishes that even as a younger, full-time fighter he was middling at best and that first part of his career ended with him being put into an ambulance and taken to a hospital nearly dead. Now, years older and rusty, but desperate for money, he's capable of taking down some of the best fighters in the world. Hey, at least he takes some punishment along the way. Then after 4 punishing fights in under 2 days, he steps into the ring against his brother, who has walked through 4 fights, easily knocking other fighters out in under 10 seconds each. He's completely fresh. And despite the fact that they're all fighting as middleweights, Hardy and all of the other fighters look like they weigh 20 pounds more than the teacher, easy. At some point during the tournament, the media finds out that Tommy, a war hero, has deserted his Marine unit. But they find this out weeks after a video of him knocking out a top fighter during a sparring session has gone public. The way the media really works, you know that would have come out about an hour after the video did. And the person who gives him away, apparently, who rats him out, is the woman he's trying to win 5 million dollars for... And the Nick Nolte character could have just not appeared in the film at all. Former alcoholic and wife-beater who's been sober for a little under 3 years, does nothing really to earn his sons' forgiveness but hope strongly. The son who seems to hate him more, and actually tells him he has no use for him, is the son who has had him as a trainer for half the movie. And then the guy goes back to drinking. There's no character development, no sympathy build up for the guy at all. You could have just had both kids say they hate the father, have Hardy prepare himself without a trainer, and be done with it. The 4 stars here are because the film actually tried to do something. It fails miserably, though, and isn't really worth the watch. It's 2 hours and 20 minutes and would have needed to be an hour longer to explain things enough to the point where it would even approach being watchable.",

It was just too clichéd. The story was OK, I liked the whole idea of the physics teacher moonlighting in MMA, but it seemed to stretch reality at some points in a film that is trying to be serious. There could of been a few more scenes to the story to add more dimension and give more depth to the characters relationships so it wasn't so clichéd (I think it could be more moving in the end if it had done this - seriously at the end I knew I was supposed to be moved but I wasn't). For example the Dad did some bad stuff, but what exactly, why did they leave? What was the brothers relationship like before all the crap went down? Etc. I am a viewer that definitely doesn't need everything spelled out, and I like when films leave some mystery, but there wasn't enough here to emotionally invest me. And when the film does reveal a hidden secret I was kind of disappointed, it went for the obvious at every turn, The performances in this movie are great, especially Nolte and Hardy, and that is what the film relies on to get our sympathies. With different actors the film would have really not been that good, so I would give the director/story and all other aspects of this film a 5, the acting around an 8, again I am being generous with a 7 rating. It is definitely worth watching, and entertaining, but anyone with half a brain will know what is going to happen in the end half way through the movie, and will even know the plot surprises before they are revealed, because the film goes for the obvious.",

I'd previously been impressed with Tom hardy in ""Martina Cole's The Take"", ""Inception"" and ""Bronson"" to name a few. Even as far back as his small stint on ""Band of Brothers"" TV series. Love watching and training in MMA, so was excited upon hearing this film was coming about. Was hoping & praying this would NOT be a ""Rocky"" with MMA and found myself completely blown out the water by the emotional depth of the characters, (provided by Hardy, Edgerton & Nolte), and the honest acting. Great story, fantastic acting, humorous in parts throughout and beautiful direction! We both loved it, told our friends about it........C'mon the DVD! :) Nolte should get an Oscar nod.

The training and fight scenes were great and as a BJJ and boxing practitioner I enjoyed watching these bits in the film and it does leave you pumped to go and train! If you buy the DVD there's also some great behind the scenes footage from the film and the story behind the 'tapout' brand. The accents were brilliant from both Tom Hardy (who's British) and Joel Edgerton (oz). Both portrayed convincing American accents. Nick Noltes performance was also brilliant in this.

I've seen Never Back Down, which had one good feature; the gorgeous Amber Heard, and that was a shambles of a film about mma. To say this is the Rocky of mma films is an understatement. Stallone cannot touch Hardy or Edgerton in their acting prowess. This is easily the definitive sports film. Every bout, every fight between family members was breathtaking.

The plot was at many times pretty obvious and many viewers anticipated from the start of the movie that the two brothers will settle family business in this unrealistic MMA final. I won't criticize the fantasy of two underdogs fighting an MMA final, but instead I want to emphasize on the idea of a broken family: on one side was the rebellious Tommy who was blaming everyone around him for his mother's death, while on the other side, Brendan the retired UFC average fighter who picked up a teaching position choosing lower paid but secure employment as a physics teacher, fighting for the biggest motive, not fame, girls or belts, but his family's salvation from bankruptcy. Also the Pop (Nick Nolte) did a great job as the estranged father fighting alcoholism who in the end sees his two boys reunite in an applause filled movie happy ending. At the end I could say, Brendan tamed his furious brother and took up his big brother role again, while Tommy finally could be happy with himself, although losing this match. Actually, I had a feeling (maybe I'm wrong) that Tommy wanted to lose and let the guilt consume him as he never felt being a part of his family. ",

The mix of a broken family with MMA and the struggles of each member to get on with their lives in anyway possible is perfect. With me being a huge fan of UFC and MMA in general i can say that, as far as the fights are concerned, they look completely realistic. I must admit that a was almost moved to tears by that movie, something that, to be honest, has happened to me once or twice in the past.

587,7 January 2012,skillswordfish,10, I can't believe what I've just witnessed......,".....the best movie I've seen in YEARS. I'm shocked. I've always loved MMA, watched so many PPV events I could probably pay a mortgage so I expected a sappy, yet enjoyable sports film. Oh my.....was I ever wrong! Tom Hardy....you've blown my mind. But it's not just him, everyone in this film is so believable, I forgot I was watching a movie. I laughed, smiled, chuckled, frowned, held my breath (alot), literally jumped off the couch yelling stuff, held my breath some more, and felt tears well up in my eyes. And that was before the ending!!! The ending is epic, in my opinion. I've read other reviews stating an opinion that it would have been better if certain things happened but I don't agree. I refuse to put spoilers in here but the ending is perfect just the way it is. It's more like watching reality TV the way it's done and like I've already said, I totally forgot I was watching a movie, it's so believable. Please, females who read this......do NOT pass this up because it looks like a guy film. This is like a chick flick wrapped in testosterone. Besides, the stars are gorgeous. This is definitely going in my Blu Ray collection and I'm inviting everyone I know to come over and watch it.",
588,18 September 2011,TDKgal15,9, A Final Act with a Powerful Punch,"Some of the best fighting scenes I've seen in a movie. As I watched, I found myself flinching with every blow, wriggling around in my seat delightfully enraptured during these truly epic scenes. They are by far the best part of the film, and that's saying a lot. All the actors are outstanding and the emotional build-up at the end is so fantastic and gripping, that it's hard to put into words. Granted, the first half is very slow and a little cliché. Once you get to the halfway point the movie SKYROCKETS. By the beautiful, heart-wrenching, touching, action- packed, magnificent, and overall EXHILARATING, final act, you'll have forgotten all that might have been possibly slow from the beginning, for you will be truly captivated. The final minutes will make you want to weep and cheer all at the same time. I've never seen such a huge take off in a movie as this one, for the second half is just plain brilliant. Tom Hardy is a machine in this movie, a ball of tightly wounded rage and hurt that his opponents unfortunately feel as he viciously unleashes it ALL in the ring. While his brother, Joel Edgerton, is more stable, still dealing with his own heavy problems as well, but like his fighting style, is thoughtful and deliberate in his decisions. I'm tempted to say these brothers make up your protagonist and antagonist, but then I would be sorely mistaken. You have your clear-cut hero, Edgerton the good-hearted school teacher trying to save his family and home due to financial troubles, and your ANTI-hero (most of the time my favorite characters in movies) Hardy, the dark, complex, and untrusting war ""hero"" that cannot let go of his tragic past from both war and his earlier home life. Both these actors carry the film, both equally engrossing, and their inevitable confrontation at the end is powerful, brutal, and breathtaking. Nick Nolte is especially engaging, playing the formerly severe alcoholic father begging for redemption from his two sons. (I sense a possible Oscar nomination for him) Overall, this movie is brutal while thoroughly uplifting and touching at the same time, and it is speckled with some surprisingly humorous moments. It creates quite a build up, and the ending trumps and exceeds all possible expectations. The fight scenes are BEAUTIFULLY choreographed and are, once again, some of the best fight scenes I've seen in a movie. If your not an MMA fan you will become one after this movie. If you are an MMA fan, you will lose your mind with delight during this movie. Overall, the first half may be hard to stay with, but the movie eventually transcends into a gripping, emotional, heart-racing, and brilliant tale of two brothers with stakes higher than you can imagine. This one will have you on the edge of your seat, whilst you hold back tears. Warrior is a must see.",

Both are centered on professional fighting, yet the true bulk of the story comes in it's portrayal of a highly dysfunctional family. However, whereas I found 'The Fighter,' to be quite overrated and fairly dull, 'Warrior,' is not. Primarily because of a holy trinity of incredible performances from its three male leads, Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte. Whereas the film is fairly conventional in its plot and direction, the sheer power of these three truly elevates the film to something great.",

However, there are parts of this movie that really hit hard emotionally and thats due to the incredible performances of the three main actors. Nick Nolte steals every scene and both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton were flawless in both the drama and especially the action sequences. The fight scenes are probably the best shot and edited from any that I can recall in recent history.

When I bought it on DVD, I was shocked of this film. I love all performances from Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Morrison and Nick Nolte. The story line behind the film wasn't any ordinary where one guy loses everything in the beginning and battles back over obstacles at the end and rise about everything. You get many stories through this whole film where Nick Nolte is a recovering alcoholic, Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Morrison are a married couple with two girls and they are just like any other American family. Working two to three jobs to help their kids and doctor bill as well. Then there comes Tom Hardy's character where he plays a Marine that goes AWOL after his brother in arms in killed and he saves a fellow marine in the process. He returns home and asks the help of his father to train him for an MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) tournament. By far, this movie has Oscar buzz flowing around it. Gavin O'Connor coming from making Miracle to this is a big step forward in his career. I just liked it cause within 15 minutes of the movie, there is a fight.",
603,17 July 2014,tamaasik,9, Masterpiece of contemporary cinema,"Let me be clear about one thing first, this is by far the best wrestling movie I've ever seen. This movie has some of the most intimidating and breathtaking fighting scenes that you cant get to watch in real fights. When the fight commentator confirms that 'Tommy Riordan definitely is real', I figured this really hyped up Gavin O'Connor movie Warrior definitely is real. Daron Aronofsky's The Wrestler (2008) was the fighting movie of my mode with more of life, emotions than the fighting, Micky Rourke acted his best in that Oscar nominated movie. Paddy Conlon reminded me of that old fighter re-entering his life with a lot of difficulties. After awhile Tommy and Brendan Conlon and their twisted relationship resembles another two brothers in The Fighter (2010). But none of them mentioned above are worthy to be the epic one, Warrior, I would say has everything to be remembered as the finest wrestling movie ever made.Although there is a lot of cage in this movie but for me, the story is beyond the cage. I have no say about that war hero part, I think everybody knows that the Iraq War is no heroic war to be fought. People of America need to fight a greater war than that. ",

605,7 October 2011,giantshannon,9, Rocky never had it this good....,"The story is nothing new, its the underdog's rise but done in a fresh way from two different perspectives. It is exciting and very well done and has a modern twist on the old training montage. The performances; a tour-de-force. I would say that appropriately describes Tom Hardy's performance here. Wow. He is unbelievable. A dark and troubled character who is wound so tight that once he steps in the ring he becomes an animal, with the haunted look of all your favourite psycho's down the years. He has to be getting Oscar buzz for this. Nolte too is fantastic, a recovered alcoholic and so troubled by his past and his olive branches which he extends to his estranged sons get torched without even being entertained. It is an understated performance but very powerful. Egerton is almost the boy next door, driven to fight to support his family, he blends in alongside Hardy and Nolte but so would anyone else. He handles his emotional and fighting scenes very well, without being clichéd. Again, he is understated.",

You cannot help but get drawn into this tale of a family gone wrong. It's raw and visceral with a poetic human touch. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are fantastic as the brothers bonded by blood. And Nick Nolte where have you been lately?. Terrific as the father seeking redemption. A great supporting role by Jennifer Morrison as the vulnerable wife too. The ultimate question is ""What sacrifice would you make for your family ?"" I challenge you to not feel every crack, crunch and thwack and not be misty eyed at the same time by the end. It's in my top 5 of all time because its the humanity of the story that runs so deep.",
607,20 February 2012,rockyfanatic9292,10, Inspiring emotional MMA film,"It's rare for me to get so emotionally involved with characters in a movie, but this is a film that did it for me. If you don't already know, the film is about two brothers who end up fighting each other for $5,000,000. There are so many things that this film got right, that I have no idea how it didn't get nominated for best picture. The story was great, the dialogue was excellent, and the characters felt very real. The back stories behind the two fighters makes it so you want to root for both of them and when the end comes you don't know who to root for. I have never watched a fighting film where I had no idea who I wanted to root for until watching Warrior. Nick Nolte played an excellent role as the once alcoholic father, and Tom Hardy was excellent as Tommy. When I first saw Tom Hardy in Inception, I thought of him playing roles that are meant to be sarcastic, however this movie changed that opinion. His character was isolated, angry, and cold hearted and Hardy captured it perfectly. I would put his character in the same category as Christian Bale in The Fighter. This movie had everything that I was looking for and more. It had awesome fighting scenes, emotions, and great character development and dialogue. I would highly recommend this movie even to people who don't like MMA. It's hard to watch this movie and not become emotionally involved with them and for me, that's what makes a great film.

611,28 December 2011,dalyea,3," Not a feel good movie, and awful camera work","I'm a big UFC fan and have started to watch all the MMA movies I could find. I went into watching this movie completely ready to enjoy the story line, the fight scenes, and whatever other magic this film would have to offer. That is, I was ready to like it. Well, sad to say, this movie disappoints on many levels. It starts out fine, with good character development, the hint of some intrigue, the modern theme of foreclosure, and it seems like the movie will be good. The problem is, the way the story unfolds, it definitely is not a feel good movie. Of course, it's obvious to everyone where it's headed, so that's another disappointment - there is no surprise as to how the tournament will turn out, except for who will win. Ultimately, I expected some sort of resolution where both guys win - meaning, one guy wins the fights, yes, but both guys come out winners in real life. The director does the best he can to get to that conclusion, but I think it's just yucky by the end. How can I really feel good after seeing the final fight? Not knowing how the prize money, which has good intentions for both guys, will be used or split? Of course, there had to be the brother reconciliation, that was to be expected, and that part was OK. The two things that really made this movie a stinker are these. The MMA scenes are awful. Just terrible. Why? The camera work! It's dizzying, moves way too fast, there is never any focus, and it all just feels, well, not even frenetic, just like it was the best that could be done to splice together bits of the acted fighting to make it feel intense and high action. I had to look away for parts of the fight because the camera work was so bad, and certainly, you get no sense of what is developing in the fight. Of course, they can't show even a full 5-minute round, but the editing down to what it ended up with was terrible. Then, the final part where one brother gets injured badly - forget it, right then and there, it's just pointless. At least if they'd ended the final fight at the 3rd round at that injury, there would be a semblance of reality in terms of how MMA fights really wind up. The second thing, now, is that everyone kept saying this was the next Rocky feel-good underdog movie. It wasn't. The reason being, by the time you get to the final fight, the whole lead-in is awful, and you feel conflicted knowing brothers are going to fight. How does that feel good? Of course you know why - because the brothers will reconcile. So there should be triumph. But there isn't, not to me. And how could there be? One brother has to lose, and he gets devastatingly injured in a very similar fashion to the way that Antonio Nogueria was in real life (granted, that was after this movie was released). Rocky feels good at the end. Rudy feels good. This movie does not. I usually feel very confident relying on IMDb movie review ratings, and I could see this coming in at 6.5 to 7.0, but no way it's 8.3 in my book. If you're an MMA fan, and if you have any expectation of a feel good Rocky type movie, forget it. This movie turns out to be quite disappointing. Better: Never Back Down 2. That movie isn't as high production quality, but it's better overall to me.",

Cinematography and themes are similar to the fighter but the acting is no where near and the mma thing isn't as big of a deal as you would think. The main point of the movie is the effects of alcoholism on a family. Nolte is great as always as a former boxer and wrestling trainer to his sons. After years of drinking his family is torn apart. His two sons hate him and they all go their separate ways. One to war,,,One to a family. Through hardships in both their lives they turn to ring matches for financial gain. Thus a modern day kumite bloodsport style movie is born. Of curse its tapout mma stuff and not backbreaking action. The best parts of the movie are the scenes between Tom Hardy kicking some major ass and not showing emotion or he's making Nick Nolte feel like a complete p.o.s. for being such a bad father in the past. This is really a ""BRO"" movie. Some OK fights but pretty predictable. Redbox it up,,,,but could be an OK present for an mma fan that has daddy issues",
615,16 May 2012,valient-973-773313,8, Parable of the lost sons,"Movie is loosely related to the Parable of the prodigal son,set in a modern everyday American setting.This movie is seen from the eyes of the two brothers.Both needed forgiveness and love.The ""brotherhood"" of belonging to the navy or army can never replace the true bond of a family. Even though the younger brother spurned the forgiveness of the elder brother but eventually that was what he was really seeking.His pride and anger prevented him from talking the problem out with his brother.He best expressed his challenges in the 'ring'.The 'art of fighting' was a gift given to the two sons by their father.It is in the 'ring' they will find redemption and love,which we all long for. Now will the elder brother spurn the love and forgive his father? On the whole a great movie",

But the education system finds out about his underground fights and he is suspended without pay,so he uses this to train full time, and compete in Sparta.The movie had a specific way to get emotionally attached to characters and to know them really good.This movie is a truly respectable candidate for the Academy Award.My advice is that you leave anything you doing and run to the cinema,you wont regret it.This movie will be carved in your memory because of his incredible emotional story and incredible roles of actors especially Tom Hardy,Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton.Once again i have to say it is truly amazing movie!!!",

If I could vote this a 11 out of 10 I would. hope this gets the Oscar nod because it is without a doubt the best movie of the year. The audience in the theater including myself were cheering out loud in some of the fight scenes. It was great. Moving. I am a straight mans man and I actually had a tear come to my eyes in some of the scenes with Nolte and Hardy (in the casino) and also in the victory's in the cage. AMAZING MOVIE.

The only beauty in the movie is Tom Hardy's trapeze. Better than that certainly could have been done with a few tweaks to the script. In particular, there was no need to tell too many events.

After watching it, I went on to buy it for only £3 (Which is a bargain). It starts off a little slow but it was definitely worth it in the end. What I mainly liked about this movie, is that it has a lot of background information to the main characters, which really makes them interesting and most importantly memorable. When it gets going, its almost impossible to move your eyes away from the screen as it keeps you gripped at all times. This is partially because anything could happen at any given moment. I simply cant see how people can give bad reviews for this masterpiece. The makers have done a really good job by creating a truly outstanding movie.

And unfortunately, by what I've read here about it being a box office flop is distressing. Now, that said, I've never even seen a trailer for this movie, until I actually saw it. Regardless, amazing movie, it helps if you are an MMA fan, but if you aren't, you're forgiven. As the movie first and foremost is a drama and a family driven drama at that. I really liked the fact that the whole story wasn't just dumped in our laps at the outset and we would have to follow whatever storyline the writers had envisioned. The grey areas and ambiguity let us make up our own mind and we could still change our opinions as more of the story was told. Great performances by all, Nick Nolte, I bought all of it, I felt the pain and frustration and hope that he was portraying, great job. Brendan, perfect as the regretful and loving husband and father, doing what he has to to get by. Tommy, the angry, guilty, quiet and yet amazingly caring guy. Again, great job. There should be at the very least, best movie award nomination awards for this. It's a modern day reiteration of the classic Rocky movie, with a few more details.

Rocky did not interest me as that it just not my type of film and I have to say that I was reluctant to go and view this movie BUT.... I was extremely and pleasantly surprised whilst I was exiting the cinema after seeing this film. This movie is not just a movie for hardcore UFC fans but it is a movie for anyone who enjoys films altogether. The fight scenes that take place throughout this movie are brilliantly choreographed and they will take your breath away. The plot line is very well directed and the cinematography is outstanding in some instances |e.g the montaged training scene|. The actors did fantastic in their roles but I would have loved to see more of Nick Nolte.,

Each and every scene has been shot perfectly. you will feel the emotions during the confrontation of the two brothers for the first time when one tries to Introduce his family and the Response from Tom.

654,12 March 2023,mikes-87186,10, Deep,"So many good things to say. What a cast. The way I see it, once those brothers come together again they will be unbreakable. Tom Hardy was great with showing so much emotional pain but with the strength to hang on without destroying himself. Instead he found what felt like real family. Someone he could love and trust in the military. His performance for me was so telling. He became Tommy Reardin. But losing his fallen Conrad drops him to his knees and overwhelms him with anger. But at the same time he's focused on helping his friends family, he promised. Then if you thought Tommy's determination to fight his way back was so impressive, we watch Brenden come to realize his family's well being is in jeopardy and decides to do what he knows will hurt his wife, and possibly him. The interaction they ( Tommy and Brenden)had outside of the hotel was brilliant. So much emotion and raw pain that quickly turns to anger. Leaves you feeling that what Evers broken with these 2 brothers is not gonna get fixed. But, they've gotten to a path that requires both of them to finish. Their father wants to help. All of them survivors. We see one display of strength and courage after another until we see the one we may not wanna see. How can this end well. The movies been so great to this point, how will they not ruin it. I'm gonna tell you. It's a fairytale. Those boys come together. Tommy gets to unload all that hate and hurt while Brenden just wants to survive. Save his family, which he does. He saves his brother, and his family. Someone needs to produce an episode of ""where are they now""
Where are those boys now? I think Brenden split his winnings with Tommy and Tommy helped his friends wife.",

If I had to choose between this or Rocky, I'd watch Warrior. Underrated in my opinion. People carry around hurts for many years. This movie gives a glimpse of the pain of carrying around those hurts vs the release found in forgiveness. I thought the fight scenes were intense, the characters very believable, and the story very moving.

This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. In the very beginning it seemed like it was going to be one of those low budget, small town movies that I may end up turning off. 10 minutes in I knew I was wrong. This story takes off and doesn't let up. It has a long running time but in no way drags. The acting between the brothers and father (Nick Nolte!) was just right for the story. By the end I was almost moved to tears (I don't think that has happened since Saving Private Ryan.) For the record, this movie KILLED 'The Fighter' that got so much hype last year.

665,20 March 2012,serge_mattheyssen,9," see it, you won't be disappointed","Actually, when i planned on seeing the movie, i thought it would be another fighting movie about a guy, with a questionable history, who has issues with another guy, while dealing with a girl. And when you strip it down to the basics, it is exactly like that. But then you realize that the main storyline is the one about 'the other guy', and that is his brother. The acting is good, way above average. But i do have a problem with the way Tom Hardy is shown in the movie. His behavior and fighting style suggests that he is a barbarian, with an IQ below 50. Maybe it was the directors' vision, but i would have done it slightly different. Nick Nolte is amazing. He deserves a good role like this, a chance he gets not often enough. Frank Grillo and Joel Edgerton do a great job. And then, the fighting itself: it's more than just a fighting movie. I can read in the other reviews that comparisons with Rocky are often made. They are both good films in the genre. Rocky is a huge icon in movie history, known to man and child for over 35 years. But it's more a 'drama' than a 'fighting movie'. Warrior (for me) tilts the balance a bit in the other direction. The difference and variation in fighting styles of the contenders is welcome. Joel (Brendan) has clearly a another approach in the cage. I enjoyed it, no doubt about it. Nevertheless, a huge merit for director, producer and actors: one of the best movies i've seen in a while.

The way the story is told makes you connect with the characters. The role of brothers between Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton might make you feel identified if you ever fought with your brother. I think the role of Nick Nolte is very well done. Jennifer Morrison acts very little, but their role is well achieved. I think they could have improved a little Tommy military background history, and the end could have had a more detailed outcome as how each story ends. But They leave an open end. I fully recommend this movie, very entertaining, very well acted.",
671,29 September 2012,stewartos,5, Melodrama,"The story started off pretty good but got more and more unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous at the end. The acting and dialog were good overall, especially Nick Nolte. But the melodrama got so thick at the end I could barely stand it. It also started to get really tiresome listening to Tommy grunt and snarl at everyone all hunched over like a cave man. And, what a surprise, he turns out to be a war hero who never took credit for saving someone's life so the whole crowd is cheering for him. That by itself, okay; but added to all the other unbelievable stuff; no. If the writers had consulted a group of high school boys, they probably would have recommended that. Then how the fight turned out in the end: could it have even been attempted to make it more dramatic and moving? What else could have been thrown in there to aim for a higher crescendo to make it by far the very most dramatic sports movie of all time--since that seems to have been what they were aiming for? Maybe the other guy's daughter could have been taken hostage and he has to win to save her life, but at the same time Tommy actually had organ damage and would die if he was hit again. Sound pretty good? I mean, that would be really dramatic. It is possible to overdo something so that it just becomes dumb, and despite the good elements of this film, it could not have been much more overdone in the end.",

UNTIL, my boyfriend asked me to. And I thank God he did. This movie has changed my life. You need to take a bathroom break before the movie even begins. GRAB EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND MAYBE EVEN A FEW TISSUES. THESE WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS , AND PRODUCES ALL NEED AN AWARD. I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE AND I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE I NEVER HEARD OF IT UNTIL TONIGHT [ July 9th, 2013 ] I am going to find this movie, buy it (maybe even two copies just in case someone steals it) and show it to my kids. This is a movie for absolutely EVERYONE. I will forever brag about this wonderful movie. It sets up a story (not too fast and not too slow) and it HONESTLY keeps you on the edge of your seat! Exactly Right After watching it, I encourage you to write a review of your own!",
673,20 October 2013,hhjt,8, Burying the hatchet,"For those of you who expect 'Warrior' to be a some sort of fighting extravaganza like the ones Sylvester Stallone or Jean-Claude van Damme used to make, let me get one thing straight: 'Warrior' is a drama about a dysfunctional family. The mother is dead. Her two sons haven't spoken to each other for years and contact with the father is avoided by both of them at all cost. The MMA-contest is but the scenery in which they stand face to face. It easily could have been a tennis tournament or a beauty pageant! That doesn't mean the fighting isn't there. Off course it is. People not familiar with the term MMA are in for a treat. People that follow MMA on a regular basis will probably find the various styles that MMA has to offer not extremely well distilled. What makes 'Warrior' into a fine piece of cinema is not the story as it is seen before in other movies. The performances however of Joel Egderton, Tom Hardy and especially Nick Nolte take it to a higher level and therefore 'Warrior' is definitely worth watching.",

675,26 December 2011,patrick5-810-337920,10, Wonderful movie on so many levels!,"My family and I just watched this movie and I had to join IMDb just to write this review. After seeing a review about this movie on NPR, I put it on the list of movies my husband & I wanted to watch. Even with that good review, I wasn't sure what to expect: Rocky, Fighter, etc. It's a long movie, over 2 hours, and the fighting doesn't really start to happen till over half way through but that may be the best part about it. Because the fight wouldn't mean anything without knowing the history of these men. This movie moved me to tears, it made me cheer, it made me nervous for the fighters, it made me want them to win and it made me want them to heal. ",
676,1 October 2013,lagoontree,9, a must see movie!,"What a great movie! One of the best in recent years! The movies' messages of redemption and the importance of family are ongoing throughout all the scenes in the movie and excellent acting allows the viewer to ask himself deep questions at the end. How much pain must a person go through before he is redeemed? How much pain must a person go through that allows him not to forgive? How important is family? Is there a point where it is too late to change the past? And many more. This is not an action-packed sports-movie, that is an original and realistic drama that takes place in the world of mixed martial arts and it is definitely a must-see and one of those movies that every movie fan waits for.",

679,6 May 2014,unusualdilemna,10," An excellent tear inducing movie, that left me on the edge of my seat","Warrior, directed by Gavin O' Connor in 2011, is a powerful and emotional driven movie that places three men into an everlasting feud, until two of them begin to fight over it physically. Between battling their relentless pasts, their undecided futures, their persistent financial struggles, and lifelong regrets, Warrior has to do a lot more with just two men who duke it out in a ring until one of them lies unconscious. Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan (Joel Edgerton) are two brothers who both struggle with financial and personal issues. Their past has them against each other, and both of them struggle to find a truce between one another. When a competition in wrestling comes to town with a $5 million prize, it leads them onto a collision course with one another to determine who takes the money, and the pride over the other. It's the emotional power, and the visualization of the physical pain that the characters go through which makes Warrior an excellent film, and one I would truly recommend.",

681,4 October 2014,salsatony,9, outstanding best movie of the year,I don't really watch movies like this but after seeing this movie I will. The reason why I liked this movie was because of the emotional back story and of cause the brilliant and brutal fight sequences. I was gripped to my seat after the first fight scene and after that I knew this was going to be a good movie. I don't usual get upset with movies but the emotional scenes and the outstanding fight scenes it made me get upset. What also made this movie so good was its brilliant cast with no bad actors. I could tell they were trying to make a film you would not forget and well they did the job. This is why i gave it such a high rating and gave it the title of best movie of the year.,

Nick Nolty is on my to watch list also. I had no expectations going in to this movie but after 5 minuets i was hooked and couldn't look away. For anyone who hasn't seen this yet you have no idea what your missing out on. Absolutely stunning performances all round and is definitely my favourite movie topping many others by a mile.

It just has everything, pain, joy, love, heartbreak, redemption. Just everything you could want this movie has. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I would bump it up to the top of your must see list. Tom Hardy is just incredibly in it, so is Nolte and the whole cast. I consider myself a tough grader and a bit of a hard sell when it comes to movies. usually there are only 3=4 movies a year that I am actually excited to see and even less that I recommend to others. This is my number one movie that I would recommend right now. 10/10 for me, just go see it, that's about all I can say without giving any spoilers.",

I immediately called my dad after seeing this movie and told him to forget out about Rocky and Rudy(his 2 favorite movies). Warrior is a movie that tells the story of humanity NOW. It is the only thing I've seen since I returned home from the war in 2006 that even comes close to telling the story of what people go through when they come home.,
693,3 August 2012,aczb1988,9, well worth the 8.3,Tom Hardy gives an excellent performance in what i would say an excellent film.

I could see this being a Harmony Korine film about what he imagines what sports masculinity is all about. A ton of laughs! Tom Hardy mumbles and sulks around with terrible posture like a teenager but he's actually a war hero who fights. His brother is a physics teacher who fights and there's some weird side story about his principal and students rooting for him. There's a Russian fighter who is a rip off of Fedor Emelianenko. Great movie, as inspirational as Weekend at Bernie's.",
704,26 July 2013,clyons31079,10, Awesome,I loved it! The story of family pain relationship heart ache Forgiveness. From the start of the movie I was glued to the screen. Tom hardy is an awesome actor. The whole cast did a great job. The fight choreography was great kudos to the fight and stunt coordinator. More films can take a page out of this book. the blending of the lives tying the stories together and then sealing it all at the end. The only thing I would have loved to see is the teacher give his brother half or some of the money to help out the family of the fallen soldier. Maybe a flash forward in life at the end of the film. maybe during the credits. All in all the film was great.,
705,11 September 2011,shahrokni16,9, One of the most intense movies ever ....,"I am not a fan of MMA but I am sure that its history is much less than WWE. While a lot of people watch and follow WWE just because of its story lines and ""acts"", MMA fans usually watch MMA fights for real fights. Fights are real and the outcome at times could be between life or death. The intensity behind and beneath its fights should be portrayed much more than WWE matches. Warrior delivers the intensity up to the maximum level it possibly can. I do think fight scenes are good enough. Obviously if you haven't watched MMA in your whole life, you need to be with someone that at least can tell you the rules. I was with my wife and she is definitely no fan of MMA, boxing, WWE, etc...and I explained to her the difference between MMA, WWE and Boxing. The acts are great. I will be shocked if I don't see some Oscar nomination. One of the story lines is everyday - unfortunately for these days - life of many of us. The other story line at least from my point of view needed more information. It was good to see both sides of a human being in his life however the story doesn't give you time to feel close to the character,when he does something heroic and when he runs away. When I saw that Warrior came out 3d in box office, I thought people might be biased toward a movie about MMA - and many may say wth is MMA - so I decided to get the review out. Once again it's an INTENSE movie so if you are on a date and looking for a romantic movie definitely it's not recommended but if you want to see why and how some people go to the CAGE to FIGHT for a GOAL, this is definitely a movie to watch.",

The character building is even worse. The fight scenes are extremely unrealistic and brutal to watch. Not sure what accent Tom Hardy's character,Tommy, has but it's hard to listen too. Think rainman with a Boston accent. At one point they have a goldfish ringside being held up by Bryan callen, I can not believe this movie is rated so high. Two hours and twenty minutes I'll never get back. Tom Hardy is a good actor but this is definitely a low light. The ending is completely predictable.",

However anyone can make mistakes like I did, the fact is that this movie is very interesting from beginning to end not only for the fight scenes, but also for the story that we can see. Most of the people have problems between brothers, and some of them can lead into a fight, but have you ever imagine to solve it into a ring? That's the reason why this movie can be so shocking. The soundtrack is perfect, beautiful instrumental and lyrics songs that are in the company of a magnificent screen play. We have to recognize the role of Joel Edgerton as Brandon that is, in my opinion, one of the roles that deserves to be recognized with an Academy award.",
737,29 January 2012,SlyAce365,9," Warrior: A Story of Struggle, Love, Hate, and a Family Worth Fighting For","Why did I go see this movie? Well first of all, when I read that this film was like Rocky, (I'm a die hard Rocky fan), I thought ""Eh, what the heck, I'll go see it"". That wasn't the only motivation though. What was the other? Tom Hardy. I first saw Tom Hardy in Inception, even though his role was a small one, I could tell that he had a talent for acting.",
738,14 January 2012,mark_foxx13,8," Great movie, awesome over all acting, must see","I was on holidays when i seen this movie advertised on TV, i thought ""oh great another sport/fighting movie""(like fighter, and the wrestler.) , and honestly the only reason i watched it was because of tom hardy, for his up coming role in batman,and luckily i did watch it because clearly i was dead wrong, as soon as i got to the first fight scene i was sucked in, being very interested by hardy's mysteries character, and loving the man with a heart and a will to go on(edgertons character), this movie will make you smile, cheer and shed a tear,all around great performances by everyone, the only thing that i found wrong with this was the ending and NOTE to those readers who haven't watched it this is kinda.. a SPOILER ALERT!! okay now.. i love the brothers in arms, walking away scene very emotional and well thought of but in the end and i'm sure i speak for a lot of people and they want to know what happened to hardy's character they don't tell us that maybe he got off, and didn't do jail time, got the money for his mates fiancé, and now has a healthy relationship with his brother and dad. thats what i would like to know, but other then that i love this movie from start to finish, a great movie maybe even some Oscar nomination's. 8/10",

741,27 January 2012,pokers_jokers,9," When a man returns home to find redemption, he was able to find it and more.","When I read the title of this film, I thought it would be one of those films in which I would be immensely disappointed in. But I was glad to be wrong, and more glad that I looked passed the title and viewed the film on my own willingness and accord. And this was one of those you shouldn't judge by it's cover, in this case it's the title, not the cover. ",
742,29 February 2012,favorite-colors,10, Worth watching,"I had no interest in watching this film to begin with, I'm not much of a sports fan, I don't like violence and doubted it would be as good as Rocky, The Wrestler, Raging Bull etc so why bother. I don't even know what MMA stands for. It was only seeing the many decent ratings by you beautiful people, my flixster friends, who convinced me it was worth a go and I'm glad I did because most of you were right, Warrior is a fantastic film! I really didn't think you could tell another original, compassionate and compelling story in the genres but I was totally wrong, Gavin O'Connor has made a brilliant film. Along with his fantastic direction and the hard work and determination from Hardy and Edgerton and not forgetting the heartbreaking performance from Nolte, it had all the right ingredients for a great film, and it is a great film. Definitely one of my favourite 2011 films.",
743,31 March 2012,risburtfernandes,10, a slow starting and within 15 minutes ..........boom,I rarely cry when ever i see any movie. titanic was one of the few movies i cried at. i even did not cry in the notebook and a walk to remember. but this movie made tears come in my eyes. the best story ever written and the best directed movie ever. there's not one moment that you wont enjoy in this master piece. for every fight won i would punch my hand in the air and give a broad smile. till the end i was glued to the screen. i recommend everyone watch this film.i cried when both brothers fought. the scene was like so painful when Brendan breaks Tommy's hand but Tommy does not give up. he still fights with one hand. and when he cries i feel so sad. also when Tommy taps out when his brother said i love you Tommy. it brought tears to my eyes. the most touching movie ever. i am surprised it got just so little ratings. i would have given it a 9.8 or a 10.,
744,10 April 2012,emo-vampire1,10, Outstanding Movie,"This was a truly outstanding movie. I watch a lot of movies and from time to time I get get into some, but not a lot. This movie I was literally standing up, I was talking to the screen, I was punching my own hand with the excitement. I have seen some sad movies, but rarely do I feel anything, But this was a different story. The directing was amazing and the plot was something that you will rarely ever see in movies or on TV. My only regret was I didn't see this movie in theaters. Truly the only thing missing from this masterpiece for me was not seeing it on a huge screen with surround sound. I would recommend this movie to any and everyone. To anyone who is questioning whether or not to watch this movie, PLEASE take my advice and do so.",
745,31 October 2013,jokwan,10, Made me cry...,"Usually, I am not very emotional over any movie whatsoever. However, this movie made me cry like a little bitch. I was choked up for the whole second half of the movie, and then boom, bawling in front of my computer. I expected this movie to be like every other fighting movie, but it's not. One could even argue that this movie isn't even about the fighting. This isn't one of those sports movies where you know who's going to win. And that's not even the beauty of it. The best part is that moment when you realize you don't even care about the fight, or the winner, at all. And that's when this movie sets itself apart from all other fighting movies.",

747,5 November 2012,jackperry264,5, Not Good Not Bad... Just OK :(,"There is not much in this Mixed Marital art film but it is on the top end of the spectrum, good cast and script with a few well choreographed fights here and there but it's mediocre, not good nor bad, just mediocre which to be fair is the worst thing for films but as you don't get many of this type flying around so it does have its time in the spotlight which is more to say for most that just degrade and get watered down from their B movie titles.",
748,30 December 2011,wcaparas,10, Best sports movie ever made. PERIOD.,"Writer/Director Gavin O'Connor is a true rising star, and may be the next Ron Howard or James Cameron, but standing on their shoulders capable of more. His innovative cinematography and editing style is crisp and edgy and entirely real world, while his writing skill is truly extraordinary, and his ability to draw the best out of his actors is UNRIVALED in my mind. This is a tough mixed genre... maybe the toughest to direct. Too many interpersonal dynamics to expect believable scenes from start to finish, and far too many crowd scenes to ever expect believable moments, but somehow O'Connor brings the best even out of his extras, and without question, his crew. This is an amazingly raw and believable American tale that is a MUST See for fans of honest drama, Americana, great love stories, or great sport films. Above all, this is, in my opinion, all things considered the greatest sports related movie ever made.",

752,7 July 2013,Vodkamilk,9, Great and touching,"I really loved this movie, it gave me a smile on my lips and made me sad. The relationship between the sons and the father was the most touching thing in the movie. I didn't understand what happened in the ending, I have different theories though, which would make more sense, however I recommend this movie!",
753,26 July 2014,cutout1,8, I love the fighting scene,I think that this movie shows great detail of fighting. This is great for Mixed Martial Arts fans. It just made me realize that MMA isn't just about watching the TV shows its about practicing and fighting the real people out there,
754,14 June 2020,paulcleaver-18043,4, Poor sound,The sound level on the movie from the very beginning is really quiet and ends up spoiling the movie the sound is the bad you can't hear any talking at all,
755,19 May 2014,serbiannarutofan,10, Perfect,"I've heard of this film. Everyone watched it, all my friends, friends of my friends, all parents and they've all liked this movie so i thought that i should watch it too.When movie ended i was blown away when i realized i how GRAEAT this film is. Every tiny bit of it, EVERYTHING. First great casting, Tom Hardy totally sold it and the guy i don't know his name, killed it. Second: This film was so good filmed i was stunned. Camera work was just perfect accept maybe in first fight in a gym but it was really good Third and the best part: Use of a music in the film and perfect timing. When i saw last scene i was like THIS IS MASTERPIECE, when i heard music in the background i wanted to go in the movie and hug them about, thats how i felt. With all said and cleared, you can call me stupid but this movie deserves place in my top 10 movies of all time!!!",
756,15 June 2022,brad-monk,6, The Quest - for a developed plot line,"Hardy and Nolte put on great performances in this film. Too bad none of the characters were developed enough to not be cliche. Overall the film reminded me of The Quest, a single elimination martial arts tournament with the best fighters in the world, but instead of a bunch of interesting contrasting styles from all over the world, there is bland MMA and ""the Russian"". The primary subplot leading up to the fight is that two brothers are really mad at their dad for 'not being there'.",

759,6 March 2015,raidr-06741,7," A straight genre picture,","""Warrior"" wants to be a great sports movie so badly, so desperately, that it loses touch with what I suspect it was supposed to be about all along. Theoretically speaking, everything you could possibly want from an inspirational-but-grounded sports movie is here: Brooding themes of brotherhood, redemption and guilt; a scrappy underdog beating the odds; the indestructible, Ivan Drago-like combatant who looms for our heroes (they've even made him Russian here, despite the fact that he's played by U.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Kurt Angle); and of course the Big Competition at the end, in which all the plot lines are wrapped up in a single-elimination tournament. A lot of this works; director Gavin O'Connor (""Miracle"") knows his sports movie tropes well, and how to hit them to maximize their impact. But by focusing too much on the sports movie conventions and not enough on the movie itself, it doesn't punch us in the gut at the end the way it should. It's a lot of impressively empty theater.",
760,14 June 2015,khendrix-08388,9, One of the best movies I have seen!,"I wanted to watch a film that I have not heard much of yet. So I started watching this movie without any expectations and without watching a trailer of it. I did not know what kind of film this was. After the first scene I could not get my eyes of this movie. I have seen a couple of movies that had kind of the same plot. However, this still felt like a new experience. It is very nice to see that good movies like this one are still being made. Very well acted and directed. One of my favorite movies of all time! If you are looking for a great movie that mixes up your feelings and make you feel good, then this is the right movie to watch.",
