0,26 July 2004,MovieAddict2016,10, A classic that still holds up to this very day,"""I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.""",/
1,31 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," ""The Thing"" is John Carpenter's masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!","A classic film. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?",r
2,4 March 2008,hitchcockthelegend,10, Flips the scenario round from the original to great effect.,"John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.",e
3,6 December 2003,preppy-3,10," Right up there with ""Halloween""--one of Carpenter's best!","Remake of the classic 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?",v
4,28 December 2003,Gafke,10, Intelligent Splatter,"This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.",i

The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.",e

7,22 May 2008,PeachHamBeach,10, Still my all time favorite sci-fi/horror!!!,"The silly saying, ""You can't touch this"" surely applies here. With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.",/
8,29 May 2021,fullbug,10, One of the Most Re-Watchable Movies Ever Made,"Classic and timeless that is now almost 40 years old. Great cast and character interaction, and covers the whole gambit of genre's (sci-fi, action, horror, thriller, mystery). There are even a few comedy moments, and with it taking place in Antarctica, it could even be classified as an adventure. It is one of the most re-watchable movies ever made.",r
9,20 April 2002,The_Wood,10, I worship this film. 10/10,"John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.",w
10,12 September 2022,Xstal,8, Who Goes There?...,"You're stationed at an isolated outpost in Antarctica when a helicopter arrives intent on shooting a dog it had been pursuing across the tundra. Things get out of hand and the occupants of the chopper have their ability to pursue curtailed, more permanently than they'd like. Not too long after this carnage it becomes apparent that the pursuing shooters had a pretty good reason for wanting to remove the dog from the land of the living as the dog turns out to have the same aspirations as its pursuers, albeit in various guises, transformations, metamorphoses and reconfigurations.",3
11,12 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, A creepy gem of imaginative sci-fi horror,"Although this film clearly got made due to the success of ALIEN, I actually find it the better of the two. I certainly consider it Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy. This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story ""Who Goes There?"", which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting alien which consumes and imitates its prey – forget the T1000, he has nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting and disturbing and hard to forget – imagine some Lovecraftian terror in the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable body parts, and you're halfway there.",6
12,8 April 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, A serious contender for the best remake ever,The Thing is not only a brilliant remake(which I was not expecting after seeing abominations such as Psycho and The Wicker Man) but it is also a brilliant film that seamlessly blends horror and sci-fi amongst other things.,9
13,1 May 2008,DavidSim240183,10, The last John Carpenter classic,"In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.",5
14,19 December 2020,BandSAboutMovies,8, Makes more sense now,"This movie failed at the box office and nearly ruined the career of John Carpenter. Think of that as you watch it. But did it really fail? It made nearly $20 million on a $15 million budget, but audiences must have expected more. Studios certainly did.",9
15,28 May 2021,YellowTea,10, Couldn't Be Better - One of History's Greatest Films,"I remember being encouraged to watch this in my mid-teens. Naturally, being a teen, I was reluctant to give anything from the 80s a try as I felt it to be a long gone ancient era. I was pleasantly surprised. The practical effects were a very welcome change to the cgi I was used to. They were done so well that I was at no point removed from the illusion. To this day, they're still the best I've seen. It's proof that if done right, practical effects such as animatronics will always beat out cgi.",6
16,11 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,9, Must-watch for all horror fans,It's the start of winter. An isolation group of scientists at the United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica is interrupted by a Norwegian helicopter buzzing around. The Norwegians are throwing charges and shooting at a dog. George Bennings (Peter Maloney) is shot and Garry (Donald Moffat) kills the supposed mad Norwegian. Clark (Richard Masur) takes the dog in. MacReady (Kurt Russell) flies Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) and Garry to the Norwegian camp. They discover it smoldering and a place of massacre. Windows can't reach anybody on the radio.,5
17,30 May 2021,drewnes,10," ""First goddamn week of winter.""","I saved the best for last. There is nothing I don't like about this movie. The music, the pacing, the story, the practical effects, the cast, the paranoia, the ending.. I love it all. Kurt Russell is so cool and the creature haunted my dreams when I first saw this, and is still creepy on a rewatch. Sucks that it was not popular when it first came out, because I would've loved to see this in theaters. The Thing might be my favorite horror movie of all time.",/

19,19 May 2021,atdmv,10, Better than the book,One of very few movies that are better than the books they're based on. Great storyline. The effects exceed expectations for their time. Excellent acting!,r
20,29 December 2013,Vartiainen,9, Masterful horror,"The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.",e
21,10 March 2017,Hitchcoc,9, It Never Lets Up,"I don't know if I could ever watch this film again. It's one of those where, once you get involved, you sit on the edge of your seat, feeling everything that befalls these poor men. If one wanted to create a hell on earth, this would be it. From the Norwegians chasing that dog, to a minute by minute effort to survive and save civilization from this horror. The special effects dealing with the aliens transformation are stunning, especially when one realizes it was 1982 and the CGI stuff was really barely a thought. We care about the characters but are not let in on anything, so when something jumps, we jump with it. If there is a criticism, there is no release from the tension. Even if one is able to relax for a minute or two, there is an atmosphere of threat over everyone. When you can't trust the person you've known much of your life, who works next to you, when he becomes a deadly beast, what can you do? This is one of the greatest horror films ever.",f
22,31 December 2005,Quinoa1984,10," the most professionally astute horror film of the 80's, very entertaining","In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.",_

24,14 January 2006,Nightman85,10, You couldn't ask for better sci-fi horror!,Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing From Another World. ,t
25,9 March 2008,zetes,10, An equal to Alien,"This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense. It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in. Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form  kind of  and is burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features some of the best special effects of its time  they have not dated a bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside, though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. ""Nobody trusts anybody"" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a 1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.",t
26,3 February 2008,gheremond,10," One of the best horror movies ever, finally getting recognition.","If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, ""The Thing"" really gives ""Alien"" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider ""Starman"" to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike any""thing"" you have seen before.

27,23 July 2016,grantss,8, A horror classic,"A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread like a virus.

28,3 January 2023,acidburn-10,10, Monumental classic in every sense of the word,'The Thing' is a remake of the 1951 flick 'The Thing from Another World' and this must be if not one of the ultimate sci-fi horror classics.

31,27 October 2015,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10, A masterwork of horror atmosphere and special effects,"No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the 80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust, mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed. Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character. T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the ages.",

Giving us something missing from almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did well with this one, and maybe two others.",

36,1 May 2008,LagerLagerLagerShouting,9," Forget E.T, The Thing is The Real Alien Film of 1982.","John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original, Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.",

38,18 February 2006,lost-in-limbo,10, Sci-Fi / Horror that hits all the right chords!,"This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica. A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one, but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold, in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be enough to compensate for the handicap.",
39,3 August 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10, The Gospel according to Saint Carpenter,"I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror. He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to keep watching.",
40,18 February 2010,trnjamesbond,10, This is how a movie is made,"Anybody who knows anything about horror director John Carpenter knows how much he idolizes not only Howard Hawks but also the 1951 sci-fi chiller ""The Thing from Another World"" about an alien that tangles with a group of scientists who accidentally thaw out the creature out. Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella ""Who Goes There?"" (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes. ""The Thing"" is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising, and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense, humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in. Before long things start to happen. Kurt Russell stars a MacReedy, a rough and tough helicopter pilot who nurses Jack Daniels throughout the movie and wears a hilarious Yosemite Sam Stetson. Not to be missed. Lots of suspenseful situations.",

The rarest of the rare: a remake of a great film that is just as good, if not better, than the original. I don't know if I would say it's better but it's a damn fine film. I love both movies equally. It doesn't just copy the original. As a matter of fact, other than the bare bones of the plot, it's completely different. It adheres more closely to the short story that both Thing films were based on, which was more of a 'body snatchers' paranoia type of story.",

What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling, bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by everyone.

46,7 February 2021,mrashtastic89,10, Pretty amazing movie,"Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it, 'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do, it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another, and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it, it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things' really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold, savour it on a long cold night...",

The build suspense with their slow tracking and are perfectly planned with a great beginning and ending. This has to be one of the nicest shot films of this type. It started using the surround a lot but slowly became quite front-heavy. The sound was lacking in dynamic range and sounded eighties in the technical quality. The music was mostly really good but occasionally a bit dated. Dialogue was perfect except afore-mentioned technical problems. This is the definition of paranoid suspense horror. It builds on an idea into terror with perfect film-crafting. The acting is amazing and each character is distinct. The special effects are real and harrowing. Some scenes are so intense that it is almost impossible to take! A near-perfect horror that transcends its b-movie roots.,

There's just so much to appreciate. Much like both of those films, it is not strictly of one genre. It is a horror film as well as a psychological paranoia thriller, an explosion and gunfire-filled action movie, and a plausible science fiction movie. On top of that, it vaguely realistically depicts life in an antarctic research station, a setting that has not yet been fully explored to my satisfaction. There's a few goofups there such as an antarctic base housing a subterranean generator room (wouldn't they be concerned that such a thing would melt the ice out from under the buildings?).",

Dysart, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is very interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great effects! In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of all time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is very good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and the hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse!

There was also a goofy suggestion to use something hot to throw against the creature in order to subdue it.

Besides the fact that must be really frustrating to be working in a station like that without your family and women, the winter looks even more difficult in part because now they can't make a communication with anybody so practically nobody will hear their screams. That cold and lonely environment is perfect for the story of this film, story of paranoia, human behaviour and unknown things. That aspect of the unknown things is brilliant, first everything starts with an unusual situation: a Norwegian helicopter is pursuing a Siberian husky, trying to kill it. Not knowing why that Norwegian went crazy shooting everywhere, the men of the station kill him and the dog stays there. And since then they start to investigate, first to know more about the Norwegian station and later to know more about a thing that was defrost. Of course thanks to their science skills they obtain great information about what was really the dog and how that thing is able to imitate other life forms. Now the paranoia begins with everybody trying to survive and not trusting in anybody. Here the best part of the film begins with that thing that could be anybody. Of course every team has a leader, here is RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) who is the helicopter pilot and definitely the smartest and the only who still can think about a possible solution, also realizing that the thing is trying to survive just like them. The last part is just great with the ""still humans"" knowing that they are not going to survive but with the hope that they can take with them the thing.

This contributes to a sense of paranoid mystery that burns slowly from the beginning, starting with the Norwegians trying to kill a dog which puts everyone on alert. From there, everyone goes insane as they are picked off one by one - but they do not know whom is affected! The special effects of the creature makes it completely disturbing and revolting, while the setting is inhospitable and harsh.

Then there are the special effects, different every time and mind boggling and the degree to which we buy into these transformations figures heavily when the guys partake in the blood testing. A fantastic and central sequence where we believe nobody knows whether they are possessed or not and feel their individual fear as the Russian roulette type ritual is undergone.

I think the prosthetics and makeup in the movie are absolutely fantastic considering the time even more so. The movie is set in a place where everything is about the same colour palette (even the buildings) and I think when characters are on screen or the thing or fire which is commonly used it makes all that pop out a lot creating a really unique visual look. Again seeing the cast go against one another in a high tension kind of mystery thriller where even the audience is unsure of who the thing is at times is great for the story and makes everything more effective! You really get into the shoes of the characters in the story as you feel what they feel and are constantly on edge and guessing. It has psychological elements in the movie which I always love in movies, I'd say it thrives more off that element and creating a guessing game which is insanely tense instead of showing the monster all the time and it definitely succeeds.

Of course this was a very bad mistake; one which will cost many lives.

While I agree that the special effects and the grotesque visuals were amazingly creative for a movie made 40 years ago, I think the movie's strong suit lies in its writing. The script is airtight and Mr. Carpenter's direction doesn't allow us for any room for breathing. Everybody is at constant paranoia and doubt of each other in the isolated Antarctica camp, and such fear does not feel forced or arbitrary. The only one that the audience is certain that is not infected is MacReady, because he is the main character.

Unlike with The Shining, The Thing isn't bogged down by unlikable characters and scenes which don't advance the story in important ways. Kurt Russel always seems to be a huge presence in his films. His likability always makes the movie itself more likable. The whole cast deliver convincing performances. This movie doesn't hold back on gore and suspense. The paranoia is real as everyone is suspicious of each other not being human. The need for a strong leader arises and Kurt Russel's character is the obvious man for the job. Even so, the fear and lack of trust creates tension between the characters and apprehension in the viewer. This alien monster puts an abundance of blood, slime and grisly images on display. So much so that the initial shock factor proved to be a bit too much for its viewers in 1982. Even all these years later, the special effects hold up well. This movie has a lot going for it.

It is somewhat funny, the spin history can put on things, because now as a Lucas-like special edition has failed to reinvigorate interest in the family-friendly box office hit, The Thing has found a new life as a cult piece. This is not to put down Spielberg's career-building piece, as it is a well-made film in its own right. But years after I have forgotten Spielberg's effort, and dismissed it after he tried to make even more suitable only for infants, I still remember the mood it put me in, the first time I saw The Thing, and watched as the creepiest score I have heard in at least a thousand films played over elegantly understated credits.

The practical monster effects looked disgusting and realistic and as far as I know they smelled terribly, which make the actors be disgusted by it. The set was also very cold which led actors to feel it like we see in the movie. As far as I know the actors got script by parts not revealing who is a monster so it would keep the mystery for them and also make their performances better.
As for movie itself, the practical effect do in fact look very good, they realistic and disgusting, the monster designs are brilliant. The movie is very thrilling and unpredictable.

114,16 June 2021,sulakevinicius,10, Iam very surprised that this movie is old,"Some time ago, I wrote about The Thing From Another World, a classic 50s sci-fi movie that focuses on an almost unkillable alien creature rampaging through a base in the arctic and causing destruction. John Carpenter, being the avid fan of horror he is, was probably a big fan of that movie and wanted to reinvent it in a newer style for modern audiences. The movie bears a lot of similarities with its predecessor, the most distinctive being the similar setting. However, the 50s film takes place at the north pole, while this takes place in Antarctica. They both involve tons of snow and frigid temperatures so it can be easy to forget which is which. Despite essentially being an unofficial followup to the 50s movie, The Thing's plot is drastically different in many ways. It begins with a vehicle that was around during the filming of the original, but was not featured: a helicopter. One belonging to a team of Norwegian explorers to be specific. They are flying near the south pole and chasing some kind of dog with the flying machine, which leads them to an american base. After landing, the norwegian helicopter blows up and everyone onboard is killed. An american named MacReady (Kurt Russell) is stationed at the base and takes a helicopter ride of his own to the base the norwegians were a part of, only to find a strange creature that appears to be dead. MacReady takes it back to base for study, and Blair, a doctor, finds perfectly healthy organs inside of it. Meanwhile, the dog the helicopter was chasing earlier gets locked up with some other ones, when all of a sudden it transforms into a grotesque, gory mess of tentacles and bones. The researchers manage to fend it off with a flamethrower, and shortly after, learn about a buried alien spaceship. Things get worse when the alien starts to kill personnel all around the base and prevents it from being reinforced. It also becomes apparent the alien has the ability to steal the appearance of any one of the team members, meaning nobody can be trusted. The alien continues to infect and kill the remaining members of the base, and MacReady is forced to lay explosive charges all around the area in a last ditch attempt to get rid of the creature. Blair is killed and his body is taken over by the alien, who uses it to attack MacReady. Nevertheless, the base explodes anyway, and MacReady (alongside Childs, the only other survivor) grab a beer. When it was released back in 1982, this movie was so hated and misunderstood that it was called ""instant junk."" The thing is (no pun intended), this probably came about because of bad timing. E. T. Was released the same year, and also featured an alien. The difference is that it had a much more lighthearted mood and was easier and less violent to watch. Interestingly, the theme for this movie was done by Ennio Morricone, which was unexpected. The special effects in this movie are what really steal the show, since they're quite disturbing, especially when the alien is able to steal people's bodies and make all their skin peel off. During its release, lots of people hated this movie because of how graphic it is, and also because of its cynical attitude of not being able to trust anyone, since after all, they might be the alien. John Carpenter said he was greatly upset when he heard people at the time hated this movie, saying how ""he takes every failure hard."" Many of his movies, like Halloween, also have this gory, slasher feel to them, and this contrasted deeply with Spielberg's ET. Still, more recent reviews have been more positive, citing that the movie didn't get admiration when it came out and thus deserves some now. The synthesizer music is really creepy, and the thought of being stuck in -70 degree weather where nobody can help you is pretty disturbing. When compared with the 50s original, I feel that The Thing is an inferior but still worthy remake. The original set the standard and had a different monster, one that was visible to all the members of the base. This one can be anywhere at any time. I still think it's odd how a remake ended up more popular than the original, because without that movie, this one wouldn't exist.",

It's a movie that scares you with little to no jumpscares because it presents you with superb visual effects that will make you look away at the horrific mutated monsters, the chilling and claustrophobic environment and the uneasy feeling of distrust regarding all characters in the picture. You never know who's human and who's pretending to be human and you never know what is lurking inside, what the infection is, where it is, what it is doing when it might be right in front of you, etc. It's right there, haunting and destroying you but you can't see it, feel it, hear it, touch it.

This, like Alien toys with the viewer's imagination as you don't know what's going to happen next or what the enemy looks like. Adding to that, like Alien is a sense of paranoia as the men can't determine who's the enemy. The effects of the creature are great, no CGI here, all practical and it holds up quite nicely which makes it all the more terrifying. The acting is great and every man has a different personality, though it lacks character development. Love the fact that it takes place in Antarctica, cut off from the rest of society, and with few weapons, only one really works against the monster.

125,5 March 2020,SeagalMuskula,10, masterpiece,"As most of the reviewers for this film will agree, this is a genuinely gripping story from start to finish, as well as being a horror classic. But it's also an important milestone for two reasons.
First it was one of the very first horror films to actually give you in detail, a really good look at the various monstrous expressions of the key villain. Up to that time most horrors were implied and as soon as you saw the the rather dodgy special effects representing the actual monster, the illusion started to fade.
Secondly, despite this challenge, absolutely no CGI or anything like it was used. Computer graphics in those days were so primitive that it took the makers several days to create a simple computer screen showing the cells of the monster transforming into those of a host. Instead the special effects team took a delirious joy in dreaming up ingenious ways to show various horrors using simple techniques like reversing the film, the use of plentiful amounts of plasticine, string and goo, and stop motion photography.
Lastly there was brilliant use of a trained Alsatian dog. The strange stillness and focus of its gaze before it's finally revealed that it has been invaded by the alien sends a chill down the back and was completely convincing.

129,12 October 2021,laurelhardy-12268,10, As frightening as Sci-Fi/Horror gets,"If the tag-line for ALIEN was ""In space no one can hear you scream"", then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: ""In Antarctica, no one can hear you scream."" Originally, The Thing started life as a novella called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien. Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems... Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer, there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!",

Having seen the original 1951 Howard Hawks' classic a few times, I was stunned that Carpenter's remake is actually SLOWER than the original film, which moves at a brisker pace, never lets up, and is still fun to watch even over 60s years later!

Here was a John Carpenter movie that broke all the boundries of what horror-scifi is all about, & then some. Based on the excellent movie ""Thing from Another World"" (1951) it tells the story of a crew of men at an Antarctica research base & their deadly encounters with a deep space shape shifting alien, which infects people it wants to replecate. The Thing 1982 makes Alien 1979 look like childs play! This move actually follows the original 1938 novella called ""Who goes there"" by John W. Campbell quite closely as opposed to the 1951 film & the result is nothing short of spectacular with ground breaking special effects, great acting & a screen play that is nightmare inducing. The minimalist score by Ennio Morricone who uses simple bass tones to invoke a sinister foreboding is equally chilling & fits the back drop perfectly. If anyone of the younger generation enjoyed the 2011 remake & loved it, it's well worth giving this a try. Some of the other, less impressed reviews are amusing, saying they found the Dog-Thing disturbing & gross. What you find disturbing is actually a sock puppet operated on the arm of monster genius Stan Winston & basically if a horror film creeps you out then it has done its job. Don't like the genre. Don't watch it then! Another reviewer on here said this was a ""man"" film (?) Well I am a woman in my 50's who has adored this movie over & over for the past 38 years!

Attempting to determine who it might be, and selectively isolating him? Destroying everyone so that you might survive? Attempting to use reason and science in a helter skelter, chaotic situation?

There may be a couple of moments when one wonders about character motivations and it's a pretty simple story, but the latter keeps it focused, and the pace of the film is good. Kurt Russell and Keith David stand out in the cast, which also includes A. Wilford Brimley and Donald Moffat.",

To be honest, I'm not a big John Carpenter fan. In fact, of all of his attempts at the genre, this is the only one that stands out to me. It's just as impactful as it was forty years ago. I was six years old when this came out and even though it scared the ever-living bejeezus out of me, I would keep an eye on the weekly TV Guide to make sure that I watched every Showtime showing of this spectacular film. I was both enthralled and terrified by this amazing movie. If you're on the fence about watching it, just do yourself a favor and watch it... Alone... At night... In the dark. You'll never be the same. Most definitely my favorite movie of any genre of all time. No movie has been made that even comes close.

In this version, the title alien starts to inhabit many of the dogs and people that are stationed in the Antarctic Circle. Among the crew: R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), Nauls (T. K. Carter), Dr. Blair (A. Wilford Brimley without his familiar mustache and glasses), Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan), Garry (Donald Moffat), Clark (Richard Masur), Dr. Cooper (Richard Dysart), and others. I'll stop there and just say how fascinatingly weird and gory this movie is. I mean from the dog scene to yet another creature-coming-out-of-someone's-body sequence, there's plenty of entertaining blood-drenched visual effects courtesy of Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. And the pulsating score of Ennio Morricone is positively riveting. I can't always make sense of the dialogue in Bill Lancaster's screenplay but as long as those monster effects come on, I'm never bored.

Ever since then I'm careful when I see a Hushky...John Carpenter's version of the ""Who Goes There"" story is fascinating, scary and pretty gore at several times but it surely is highly recommended. The creepy atmosphere is unique and very few movies equal to it or even come close. The Thing is some sort of Alien monster that has been safely frozen for the last 100.000 years but now it has thawed. That's the fault of a few Norwegian guys...In the form of a innocent looking dog, the thing ends up in an American Station. This is the greatest power of the enemy. It's fully capable to take over any life form and therefore it's hard to detect. And ... even more importantly ... it doesn't take long before anyone can be trusted. Everyone could in fact be ""The Thing"" This rather simple - but at the same time original and innovative - aspect about the enemy allows the story to create a unique claustrophobic atmosphere. First of all, you have the isolated landscape of the Antarctic Circle. The groups ' space to run and hide is very limited since it's unbearably cold and there are lots of storms. Secondly, the Thing to itself is very unpredictable. The tension between the characters can almost be smelled by the viewer and I think that's Carpenter biggest achievement about this movie. Although, there ain't much dialog in this film , you're kept close to the screen in order not to miss anything. Basically, Carpenter does pretty much the same as in his other horror classic Halloween. Although this is a complete different plot and complete different setting, there's not a message to detect, no psychological undertone or no form of humanity what so ever. Just a raw battle to survive between a bunch of tough men.",

This is definitely a testament of how horror films should be made. Although their is copious amounts of gore, it never lags in suspense, good acting, taut plot buildup, and enthralling drama. This is a time when CGI was nearly unheard of and special effects and horror make-up were made from scratch in an artists studio. Yes, they literally had to build and create tangible/three dimensional puppets, robots and props to enhance the movie monsters and horror effects. By the early 80's there were several notable horror make-up artists that earned the majority of the business. Therefore, they were at the height of their craft due to competition and a deep appreciation and desire to explore the depths of their creativity that the imagination could fathom.",

Not everyone is human, so the remaining workers must figure out who to trust. That is where the horror and thrills arise. Push aside the gruesome, terrifying, hideous looking aliens that are constructed to precision for now. It's the isolation that sends chills down the spine. An enormous sense of claustrophobia where trust issues are the major concern. The characters are well established, well developed and well acted enough to, finally, create an involving story. Seriously, the plot is so welcoming that it invites you to figure out who might be ""The Thing"". Tense, gritty, dark...just how I like my horrors. Now we can throw in the inventive practical effects to enhance the film onto a-whole-nother level. Wow. It was so disgustingly delicious that I had to rewind back, hold up my phone on snapchat, and record those scenes so that all my friends can appreciate what I went through. Even the cries that ""The Thing"" yelps is nightmare inducing. John Carpenter's direction was slow, but it worked! He took his time to bring life to the characters and to create the chilling tension. I found the scene transitions slightly basic and jarring, simply fading to black. Also the ending was a tad underwhelming, was hoping for a final minute twist or something.

Carpenter thinks that slimy creatures and graphic mutilations are entertaining, but it's just disgusting. There is no subtlety at work here. This film has parallels to ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the original) and ""Alien,"" but one of the reasons it falls far short of those landmark sci-fi classics is that there's little build-up of suspense.

In The Thing, Carpenter (with the help of the screenwriter) has us get to know every single character, without it being redundant or boring. We know every character so when one doesn't make it, we know who it was. The practical effects are remarkable, and it is a creepy movie. It's creepier than most horror movies today.

This film still looks great,"The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself. You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10",

180,21 April 2011,neil-476,8, Excellent update,"Carpenter actually managed to make his ""The Thing"" far inferior to its predecessor , the 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". If you have read my comment on the latter you may know what I'm talking about, but the fact remains that you cannot make this sort of movie based purely on some cheesy monster, it has to be character driven first; that's why ""Predator"", the whole ""Alien"" franchise and some other monster movies work. And what does ""The Thing"" have to offer; well not much; Kurt Russel is his hillbilly self, taking the leader role from the very start and the rest of the cast doesn't amount to much either. The best part of the whole movie is the opener which really got me thinking and hoping what Carpenter had in store, but it just proved to be a disappointment. The movie also excluded some of the best scenes from the original, like showing  the discovery of the space ship. The 1951 movie made that scene very thrilling, showing less than more, making the viewer yearn for a glimpse but never getting one. And don't get me started on the monsters; the comments I read from the IMDb users make you want to think the effects are better and scarier than anything you've ever seen, but the honest to God truth is I'd choose even the original creature from ""Alien"" any day. There are just so many things popping and bursting out of those creatures it's hard to swallow, and the head-turn-to-spider scene is a real gem when it comes to idiotic comedy. Plus it shows just how much the special effects creators were influenced by ""Alien"" which came out only a couple of years ago; the thing even lived off of the same thing, it needed a host and then it just ate whatever it could find. There were even similarities with the whole blood scene; alien's was acid, this one just lived forever and didn't like fire. I thought Morricone's score was quite good, the whole 5 minutes of it which I'm guessing is one of the reasons it got a Razzie nomination. Ha. Overall, a movie that doesn't pay much tribute to the original, nor does it manage to surpass it, not by a long shot. Not enough atmosphere, a poor script and a bad climax don't amount to much and probably the most inventive and positive thing in this whole mess is the very ending, which reminds us ""The Thing"" is definitely a Carpenter movie, sadly just not one of the better ones. 5/10",

Also, my favorite line in the film still holds up. ""I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off."" Without spoiling too much of the plot, Kurt Russell is part of a US outpost in Antarctica who encounter an alien life form that kills and then assumes the form of outpost members, leaving those still human unable to figure out who is friend or foe, ALA ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" A remake of the Howard Hawks produced ""The Thing from Another World,"" Carpenter ups the suspense tenfold by not having one alien terrorizing the isolated team, but has any and all of the characters a potential enemy. It's utterly chilling when at one point a desperate Russell tells the group, ""I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human."" Members of that team are played by an excellent and varied group of actors who include Keith David (""They Live"" ""Pitch Black""), Wilford Brimley (""The Firm"" ""The Natural""), T. K. Carter (""Runaway Train"" ""Southern Comfort""), Richard Dysart (""LA Law"" ""Being There""), Richard Masur (""Risky Business"" ""My Girl""), Donald Moffat (""The Right Stuff"" ""Clear and Present Danger""), and other character actors you'd know their face if not their names. The script is credited to Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and is his only original film script outside of ""The Bad News Bears"" (arguably the greatest sports film of all time) and an okay sequel, ""The Bad News Bears Go to Japan."" The script is efficient and stripped down in a way that perfectly matches Carpenter's directorial sensibilities. When this film originally came out it was considered wildly gory in its graphic violence, courtesy of special effects wizard Rob Bottin. SPOILER ALERT! I remember my mind exploding the first time is saw the a head extricate itself from it's burning torso and then sprout spider-like legs to escape. The same can be said for the chest cavity opening up to bite off Richard Dysart's arms, and for so many other wild moments that are a result of Bottin's truly monstrous creations. All of this is masterfully shot and edited by Carpenter and crew. The crisp, stark photography by Carpenter's regular DP Dean Cundey, who'd later go on to work regularly with Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard on high profile Hollywood films, is absolutely dynamite. And enough cannot be said for the score by Ennio Morricone, which interestingly sounds more similar to a John Carpenter score than most Morricone scores. Morricone at this point had done some work for Hollywood films (""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Exorcist II""), but this is the film that really started landing him bigger Hollywood pictures such as ""The Untouchables"" and ""In the Line of Fire."" It's also fun to watch rewatch this film if you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" due to Tarantino's many nods, intentional or not, to Carpenter's film. Overall, if there was ever a perfect marriage of science fiction and horror, ""The Thing"" is that film. And if you ever want to have a vigorous argument with me, let's start a discussion about what is the most perfect horro film of all time.",

So glad to have this finally off my list of shame and even happier that it actually lives up to all the hype, not necessarily in the way I thought but still incredible. I didn't find it particularly scary or anything and would probably classify it more as a creature thriller more than horror but that's not a bad thing. The tension this builds is incredible, the way the characters all twist and turn on each other is intriguing and seems realistic enough to be believable. So this psychological aspect was completely unexpected for me and I loved that. Then there's the effects themselves which are mindblowingly good even to current standards almost 40 years later. The Thing makes me want to sing the praises and pine for the days of practical effects, when a movie could still look so good regardless of the passage of time or advancements in technology.",

It was difficult for me to follow this many characters as it was a crowded crew so for me it was more like McReady (Kurt Russel) and the other guys. The most epic scene was of course when the guy was performing CPR on a man and his body opened like a mouth and severed his arms and after he's burnt with the flamethrower, his head fell to the ground unburnt and turned into a giant spider-like creature. Blair who was locked up in the store shed was found to build another spacecraft like the one Norwegian crew found under the ice. The blood samples was being heated with a copper wire to see who's an imitation and one of the guys turned into a giant monster and that scene was really good too. Blair the old guy that was locked up wore the face of one of the three last surviving guys like a glove.

200,28 May 2013,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,10, Ultimately creepy and unsettling,"I caught this on the big screen when it came out and I watched myself at some point actually gripping the armrests of my movie seat. I was eagerly looking forward to this being a die-hard fan of the 1951 version that I have seen countless times and will see again. I like this movie because we got to be one of the boys in the film and because of that, we closely follow what they do and say and care for them. That's the idea! When the movie takes off, it is hard to determine who is who and when but one doesn't have time to figure it all out. The intensity prevents that and before we know it, we went along for a thrill ride! Kudos to everyone involved and a hearty well-done. I have a small gripe about this and the 2011 film. In the 1951 version, the head scientist goes without sleep for days during the whole ""thing"". I get it too. Who would want to sleep with this type of discovery. Also worth mentioning is they don't waste anytime trying to access the spaceship. Both the 1982 and the 2011 completely dismiss both the spaceship for exploration purposes and more investigating of the ""THING"" . Now ask yourself, wouldn't you want to see the inside of a spaceship from another world? Its weapons? Food? Clothing? Endless items? Finding and exploring the ship is one thing and understanding what we find is another. Who could sleep? Both films avoid going there. Shame too. In any event, the premise remains and holds like no other: A spaceship and its occupants. What do they want? Where did they come from? Wow! I like to eat while watching and this movie is good for a meal, a tasty drink and a decent snack of choice. Sunflower or pumpkin seeds work very well so that you don't nail bite or get antsy.

For starters, it is scary, no question about it. The film is able to create a terrifying atmosphere and combines it with a sense of paranoia and dread from the first frame. The dark and moody tone continues throughout the film and builds off the ever increasing amount of suspense and claustrophobia. It doesn't take too long either for the things to get freaky; extremely freaky! The cast is another thing that's well worth mentioning. They bring humanity to the characters with vivid life and even a bit of humor. It's Kurt Russell though that really shines. He's as good as he's ever been,
sarcastic and unafraid, making for a milestone in his career of performances. The elaborate special effects though are the undeniable highlight of the film because they leave absolutely nothing to our imagination and push the boundaries of gore to their very limit. It's the stomach-churning visual excess and outright disturbing use of realism that make this film so horrifying. This is the movie that shows you how to love the horror genre and appreciate its relentless desire to be as unpleasant as
possible. Bloody, creepy, frightening, shocking, and very wellacted, The Thing is a horror classic full of grotesque effects and chilling scares.",

It is a masterpiece of suspense, paranoia and dread. . Why does the film work so well you ask? The setup is standard stuff, establishing that the characters are isolated and can expect no help from the outside but it is the realization there could be an alien among them, and any one of them might not be human, is what launches The Thing into a spiral of escalating tension. The quest to identify the alien consumes about half the movie's running time, and includes several red herrings and the gripping blood test sequence in which MacReady uses a hot wire and samples of everyone's hemoglobin to clear some members of the crew and damn others. The final confrontation with the alien, despite providing the most grotesque special effect of the movie and allowing plenty of pyrotechnics, is anticlimactic. Then again, after the extended suspense of the middle section, it's hard to see how any resolution could rise to that level. This is great filmmaking and the Thing came during Carpentar's most fertile period as a filmmaker. Kurt Russell shines as do the rest of the all male cast.

This question was quickly answered, it turns out that this is not a dog at all, but ""the thing""
Behind the monsters gradually showed a fierce look, using psychological warfare to kill the scientific research personnel one by one and make everyone self-endangered.

I guess it's slightly unfair to judge with hindsight as the special effects are made less spectacular by the fact that we have seen them in Alien.

Most of his films are often hated upon release and then years later, are considered cult classics. That would be the case with 1982's The Thing which I consider to be more based off of the original story ""Who Goes There?"" and not the 1951 film, The Thing From Another World. I have not read the story or even watched the 1951 film. With that being said, when this film was released, nearly every one hated this film. But, years later, people now consider this film to be one of the best John Carpenter films and one of the best horror films of all time. This is notably one of the few John Carpenter films to not be scored by John Carpenter himself and rather was scored by the late Ennio Morricone. The film notably stars Kurt Russel in one of his many roles in John Carpenter films, Keith David (who would later star in They Live, and Wilfred Brimley (famous for the diabetes commercials that are so nostalgic).

Campbell Jr. novel it was based, with an updated screenplay by Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Starman), this is a special effects extravaganza. Basically an alien ship crashed to Earth, and then we see a helicopter circling an Antartican snowfield, trying to shoot a dog, and this is where American researchers work in their facility. They let the dog into their facility, but what they don't realise is that it is an alien copy, and it is only when they see the remains of a mangled body they discover and realise this ""Thing"" can transform and take the appearance of anyone amongst them. Everyone is now a suspect, because they don't know who is the ""Thing"", and one by one, the unlucky few are suffering the horrific terror attacks to it. The only way to determine the alien is taking blood and putting it in a dish, to see reaction to a hot needle, and they have to make sure all other remains of it are with it to be destroyed. Starring Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair, T.K. Carter as Nauls, David Clennon as Palmer, Keith David as Childs, Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, Charles Hallahan as Vance Norris, Peter Maloney as George Bennings, Richard Masur as Clark, Donald Moffat as Garry, Joel Polis as Fuchs and Thomas G.

It is almost unbelievable to think that absolutely every effect in this film was created by animatronics, no CGI whatsoever, and you have to remember that things and people are being ripped apart, and they still move! The story is good, the acting is as good as you can get, and the special effects, what can I say, a good horror classic.

271,7 June 2020,joelgodinho,8, One of Carpenter's Best,"Kurt Russell and John Carpenter collaborate again in this frostbitten masterpiece of extraterrestrial terror. Kurt is the lead and the film contains an excellent ensemble all male cast. In this horror/science fiction story and sausage party, our cast and film makers deliver the goods. They are a twelve man research team in Antarctica and have discovered that a shape shifting alien is capable of imitating anything and infects and imitates its host. If it reaches civilization, it could mean the extinction of all life on planet Earth. The special f/x by Robert Botin are state of the art and truly remarkable. The tone of the film is stark, apocalyptic and dead serious. The atmosphere is cold and tense, enhanced to great effect by Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. Performances by the cast are very solid and another one of my favorite actors Keith David also appears and gives our lead, Kurt some competition as alpha male of the show. Keith David also worked with John Carpenter on They Live, another classic and huge favorite of mine. This was the first film which John Carpenter refers to as his apocalypse trilogy. The three films have nothing to do with one another, but deal with a potential end of the world situation in different ways. The other two films are Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness which are both very good as well. The Thing is one of his best films and you can feel the coldness and isolation as this group of men struggle for survival on this Antarctic glacier.

272,9 February 2015,dworldeater,10, John Carpenter's sci fi/horror masterwork!,"""The Thing"" is a co-production between the United States and Canada from 1982, so this one here will have its 40th anniversary next year already. Kinda strange the (early) 1980s are this far away already. Anyway, I see there are several versions out there, but the most common one, also the one I saw the other day, is the one that is slightly closer to two hours than to 90 minutes. The language is really English from beginning to end with a very tiny amount of Norwegian early on. But really just minimal. This is considered one of the best and most famous film by director John Carpenter, a bit of a horror film icon, but I hope it is not really one of his best because that would mean that the many, many films he made are mostly genuinely mediocre or even weak because I am not particularly impressed by this one here at all. But I shall get to that a little later. The two writers were Bill Lancaster and John W. Campbell Jr. And they are both deceased now unfortunately. Lancaster was still fairly young here and died at an early age 15 years after this movie and Campbell was about as old as Carpenter is today, so he would be 110 now, which of course did not happen. For both of them, this film is by far their most known career effort. As for the cast, you will not find many familiar faces either. The one big exception is of course lead actor Kurt Russell. Or he is the closest to a lead maybe, also because of his character, from this ensemble cast. He is also first credit. He was 30 here. Keith David also deserves a mention. He won three Emmys and Russell was ""only"" nominated for one, but yeah feel free to check out everybody's body of work if you care what (else) they did. They were no rookies and acted before and after this film of course, but no performers that you recognize immediately and remember the name. On the crew members I will not elaborate in detail, but most did a fine job. Nothing to complain about for example in terms of costumes or sets.",

The Thing was the only one I had never even heard of, and the premise sounded super interesting, so we decided on that one. I don't know why this film isn't on the same popular level as The Shining or Jaws when it really should be. The Thing is absolutely terrifying on every single level. The practical effects are AMAZING and they look super realistic. It blew my mind because I thought the film was made in the 90's, not 1982. However, what I think is even greater is the story. The idea of being trapped in a building with no escape and your with a bunch of people and one of them is a killer but you don't know who? Terrifying concept!!! It was great to see all these palatable characters turn against each other in a realistic way. They weren't just cardboard stereotypes, they were realistic and interesting characters and it was scary to see them decay to paranoia. I was at the edge of my seat trying to figure out who was lying, and whenever an alien was revealed I nearly died from the shock. It's a shame that critics bashed the movie back in 1982 because it was too gory for their snobby old stomachs to handle. Who cares about the gore? The effects and gore are super good, but the real scary thing here is the tension. The Thing needs to be a lot more popular then it is. I had never even heard of the film before my film school and that's a huge shame because The Thing is now one of my favorite movies.

If you don't get anxious and ask important questions about what exactly happens that we don't get to see, and when, during the course of this, then you, my friend, were not properly engaged, and, let's be brutally honest here, this film probably wasn't meant for you(and hey, that's no problem, nothing is for everyone). A lot of debate is possible over the answers. And that's part of why this is so enormously terrifying, and what keeps this working for the audience, even with many viewings. It's difficult to be certain. The plot is marvelous, and its progression feels natural without being predictable. The concept is well-thought out, interesting and fascinating, and the execution does not disappoint. The pacing is spot-on, there is not a misplaced moment to be found in this. When this intends to be, it is rather intense. The atmosphere is expertly crafted, and builds at the proper speed, never rushed. The tension is so thick you can practically *see* it. The gore is plentiful, and while quite frightening, it isn't the point, nor does it ever feel like it is. And whether you like them or not, ya gotta admit, they look pretty darn good for when they were made. All the special effects in this do, almost entirely on account of Rob Bottin, the newcomer who literally exhausted himself creating them. The key is the balance, how far you push the shocks, and John's got that down to a science. The humor is of the same type and close to the same amount as his usual efforts. The acting is average or above. The characters are sufficiently developed and varied. The dialog is well-delivered and well-written. The mood is helped by the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone, who applies his talent, and puts together music that fits Carpenter perfectly. If your nerves are not in tattered rags before this is over... see the beginning of this review. All of these things together... the isolation of the people and the setting, the long, claustrophobic hallways, the genuinely successful scares, the gruesome violence and the haunting, unsettling score... it creates a strong horror piece which still holds up today, and which manages to get jumps out of yours truly, after having watched it around a dozen times. The DVD holds a feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with Kurt Russell and the director, who are cool to listen to together, and which is both entertaining and informative. The menus are a tad flat, and one can tell that the release was done years after this hit theaters.

What he did in remaking a 50's science fiction movie into a super horror movie was just genius. The story has these guys (and it is all males, not a female to be seen) at some sort of research facility in Antarctica, I think. They discover something that has been removed from the ice at another facility, having been led there after witnessing a helicopter chasing after a dog with the purpose of killing it. Well they explore the base and take said dog back to their base, which in turn leads to some thing moving about the facility. It seems to infect or take on properties of those it kills, it is kind of hard to say, but when you find it out it goes all out to defend itself making for some of the most gruesome special effects you have ever seen. I love the scene with the shock pads and the head, who can forget the head? The movie also has such tense moments as you do not know who could be the thing and the group of dwindling survivors gets more and more nervous and paranoid as their numbers go down. The monster effects would inspire a lot of horror movies and games, just look at the recent ""Dead Space"" video game for things that look like they came straight out of this movie. This movie would also be Carpenter's greatest movie, looking at this one wonder's how he could have made a movie as bad as ""Ghosts of Mars"". This is also one of Kurt Russell's best roles as well, he and Carpenter always make a good team and this movie makes for a good night of fear, suspicion and gore. The thing could be anywhere...or be anyone!",

Great paranoia horror from one of the masters of horror.,"After watching ""The Thing"" for the first time in 2021, I am genuinely perplexed as to how this film doesn't get its respects in being an all time horror masterpiece.

There are no weaknesses in cinematography, acting, effects, human drama or science fiction concept. There is a certain amount of shock effect, but an impressive feature is the additional horror produced by the concept of the predicament of the ice station crew and by extension, humanity.

While this 1982 version was not the exact same storyline, it took the premise of what the original offered then ran with it.. If you go back and look at the original what made it really stand out was the crisp and intelligent dialog that went on though out the movie.. The 1982 version seemed more like a bunch of cowboys on ice rather than intelligent beings and scientists battling a being from another world. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it but for me visual scares do not put fear into me as much as that of an unknown terror approaching.

307,2 November 2013,RMS1949,6, Good but still prefer the original..,"Men at a remote Antarctic research base are threatened by an alien creature that can absorb and duplicate its victims. Director John Carpenter's gruesome splatter version of the story is much truer to the original (John W. Campbell's 1938 short story 'Who Goes There?') than 1951's 'The Thing (From Another World)'. As noted elsewhere, the film was largely reviled when it was first released for its over-the-top gruesome special effects and its cold, nihilistic vibe (at the time audiences and critics were used to the cheerful optimism of 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and the saccharine-sweetness of 'E.T.'). Led by Kurt Russell, the film's all male cast makes no effort to make their characters heroic or likable, but as the premise of the story is that you cannot trust anyone, asocial hostility is a realistic, if not very pretty, reaction. Carpenter has never been known for his subtlety, and this film's special effects are (in)famous for their shocking ugliness. Standards have changed in 40 years and the ingenious mechanical effects might seem quaint to fans reared on CGI but some (but not all) of the images are highly memorable (the spider-head for example). Sci-fi films have depicted aliens that can mimic people for decades and while the concept makes for a good yarn, it makes little sense and 'The Thing's plot is no exception. Key to the story is that individual parts of the alien are independent creatures, and since the conservation of mass seems to be conveniently ignored, every spilled drop of alien blood is therefore a new creature, making hunting down one pointless. Definitely a film to enjoy (albeit not to everyone's taste) but not think too hard about (but 'so what'). The early shots of the Norwegians finding the Thing's circular spaceship is a nice homage to the iconic scene in the 1951 film.",

This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences.

The film features a one trick pony with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly exploiting the scare potential of such a ""character"". Instead the shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other function.

Yet they're over the top enough to make the film energetic and fun and honestly make the even more dreary bickering of the station crew lively. The suspense is also so well laid and executed and the different things you might pick up on as you watch this film make it such a fun rewatch. Pair that with a fantastic cast and you just get a horror film for the ages. But you know what I'll admit? The suspense does take a little while to build, and to be quite honest I don't remember the first act of the film being so slow. I feel like there are two critical scenes that could've either been trimmed down or cut entirely as they really only reinforce what we as an audience already know.

326,22 October 2022,the50xbomb,9, The Thing About The Thing,"Don't let the extremely high rating here on IMDb fool you, this movie does not deliver. It honestly did nothing but bore me the entire time. The movie starts off slow, and never really gets going. There's no character development with any of the characters sans Kurt Russell, and the movie relies on Gore & special effects for it's scares. Trust me when I say there's absolutely nothing suspenseful about this movie, and the paranoia theme doesn't work here. What we basically get is some shape shifting Alien that apparently was frozen for thousands of years, which apparently a group of Norwegians was able to carry to their base, which then escaped and started attacking the group of Americans. That's the plot right there. What it does is it basically stays hidden as a dog for a very long time, apparently not in the mood to make it's attack, and only gets caught because apparently the sounds of dogs barking annoys it enough. And let's not forget how the seemingly immortal Shape Shifting Alien dies in such a laughably easy manner. Kurt Russell and his crew spend the entire time burning it down, and yet it somehow still finds a way to survive, making it seemingly immortal. Then at the end Russell blows it up easily with a stick of dynamite, which for some reason he never thought of doing before. We also have no idea what happens to the Nauls character, as he just disappears into oblivion. Apparently his character wasn't needed anymore, so the makers of this film decided to get rid of him by sending the character to go investigate something he saw, even though the character Nauls knows there's an Alien out there waiting to take over his body. Honestly, what sense does that make? That part right there was very poorly written. As to the ending, it really makes no sense because it features Russell's character and Childs sitting there wondering if each one is possibly The Thing, despite Russell just recently killing it. And if either one was The Thing, why didn't it attack the other? Why sit there drinking whiskey with a human when you could easily finish him off? It makes no sense to me. Also, neither apparently care to leave the freezing area, apparently leaving us to believe they both just die there. Anyway, the only points I give this movie for is the special effects, and the atmosphere. The location of Antarctica was fantastic, and the special effects for it's time were astounding.

An American scientific expedition in the Antarctic is laid siege by a shape-shifting alien, and no one is able to stop it. Kurt Russell stars as the expedition's bearded, quirky pilot. Shot in Canada, the movie is stark and shocking at times, and the creature effects -- prosthetics, the forerunner to CGI -- are simply amazing. They look great to this day. The opening is haunting: a sled dog is pursued across frozen terrain by a gun-toting helicopter crew from a Norwegian camp. The dog reaches the American camp, and it soon becomes apparent this is no ordinary dog. It is an alien in disguise, which the Norwegians inadvertently released from its 30,000 year old frozen slumber. Carpenter respectfully pays homage to the 1951 Howard Hawks version, but takes his remake to levels Hawks could only have dreamed of. Great supporting cast, including Wilfred Brimley and Keith David. For those unfamiliar with the source material, it is a short story called ""Who Goes There?"" Carpenter's version is much closer than Hawks' to this Cold War tale.

MacReady, a scientist stationed in remote Antarctica. The setting, Antarctica, has really never been seen in a horror film, so with all the snow and cold, it provided a great hopeless dark atmosphere. The cast around Russell were also suburb with all delivering great written dialog. The story is brilliant, leaving the viewer's clueless to who might potentially be the shape shifting monster and what will be happening next. The uncertainty of The Thing stays all the way to the ending scene, which is still talked and dissected by horror fanatics to this day. The Thing is a classic horror, recognized as one of John Carpenter's finest. Watch it if you haven't seen it now!!!",

As both writer (often under a pseudonym) and director, Carpenter's films comprise some of the finest examples of the horror genre.

353,23 December 2016,Danielpotato,6, A Good Movie.,"It's impossible for me to discuss John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" without also discussing several works that provided its inspiration. J.w. Campbell's classic story ""Who Goes There"" was also the inspiration for the Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby version in 1950. Since Hawks/Nyby lacked the technology to portray Campbell's shape-shifting, assimilating creature, they focus on Campbell's theme of the ""red scare"". It's absolutely true communists occupied high positions in our government, including the CIA at the time Campbell wrote ""Who Goes There"". Hawks/Nyby focused on the camaraderie of the artic crew to represent ""the American way of life,"" while making the creature a ""walking vegetable,"" feeding on blood and preparing its occupation of the earth through asexual reproduction. Thus, the creature represented the ""Communist menace"" and the scientist a ""fellow traveler. By 1955, the US government, through oppressive laws against communist in this nation, as well as the Hollywood Blacklist,had created a backlash against ""McCarthyism"". As a result, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" presented the humans as communists and the ""pod people"" as the ""fascist oppressors"". Also, in 1955, the UK released ""The Quatermass Experiment,"" AKA ""The Creeping Unknown,"" which presented a creature that possessed the assimilation half of Campbell's ""Thing"". By the time of the unsuccessful release of John Carpenter's film, the ""red scare"" portion had been utterly discarded. However, the paranoic theme of ""do you ever really 'know' somebody?"" essence of Campbell's story remained. Even better, ""movie magic"" technology had made it possible to represent the creature as Campbell presented him: a communal shape-shifter capable of masking his actual identities, but capable of viciously revealing it true multiple natures when threatened or ""hungry"". Carpenter wisely retained most of Campbell's story. Especially effective is the scene where each of the Antarctic station's crew member is tested by having a hot wire submerged in his blood. It's a pity Carpenter didn't retain Campbell's ending, which was to discover that the creature was using equipment parts to build a communicator to alert his kind that the earth was ripe for invasion. Carpenter's ending is not as plausible, but it is certainly more exciting.",

366,25 September 2017,lovintennis,6, I like this one except for the beginning,"This 1982 remake of THE THING gets my top rating, and few films do. I was awestruck by it from my very first viewing and continue to watch it at least once a year for good measure. An ambitious rehash of Howard Hawks' 1952 THE THING and clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN, JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING roughly follows the plot of the original: An alien life form that can imitate anything it desires kills and absorbs humans and other animals left and right. If let loose on the world, it will soon be the only living thing on the planet. A bunch of American scientists and their support team working at an Antarctioc base try to contain the beast, with little success. Hawks made his creature a close copy of Universal's Frankenstein monster, while Carpenter opts to have his Thing morph into all sorts of things, including a sled dog, various people and occasionally a snarling pile of absolutely disgusting ooze and flesh. There's even a funny if stomach-turning moment when the creature is an upside-down head running around on tiny feet. I wouldn't have been surprised if one of the men had said, ""Now there's something you don't see everyday."" It's a fight to the finish, with a very ambiguous ending. The incredible special effects have never been surpassed. The cast is superb, and includes a very hairy Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Keith David and Richard Dysart. Plus some wonderfully trained dogs, with an astounding opening sequence involving a suspenseful chase across a snowy landscape. The film was shot in Canada, for the record. While each character is nicely defined, Russell is definitely the tie that binds, the John Wayne-type hero facing down the black-hat villain. Several sequences pay fond tribute to Hawks' original. I like that as well. See it. But definitely not at meal time.",
367,27 October 2008,ctomvelu-1,9, An unrivaled masterpiece,""" The Thing"" has been in my ""Best 10 horror movies of all time"" list for a long, long time. I understand that many people might disagree, seeing that it is not a deep movie (in the surface), instead it is a plain survival horror movie, which, could very well be adapted into a PC game. But, there is nothing plain or mundane about ""The Thing"" and what it promises, it delivers. Oh, boy does it deliver. The premise is a remote, isolated science base in Antarctica, with an unknown enemy hunting and killing the inhabitants, while the slowly creeping insanity and subsequent power struggle between them, culminate into an ambiguous ending, which makes you remain numb for a few seconds. I won't spoil the ending- but it is one of the best endings of any movie. The plot depicts a very real horror scenario, that could possibly happen with a few variations- I mean anything can go wrong in an inhospitable, isolated place like Antarctica, and almost all the things that can go wrong, result in death(s), so, the horror is real and authentic. From that respect, the rest of the aspects of the movie, are only secondary. The locations are (mostly) indoors, something which enhances the claustrophobic feel of the base, the direction by Carpenter is, well, Carpenteresque, the acting is solid and the music is spot on, as always. No, the real highlight and protagonist of this film, is the story. The mere idea that you could be stranded in a limited space, in an isolated, frozen desert, with a bunch of people you don't really care about, and with someone or something out for your blood- now that is real horror. This is where the movie shines and this is why I consider it one of the best horror movies. Watch it at night-preferably on a cold, windy night- with the lights out and you won't regret it.",
368,14 June 2019,byzantineiconoclast,10, Antarctica is deadly for more reasons than mere cold.,"John Carpenter takes a brilliant concept and lanches it ten fold. This movie scared me for such a long time after the first viewing then to learn that it was not only a remake but an adaptation as well it blew my mind. When talking about some of the best horror movies ever this movie comes up on several lists even all of the way at number three. This in my opinion is one of a few films that surpasses the source material.
The film opens in space and shows a ship being pulled into the atmosphere and thus the movie begins. After the title opening a dog is seen running in the snow from a helicopter that is shooting down at it, It goes to a camp of twelve men who all seem a little bored and a little anxious to leave, Things only go down from there for these men as the begin to loss complete trust in one another Already things are shrouded in mystery and it escalates dramatically as the movie progresses. To say anymore of the plot would spoil the movie as knowing as little as possible gives the movie a huge advantage to frighten the viewer. 
Some of the aspects and themes that contribute to what makes a horror movie for me are something unknown that lacks normal human morals, panic by the characters, isolation, and a large lack of knowledge of what to do and what is going on. These are all aspects of this film from start to finish. It hits all of the right notes and makes a constant level of mistrust and lack of knowledge. This can not be done without good direction and great acting. The cast is a group of just men fourteen men in total, the two Norwegian men and then all of the Americans, This is a big change from the novella as there are thirty-six men but this way the men have some character development and are fleshed out, so when things start to get tense in the film and you don't know what is going to happen you care for each person their. This is not only done by the acting but by how Carpenter set up each scene and leaving all of the windows open so that you feel the same mistrust that the men at the facility feel. Some of this and more themes lead to this film surpassing the novella. I watched the film before knowing about the novella so going into this film with not knowing what to expect and wanted to be scared and I can say without a doubt I was, from the mystery to the stunning practical effects this movie is one of the best.
Every aspect of this movie felt real, from all of the costumes to the practical effects of the beast and the setting, it feels as though I am watching these events first hand. The setting of the film is one of its strongest points, stranded in the middle of a desalite continent with no where to go as the storm covering the glacier would kill you within the hour. It creating such a feel of isolation for these men as they could not escape this thing. This film is probably most famous for its effects. They are perfect. A question was asked about how the effects look today and if they hold up, I heard some people mention that they are dumb looking now but I guarantee that if they were in the presence of the thing they would turn running with their tails between their legs. They are so real and terrifying that it has become one of the most renown horror movies of all time. 
There is a definite main character of this story, R. J. McReady, as he takes charge of the group and it follows him, but not for the entire film. This film follows a handful characters to expand the view of the mistrust. Even if it is just with a character for a moment it gives a look to what they are thinking and feeling, adding some small things to each of the scenes brings it so much further than the novella was at. Like the scene when McReady goes to ask Blair a question in the shed and they open the little hatch in the door to see him and there is a noose hung by Blair at the table and it is never mentioned, and Blair walks by it not even looking at it. I thought that this was brilliant and it brought a lot of mental distress his character, even though he just walks past it and asks to leave. This sort of pain can be seen in a lot of the characters as they are having inner conflicts not knowing if some of their best friends have been taken over by this monstrosity. 
One of the most prominent themes of this movie is mistrust. The men all have their composure and are level headed until they get to the Norwegian and realize something very bad is going on. Soon after that everything starts to fall apart for the men, as they can't trust each other at all in fear that the person they are standing next to might not be a person. This leads everyone to be very upset and even to do rash things throughout the film. This same feeling is felt for the viewers as you have no idea if any of the characters are themselves or not. 
John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the best horror movies of all time. It far surpasses all of the source material. The film as a whole was almost perfect with a few technical flaws here and there concerning time lapsing, not knowing how much time has gone by when they find the tunnel and the amount of fuel they have for their flamethrowers. Other than that I thought the movie was great and I would give it an A on a letter grade scale from A+ to F. I gave it 10/10 on here but I'd give it a 9 and a half if I could do halves",
369,16 October 2018,morfunkel,10, Novella to One of the Best Horror Movies Ever,"John Carpenter exercises as much control over his films as possible. As a pointer to this, many, including The Thing, bear his name as a suffix of sorts in the title. And Carpenter's film relies on its special effects, which are among the most laborious, revolting, and shocking spectacles by its time accomplished by Hollywood's technical wizards. There are times when it appears we are jutting our heads right down into the rancid, gore-gushing jaws of the unidentifiable, as the Thing metamorphoses itself into creatures with the body parts of dogs, men, lobsters, and spiders, all entrenched in gummy intestines. And Jesus, those poor poor dogs. Designer Rob Bottin's work is groundbreaking and extraordinary, yet because it endures in a near abyss in terms of emotional investment, it becomes too aesthetically oppressive and something of an enterprise in abstract art more than film.",

After viewing it, what I don't understand are the views of the critics. I thought this really was a superb remake of the 1951 movie of the same name, different enough to be a totally unique movie-watching experience, but maintaining the same basic plot. My attention was captured from the very beginning, with the scenes of the helicopter chasing the husky across the antarctic landscape, with a gunman on board desperately trying to kill the animal. What's going on? Once we discover that the dog is in fact the alien being (an alien who consumes its victims and then takes on their identical form) the story progresses and becomes completely bewildering (appropriately so, because a big part of the suspense is that neither the viewers nor the characters in the movie know who has been infected by these aliens and who hasn't) and at the same time extremely suspenseful, and sometimes downright frightening.",

When I finally watched it, I realized it wasn't so scary, except for the dog kennel scene.  I give The Thing a 4 out of 5 because you have to give Carpenter credit for the grotesque special effects. Everything in The Thing is perfect. SPOILER ALERT My only major complaint about it is Death of Nauls scene.  When MacReady, Nauls and Garry are setting the charges, Garry's headlight dies and Blair comes out of nowhere and kills Garry.  When Nauls realizes Garry is missing, he doesn't bother to alert MacReady that Garry is missing.  Then Nauls is attacked by the thing.

Not being a massive fan of John Carpenter's work (Michael Myers and Snake Plissken don't really impress me) I wasn't expecting much, without even considering the 80s music and effects. However, in honesty, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst too many years have passed for the effects to scare or horrify, they at least manage to stay the right side of laughable, so there was no unintentional comedy. The cast was well chosen and stuck to their jobs, and the film was pleasingly bleak and effective.

The film is scary because they're trapped inside with each other and one of them is The Thing and they can't stay outside because they'll freeze. The paranoia is great between the characters as they start to distrust each other thinking one of them could be it. The music score is another thing why I enjoy this movie because it's so creepy and makes this film more scary, The Thing effects are brilliant and really impressive since all of it is hand made since CGI wasn't made then.

This is a creature horror, a genre that rarely hit's the mark, but most memorably perhaps with this film, and Ridley Scott's Alien, a few years previously (for the best recent example, check out The Descent). The Thing also ranks as Kurt Russell's greatest cinematical moment.

A great story, because it doesn't reveal everything and it doesn't have to - it leaves a lot up to the audience's interpretation, and remains mysteriously ambiguous most of the time. Because you don't know who gets infected and when, the film is even more suspenseful, as the audience is in the same position as the characters.

406,25 May 2020,h-28658,8, It may not have aged well but it was still a really great film to watch just recently.,"Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" such an entertaining sci-fi film are its genre-defying elements of mystery, suspense, and tight plot structure.  It puts to shame such films as ""Aliens"" or ""Armageddon"" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject ""meaning"" into the barrage on screen with ""emotional sequences"" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience.   The supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular.  I think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting.   There is an increasing trend in our culture to passively ""surrender"" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make.  This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable ""reader response"" theory that pervades our schools and the ""tabloid brigade"" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press.  Nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on ""pause.""  Is ""The Thing"" a ""good"" movie?  For the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be ""entertaining.""  Its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia.  Upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling.

With the arrival of a seemingly insane Norweigen helicopter crew shooting wildly at a fleeing husky dog the film starts with violence. The dog runs in to the American base prompting the hysterical rifleman to chase after him, firing blindly. Garry the base officer shoots and kills him. After trying to radio out for advice on how to proceed the base radio operator 'Windows' tells them he has been getting nothing but static for two weeks. Concerned at this crews seemingly randomly insane behaviour, Dr Copper wants to check on the Norweigen crew at their base in case anyone else is hurt, recruiting helicoper pilot McReady to shuttle him. The Norweigen base is destroyed, decimated by fire. Searching the ruins they see the grisly sight of a man who has cut his throat and wrists in an apparent suicide..what happened here to make a man do this to himself. Could they have all gone crazy out here in the frozen wilderness?. Outside they come across what appears to be the burnt remains of several men , they wrap it up and take it back for examination. Later Fuchs the dog handler takes the dog which has been wandering aimlessly about the base and puts it with the other huskies. Checking on the animal later to see how it is settling in he is confronted with something out of a nightmare..something is killing the dogs . The men spring in to action and use a flamethrower on the monster they find, but not before it cleaves off a part of itself and disappears through the roof of the dog shed. Blair the biologist does an autopsy of the dogs mangled remains and makes a horrific discovery. The dogs were not being attacked they were being taken over by this creature, and then imitated. After further research in to the imitations capabilities Blair comes to the stark conclusion ..if one single cell of this imitator reaches a populated area in 27,000 hours it will have imitated the entire population of the earth. And there is further bad news, there is a 75% chance that one or more members of the crew have now been imitated. With this realisation paranoia descends on the crew as they realise this alien can imitate anyone of them perfectly and no one would know until it is too late. With trust gone, how will the men survive ?. ",

The special effects are so mind-blowing that one can almost not believe it. This is made before computer graphics, so one becomes aware of the artistic genius behind the special effects. I saw this as a child. It is super cool. A real 80s movie. Later I found out the H.P.Lovecraftian spawning of the movie. Anyway, it's great. Watch it! All sci-fi and horror fans should see this movie, and despair! Only thing I found a bit weird was the beginning with the spaceship that is flying to Earth. Perhaps that is a bit too much, since this is a monster-movie more than anything else. Moreover, one has a feeling that it is a present-day Earth, so it doesn't fit in with the plot of the UFO having landed a long time ago. Anyway, despite ""goofs"" and ""mistakes"" this movie is on my top 10 of favorite movies. Of course, the reason for this is also the excellent acting and dialog, such as great lines like: ""Maybe we are at war with Norway!""

There are so many moments in this film that will leave your jaws on the floor even after the 4th, 5th, and 6th viewing. Complementing Bottin's stellar effects work is a strong cast, masterful editing, and superb, suspenseful directing by John Carpenter. While the movie is definitely a horror film, it delightfully morphs, at times, into a great ""whodunnit"" murder mystery with many shocking twists. The erosion of trust between the main characters and the chaos this creates is pulled off wonderfully by Carpenter. Throw in a super creepy score, a great opening and closing sequence and you've got a horror classic. Look for some solid character acting from the great Keith David and Wilford Brimley, as well as a gritty, dark turn from Kurt Russell as the lead.

The atmosphere is the opposite of any drama-influenced movies - even the characters are cold and unsympathetic; there's barely any emotion in this movie (and in a good way of course). Extreme paranoia, bleakness, hopelessness and resignation are dominant here. Human psychology is yet again being explored.
Kurt Russell fits perfectly here and it's probably his best performance in his whole movie career - an emotionless and calculated badass that uses logic in order to solve everything.

437,17 February 2018,auritone,10," ""You gotta be f.....g kidding...""","John Carpenter is one of the most influential directors in the horror/thriller genres. He has at least four classic films to his credit in my personal order of preference - Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Thing and Escape from New York. I liked Assault and Halloween better than The Thing largely because of their low-budget feel. The Thing, although probably better directed, is a big-budget movie from an established and successful director who was all of 33. It doesn't have that gritty, low-budget feel that made Assault so stunning - although its certainly more testosterone fueled and there is NO female involved in the making of this film. This is the second adaptation of the John Campbell sci-fi short ""Who Goes There?"" which was first filmed in 1951 as The Thing from Another World. The original was reputedly directed by Howard Hawks but I find that hard to believe. The original was a drag, there was no atmosphere or any of that B-Movie feel that films of the period like Them! or Invasion of the Body Snatchers give fans of those films. There was also a ridiculous love interest angle which added nothing to the film.

Since then, Carpenter has only gotten worse, with his newest release ""Vampires"" sucking REAL bad. But here, you see Carpenter at his peak, working in a claustrophobic isolated environment with a hopeless situation. The best thing about the movie are the special effects by Rob Bottin, who had done an excellent job with ""The Howling"" a year earlier.

439,19 March 2000,Casey-52,10, John Carpenter makes a classic sci-fi movie even better!,"This is one of those movies that even if you aren't a die hard fan of it, you'll still find it hard to turn away from. It is hard macho action and hard macho science fiction, and it does Carpenter a lot of justice I dare say. The old version of the Thing had an appeal to it, but so does this one. And this one I dare say has a lot of grit and excitement to it. The premise is an isolated Arcitc (or is it Antarctic? Who cares)) science team finds a frozen alien and inadvertently bring it back to life. In this version the ""Thing"" is very high on the evolutionary scale, and very tough to deal with. Each cell can act on its own, but also must respond to the other cells. I know it doesn't make sense, but it makes for one *$#* of an adversary you don't want to tangle with. It eats you and then copies your DNA so that it becomes an exact replica of you with even your memories. How can you beat something like that? Well, Kurt Russell finds a why. He drinks vodka at it! And then he gets flame throwing units to burn it. But which people are real and which are ""things""? You see the dilemma. And the script plays it for all its worth, and I dare say it plays it very well. An exciting thrill ride. The characters ring fairly true, and Carpenter, as usual, does his characters much better than most directors. I could nit pick at one flaw. It didn't ring true when a certain character froze and refused to burn up a thing, who even in human form was abusive toward s him. There's my one nit pick. Not bad for over a dozen characters in a full length film. If only other directors and writers could keep it down to one nit pick. There is a question at the end, as to whether one of the survivors might be a ""thing."" A good ambiguous ending, and enhanced by good selection of music. I think the sound effects unit deserves much praise for this film. The first time I watched it, and I've reinforced that opinion over later watchings, I thought the vodka drank by the characters at the end proved they weren't things, since alcohol kills individual cells, and the ""thing"" would not be able to tolerate it. Indeed, I believe the alien had to have a stronger weakness than just fire, or it would have taken over much easier.

441,27 February 2010,BA_Harrison,8, Carpenter does his own thing.,"John Carpenter, the filmmaker who sprung to success with his 1978 slasher flick 'Halloween', has taken on a new challenge. And the challenge is re-imagining terrifying John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella 'Who Goes There?'. Decades after the first film adaptation in the 50s, Carpenter has spawned a terrifying science-fiction/horror hybrid that blends a heavy amount of gruesome special effects with hair-raising tension and paranoia. The main antagonist of this freak show is an alien, but it's no ordinary alien like the ones from Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. It is an alien that can only be described as an abstract being that possesses the bodies of subconscious individuals, and the scariest part is you have no idea who the victim is. Carpenter brings a hefty hand at this nightmare-inducing ride, and results amount to one of the scariest cinematic endeavors of both of the horror and science- fiction genre. This film stars Kurt Russell as R.J MacReady, an American scientist who leads an expedition team including biologist Blair (played by A. Wilford Brimley), Nauls (played by T.K Carter), Palmer (played by David Clennon), Childs (played by Keith David), and Dr. Cooper (played by Richard Dysart) among other members on a research mission to a remote shelter in Antarctica. There, they witness the shooting a fluffy canine. When they take to dog to the shelter, it subsequently mutates into a grotesque parasitic monster that not only begins killing members of the team, but is secretly assimilating the bodies of other people in the shelter. So the mission becomes a battle for survival as the team grows paranoid of who's human.....and who's not.",

This movie did follow the original but it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.,

For one thing, Ennio Morricone's intense score sets the creepy tone, with chords that suggest a pulse or a heartbeat.

446,3 February 2021,Elliotdoesreviews,10, Timeless Horror Classic,"David Foster created one of, if not the most intriguing horror movies of the early 80's by giving light to one of the most genre defining films at the time, and shows how a simple idea, combined with talented people on its side, can give birth to not just a great horror movie, but can give birth to The Thing. The story unfolds as a Norwegian camp come into contact with extra-terrestrial creatures, called Things by the characters, and the things begin to terrorize the group until the base they lived in explodes, ending the Thing once and for all. Writer John W. Campbell Jr. uses his way of writing to display not just what it's like to live at an Antarctic base, but how people use to act during that period of time. Take for example, Nauls, who is first seen in the film sliding around the camp with his roller-skates, and blasting his music from his boombox. He uses perspectives of different to show how each person would react if they were put in a situation against these monsters, and the result is, quite frankly, the most ambitious movie released at the time. It's taken all these ideas that have been shunned from modern horror, like gore, aliens, and other cliché topics, and, backed up with excellent special effects for the time overseen by Roy Arbogast, seamless sound direction from John K. Adams team, and created a movie more realistic than any other film that came before. The way critics pick on the film for being too outdated is a testament to how groundbreaking it was at the time.
During the movie, a hidden message can be noticed throughout the film. During MacReadys chess match with the computer, when the computer A.I. was about to win, he used his beer to make the computer malfunction. This is foreshadowing how MacReady is willing to destroy absolutely anything, even the base, if ""The Thing"" is winning. A good horror film always leaves the viewer to interpret the events that take place, and for The Thing, it's when MacReady hands Childs a drink, which can be interpreted as he thinks Childs is infected, or he's doing this as a sign of trust to Childs. Another thing that can be interpreted is the ending itself, having the viewer decide whether or not MacReady and Childs survived in the end. The way John K. Adams uses sound in order to enhance scenes can heavily sell the atmosphere of the scenes. Back to the story, MacReady has been isolated from the crew, after he was last seen outside in the cold, cold weather. He's been isolated from the group and has almost gone mad under the circumstances they're in, and it almost culminates when Childs questions MacReadys morality, after he killed Clark (who was innocent). After killing Palmer, who was shown in his infected terror with excellent special effects that sell the scene as a whole, MacReady gathers up a small crew in order to blow up the base, ending the Thing once and for all. Once the smoke settles, there's no victory, no cheering, not even any horror, just the uncertainty whether or not MacReady will survive.",

456,13 February 2016,rivshaadl,10, Great eternal horror classic from master Carpenter.,"so i just rented this movie, I'm only 22 but being on the internet hearing so much about this horror movie ""the thing"", i knew that despite me hating bloody/gory movies, i was eventually gonna have to see it. well this is my take: sure it was creepy and pretty disturbing effects and the tension and paranoid feeling is OK (although done better in older scifi films like ""body snatchers"") but lets face it, this movie was and is a cult movie. no way this was ever going to be a mainstream film. and today, movies like this that are old and gross seem to be very popular in todays goth/punk culture of death, anyone notice? no wonder its got such a (highly undeserved) rating on IMDb! older movies from the 70's/80's that are known to be gross and twisted with those supremely gross special effects are actually more popular now then they were back then. i think its just a stupid trend and shows was perverted times were are living in. movies like the thing, army of darkness, Texas chainsaw massacre, Halloween etc (just look at all the new remakes!) are all more popular now then they were back in the day. and no greater example of this then the Thing. i think its just a really lame trend that needs to go away and fast! this movie was a onetime view and nothing more. certainly not something you can watch 20+ times unless your like a sick freak or something. seeing ppls heads getting torn apart and see poor innocent dogs getting brutally attacked by some idiot monster (guess there isn't intelligent life out there huh?) just isn't my idea of a good time at the movies. movies IMO are meant to make you feel good or if anything, have the good guy win in the end. but movies like this are dumb and depressing. i don't need real life fear in movies, unless i know the good guy is gonna kill the evil thing. i just think movies like this are too gross for there own good. i mean, you didn't see movies like this in the 1950's or even the 60's that much. pretty scary when you think that you can get away making disturbing movies like this, and they are even worse today! thanks to movies like the Thing and even Alien, we now have these insanely graphic gross-out movies by the ton. well, you can be sure i will never give them the time of day. I'm not a fan of ultra scifi cuz most of scifi tends to be creepy, gross and depressing with always a question to things. i don't like that, reminds me too much of real life. but there are some ""alien"" movies i really do enjoy, like Independence Day, Star Wars movies, Predator (which although it has SOME blood, its certainly not over the top gross like some of these others). but overall, not a big scifi fan, and the thing is just too gross for anyone IMO. only the most depraved of people would actually enjoy this kind of movie, along with the evil dead and other films of that ilk.",

What an incredible drama as the film neared its end and no salvation appeared in sight for the human race and earth.

The special effects are some of the best makeup effects (which I prefer to CG) I've ever seen, and the visuals are beautiful and bleak.  The only real thing that seems to date this film is the clothing and the shots of the ""high tech"" electronics.  If you can get past these minor things, you will find that this is a gem of a film.  The story is intense, the acting is top notch, the cinematography and direction are good, and the score, a staple of every John Carpenter film, is as haunting as ever.

But he broke the mold when he made The Thing, and the result is probably the greatest monster movie in history. Sure Jaws was great, and so was Alien, but The Thing blows them all away. It's about a twelve-man research team that unwittingly takes in an alien organism that has been frozen in the ice for over 100,000 years. As if things couldn't be worse, this alien can shape-shift and ""absorbs"" its victims, so no one in the camp quite knows who is real and who is ""the thing."" Rob Bottin's special effects for the film are probably its ground-breaking achievement, for it was the first movie with a really gross-looking monster, and the monster effects still look great even today. Ennio Morricone's chilling score, Dean Cundey's beautiful photography, and John Llyod's incredible sets all help contribute to the eerie mood of the picture. Not only that, but the cast does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned, Carpenter was at the peak of his skills when he made this film.

Its precisely because these disturbing images are not used as crutches for the taut, tense and ominous narrative that 'The Thing (1982)' holds up to scrutiny and remains such a foreboding and thrilling watch all these years later. The flick keeps you on your toes because its underlying premise means that anyone could be the eponymous 'Thing' from another world. Carpenter wisely never reveals exactly who the creature is until its too late.

But what kept me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering the ""aliens-as-us"" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well, and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story.

488,25 August 2021,LambChop21,9, Gets better each time you watch it,"Though it didn't attract audience and mostly received bad critics,John Carpenter's The Thing is now considered as a masterpiece about human nature and paranoia.At least,it's a masterpiece to me and it's one of my all time favorites.Carpenter creates a chilling atmosphere which he does best and he focuses on twelve men working in a research station in Antarctica with nowhere to run.When they find an unknown organism,they took it to the station with the hope that they could've made the discovery of the century.But when the frozen organism is thawed out,the trouble begins.From that point,the movie gets very different from it's predecessor which was a Howard Hawks (Carpenter's favorite) production.The thing was a monster in shape in the original film and the crew was fighting against something they could see,but in Carpenter's version,the thing has a deadly weapon;it can imitate any living creature it wants.After they learn the terrifying truth about their guest,the crew loses trust for each other and this keeps the tension always high.Members of the crew fall apart and they begin to accuse each other of being an alien instead of acting like a team.With this masterpiece,Carpenter accomplishes what he always does once again;he scares us to death.While doing this,he also shows what a human being is capable of(lies,mistrust,even murder)and how easy they can forget some basic moral values when they feel they're in danger.Kurt Russell stars as R.J.MacReady;the helicopter pilot who tries to hold the men together in order to fight against the thing and gives one of the greatest performances of his career.The cast also includes some well known character actors like Wilford Brimley,Richard Masur,Keith David (also appeared in Carpenter's They live),Richard Dysart and Donald Moffat.Unlike his other movies,Carpenter didn't compose the music.The music belongs to a legendary composer;Ennio Morricone(you know who he is)and it provides a great support.The movies great special effects were made by Rob Bottin and his work is still remembered as a milestone.",

A work that arouses fear through strangeness and claustrophobia, a completely inhospitable environment with a danger that knows how to hide and defend itself. A world where science fiction and terror are intelligently mixed, even more so when the practical effects are perfect (better than CGI's).

490,24 May 2022,pedropittss,10, Simply John Carpenter in its essence,"There must be certain objections to this classic Science Fiction film, by many considered John Carpenter's masterpiece and best film at least, and of course it is extremely well done with a virtuoso program of special effects, making the results of the activity of ""The Thing"" as horribly revolting as possible - you really aren't prepared for it when the first appearance of ""The Thing"" turns up doing something terrible to the poor innocent dog. The first time I happened to this film I could not see it any further than this, the second time I gave it a chance but still couldn't see it all, but now the third time at least I was prepared and could watch it calmly to the end. Everything is technically perfect, and the direction and music by Morricone couldn't be better, but the flaws are all in the script. After all, these researchers in the Antarctic are all scientists and should act accordingly and not constantly lose their self control. When doctor Blair loses control it's the starting point for the whole adventure to run off the rails, and then it constantly gets worse. They resort to violence, which is the last thing a scientist should do, he is educated to have no capacity for that, and then the film goes constantly from bad to worse and becomes nothing else than a monument to paranoia. Of course, these poor fellows without a woman or even any picture of such a healthy creature are all fenced in by the Antarctic winter in hopeless isolation in the dark of winter, so naturally they could develop psychic problems, especially in the encounter with such a thing as ""The Thing"", but they should at least TRY to keep cool and maintain some scientific self control. They all fail in this, and the signal for everyone's going off the rails occurs perhaps already in the beginning, when Kurt Russell accuses his computer, with which he plays chess, of cheating and pours whiskey into him. That's perhaps the starting point of the following accumulating monumental mess.",
491,3 May 2020,clanciai,9, An unidentifiable thing making a mess of things,"Dumb-Dumb Dumb-Dumb Dumb-Dumb...so goes the now chilling theme (which was originally nominated for a Razzie, you know) which, though it sounds like classic Carpenter, was actually composed by the legendary Ennio MorrIone. It perfectly captures the sense of dread and foreboding that The Thing emits. I remember when I first watched this on TV years ago. I didn't know who John Carpenter was or Kurt Russell or Ennio Morricone. All I saw was the title, and it was intriguing enough for me to go in blind. And what an experience it was. Paranoiac, gut- wrenching and filled with outstanding special effects, The Thing left me with my mouth open long after the credits started rolling. Set in the isolated Antarctica and filled to the brim with a memorable supporting cast, each of whom threaten to steal the scene they're in, The Thing is far more than an ""Ooh. Ahh!"" splatter fest. Though the creature effects (completely practical – take that, CGI!) have gone down in history as some of the most inventive and disgusting in cinema, the paranoia and mistrust between the characters is just as nail-biting to watch. The all-male group of actors are constantly at each other's throats, prioritising their own survival, and anyone could be 'the thing.' The creature is t it's most powerful when the humans are doing the killing and fighting for it. There is a constant sense of dread, as previously stated, of what is to come, of who to trust, that when one of 'the things' is revealed an orgasmic amount of colours hit the screen - there is blood and body parts flying in all directions. It's an excellent film that is essentially a collection of memorable scenes. Take the blood test scene – the protagonist, played by Russell, ties up the rest of the cast and takes a sample of their blood in a petri dish to burn and, hopefully, reveal who is not human in the group. There is arguing as Russell moves from one dish to the next, and Carpenter cleverly distracts us with the dialogue – we become do engrossed into what the characters are accusing each other of that when the alien blood 'jumps' out of the dish it feels as though someone has stamped on your heart. Then the character who was the thing transforms, and our nail-biting is rudely interrupted by a terrifically tense showdown between Kurt Russell and the thing (the others are, of course tied up). After the hullabaloo is over, tensions rise again, but not quite as much, as Russell's continues with his tests, untying those who have been had their blood tested. It ends with the final character, exasperated after having been finally cleared, bellowing a hilarious line at the rest of the cast, after which we fade to black and are given the chance to breath. It's masterful direction. The Thing is, quite simply, one of the all-time great horror/sci-fi films and undoubtedly John Carpenter's best work. ",

A man in an helicopter is shooting at a lonely mutt amidst the antarctic wilderness when it arrives at an American scientific base. An accident ensures the inhabitants cannot interrogate the pursuing Norwegians and a quick visit to their nearby camp shows that disaster has struck. A large block of hollowed out ice suggests, though, that they may well have made an unique discovery - especially when they find some smouldering skeletal remains. Back at their own camp - along with their new charcoaled find - things get back to normal until the mysterious dog is put into the cage with the others and all hell breaks loose. It is soon clear to ""Mac"" (Kurt Russell) that they are dealing with something extremely strong, adaptable and ruthless. Can they survive? The visual effects here go a long way to compensating for the rather lacklustre acting - Russell isn't really very good - and the claustrophobic antarctic settings and howling winds add a richness and sense of peril to this superior horror story. The fact that the creature has a sort of Azazel-like ability to transfer from any life-form to another, and to more than one simultaneously adds some decent jeopardy to the plot, too, as neither they nor us know who is to be trusted right until the ending. This is certainly one of John Carpenter's better efforts - and is well worth a watch on a cold winter's night!",

Before you get a chance to ponder too long the fit hits the shan. I love this movie. It is so nightmarish, grotesque, and at times hideous. The special effects are stomach churning every time - and fascinating - almost beautiful. And yet it isn't necessarily a 'gross-out'. There's plenty of blood and ooze to last a couple of sequels - it's just the nature of this beast - whatever it is. The movie keeps you tensed and eventually resolves to a logical ending.

Mind blowing creature effects, blood, gore and a fantastic storyline to pull it all together. R.J. MacKeady (Kurt Russell) is a hard-edged government man stranded in the north pole on a research team, when they come across someTHING in the ice. Carpenter blends comedy with horror and gore to a glorious conclusion, the acting is top notch and the characters are believable through out. The scenes are paced so that you truly are on the edge of your seat and when the horror starts, it throws you out of your seat.

""The Thing"" is not my favourite science-fiction/ horror film, that honour goes to ""Alien"" (1979); neither is it my favourite John Carpenter movie, his ""Halloween"" (1978) is his best work in my opinion. However it is a close second on both counts. I don't understand all of the negativity that this classic received back in the day. It has a great, suspenseful plot, some interesting characters, a fantastic musical score (Ennio Morricone) and a very bleak setting. One of the plot's strengths is not knowing who is going to be the alien's next victim, causing a great deal of tension amongst the cast.

I will never, ever forget the score to this movie, while it is very simple I don't think a better one could have been made for the film. Aside from his ridiculous hat choice early in the movie, I would also say this is a pretty good performance on the part of Kurt Russel, not his best, but he plays his part perfectly. The special effects in this movie are worth mentioning as well.

This 1982 remake of ""The Thing from another world"" was a sheer delight to all fans of gore and horror! Kurt Russel is perfectly cast as the boozing anti-social helicopter pilot R.J MacReady. His performance hit the right tone of the last guy you would ever expect to take up the mantel of leadership in a situation like this. Actually, I have to commend the entire cast in this movie. They all are individuals with strengths and weaknesses that come off as genuine. The big temptation in a movie like this is for everybody to ultimately rise to the challenge and work together to fight this alien menace. Here everybody is an individual that cant trust anybody else because the enemy is hidden and could be anybody. The setting of the barren ice Continent of Anarctica was so apt to convey the isolation of these men. This and the tight almost claustrophobic way the camera shoots tends to send shivers right up my spine. The soundtrack was truly scary with its primitive methodical tempo of impending doom. The special effects in this movie, for 1982 or even for today, were jaw dropping! I had nightmares for weeks at some of those transformation scenes. Like, remember when the thing-dog is put into the kennels and transforms into some horrific space creature and starts to absorb the other dogs. Or when the ""test"" to discover who is the thing is done and the blood literately screams and jumps out of the dish. I could go on and on. Whoever did the effects for this movie should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination. In conclusion, see this movie if you like horror, or even just suspense. You will not be disappointed!",

The film professionally features suspense, horror, and even bits of humor (Russell's macho attitude features humor in it all-around) in it, showing us all that the filmmakers and actors were indeed all well-trained. Rob Bottin deserves a special award for his breathtaking effects and Ennio Morricone's score is absolutely eerie (overtones of Carpenter's scores are heard here, or i believe Carpenter uses overtones of Morricone).

The direction of John Carpenter is great at this film. The cinematography of Dean Curry is also great. Performance by the actors (especially Kurt Russel), the practical effects, pacing, everything is just great.
According to FilmRadar, a YouTube Channel, there is a lot of ways that The Thing use to exploit the fears of the audience. The use of setting is one of those ways the film uses. The film is set in Antartica, a place that is so cold and very remote. The setting gives the characters a sense of isolation, the feeling of being unable to call for help.The setting also gives a sense of ""claustrophobia"". The feeling of being trapped in a confined place. Also one of the thing that this film uses is ""paranoia"". Since the organism can perfectly imitate the host after it fully assimilates it, the characters (and also us) don't know who to trust. Another thing that is uses is ""the fear of the unknown"". Since we don't fully understand on what even this organism is, we don't know what is will do or what it truly is. Another way is the use of ""phobias"". The creature can look like a dog (cynophobia), it can have spider legs (arachnophobia), it can have a serpent-like tail (ophiodiophobia), the creature even looks bloody (hemophobia), etc. It's this that why The Thing works in a lot of ways.",

However, because of the isolation in the Antarctic, the time could almost be anytime. John Carpenter uses every ounce of his prowess to turn in a creepy, exciting and horrific thriller in which the monster could be anyone or anything. This movie received a lot of bad press because it came out right after E.T. Everyone was looking for a friendly alien at this point and the malevolent shape shifter from this movie was not well received. Well, the hell with those people. In the years that followed, viewers saw this movie pop up on cable and were astounded at the pure genius behind it. This movie was made at a time when there was little or nothing in the way of CGI effect. Each and everyone of the creature effects was constructed out of real stuff by effects expert Rob Bottin.

Everything here is excellent from cinematography to story and writing to acting, but what stands out the most in this film for me is the special effects.

This one, however, is probably my favorite.  I do not consider this a horror film, but rather as an intense drama with horror elements, much in the same way David Cronenberg's remake of ""The Fly"" was a tragic love story with horror elements.  This is a character-driven piece and is a shining example of great ensemble acting.  These guys seemed to be really into their characters.  Ennio Morricone's score sounded like Carpenter wrote it himself.  It is minimal, yet very effective, especially the pulsing two-note motive in the bass.  The icing on the cake is the eye-popping visual and makeup effects, supervised by Rob Bottin and Albert Whitlock.  See this film, and ALL of Carpenter's films for that matter, in letterbox format.",

558,29 July 2006,Pet_Rock,9, Who the hell's the thing?!,"As we all know, usually remakes can be colossal bombs. Not so, ""The Thing."" Quite possibly John Carpenter's greatest film, I have watched this fantastic movie at least 50 times to date, largely because most of my friends have never seen it! While working on ""Big Trouble in Little China"" with the same director, I was prompted to ask him, straight out, why this film seemed to simply fall off the radar, and his answer was short and sweet: ""Timing. I had the bad fortune of deciding to release 'Thing' at the same time that Steven Spielberg released ""ET."" The movie was simply buried under the onslaught of media attention that made ET a worldwide hit. But that fact doesn't undercut the sheer brilliance of this nail biting masterpiece of horror. Starting from the truly inspired casting, to the script, to the incredible monster making, to the cinematography, to even the stark, atmospheric soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone, 'The Thing' has become the modern benchmark of sci fi/horror films to come, and John Carpenter deserves all the credit. First, the setting. Using an already claustrophobic location of a completely enclosed, totally isolated Arctic science lab outpost, inhabited by all that testosterone, was as an effective a place for a modern day horror flick as the spooky Gothic castle was in the classic of the genre, ""Frankenstein,"" imparting as much of the feeling of dread as the story itself. But quite possibly the greatest plot choice in was in simply leaving the ending open, ""and just wait and see what happens."" Brilliant.",

That's not really unusual as opinions on so many films change with time. There is not a slack moment in a film that is intensely absorbing from start to finish. One would expect the special effects to be really weak compared to what can be done today, but they are surprisingly still strong, gross and creepy. A couple will still cause a hoot or two!

There were some flaws, however. As in ""Alien"", we have an African American character who has a highly qualified position,no doubt having had to be screened for intelligence,and technical know-how. As in ""Alien"", he is a jive turkey; a fool who speaks like an uneducated ghetto stereotype. Some scenes called for an emotional response, but the characters took it in stride. When Russel's character and the other guy look at a huge spaceship stuck in he ice, they seem too relaxed. Nobody said, ""Wow! a flying saucer!"" They didn't even elaborate on it when they got back o the other guys. When the horrific Thing kept warping itself into demonic images of horror, nobody really panicked...they just dealt with it as if it were a rat in the kitchen...

Most of them are unnecessary (e.g. Alfie), or unwarranted (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), and damned near every single one is crap. But there is always the exception to the rule: John Carpenter's The Thing is the exception to the Iron Law of Remakes. It goes off in a different direction than Howard Hawks' Thing (which is trite ""Doctor, look at the geiger counter!"" 1950s rubbish), but stays more faithful to the original source material. This film is a horror masterpiece, without flaws, false notes, or counterfeit nonsense that makes the viewer say to himself ""Oh yeah, I'm watchin' a movie."" The script is taut, the acting superb, the credibility factor unassailable, and the special effects tremendous. I don't think Hollywood realizes just how artificial and awful CGI is. The effects in The Thing are gross, gory, and organic, and they never made me shake my head once. Let's put it this way: the 1982 special effects for The Thing do the job they're supposed to do--tell the story--better than anything George Lucas and his oodles of nerd-loot managed twenty years later. This is a film to own, and I can't sing its praises enough.

I also saw ( approx. around this time, Blade Runner, Videodrome.. talk about spoiled with riches. has there been a similar time in our CG-saturated era? not really. there are great films, district 9, Primer... but nothing can match the impact of this in my own experience. it is simply perfect. i can only tolerate the remake, because of knowing that it is a remake of the 1982 version, and in spite of it's more state of the art sfx ( and the gorgeous Elizabeth Winstead), it really can not compare.. it seems at the very least ( esp. in the soundtrack) a work of reverence to a master. in my top 10 of all time, no mistake : )",

Upon investigating further, they discover the Norwegian camp and remains of something not quite human. The dog meanwhile, is placed in a kennel facility with others and soon begins a hideous transformation revealing itself to be an alien being capable of replicating any living creature it comes into contact with. In a shortwhile, the scientists, find themselves fighting to survive against a creature, not afraid to reveal its gory self once exposed in a hostile environment. Watch as a dog gets turned inside out, watch as a man loses his arms during a heart resuscitation sequence and in the same scene, somebodys head is pulled clean of their torso in a blaze of splatter.

⚪
All in all, master of horror John Carpenter took a beloved sci-fi b-movie from the fifties and used it to construct a wonderfully horrifying mind game that is defined by pure psychological horror, complete paranoia and extra-terrestrial terror, of which the uniquely claustrophobic and spine chilling atmosphere is only exceeded by the grotesque special effects that were way ahead of their time, thus making it a near-perfect genre masterpiece that outshines most of the GCI abominations the modern movie industry produces.
⚪
Day three of Spooktober is the movie of choice of my brother who, just as me, is a huge fan of this extra-terrestrial terror fest. I have already watched it three times by now, in only two years (what is an unusual ratio for me personally) and it still is a great, horrifying experience. It is probably among my personal top three films of the master of horror, and there is almost nothing for me to hate about it, quite the contrary, with each watch I cherish it even more. You got a charismatic Kurt Russell, gradually losing his mind and like every other member of the team, being paranoid towards each and everyone. The best thing about it is that you cannot really tell who is an imitation and who is still human, because the film displays so many paradoxical hints that lead you into a totally wrong direction. To be honest, despite having watched it three times and paying close attention to it, I still don't know if the two survivors are in fact human or just alien imitation, and that makes this movie so utterly enjoyable. It is the perfect mix of gross gore and practical effects, distrust and terror and somehow even snow western, a formula that is currently making the game ""Among Us"" so popular. And the bone-chilling score of the late Ennio Morricone makes it perfect. I love this film so much and I think every horror fan should have seen at least once in a lifetime.",

It has a good, suspenseful story, great acting from interesting characters, and even better special effects. There are some moments in the movie that still make my skin crawl. The best aspect of The Thing is that it seems very realistic. The characters look and act like real people would if they were thrust into this situation. It also withstands the test of time.

638,22 July 2010,albinus01,10, The most realistic sci-fi / horror movie ever made,"John Carpenter's The Thing is the quintessential bottle movie. Set in remote Antarctica, The Thing illustrates paranoia and isolation. This is achieved effectively because the pacing is methodical and deliberate. The tension builds patiently. So when excitement does erupt, it is cathartic and earned. The editing contributes here with prolonged takes and fades to black, evoking an atmosphere of exhaustion. Yet, it is the careful writing that is the driving force behind this mood. Each actor utilizes the chilling script and displays his own form of anxiety as the walls close in. The haunting music and ominous sound design are cherries on top.",
639,23 October 2021,guskeller,9, Certified classic,"""The Thing"" could be seen as the natural evolution of the formula that began with Ridley Scott's ""Alien"". The two movies have an entirely different setting and atmosphere, but share the same simple structure: a group of humans ends up being stuck in a confined space as they are chased by an unknown alien entity. However, the ""Thing"" manages to become something more than a beautifully designed hungry monster: it's a threat with no discernible appearance, as it has the ability to imitate the organisms it consumes and blend in with its prey. This allows Carpenter to convey his trademark cynical, nihilistic view of humanity, focusing on how easily a team of highly unlikeable characters can fall apart as they slowly get consumed by their distrust and paranoia. The ""Thing"" has no evil intentions and is just trying to survive, but it won't take much to the humans to end up turning against each other.",
640,24 August 2021,x_manicure_x,8, Cold and claustrophobic,"""First g--d--- week of Winter."" With that line, Kurt Russell as R.J.Macready, the rock solid helicopter pilot, paints a bleak picture of what is to come in John Carpenter's The Thing. Twelve men living in the Antarctic are confronted by a mysterious and terrifying ""Thing"" from outer space. The Thing it is revealed, crash-landed 100,000 years ago and frozen, was dug up by a team of Norwegians who allow it to thaw with disastrous consequences. After arriving in the American camp in the guise of a dog, the Thing goes after Kurt Russell and his comrades, killing and replacing them, one by one. Who is human? Who is the Thing? The air of paranoia and suspense are practically palpable in a movie that if it does not scare you, then you are already dead. I love this movie. I watch it about once a month. Based on the short story,""Who goes There?"" by John W. Campbell Jr., John Carpenter's picture has a group of regular guys thrust into highly irregular circumstances, threatened by a creature that can imitate exactly any living thing it touches. An all male cast and claustrophobic sets are a few of the unique aspects of the production. I see something new every time I watch it. Wilford Brimley is cast as Blair, the scientist who discovers the true nature of the Thing and decides to save the world,isolating the research station by destroying their transportation and radio equipment. Beautifully shot in Canada and Alaska and using then (1982) state of the art special effects, The Thing is the perfect movie to curl up with on a cold Winter's night. The characters are entirely believable and their sense of isolation and panic are easily felt by the viewer. Beware, there are some squeam inducing scenes with plenty of alien goo and guts. I highly recommend this movie for all those who love suspense and horror. I think it is also some of Kurt Russell's best work.",

651,13 August 2003,willsgb,10, wow,"John Carpenter is probably the horror genre's single most famous export. I think the reason why, other than the fact that he built his career with a couple highly successful low budget horror films at the box office (Halloween and The Fog), is because those films had his name all over the advertisements. You knew it was a John Carpenter film when you went to see it. But any biography of John Carpenter reads a little funny when you consider how big a name he is in the genre, because shortly after those films were so successful, his 1982 epic The Thing absolutely tanked at the box office. Things didn't get much better for him following that. Neither 1983's Christine, 1984's wonderful Starman, nor 1986's Big Trouble in Little China did any better. I'll bet Universal was having greater luck when they acquired the rights to the sequels for Halloween. Though even there, Part III: Season of the Witch most likely didn't make too much more than John's remake of The Thing.

I was excited to see this movie- that was for sure The premise to 'The Thing' sounds very interesting with a shape shifting alien who duplicates and shape shifts into humans picking off members of an expedition at Antarctica. I'll tell you why I was interested. Monster horror movies such as Alien are just amazing and so I was excited for this. Being trapped in Antarctica is perhaps the best place to be trapped and John Carpenter's suspense added in Halloween and absolute minimal level of gore made his original Halloween a frightening movie. So, it was hard for me not to have high expectations The acting by the entire cast is very good mainly Kurt Russel who shines as MacReady. The music was great but to me, not as frightening or anywhere near as iconic as the Halloween theme. The story was as I said...just an awesome premise for a horror. The writing and directing were great. The movie falls a bit in terms of suspense as I found the movie very suspense-less and very ""not so scary"" The effects have certainly been outdated but that isn't a flaw considering the movie came out 30 years ago. I felt that during many circumstances that the suspense level could've easily been risen and would've had me far more interested in the story.

The screenplay, the actors, the plot, the intrigue, the fact that we always want to know what will happen next...all those elements make this film a true masterpiece.

While not as groundbreaking a classic as Ridley Scott's masterpiece, it's certainly worth repeated viewings. It is a good ol' fashioned scary movie, and certainly Carpenter's best work. If you've only seen in on TV with commercials or on cable a dozen years ago, see it again (if possible a wide screen copy as Carpenter used the 2.35:1 screen beautifully to create a mood and place).

680,14 May 2022,joshuamedina-87920,10, IMO the greatest film ever made,"For many people, John Carpenters swansong will always be Halloween, a taut brilliantly directed movie that continues to generate new fans over 30 years since its release. But for those who know carpenters work, he directed at least 3 other gems, one of those being the 1982 movie, the thing. ostensibly a remake of the 1951 movie the 'thing from another world', the movie begins with a helicopter chasing a dog, whom the occupants are trying to shoot, for which we have no idea why at this point. Carpenter is an expert when it comes to tension and suspense in his movies, right up there with Hitchcock in my opinion. the use of such tension in this movie is where carpenter excels,the master directors vision of a dark cold world perfectly instills the sense of dread and(later) paranoia all of the scientists at this research station feel. So they let this dog into the facility...and then the real terror begins. all the tension and great directing you like wouldn't work though if it were not for the absolutely astounding effects that to be honest are probably the best I've ever seen in cinema, horrifyingly gut wrenching spine ripping head tearingly real and convincing of an alien force that will absorb its host... all credit must go to rob bottin for these effects which with carpenter knowing exactly what to do (and when to do it) added together and we have an absolute corker of a movie which should be in the top 30 movies if all time and top 10 horrors. and yet it has never received the credit it deserves. why? no pun intended but perhaps the violence alienated some people? it is fantastically gory and anyone easily offended and under 16 should avoid at all costs, for the rest well, turn the lights off, get rid of any yakkers and ENJOY. 10/10 David Ford",
681,14 August 2009,sjmdd,10, glorious gorious masterpiece,I saw this movie many many years ago on TV and hadn't seen it for a while. It was on TV again last night and decided I should give it another go. I am very glad I did because it is a tremendously entertaining horror movie from the master of the genre John Carpenter. The movie concerns a bunch of research scientists who investigate an isolated place and find some kind of deformed creature and take it for research hoping to gain recognition for their discovery. What they don't know however is that the creature is very much alive and it's not long before it starts taking over their bodies. It is then upto the crew to decide which one of them has been taken over by the creature by taking a series of tests cue bags of tension. This could have been simply awesome but it ends up being just great. The problem is not the script or the climax but the fact that it bears quite a bit of resemblance to Alien(my favourite horror movie). For example in The Thing the scene where The Thing comes out of one the scientists body is similar to that famous John Hurt scene in Alien. One interesting point is that in John Carpenter's Halloween the original version of The Thing is playing in the background. Despite it's minor flaws The Thing is a pretty great monster movie and one of the best horror movies of the 80's.,

The Thing is a horror masterpiece. The movie is based on a book called ""Who Goes There?"", which is rather fitting considering the plot. In 1980's Antartica, a research team accidentally stumble upon an alien that can change it's appearance to look like anyone through cell-transformation.

John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film about a mutant molecular cell that once it comes into contact of any living entity manifests itself, transforming and imitating the original DNA of that being. 'The Thing' as it becomes known is capable of assuming the physical and mental characteristics of anyone it chooses or to put it simply, an alien life form in disguise! Many top critics have missed the mark in their reviews of this film, although most being from when it originally came out. The public nonetheless knows a classic when they see one and that's why this film has developed such a long legacy and rightly so. The story is plausible if a little thin at times but the continuous 'guessing game' of who is infected keeps the viewer on edge, building up to a wonderfully tense moment in the film I like to call, 'the blood test'.",

John Carpenter created a masterpiece that stands as the crown jewel in the horror genre! Great acting, thick atmosphere, brilliant effects, and smart character decisions are just some of the things 'The Thing' offers. Speaking of the characters, this is one of the aspects where the movie stands apart from the rest, they make logical decisions for the greater good of the group. They aren't splitting up, going to into dark rooms alone, they are fighting back and using science to their advantage. Outside of strong characters, the movies special effects are unrivaled even by today's technological advancements and widening resources. The practical effects used in the movie look spectacular, over the top yes, but never too fake to the point where they become silly. The creatures many taking forms could not look any more impressive or scary!

Yes it's but no need to make it much bigger than itself, the plot is enjoyable but i didn't like the sad ending it had it didn't get to any real conclusion, no it's not that horrific it had just a simple feel with it, soundtrack was calming and what i noticed it was a quiet movie not so many dialogues, so 1.5$ million was spent on Rob Bottin's creature effects, a mixture of chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form yes the creature was well crafted but nothing to worry about, i can just recognize Kurt Russell from the cast he is so good there loved him acting the role, at last it's one of the classic Sci-fi movie i enjoyed recommended for the Sci-fi fans, 7.5/10⭐",

The stop-motion animation, instead of feeling dated and tired, has a more visceral impact than computer-generated FX, and the entire film is loaded with tension.

Perhaps due to technical limitations, or maybe to fit with the contemporary conventions of the horror genre, the 1951 adaptation portrayed the Thing as a Frankenstein monster from outer space. John Carpenter set out to change this with this adaptation, not only to make the story more loyal to the book, but to create the ultimate monster, one that was more than just a guy in a suit. Boy, did he succeed! The special effects for the Thing, created by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston, are incredible to this day; it is a much more realistic creature than many of the CGI monsters you see today. It's an amalgamation of all the creatures it has assimilated, including dogs, humans, and any other alien life forms it has encountered, giving it a familiar yet distinctly alien look.",

The suspense is wonderful because of the enclosed area that the scientists inhabit and the feeling that no one can truly trust each other is unbelievably intense. Although i have said that the effects now maybe slightly outdated i also have to put that at the time they were stunning and the effects designer Rob Bottin should get an honourable mention for making the creature seem terrifying and at the same time with the weird shapes and forms that the 'Thing' had become in the past visually stunning and intriguing.",

There is never any interaction between the cast and the alien (except for when the doctor looses his hands, that part doesn't make sense btw., why does the replicant suddenly collapse?) Sure, the ones infected/taken over/copied must have interacted with it, but every time the alien shows itself it never does anything.

For that remarkable comeback alone, you have to give ""The Thing"" and its resiliency some mad props. Myself, I ended up finally seeing this in the early 90s when I was in college. Definitely worth the wait. Its based on the old 1930s sci-fi novel ""Who Goes There?"" and is essentially a remake of the 1950s ""The Thing From Another Planet."" Aside from being based on an old novel, it is derivative of many before it the sci-fi/monster movie genre. Think ""Alien"" but in the Antarctic instead of outer space. But this movie still works on so many levels. First of all, it was one of the few movies in the late '70s/early '80s sci-fi genre that actually had a decent cast (such as Kurt Russell, Richard Dysart and that old geezer -- forgot his name -- who used to do Quaker Oats commercials and always mispronounced ""diabetes""). Secondly, the special effects are amazingly good for an '80s sci-fi movie; better than a lot of the crap that passes off as CGI special effects on SciFi Channel. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, this movie takes a somewhat complex plot (in addition to the ""monster runs amok"" theme, there's quite a bit of plot and character buildup and mistrust amongst the main characters, weaved in with the ""in addition to fighting an unknown monster, we're kind of stuck in Antarctica too"" claustrophobia) and does it without affecting the pace of the movie whatsoever. I guess that must be the John Carpenter influence. Whatever it is, this was a great movie to watch, giving you the sci-fi scares without any of the laugh-ability of bad, low-budget shockers. I'm shying away just a bit at giving it the highest possible rating because I wasn't 100% on board with the ending (leaves a little too much to interpretation of what happened to the final two survivors), but I give ""The Thing"" a very solid 9.",

He has done lots of classic horror movies throughout his career but this one perhaps is his most brilliant one. He builds up the movie extremely well and very effectively.

Why doesn't he do horror movies anymore? Now days he mostly makes bright looking, happy movies, while in the past he did the camera-work for some fine and classic horror flicks, including ""The Fog"" and ""Halloween"", which also got directed by John Carpenter. It's also a quite gory movie to watch. The still at the time very young Rob Bottin did a very good job with all of its make-up effects. Some truly gory and unexpected things are happening throughout this movie, so know what to expect.

I don't say that's a bad thing but rather a good thing because it has those good elements from Alien, expands on them, and makes a pretty entertaining and fun horror sci-fi flick. Kurt Russel is good as our main character and also everyone else. It's cool to see how the crew have regonizable features and personality traits you maybe wouldn't see in an environment the movie has. However, what steals the show and terrifies me all the time would have to be the alien. Oh my god, this thing might be the scariest thing I have even seen as both a child and adult. So, this movie has action, that sci-fi feeling, horror, and a hint of suspense. This movie is fun. 8/10.",

762,5 June 2019,reillyjohnnie,9, Best horror film ever made (in my opinion),"I'm a big fan of the black and white version of ""The Thing"". I was angry that John Carpenter made his own version and I refused to see it... until recently. ""The Thing"" has a very Lovecraftian feeling to it. Lovecraft is one of my favorite writers so it was inevitable that I would love this film. Let me clear the air about a few things. This is NOT a remake, both films are based on a story entitled ""Who Goes There?"" by an author I can't remember. I will try to find and read it as soon as possible. The level of paranoia in this film is thick. You have no clue who is The Thing until the transformation happens. The difference between this film and the black and white version is that the black and white monster was like a Frankenstein monster type of thing. This monster is like Alien from ""Alien"". It takes the form of living things (excluding plants, that's just my guess) and hides in them. Both monsters can be destroyed by the same means, see both films if you want to see what these means are. I'm eating my words, I will bow down to John Carpenter for doing this film. Both films are good, so I suggest if you see this one, see the black and white version. Just don't expect to see the same monster. Another thing that got me about this film is its level of controversy. Apparently, a bunch of sensitive people got offended because there's no females in this film. I don't see people for their race, gender, ethnicity, etc. I see them for who they really are. Some people are way too sensitive about stupid things like this.",

This movie hits the nail on the head for so many things, the scare factor, the ambiguity leaving the watcher needing to think about the movie afterwards, the amazing chilling practical effects, the isolation and atmosphere, the amazing soundtrack playing at all the right moments expressing dread, the paranoia, the list goes on. I have never left a movie feeling the same way that this movie does. My favorite one of the things this film does wonderfully would be the ambiguity. I engaged in many theory videos and did some thinking on my own as well, but people such as Bob Ager had much better theories than anything I could come up with. This uneasiness, distrust, and uncertain feeling the movie displays is truly what makes it scary, on top of those terrifying practical effects which I love so much. The threat of The Thing being larger than life was also a very engaging aspect, making it even more truly scary. After seeing many movies of the same type, The Thing always takes the cake. Everyone involved in this film did wonderfully, and although nothing is ever perfect, this movie is damn near perfect FOR ME.",

People in this movie are scientists in antarctica, so im pretty sure if you lived on a scientific base in antarctica, you would probably act a little diffrent than other people. You can really feel the shifting of emotions trough the acting. First you can feel them relaxed, playing games and talking, and then you feel the anxitey rise trough their faces has the movie moves on. And this is something really unique to this film. The concept is so good and so well portayed. It is a lot different than other horror concept and it makes you feel a lot more emotions. The antarctica base is really well portrayed has an environement. And a lot of this is due to the fact that when they shot the movie, they actually changed the temperure of the site to 28 F degrees, which made it very accurate. Ennio Morricone's music in this movie is... Awsome! The way the movie begins is extremly suspenseful, but its a lot due to the opening title. Just that title alone is terrifying, suspenseful, cold... you can just feel the antarctica trough it. The film is also pretty reallistic, especially if you think about how non reallistic it could be.

772,14 September 2020,davroslives-47369,10, The best version,"The Thing is a classic horror film directed by John Carpenter and written by Bill
Lancaster. The 1982 film was filled with excitement, conflict, and terror from start to finish and
the film never failed to keep me on my feet. Taking place in Antarctica in 1982 with nothing
around them but their camp, the American scientists were disrupted by gunfire. A Norwegian
helicopter was shooting at a dog. The helicopter decides to land on their camp and not revert
to their station. The crazy passenger shooting at the dog comes out trying to alert them, but he
just sounded crazy to the Americans because he was talking Norwegian. The helicopter
explodes and both Norwegians are killed one from the explosion and the other was killed by the
Americans. The crew takes in the stray dog, but little did they know it would cause them their
life. The ""dog"" that they took in was infected by the deadly horrific ""thing"". Its ability to shape
shift into any organism they have absorbed made it hard for anyone to trust each other which
sets fearfulness and dispute of who is really telling the truth in the group.
John J. Lloyd (production designer) did an outstanding job in choosing the setting.
Antarctica is never a first choice when you think about horror, but the setting ties well with the
isolation and set of the film. The set Carpenter chose was a small campsite. To enhance the
isolation, it was the only shelter nearby. It was frigid outside so if you wanted to survive the
winter you would have to be inside the toasty shelter. This made it harder for anyone to trusteach other which set a paranoia feeling in all of the characters and an unsettling feeling for the
viewers. The anxious unsettling feeling is also followed by the music score by Ennio Morricone.
It created suspense when they went inspecting in the Norwegian campsite and found dead
bodies and a large block of ice that looked like it belongs to a humungous creature. Roy
Arbogast also helped enhance the fear in the film with all of his special effects. Although it was
1982, the special effects were out of this world. It looked so real and felt like you were really
there. When ""The thing"" was being autopsied by Dr.Blair (Wilford Brimley) the organism
exploded everywhere and it was looked so genuine that it was so impressive.
Lancaster creates an incredible ending to the film. MacReady (Kurt Russell) and his
crewmates that are still alive collaborate to burndown the station to preclude ""the thing"" from
getting out into the world. In the middle of putting all of the explosives ""the thing"" comes out
to attack. MacReady throws an explosive in ""the things"" mouth and bolts out of the exploding
structure. When he is in a safe spot he sits down exhaustedly and watches as the station burns
to pieces. He is then startled by the approach of one of his crewmates Childs (Keith David).
MacReady questions Childs of being ""the thing"" but ultimately, he is too drained to wrangle
about it. The viewer is left with no definite answer which creates suspense and uncertainty.",

It isn't  ""the Bicycle Thief"", or ""Citizen Kane"", but minute for minute, i gather more enjoyment from The Thing than either of those masterpieces. This movie grabs you from the first scene and takes you far away from your warm cozy living room, and blankets you in cold isolation. I find myself curious about the people who find themselves stationed in that far corner of the world. Carpenter never tells us anything about them, which gives us a voyeuristic feel. Great special effects and a good plot move the story along. The tension builds unceasingly as you slowly realize that all of the people in this film are doomed. The DVD version is a must own, It has so many extras that it is like getting another film free. And the color and sound are vastly improved over the video version ( yes, I own both).

First there's the gore which will surely put off many due to its explicitness and inventive grotesqueness. Second there's the scenery with its chilled and chilling feel of isolation and its ""no one's getting out alive"" vibe. Thirdly the most unsettling aspect is that it lays out a distrustful relationship among these men, they're all together but not once do they, or indeed can they, trust one another which is clearly made out by lines like ""Trust is a hard thing to come by these days"" or ""You'll have to sleep sometime"".Paranoia fills the air while the tension seethes inside each character threatening to boil over.",

796,18 April 2018,lonnie-48320,10, A masterpiece of horror and gore!,"The Thing is not only the undisputed best sci-fi horror movie of all time, even topping Alien and Aliens, but probably one of the best movies ever made regardless the genre. Different genres make different movies and generate different emotions, of course, but this movie totally succeeds in evoking a lot of feelings, and doing everything right. It is truly a work of art – and I am not even talking about effects alone; they are still top notch today, simply incredible for 1982. The Casting is great; all characters are played well and they are all individuals, both fitting the profile of the person you would expect to work in remote areas, as well as making it convincing anyone could later be one of those Things also. Because the people in the movie are all so different, and yet all so human and convincing, it is as if you see the story unfold through your own eyes. This distance of observer to the subject is what great art can keep at bay, and this movie excels in it. All through the end the film stays utterly unpredictable, since almost never we get to know more than the guys in the movie. Therefore, again, it feels like we are there ourselves, cleverly creating a bond between us and the humans in the movie. We never know who is who, who will make it and who won't. But we all hope 'we' make it in the end. Just as in the people struggling for survival in the Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, we feel the sense of loss as the movie progresses and mankind is slowly but surely taken over; the powers and knowledge of the Alien power might be infinitely bigger than ours and its superiority is maybe meant to survive us, but what it lacks is of course emotion, feelings, all that makes humans to special and worth fighting for. The Thing also excels in storytelling. Take the beginning. Action and setting plus players straight away, the landscape of the Arctic, the eerie pulsating beat of the GREAT soundtrack (also 10/10, you just feel the gloomy future on mankind if the Thing gets into civilized areas), a helicopter chasing a dog, the crew just as us looking at it, thinking: what the Sam Hill? Just as them, we will soon find out. Great art, whether it is a story, a painting or a movie, plays cleverly with our unconscious desires, fears and fantasies. What is shown and not told, is in the Thing just as powerful as what is not shown, but only told, leaving it up to us to fantasize. Instead of showing the inside of the UFO, or how the alien looked like in the ice, we see a distant black and white video of the doomed crew in the snow, as if it was an old Arctic exploration team a hundred years ago. It would be tantalizing to see the UFO from the inside, and the Alien too, but to not do it is the perfect choice of the director, leaving it to our own fantasies to work it out, thus creating suspense. We know the alien is old, came from far away, imitated life on a million planets, is smart, powerful and now it wants us. Even the computer prognosis of 'doc' is creepy: if it reaches civilized areas, entire world copied in around three years. But do we really believe in 'this voodoo nonsense'? (Even the dialogues in the movie are 10 out of 10). We do when we see the character Bennings burnt down, howling, with hands half finished, half human, half the unimaginable monster that is underneath, we know the Thing might indeed truly be amongst us. Of course, in reality it probably taps the subject of humans themselves: we are all capable of love, but also of burning Jews in gas chambers. We have wonderful visions, we can be brave, but we also have nightmares and fears. Not all that is human we are proud of. Together with the big picture, also used in the Bodysnatchers, it is all about society getting violent and less human, no government after Nixon can be trusted, et cetera, further tapping in on paranoia. The Thing is maybe not so different from us, maybe it is already here, after all What this movie DOES show,wow, how magnificent can special effects be? And how unpredictable? The shape shifting of one of them turning into a werewolf cum spider is unforgettable and still terrifying today when I see it. It was lucky CGI wasn't available then, making it all look more organic and realistic than any computer could have made it.",

798,24 June 2018,foxtrotfenris,10, Premiere filmmaking at it's finest.,"Easily John Carpenter's best film, ""The Thing"" is that rarest of movie rarities -- a remake of a classic film that is every bit as good as the original.  Backed by a pounding, heartbeat-like synthesizer score from the brilliant Ennio Morricone, ""The Thing"" opens (following a pre-titles UFO ""teaser"") with striking, beautifully choreographed images of a low flying helicopter chasing a dog through a desolate, frozen landscape.  The finale is just as stunningly filmed, the story bleakly and ambiguously ending in that same landscape awash in redhot flames.  In between, ""The Thing"" offers some of the most potently horrific sequences ever shot. John W. Campbell's original short story ""Who Goes There?"" is followed much more closely here than in Howard Hawks' version, resulting in some awesomely effective man-to-monster transformations.  Although these make-up effects have been much copied since 1982, the film has lost little of its power to shock even the most jaded of horror fans.

The mise-en-scene is scarce, claustrophobic, the editing is mostly slow paced but sneakingly abrupt in certain moments, cutting out exactly when it shouldn't.

Carpenter turns what would've been a lesser film in the hands of another(except possibly the great Quentin Tarantino)into a slam packed film in which the suspense is great and the various revelations pose more questions than answers. Kurt Russell oozes cool as helicoper pilot MacReady who only wants to get out of Anarctica and go home. The plot is one of my favorite aspects of the film: a remote Antarctic research station is infiltrated by a creature that is thousands of years old and can assimilate any body and become a carbon copy. Paranoia and fear run rampant as the residents try to discover which one of them isn't who they claim to be. The writing can get corny at times but the script hold tight enough.

In this movie we are treated to some intense, for the time, special effects, and some of the best acting from Kurt Russell ever seen. This is a classic sci-fi/horror movie that takes the original, 1951 The Thing from Another World, to a totally new level.  The original is somewhat tame, but really cool B&W 50's monster movie stuff.  John Carpenter took this concept and put a few twists around it.  In the original a military outpost in the Arctic finds a spaceship complete with alien.  They thaw it out and find out that it eats human blood and is part plant and part animal. In the new version, the setting is Antarctica, the group is civilian and the alien is found by a group of 'crazy swedes'.  This alien is a little different as well, instead of eating human blood it 'eats' or replicates organic tissue.  This makes it a mimic, able to replicate and consume any organism that it has contact with.  This leads to suspicion, who is real and who is the thing?, and eventually to murder and complete destruction.  My favorite  line has to be when the group locks Kurt Russell's character McCready outside in the storm because they think he might be a thing and when he tries to get back in they say, ""What if we are wrong?  Well then we're wrong.""  The suspicion between the characters is sometimes palatable and  I could feel the isolation and desperation from them.",

If you want to see the REAL ""Thing"", go watch the classic film from the 1950's. Now that one was scary and with a decent ending. John Carpenter may be great but, in my opinion, he totally missed it with this one and wasn't even close to the '50s version. In the original version, everyone in the theater, both kids and adults were on the edge of their seats and everyone was talking about the movie after they left the theater. This version started out much the same as the original one but deviated, dramatically, as it progressed. I saw the original as a kid and it scared the heck out of me. I even had nightmares about it that night. The only thing I might say about the original is that it was in black and white and it MAY have been better had it been in color, which was not that common back at that time. This one should have had a totally different title because it really was nothing compared to the 50's version.

Staying true to the spirit of Joseph Campbell's short story WHO GOES THERE? (the basis for Howard Hawks' original b/w version) Carpenter's THE THING brought Rob Bottin's mechanical special effects into the realm of high art. The original story is an allegorical tale of the fear and paranoia created by the anti-communist sentiment pervading the 1950 / 60s USA. Communist paranoia was transposed into Sci-Fi / monster movie in Hawks' version but Carpenter, having no need for this in the 80s, brings a contemporary fear to his version - that of illness. Carpenter's version plays on our fear of what may be inside us or those close to us (a type of left wing horror - fear of ourselves as opposed to right wing horror - fear of them) whether it be disease such as aids or mental illness, it is this kind of atmosphere that saturates this film and is made manifest by Bottin's truly viscerally terrifying special effects. Every aspect of the film is top notch: the acting (with the ever excellent Kurt Russell and a magic ensemble cast), the cinematography from Australian DP Dean Cundy (long time JC collaborator), the effects (as mentioned), the amazing snow covered exteriors and Carpenter's effective, intelligent, economical directing.

821,22 September 1999,Don-147,10, The Most Underrated Horror Movie Ever,"Throughout my life I have seen many horror movies and I have played many horror video-games so I am not that easily scared from horror movies (or video-games). But The Thing made me feel truly scared after a long time.So why is it so good? Well I will try to say why without spoiling the movie. First of all the characters. The characters in this movie take most of the time (if not all the time) smart and good decisions in order to defeat or hide from the Thing. The movie doesn't spent time talking about their heritage or their family status and I think that's better from making us feel bad about them when they die. Also the performance of the actors is really good Second the story. The story develops really well but I am not going to say more about it in order not to spoil the experience. Third the atmosphere. The movie takes place in a research facility in Antarctica which make's the atmosphere more scary because you know that whatever the characters do they are truly alone and helpless while being miles away from civilization.And last let's talk about the main star of the movie The Thing. This creature is the most scary and the most disgusting thing(pun not intended) I have seen in my life and from what I said at the begging you can understand that this says a lot. I am not going to say what it's this creature main ability but I am going to say that: when it transforms it makes you disgusted and afraid. This movie has the guts to show you the transformation of The Thing in full screen and with every detail. What makes it even more scary it's the fact that the whole Thing is practical effect. I kid you not, the guys that did the effects made everything from the ground up without the use of CGI. Whatever you see, no matter how hard it is to believe, its indeed not cgi. Well, that's everything I have to say about this movie and I want to believe that I convinced you to watch it the movie without ruining the surprises. 10/10",

The monsters seem to come out of some other movies like Alien but it wasn't the same thing.  The only thing that the movie could have done better was the performance of Russell, I don't think he is a bad actor, I just thought that the character that he portrait did have a resemblance to the character that he played on Escape From New York and L.A.' and so on, but that was the only fault that I found.

835,27 March 2011,nicknearmiss,10, an excellent exercise in suspense and character writing,"I am big fan of horror films and I do know what I like and dislike. The Thing was a movie I instantly loved. Since very young John Carpenter has been a director which has produced movies that I still today consider one of my favorites namely: Escape from New York and Big Trouble in Little China. It was in my later years I started to appreciate more the horror genre and that is a lot thanks to Halloween, Prince of Darkness and of course this movie the Thing. John Carpenter has an extraordinary ability to build the story in all of his movies in such a way that you feel you are just drawn into the movie, slowly but surely. There are many ways to do a horror movie and how you as a director decides to scare the audience. Many movies relies heavily on gore or visual effects, however, Carpenter has never gone that route but instead he has focused on building a great story where the suspense develops gradually. The intro song to the movie is an excellent example of his art of making horror movies.
In my opinion that is a far better way to scare someone than blood splashing on the screen. When you watch this movie then it's not the gore (which it does have also) that scares you the most but that it's the feeling that you feel you are becoming paranoid about what's really happening and that is by far the best way to really scare someone.
If you like horror movies this is a must see, if you like good movies in general, then this is also a must see. Thank you John Carpenter for showing us that a great movies doesn't have to necessary cost a fortune.",

Stuart- Who goes there? This movie centered around paranoia, which makes for a much better story than the 1951 version. And FX wiz Rob Bottin raised the bar for alien special effects in this 1982 classic, which was a dud a box office. The digital, anamorphic version is nearly perfect, with rich color reproductions. And plenty of extras that satisfy even the most hardcore fans. Lead star Kurt Russell joins John Carpenter for the commentary track.

This is the only film to have put a little fright into me. Back when you had to think of special effect (instead of having one guy with a vivid imagination, and 124 computer geeks-like today) this film maximises a lot out of a little.

I read the book first, then was treated to the film on cable television (I was too young to see it in its theatrical release), and I must say that it excels in every aspect.  The cinematography and sound are dead-on, as are the performances turned in by a fine cast.  Kurt Russel is fantastic -- I can't imagine the movie having been made with any other lead. The story is as perfect as it is simplistic.  And the creature effects are astounding considering the film's age.  This is a movie that you can really lose yourself in -- that you can imagine the character's plight as your own. Such an internalizing aspect is difficult to achieve in the cinema, and credit goes to Mr. Carpenter for the astounding job he did modernizing a cheesy old B-move.

I finally found out recently.
I LOOOOVE practical effects, 1 mil. times better and more convincing than CGI effects. That's why i loved The Nightmare On Elm Street movies, The Blob, The Fly and others. But The Thing is in a league of its own. This movie's special effects are the best i have ever seen in my long practical effects movie history :)",
852,23 August 2020,talasam12345,10, A milestone in special effects in movies and in sci-fi movie history in general !,John Carpenter at his best. In an age full of cgi and A-list clutter here is a prime example of how to get it right without going overboard. The story/plot action characters all gel so superbly I don't think a review can justify the end result. It can be labelled a horror sci-fi suspense thriller action movie all rolled into one. Nothing beats the old style special effects not a blue/green screen in sight! The performances churned out by an ordinary cast is brilliant and yes I'm saying it was an almost ordinary cast minus Kurt Russell Keith David (Childs)and possibly Donald Moffat (Garry)but you know what I mean. I remember watching this movie when I was 10 and then I definitely thought horror but as I've watched it progressively over the years each time I find myself classing it as something else sometimes even as a murder mystery! The setting works well and the film never seems to lack pace from a never ending twisting plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end. If you've not seen it I don't know what you're waiting for. No really I don't know what are you waiting for go watch it now you won't be disappointed.,

I love this one, I have always been a sucker for creepy films but this has it all. The story combines psychological effects as well as OK special effects which are used in a pretty damn scary way! ",
854,25 February 2002,jarius,8," Scary, scary, scary...",This was a very cool horror movie with tons of visual style and very good replay value. I even liked the music (which Carpenter usually does himself with mixed results; the Halloween music was killer though-this time it is done by some Italian guy I've never heard of).The acting was great I always like Keith David and I was surprised by Wilford Brimley. I never saw him in anything but commercials before this and I have to admit it was pretty weird to see him in a movie like this. The thing that makes this one great is the claustrophobic feeling and the special effects; they are just plain crazy. Carpenter must have had some help from Mary Jane on this one.,
855,6 March 2006,aaronyovanovits,10, Great Movie with wicked special effects,The Thing is about scientists in the Antarctic that are confronted by a shape shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people it kills. This ends up being a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Once the scientists realize there is a good chance someone will get affected that ads to the suspense in this this movie. You don't really know who to trust. You don't know who is going to be next affected by the shape shifting alien. The alien itself ends up being this spider like creature which is really creepy. It may gross you out but I didn't bother me much. ,

You gotta watch it. It is without a doubt Special effects master Rob Bottin's greatest work. It's amazing what people came up with before computers replaced almost everything with CGI. All the monsters are real, in the sense that everything you see on screen is really there. So real in fact that even though it was made in 81-82, they still look better than everything today, even 30+ years later. this is my favorite horror movie of all time. The cast is great, the direction is fantastic, the score is absolutely creepy and memorable. I watched The Hateful 8 recently and recognized some of the music from this movie straight away.

864,6 April 2005,newsjunkie356-1,9, Carpenter's dramatic masterpiece...,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" presentation has aged like wine over the past 3 decades. One of many strong points foe the movie's presentation is how simple but effective the soindtrack really is. The movie starts with a wide shot of a vast snowy mountains and plainviews in the anarctic, and that synth beat just gives off a atmosphere that most horror movies fail to give. After a scene of a helicopter chasing a dog the film cuts to a group of American researchers in a base camp, it truley shows how these characters are far from help and society and close they are to danger. (It's like the characters in Alien being in space, letting the audience know that these characters are alone. Another horror sci-ci masterpiece)
After the Americans save the dog and themselves from being shot by a Norwegian researcher. They go out to investigate in the Norwegian campsite and find out that chaos caused the deaths of the other Norwegian reasearchers, but know what. The scene makes the viewer feel like they're there with characters by making the chaos of the campsite look believable. It makes viewer keep guessing and wondering if what happened and the mystery is excuted perfectly.
After the two researchers come back with two gruesome bodies that seemed to be intertwined with each other, they have the biologist disect it to find out if it give any details on what happened. The practical effects by Rob Bottin stay strong throughout the film and haven't age one bit. The visuals is masterful on every level, the gorgeous cinematography, the effective use of colors, to the realistic effects makes the movie even more impressive, being the fact that it was made more than 3 decades ago.
Before all the characters decide to go to sleep we see the dog enter one of the character's room. You the character petting the dog but it's only shown through shadow on the wall. This scene clearly shows someone was affected by ""the thing"" ( witch can imitate someone)but it doesn't reveal who exactly it was. John carpenter has even said that he used someone else that wasn't include in the cast to be the silhouette so it would be more mysterious on who was affected first.
Because of this it keeps the viewer guessing who is and who isn't by ""the thing"".
The film does an amazing job presenting paranoia between the characters abd their conflicts.

Even Film critic Roger Ebert called the special effects ""among the most elaborate, nauseating, and horrifying sights yet achieved by Hollywood's new generation of visual magicians"", and called the film itself ""a great barf-bag movie"" Sadly The Thing fared poorly at the box office. It was released on June 25, 1982 in 840 theaters and was issued a ""R"" rating by the MPAA. The film grossed $3.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $13.7 million in North America.

With the exception of the ending, it is very close to the original story. The special effects are excellent, and the characterizations (or at least the fear they exhibit) seemed realistic to me.

For me, it's a movie that gets better with each viewing and still stands up today over 30 years later as a marvel of atmosphere, special effects and existential dread. Whether intentional or through sheer luck, or perhaps an unlikely combination of both, the filmmakers who made this incredible opus have made one of the few greatest monster movies of all time that not only delivers the grisly goods of gory kills and nightmarish creatures but even more importantly is so meticulously paced and plotted with such vivid characterization of seemingly ordinary men isolated and trapped in a nightmarish wasteland that it naturalistically questions, perhaps without even meaning to, the nature of trust, identity, and the extent of human relationships on a professional and personal level based purely on the instinct to preserve the idea of ""self"" as the truest form of survival. This is not just a survival movie where the characters will do anything to live, including compromising their own integrity at the expense of others like so many shallow modernistic survival horror movies have done lately in order to seemingly justify extreme and seemingly sociopathic behavior. No, ""The Thing"" questions at what point does a decent caring person have to act on their own, perhaps even against the group, for not only the sake of his/her own good but for the good of the group as well to avoid being destroyed by the very human collective paranoia and hysteria that may be even more insane and monstrous than the thing causing it. In a group where trust has broken down because anyone could be a monster the question becomes not who has the right to assume authority but who will be authoritative enough over themselves to take a leap of faith in trusting someone who might lead them to their destruction. Is the greatest feat of ""self"" deciding to resist the potentially compromised authority of another person or deciding to take a leap of faith by submitting one's trust and ultimately one's will to someone who may prevent you from destroying yourself and others in a fit of fear and paranoia? These are the kind of ideas and themes explored in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and add to that mind-blowing special effects that put current CGI to shame even today and you've got an unique unrivaled masterpiece that is as deep and terrifying as it is dazzling.",

The characterization in this movie is critical because of all the paranoia and suspense between the actors. For anyone who thinks that special effects could not be done well before the advent of CGI I beg you to watch this movie. Rob Bottin really outdid himself on the designs for the Thing, which in essence could really look like anything that he could imagine since it has no ""true"" form, at least not in the movie. The pacing of the movie is absolutely perfect and really causes the viewer to question who is who. This is one of the most suspenseful, claustrophobic and thrilling movies of all time.

895,13 May 2006,Jonny-Utah,9, the best sci-fi /horror crossover along with alien!,"One of the things that attract me to a movie is it's reception. It doesn't slim down to whether it got a rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes or a fresh. It comes down to what they have to say. Cult films are brilliant in a subtle or not so subtle way, as Rocky Horror Picture Show was an amazingly unpleasant film. When The Thing was released it was panned for over-the-top gore and special effects. Even the director of the original, Christian Nyby, denounced this film. Yet this near masterpiece followed the coarse of other classic cult films. One of the main problems was the gore. Yes it was excessive. Yes it is brutal. I really, really love this for it. Robin R. Bottin, also known for Robocop and The Fog, masterfully crafted severed body parts, warped dogs, and a blob of nightmarish skin and blood, without any computer generated images or visual assist. The creature is so grotesque, you find yourself queasy as he takes every form of tentacle-severed head to 5-dog morphing. John Carpenter excellently builds suspense with a feeling of claustrophobia and unease. As the Thing can take any form necessary, The crew of a desolate Antarctic facility know nothing of who the monster has shape over... and neither do the audience. The viewer is kept in the dark for 95% of the movie. Certain victims are hinted towards, but there is no canon answer. As for flaws, the characters will seem underdeveloped and feel like a segway for gore. This doesn't affect the movie, as they are given enough personality for you to figure out the creature's form. The ending is so ambiguous that countless fan theories have appeared trying to explain it. The showdown between the hero and villain is gory, funny, and satisfying for a fight like this. 1982 was an impactful year for sci-fi and horror film with others such as Poltergeist, Blade Runner, and the Wrath of Khan. Yet no other film will gross you out as much as THE THING will! I suggest you give it a watch.",

The film stars five or six of the best character actors in Hollywood (Richard Masur, Donald Moffat and Keith David) on top of a slightly generic Kurt Russell performance. All in all, no viewer could ever forget the kind of fun this alien creature has with its human hosts.  It literally tries to become the organism it ""absorbs"".  And some characters get it BAD.  These scenes of terror are truly disturbing, especially for a younger viewer - which I was when I first saw it.

I understand this movie was made back in the day but the monster, alien thingys did not scare me at all. They were gooey and I guess gross in a way but not frightening. So I quickly gave up on actually expected to be scared by this movie and just carried out for the suspense which it also lacked. It just felt entirely too predictable. You could tell who was who and even how the characters would act just by looking at them. The movie gave the characters no real backstories, motives, fears, families, favorite foods anything. I feel like each character was given 2 personality traits and thrown into the movie. I won't call out the characters for acting stupid at times, cause it's a scary movie, but what bugged me was that they seemed completely unafraid of dying (at least how I would expect). I understand being hysteric in their situation but the only 2 emotions these characters showed were hysteria and anger, If I had been in this movie I would have thrown up, peed my pants and balled my eyes out within like 10 minutes. I did not care if any of them survived or not. It was kinda boring and I wouldn't watch it again. I did like the soundtrack, the scenery of the movie, and it had a plot that made sense, I think it really just lacked good characters.",

Actually, I did not even know what it was about or who was in the movie. It turned out to be the scariest movie I had ever seen. It stars Kurt Russell as a member of a expedition team in Antartica. They then come across an alien that takes the shape of people. It is probably the scariest when the alien is taking shape into the other people. It is also very suspenseful when they have to figure out who is an alien by testing their blood. I think it is a very good movie, that deserved to be watched. It is up there with Halloween and the Escape movies as John Carpenters best movies.",
904,26 February 2009,Hines150,9, Scariest movie I have ever seen,"""The Thing"", directed by John Carpenter, is actually a remake of a previous film titled ""The Thing from Another World"" that both terrifies and excites many times during the movie.  With bravura special effects by Rob Bottin (The Howling, Fight Club, etc.), ""The Thing"" centers around a group of scientists in Antarctica who come across something much worse that anyone could have expected.  Carpenter's other films he directed after this still can't touch this film as it remains potent to this day.  Besides ""Halloween"", this is Carpenter's best attempt at horror.  The ending does leave it open for a sequel, but unfortunately, the low box office for this film didn't merit one.  It's a shame because this is a modern sci-fi classic that everyone should attempt to see.  9/10",

First of all, I thought it would tell about a spirit, a ghost or something like that, but no, it was about a space creature! And god I hate space creature movies (except E.T.)! Especially this one. It was boring, though the idea was good and special effects too. But still, I didn't like it. Maybe it was the actors, maybe the directing... The dialogs were dull and stupid and the characters too.

So I bought it via the Internet. When I watched for the first time I had many friends around me, we used to watch movies at least once a week, mainly horror.

913,8 May 2006,baconfats,10, Carpenter's best,"Very good........ I think after 23years I may be close to fully understanding the film. The first to be infected/ imitated is Palmer..... When Nauls is told to turn the music down by Bennings, the suspect dog is looking for a host to hide within. We only see a shadow as he turns to the doorway to see the dog but I'll explain why it has to be Palmer. Until the ""blood testing"" scene Palmer shows no sign of infection, then just as he's blood is about to be tested, he shows the look of ""my game is up""..... he transforms to take Windows and both are destroyed by flame throwers. So how does the Thing remain living? After it takes Palmer it can rely now completely on the diversions of the others' to remain anonymous, no-one suspects that someone else could be imitation (except Blair but not for very long) for he is quickly overtaken... as he analyzes the dogs' remains he unwittingly uses his pencil to point out that ""That's not dog. It looks like dog. But it ain't dog. It's imitation."" Then touches his lips with the same pencil- he has started to transform from that very moment. No- one realises at that time. Blair begins to destroy the camp and shoot up the place to limit the chances of outside contact or escape for anyone, but it doesn't like the Antarctic either and has to leave to survive, and so dismantles the chopper to construct his own means of escape. That is another story how Blair can orchestrate his imprisonment so he can remain alone to engineer plans for departure out of that hostile land in which survival comes from residing in the humans or dogs which are offer no protection at all to the Arctic conditions. Both Man and Thing are equal here. Both have to fight to survive here. Not only the environment but each other to live on........anyway, We see Blair running from the helicopter, then again prior to taking Garry thats it he is part of the 75% he computes at the beginning. The computers..... we know The Chess computer is a cheat? It makes mistakes....can Blairs computer be as unreliable? Think about that one. His ploy is to remain totally unsuspecting to all, whilst destroying the camp, the transport, the blood stocks. He also sets up his only threat, Macready, by placing his torn clothing around the camp, Blair left Macready's cabin light on as well. I have more to discuss about The Thing. The fact it wasn't a hit was because it wasn't a fairytale, where everyone lived happily ever after. It looks like no-one lives even the Thing. No-one won the battle to survive. Or did they/ it? I like to think Macready remains human, he has to be when no-one is left to fight, he still continues to finish off The Thing.... with ""...k you too!"" and some dynamite. But if Childs had seen Blair in the final scenes there is a real chance that when he goes outside to investigate that Blair deals with him there. So Macready is a doomed human destined to be frozen with or as a monster. Regards Marty. P.S John Carpenter offers us a chance to look outside the box and think about what we see. I'll love to write a sequel one day.",

How right he was. From the very first scene, of the dog being chased and shot at by the Norwegian helicopter, everything is highly strung tension. The music helps to add to the atmosphere, as does the horrible isolation of the Antarctic (although not shot there) landscape. All of the actors - Kurt Russell especially - play their parts extremely well and the feeling of comradeship being torn apart by horror and suspicion just draws you further into the story (adapted from the short story ""who goes there?"" by John W Campbell. There is a prequel being made at the moment, detailing the events up to and including the Norwegians chasing the dog scheduled for 2011. I really hope this upcoming film contains some of the magic of the original.",

918,31 May 2018,Jarvis-5,9, This is a sci-fi/horror Masterpiece!,"Based on Campbell's book, ?who Goes There? and comparing it to Aliens, I would only say this; The Thing is far more suspenseful. Russell playing his opposite, in this case Ripley is more realistic while Weaver is more stoic. A sequel should be made. Russell and Childs as you know were still alive at the end but of course being in Antartica, there was no chance they survived? Maybe they did. It will take a good writer to act on this and add to Campbells original concept. Overall, this movie is much more intense than Alien. The 1950 version with Kenneth Tobey and of course, James Arness playing The Thing was a scary movie when I saw it the first time. It gave me nightmares! The Thing IS the best horror movie of all time.",

The direction and writing is first class, breeding an ongoing sense of paranoia and dread as the movie progresses. The cast and their subsequent acting is excellent and every performance is top notch. The practical effects are so good, that they still hold up today, showing a level of logical gore and believability that most present (CGI laden) movies cannot hold a candle too. All in all, John Carpenter hit his zenith here, it's just a damn shame that it was so unappreciated at the time.",

I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm surprised this film wasn't a hit. The dark, cold tundra is beautifully and hauntingly portrayed. There are no women in the film and that was a bit weird for me because I haven't watched a movie without female characters for a long time. Nothing is predictable in this film, the events twist and turn. The sound effects are really nice, just enough timbre to give it a long haunting feel. The other really cool part of the film, especially for the female viewers, was Kurt Russell. He looked fine! and with that rugged beard of his!",

It's just as great every time. If one was to describe The Thing with one word then there's one that fits better than any other namely, ""Atmosphear"". It's like being right in the middle of the movie. The minimalistic soundtrack by Ennio Morriocone and John Carpenter is awesome and adds a lot to the feel of the movie. In my opinion this is without question the best sci-fi-horror-movie ever made and definitively John Carpenter's best movie so far.",
923,12 January 1999,Psycho-18,10, Carpenter's best movie to date,"Many have written John Carpenter's version of The Thing off as an overly gory remake of the 1950's horror 'classic'.  What these people have failed to realize is that, unlike the vastly overrated and campy Howard Hawks version, The Things' scripters actually read their source material, John W. Campbell's classic sci-fi tale, ""Who Goes There"".  You will be hard pressed to find a film that remains so faithful to the text off which it is based. Everything is meticulously captured, from the utter desolation of the Antarctic to the grotesque, Kafka-esque imagery of the monster itself. The cast offers genuinely solid performances, making for a horror movie that does what a horror movie should: frighten the audience while having them sympathize with the plight of the cast.  Despite its gore, the film keeps strength in characterization, making death scenes and creature attacks more tragic.  Those who write this film off as an overly gory remake should learn what makes a good HORROR film and read the original story off which the film is based.  This isn't a remake.  It's Hollywood finally doing the story justice after its butchering in the 1950's.",
924,12 March 2001,Exlepper,10, An unfairly under-appreciated modern horror classic,This film has to be the greatest collaboration of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell.  The other films are great but seldom am I left with such an intense and disturbed feeling as I have when I view The Thing.  The acting all around is fantastic.  Rarely have I ever seen such a troop of men pull off an acting job that lets the viewer actually feel their fear.  The special effects hold up just as well when viewed by today's standards.  The musical score is the icing on the cake which adds an extra special feeling of dread and isolation. I love this movie.,

926,12 February 2018,byussuf,10, VERY GOOD,"The Thing is real classic from king of atmosphere, John Carpenter, and one of the most famous horrors which is, nowadays, a lot more easier to classify as a psychological thriller than a horror movie. The film is based on a novel by John W. Campbell, Jr., Who Goes There? and is often mentioned as a remake of The Thing from Another World from 1951. It is also a part of the Apocalypse trilogy which also includes Prince of Darkness (1987) and In the Mouth of Madness (1994). The film begins with a scene of Norwegian scientist chasing a dog in Antarctica. The hunt ends at the U.S. scientific station where Americans, of course, shot fissured Norwegian and saved the dog. They weren't concerned about why someone so badly wanted to kill the dog so they let him stay in the station. Soon we learn the reason of Norwegian pursuit. Norwegian scientists have found unknown being frozen in the ice and being convinced that it's dead they unfrozed it. The thing was alive and just like every other life-form it wanted to survive. Only ability the thing had is to imitate any life-form with which it makes contact. In imitating process original life-form dies. And that is the core of the story. Who's real and who's not? As a psychological thriller film works wonderfully. Horror elements fits perfectly and the atmosphere is brilliantly polished with scenery and music and special effects are pretty impressive for 80's. Many scenes in the film are still striking and recognizable. That's what makes the film special, but pretty much everything else falls under mediocrity. The cast led by Kurt Russell did a solid job, and for many people Russell is most recognizable as MacReady. Here we come to the big problem of characterization. It is not strange for Carpenter that the main characters are superficial and purpose of many of them is only to die. Almost every his story is successful despite this, but that does not diminish the fact that this is still a big problem because the easiest way for audience to connect with film is through the characters. Also, some characters must behave totally illogical for story to be successful, what especially in the modern era, is very annoying. But in total The Thing deserves a high mark. Especially because of the brilliant atmosphere and interest that it creates.",

Despite it's slightly cheesy title (although very appropriate), it is a truly amazing piece of work.  It builds an eerie mood of isolation from society, creates believable characters with plausible relationships, and generates just enough gore to keep you near sickness, but not pushing the envelope.  The gore is really a subtle fraction of the disturbance factor of the film. The real suspense/fear comes from not knowing who is human and who is an alien ""Thing.""  This paranoid feeling added to the remoteness keeps this film terrifying even twenty years later.  Although the graphics are somewhat dated, I find them more frightening then some of the available computer let downs of the late 90s and early new century (pitch black).  When did Toy story become scary? I really like Kurt Russell in this film also.  He creates this kind of ""bad-boy"" hero persona into his character that really makes you like him.  The ending is also one of my favorite moving endings. Does it matter if the other guy is a ""Thing"" or not?

The story might have been a stunner ""back in the day"" but to the modern movie fan it will come off like twenty or so other horror movies that have crossed the silver screen over the recent yearsand about a hundred other that went straight to VHS or DVD. Despite that it holds in there with a nice little cast of B+ actors led by the B one day A the next actor Kurt Russell. Fear not movie fans Russell was on one of his A days for this one. The movie itself is a quality production and will do your widescreen, surround sound system proud when playing the collectors edition DVD. The movie certainly has a couple scenes that are classic for the horror fan and that alone makes it worth the time. I won't promise it will make you hide under your couch in fear but its special effects are nicely done and you might find yourself uttering an occasional ""eeeuuuwww"" or ""Yuck"".",
951,10 March 2005,MAXIMUMMOVIE,8, Nicely done but wont knock your socks off.,"Most horrors and some thrillers rely on isolation to build the tension -alone , no-one to help . . .to save . . to consult. . to believe -this is a long recognised tool. Carpenter goes for the throat straight away his background music eerie comes up as the camera pans across desolate snow capped mountains the bizarre shooting at a dog from helicopter , the awaiting unknowing Americans at play etc. The comfort of the victims is stripped away by layers , they are alone without immediate help already ,the storm strips any hope of help away then they are denied the support of their comrades when the truth of the situation is understood ....alone amongst friends who may not be what they seem - paranoia even man's best friend cant be trusted. Solid acting from all, well shot ,method acting its cold!.It finishes without hope do they live , die , convert? I read somewhere that ""you could never put anything on film more horrible than the imagination could supply- and then they made The Thing"" . Its John Carpenters best film his more recent offerings pale shadows -please make something as inspired leave the safe Hollywood clique be dangerous again. I have watched it more than any other film .",
952,5 October 2006,lovecraftfan,10, The best Horror film ever,"Personally, horror and sci fi are two of my favorite categories, with my favorite film ( 2001 a space odyssey) and my second favorite (the shining) being 1 sci fi and 1 horror ( im assuming you can guess whoch is which) But out of all the sci fi horror films I have seen ( with alien, aliens, predator, signs, annihilation being some of them), the thing is unmatched. What makes it so compelling is one thing, its atmosphere. Watching this movie with its eerie, haunting score and the sound of the howl lf wind outside in the snow, you really feel transported to their doomed base, which makes the ensuing terror all the more gripping. Yes, alien did this well too, but that movies protagonists had that huge spaceship to run and hide in as well as those escape vessels, for the men at the research station in this movie however, escape is not an option. Furthermore, the xenomorphs from alien are more cool than scary, I had one as a toy when I was younger, curtesy of my parents. My parents, however, would never have given me a the thing toy when i was little.",

It is not so much a ""form of live"" as a ""life of form"" or rather a life as such. It is an embodiment of evolutionary principles, of survival and reproduction which in the case of the thing resembles reproduction on a most basic biological level.

This was not only a fantastic horror movie but it also popularised the horror sub-genre ""body horror."" It is fantastic in almost all aspects of horror. As I sat through watching this the first time, the tension put me in constant suspicion of who really was ""The Thing."" I was also constantly surprised when I saw one person after another reveal themselves. The atmosphere was also superb as it showed to you that there was no way out of this cold hell. It was also very violent and it certainly doesn't let down on the gore. Many a time the violence made you blurt out ""good god!"" The only drawback to this classic is the lack of jump factor in the film, but nonetheless it is a fantastic film. Also I recommend that those who enjoyed this film check out the play-station 2 game ""The Thing"" which although having the same name as the film, is a sequel in story terms to the film.

Not only for because it is tract by the Campbell's novel, but also for the cut that Carpenter give it. Few movie have its balance between terror and amazing for the unknow, between suspence and beautiful(and also mechanic)special effect! I think this  is one of the best example of the Carpenter's talent, and  I'm almost sure that he also think to the genius of H.P.Lovecraft for the structure of the storyboard. The end of the movie is very enigmatic and elegance (no good end), with obscure politically reference(like more of Carpenter's movie). Enjoy for all the S.F. fan who doesn't see it. Goodbye!",
958,6 October 2002,durante-luca,8, Probably the best(with Escape from N.Y.)J.Carpenter's movie,"This movie was a box-office flop and it didn't exactly receive a lot of rave reviews either. The ""Fat Guy & Skinny Guy"" (Ebert & Siskel) split on it - Roger liked it but Gene was put off by the graphic violence. Well, take it from me and Roger that this a movie worth seeing! Not only is it a remake of the 1951 classic, but it is also ""Alien"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" all rolled into one! Yes folks, this movie combines the plot of the original movie with a monster that constantly metamorphoses like the ""Alien"" and one that can also replace unsuspecting humans with perfect (albeit extra-terrestrial) carbon copies. In addition to being a great sci-fi/horror/action flick, John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" also has a great element of suspense as well: who is really human and who isn't? Only ""The Thing"" knows for sure as it goes about killing off the motley crew of losers and misfits forced to deal with it and replacing its' victims with perfect look-alikes! Needless to add, this doesn't make things any easier for our ragtag and mostly gutless heroes, who are at each other's throats every time someone gets killed since they all suspect each other of being the extra-terrestrial murderer. I don't know why this movie seems to be either ignored, snubbed or disliked by most critics and ordinary folks but in my opinion this is an overlooked classic of sci-fi/horror and suspense. Check it out!",

It's better not to know too much about the plot if you haven't already seen the film, but pay attention during the sequence where MacReady threatens Childs and the others that he will blow up the camp.

Unfortunately, that makes Aliens a bit hard to swallow nowadays (although, that one remains J.Cameron's best work).  With everything else being a 'Jaws' retread, 'The Thing' is a bit refreshing, using a plot line that isn't done much anymore, even with its over the top effects--an isolated, spooky bump-in-the-night story.  Carpenter does a delicious job of presenting enough shadows, questions, and uncertainty to capture the effect.  The acting is top-notch, with every character a level deeper then caricature.  But clearly, what everyone remembers is the best special effects scenes ever made, and stand-up incredibly well today.  The Thing also is a credible point in the war against CGI effects: imagine those gooey episodes today, with fake-o looking CGI, for example, as in 'The Faculty,' and you can see how the animatronics and latex still are the most credible looking effects that can be used in a film.",

Kurt and crew take the dog into shelter, and go to the Norwegien camp to find out what's wrong. Horribly mutilated (and mutated) bodies are discovered. And then all hell breaks loose. I won't say anything more, except *the dog is not what it seems*. This film is incredibly scary in it's themes of isolation, paranoia, and incredibly disgusting (but entertaining) FX. One of the most tense scenes ever captured on film, where the crew's blood is checked, gives new meaning to this genre. And when the THING attacks, it's never who you think, what you think. It is the strangest damn thing made for the screen, with *opening chest cavities, heads splitting apart to reveal jaws, and heads popping off, growing spider legs*.

Today I am 41 and it was the only movie until today that did not let me sleep properly... quite scared. When internet was available I used Google Google ""movie in Antarctica Kurt Russel, dog, alien"".
The movie is beautiful, we really feel into it. We feel their paranoia (who is who?), their loneliness and isolation. The movie since the first second gets better and better and has in my opinion one of the best endings in the history of cinema. Oh and the blood test scene feels so real that its we really feel the distress, lack of thrust thanks to the actors and director.
The visual effects are from the 80's but still very good for that decade.

The main thing that keeps the horror in this movie so good is the tension that builds between all of the characters (like the characters, we as the audience are not shown who is the creature until it's suddenly revealed to us and the guys in the movie and it's keeps us on the same level of tension and anxiety as the characters and it's so well handled with great scenes of dialogue and other tense scenes like the blood testing scene right up to the last scene which leaves you wondering g if one of them is the monster or not because this movie keeps you in a sense of dread and terror until the very end. This movie also contains some of the best practical effects ever put to screen (each unique look that the monster has whether it's the dog or on of the guys in the movie stills looks incredible almost 40 years later and it sucks that critics and audiences at the time hated it and it thankfully praised now) and all the acting is great (Kurt Russell is great, Keith David is awesome, all of the actors brought the right level of tension and dread to this film) and this movie is masterfully directed by John Carpenter (not just with the amazing cinematography, but in the way he keeps us as isolated in this facility as the characters because you honestly feel cold watching it and the level of atmosphere that this movie has is amazing.

This didn't look like it would be an iconic film one day, but it is now (try buying the film poster for less than £100). It wasn't a great film, and it still isn't. But it is a very good sci-fi / horror. Russell is a supercool ice-crunchin alcoholic. Something not nice comes out of the ice, and things start getting drippy and sticky. The special effects are ""no way man - check that"" quality and, for me, have never been surpassed. The imagination involved is pleasing, and there's some really good, tense drama. So, what's mince about it? Nothing really. Closest thing to it in 'feel' I would say is ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, for many obvious reasons. Both films are VERY 80's in style - wee bit clinical, with electro music travelling with us on our quest for impending doom.",

Could you come up with a better line than that? If you thought about it for a million years, you'd still be hard pushed. That's what ""The Thing"" is all about.

Definitely the best movie Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley have been in, and it features another great performance from Keith David, a truly underrated supporting actor.

Then a couple of weeks ago I saw it in a video shop and had to buy it. 5 years on and its still as scary, as usual the music is dark and atmospheric. Some of the scenery too helps add to the atmosphere and sense of isolation. The opening scene is ingenious, again it helps add to the mysterious atmosphere,then something goes wrong and they realize what the opening scene was about. Its a similar Alien style of letting the alien on board and now The Thing is in the base, thats when it gets exciting (excitinger). The Thing can mimic people and so follows a mixture of paranoia and incredible special effects.The effects are gory, some of them just really make you think ""Whats going on in John Carpenters head?"" They really are that weird, but then that only adds to the credibility of this alien in that it is so weird and well...Alien. As I have mentioned quite a few times this is a very atmospheric film, the music, the way its directed, the cold, dark, desolate feeling. The Characters too are very good, though MacReady(Russell) and possibly Gary and Blair stand out as some of the more interesting characters. If there is a flaw its possibly in the actual physics of the creature. The Assimilation process seems unclear, there is a vague explanation which having seen several times now still seems unclear. But this is a minor fault and really does no harm overall to the film. The effects at the ending are a real extravaganza, Russell in full Snake mode(escape from L.A./New York) delivers a crisp one liner before finishing off the Thing. I really liked this film, its very atmospheric and dark, the clever twists and turns are real edge of your seat stuff and the effects are incredible.If you want to be scared out of your wits this is definitely for you. The whole alien body snatching theme isn't that original and possibly the actual technical side of the Thing could do with some refining. Overall though a damn good film, a must for any horror fan. I'd say 9/10.",

At times the suspense is very high and parts of this film still make me jump.  I'm sure after watching this film, certain sequences will stay in your mind for a long time to come.

John Carpenter's best work, even better than Halloween. The Tjing is one of my favourite films, along with Brazil, Star Wars and Shinen No Samurai. The tension Carpenter builds up, and up, and up, until something terrifying happens, like someones head falling off, or a guy getting his hands eaten by a mouth in someones stomach. From beginning to end, it is a gripping film, starting with a strange chase in a helicopter, with Norwegiens attempting to kill a dog, to the end when MacReady and Childs sitting in the snow talking. The graphics are sick and twisted at the most pleasant moments, and that is the kind of thing I like. The only thing I disagree with is the dogs face splitting open. I am an animal lover, so I think that it should be them chasing a man instead of a dog, and that guy kills a load of scientists instead of slaughtering the huskies.

1053,7 August 2014,toxxicparadise,9," The Best Horror Film Of All Time, In My Opinion,","This movie deserves mention amongst the greatest horror movies of all time. It hits the right note on four levels: visual, aural, intellectual, and emotional. The special effects hold up as some of the most disturbing that have ever been filmed. They aren't quite perfect, but given the subject matter you will have a tough time thinking of how they could have been done better in 1982 (or now, in today's impressive but hokey looking CGI). The sound of the Thing when it screams in pain is otherworldly and memorable. The movie gets you to think about how you would react in this situation, about the ramifications of such a creature existing, and about what actually happened since so many burning questions were left unanswered. It also hits the all-time height of paranoia, where your best friend could have been taken over by an alien with no regard for your or anyone else's life, and has the ability to kill you and take you over with a simple and easy touch. And the only way you will know whether the guy next to you is the thing is by harming it, and therefore, releasing it where it will destroy what it can in self defense. The only way to kill it is to burn it. You can't wound it because it can quickly repair itself by reforming itself. You can't freeze it. It survived 100,000 years of being frozen in the ice of Antarctica. You can't dismember it, since every cell is a being unto itself, capable of killing and imitating its victims.",

But as I began to watch, I realized how intolerant and cruel the people were of the poor creature. When we first see the creature being examined by the crew, they appear to be disgusted and in shock. Why? Is it because it looks ""different"" or is ""ugly"" according to media and societal standards? So what message does this send to viewers? Let's torch and shoot something that we don't understand or consider to be ugly? One would argue that the creature posed a threat to the crew members as it had a taste for human flesh. But does that mean we should kill all apex predators that would also eat a human in the wild?",
1056,29 April 2022,MikeHeady,2, INTOLERANT THEMES,"Released at the same time as ET this is a somewhat different kind of alien. A remake of an old (yet relatively) good B-Movie it was modified by John Carpenter, changing the setting to an isolated Antarctic research outpost and upping the tension significantly. A thawed out creature that can ""assimilate"" and turn into whatever it touches hacks its way through an all-male cast. This actually works well with lots of angry posturing when nobody knows who is who they say they are. Class acting from Kurt Russell (in another anti-hero role) supported by a great ensemble cast, who work well together, and opposite the very good special effects (by maestro Rob Bottin) that convey the oddness if the creature itself.

1067,26 August 2020,glynnallerton,10, Will have you questioning what would you do ?,"My mum wanted me to get her some VHS tapes for Christmas. She's worn out all of hers. There's nowhere that does blank ones anymore so I got some movies on tape at an old Mom and Pop on Oliver Plunkett St. I of course picked some movies I like, Cube, The Thing, and Solaris(not really suitable to watch on VHS more a DVD title but the other two are fine.) I wasn't crazy about watching the Thing again for some reason and just put it on for something to watch over breakfast. But I'm glad I did! I suppose it was being a bit older and wiser that made me appreciate it more. When I was young I probably only concentrated on those gross-out bodily effects(which are still awesome although they have more a look of artistic sculpture to them now then real body parts.) But now I could appreciate every other aspect of the film, and it's all superb! The script is brilliant, the film grabs you from the very first scene, it's very unusual and arresting, a helicopter chasing a dog through the tundra, right away you're hooked, and it doesn't let up all the way to a brave and uncompromising ending. There is no fat in the script, everything serves the stories. If you want to know who the characters are just observe how they behave in the situation, there's no need to take time off from the plot to listen to MacReady talk about his time in Vietnam, we can see what kind of man he is very easily. Kurt Russel's performance, and every line he speaks, informs us. He is a hero simply because he does what he has to do, he kills a man(probably as an example) and he doesn't apologise. It's kill or be killed. He's ready to sacrifice himself to protect humankind but he doesn't make a song and dance about it, he has really one speech, it's only a few lines but inspires and says it all. The setting is wonderful, it's something we hadn't seen much of before and it explains how they're not able to get help. Not to mention the lovely juxtaposition of fire and ice. Also how great is it to see a group of capable, intelligent men put their heads together to meet the threat, instead of just being victims waiting to happen. Despite the large cast and the lack of individual attention, all stand out, due to the acting and writing skill. And those great names! If I had one problem it would be what I see as a plot hole, why didn't they bring Childs with them at the end when they went to test Blair. I understand they mightn't have wanted the thing to take over the camp but it seems like they would have all four stuck together. But a small point. All in all a great flick, one worthy of study in film class. Can't believe they didn't make a sequel!",

The characters are smart and the dialog feels real. While the characters are not as developed as they might be in other classics, they are real enough to be utterly convincing - some panic, some think things through, some just try to ride it out. A great deal of tension is built from the effective setting and the developing paranoia among the characters. The title monster is one of the best in movie history. I would love to see a sequel or prequel of this movie (about the fate of the Norwegian base), as long as it is done with the care and flavor of this movie.",
1069,17 March 2005,doug-oberle,10, 10 out of 10 for the genre,"Never has a lack of trust for one's allies been depicted in such an amazing way. The isolation of the Antarctic adds to the films ever increasing suspense that creeps up on you like a nasty tentacle oozing with alien goo. The effects are timeless and the actors performances are without a doubt perfect. The Flame thrower as a horror weapon is superior (it doesn't break the tension with loud bangs and works well only in close quarters combat). It even has an axe versus door sequence. As well as all that, you have incredibly tense scenes that make this the most awesome Horror film of all time, But in my opinion what makes this film truly great is the way that every member in the team appears in equal proportion to each other with the slight exception of MacReady (Kurt Russell) the main character.

1086,21 June 2009,dortak21,10, review,"John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest Horror movies ever made. This little seen masterpiece is often credited as being a brilliant grotesque piece of cinema, and their not wrong there. A remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks original The Thing from another World is often said to be a more closer adaptation of the short story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr. The plot for those who do not know is: a parasitic extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them. It infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it kills, and paranoia occurs within the group. Sounds pretty interesting doesn't it? The Thing is classified as a science fiction horror film, I would consider it to be Slasher film also. To tell you the truth, I couldn't find a single thing wrong with The Thing, its pretty much flawless film. Let me start off by saying that the cast is amazing, the acting is brilliant. Kurt Russell was born to play the role of our assumed hero R.J MacReady. Wilford Brimley and Keith Davids are also great as Dr Blair and Childs. The mixture of paranoia and tension between the characters is brilliant. A fun fact about The Thing is that its an all male cast, presumably John Carpenter wanted it to be more realistic. Let me just say that the special effects and creature effects by Rob Bottin are just simply outstanding, probably the best use of grotesque effects ever put into film, there just simply jaw dropping its hard to believe. Originally released in 1982 The Thing did poorly at the box office and was panned by critics, much because of the release of E.T, a movie that focused on a more friendly theme of Alien life form on earth. I could go on for ages on how The Thing is such a great movie, but I want to keep this review short so, If you haven't seen The Thing before then rent or buy it, because if your a horror fan, this deserves to be on everyone's DVD/blu ray shelf.",

Segments of considerable suspense, but with the suspense disappointingly released far too easily at the end. Great, convincing special effects but wildly over-used. Fine actors, acting well, but little characterization in the script. Large budget spent on creating a highly believable antarctic environment, but then glaring lapses allowed. For example, one character says something like ""Are you crazy? Go out in these 35 knot winds?"", and in the next shot, the helicopter is flying through a beautiful clear sunny sky with not a cloud moving. They get out of the chopper and MacReady keeps his hat on easily and not a lock of his flowing mane moves. Or to take another example, as some characters go from one part of the station to another, they cling to a guide rope as if their life depended on it, but there is plenty of light to see by and only signs of a light breeze.

1096,18 April 2017,pbpbsalamanca,9, Masterpiece,"Right well what can i say other than a film that is so astonishing it still holds its own 23 years after release. I had only ever seen this film once since last night, and that must have been when i was around 6 or 7, and i barely remember it at all, but what i did remember was how great of a film it was, so i asked for it, and did happen to receive it as an Xmas present the other day, and decided to whip it into my player at 2.30 in the morning, all the signs of a john carpenter film were there, the slow beat and already chilling atmosphere (Literally!) A film set out in the south pole and something there with them, how could you resist! But what i love about this film is how its done so different, they find out about this ""thing"" and decide to research it a little, they even at one point fly out to a certain area, i won't give away what for, but its not till one of the characters destroys the mechanics of the chopper they get stranded, but what i love about the entire sequence of destroying is how you second guess if he is doing it to stop the thing getting out or whether he is doing it to stop the people getting out, thats the charm of this brilliantly enclosed movie. The paranoia is high, even with the viewer, you question everybody's actions and motives, are they infected? Or just totally scared by this entire situation, a masterful scene is when Kurt Russells Mac-Ready is talking to the entire crew, saying how one of us is the thing, but is hiding, and doesn't want to show itself, and you see a stunning smooth shot of each man, and its surreal trying to pick out which one, as it could be any of them! And what supports this entire idea is the idea of being stuck in this Arctic station, i love nothing more than a film about a group of people stuck in a place with something outside trying to get in, but the charm of this is you have the same structure, but the thing is inside trying to get out, john carpenter directed the original assault on precinct 13, you can see he does like his enclosure movies, and i love most enclosure movies, from dusk till dawn, Assault, most Romero dead movie, etc, but this has to be the best one by far, i saw it for the second time last night and was truly captivated by the mood and atmosphere, its done brilliantly, and you want to talk about Special FX, forget all this modern CG crap, this is the stuff here, some of it is truly sick, i won't spoil it, but as the guy that did the effects at the young age of 22, he truly is a master and this is a sickening but lovable film, some great performances also, Kurt Russell really shines, its obvious this and escape from new york made his career, i just wish he would return to these sorts of roles instead of trying to be funny, he plays much darker characters superbly, i urge you all to sit down late on at night, alone when the night is quiet, and watch this, it truly is a stroke of genius, and one of those films that has made my top 5 best films ever list, and that says a lot because some of the amazing films I've seen, this does enclosure a lot better than most, it is also one of the few films that has furthered my ideology of just what kind of film maker i want to be, i love these sorts of films, playing with the audiences minds, letting you second guess instead of going for the cheap special effect, if i do make it in film, you better well damn believe i won't be doing anything generic, you could say for my age I'm very old fashioned and psychological, and films like these just make me want to make it more so i can possibly bring some of this back to the movie business, but overall The Thing has it all, and one of the most chilling atmospheres in a film, the lack of a musical score all adds, i am already a fan of the slow beat that remains, and watching this last night, has made another impact on what i hope to achieve in life",

When I decided to watch it again for the 1st time last year, i realised the true greatness of this film. I don't think anything beats in in the genre. I sometimes think of horror as a brainless genre designed for teenagers who don't have access to porn. But this is much more than that. It is, among other things about claustrophobia and natural mistrust of human beings to one another. The characters have a dimension and are not here just as an excuse for horrible monsters and gore.

The effects in The Thing are imho great for its time, but that's just it.. I'd like to see an updated version. Before Kurt gets too old.. :D",
1102,2 November 2006,tilltugg,9, Just a thought,"This is a very good film, it has everything, the ambience and the mood is terrific, and the monsters are very well made by Rob Bottin. This is John Carpenter´s first film in his Apocalyptic Trilogy, the second is Prince of Darkness and the third is In the Mouth of Madness, which are also very good movies.",
1103,16 July 2000,BlueTiger-2,9, Good Review,"I'm a big fan of Howard Hawks' version of The Thing (the first adaptation of the great novella, ""Who Goes There?""), but I believe that John Carpenter's 1982 version has unjustly been condemned as ""just a remake."" Carpenter resurrects the most original aspect of ""Who Goes There?"" in making the titular alien a shape-shifter... able to mimic anything... including humans.  Who's real?  Who's the thing?  These disturbing questions together are the driving force of the film. Couple this with Carpenter's superb direction (I defy you to find any film-maker better than Carpenter at the wide-screen composition), great acting (Kurt Russell is severely under-rated) and the most original special effects in any film I can think of (think Dali, then add more goop), and you have one of the best films of the 80s.  The Invasion of the Body Snatchers of its time.",
1104,29 January 2001,shannonhubbell,10," More disturbing than the ""original.""","I've always loved the movies of John Carpenter and this is definitely one of his best. A classic example of old school horror filmaking, a piece of work that some of the newer horror directors may want to take another look at and learn something from. (I'm looking at you Eli Roth!) On that note, how many other people were as disappointed by Hostel as I was? After Cabin Fever which is basically the bomb as new horror movies go, Hostel was basically crap. The violence was generally castrated, the direction uninspired and the screenplay had none of the fun of Cabin Fever. Yes, back to Carpenter, I remember recommending this movie to a friend who is a big horror buff and loves his violence bloody and nasty. He wasn't too keen on seeing The THing simply because he doesn't like 80s horror and the DVD cover did look distinctly 80s and shoddy. After tying him down and screening the movie despite his resistance all he could say was 'Jeez, that was pretty good.'",
1105,26 July 2006,d-young-2,10, Kurt Russell fights alien beasty in winter wasteland.,"This Amazing John Carpenter Masterpiece shows a terrifying array of practical effects used to chill you to the bone. The plot, which centres around scientist R.J MacReady who has to fight in the cold Antarctic blizzards against a shape-shifting alien, is brilliant. The blood test scene is a particular highlight, where Parker is revealed as the Thing. With an amazing jump scare, this scene goes from a mild shake to a guy's head splitting in half and eating someone. It's insane how good this film is when it comes to horror. In my opinion the scariest film, although it's gets to the spot of 5th favourite in movie history. But the ending shows that this creature will kill anyone, there is no escape.",

Definitely the best movie created by John Carpenter, this is a masterpiece, i love all about that, the soundtrack created by the master Ennio Morricone, creating a chilling atmosphere from beginning to end, all the characters and how their feelings and fears gradually increase, the feeling of paranoia not knowing who to trust, not knowing who is really who, the practical effects masterfully created by Rob Bottin, making the alien being very real and horrifying, deepening the viewer's visual experience. For me, this is a classic movie, i lost count how many times i watched and i have the certain that I will watch many more times! 1000/1000 for sure! Thanks Carpenter, for this awesome movie!",

And when I saw it years later I still found it more scary then any other film I had seen. Next to the brilliant special effects ( which totally do not look out of date compared to today's computerized stuff), it is especially the extremely claustrophobic atmosphere that is created by a cast acting brilliantly in combination with a beautiful, yet terrifying icy scenery and extremely creepy music (tones).

Just recently I was compelled to rent the video and to my astonishment it scared me even more then it had when I was little. The feelings of isolation and pure terror that are created by John Carpenter, Rob Bottin, and the rest of the cast and crew are uncompromisingly brutal and harsh.  With almost no comic relief, no feminine characters, and unrelenting suspense, Carpenter doesn't allow himself to get bogged down in formulaic plot twists or romance.  He keeps the characters clear-cut and simple, defining them by their actions alone.  The ""Thing"" itself is a gory wonder, and apparently Bottin, the special effects supervisor, had to check himself into a hospital at the end of the shoot because he was reeling from exhaustion.  The suspense scenes (like at the beginning of the movie when the dog is being chased by the Norwegian helicopter, for no apparent reason) work extremely well.  This is by far Carpenter's best effort as a director (apologies to those who think differently). Carpenter never relents in his suspense, and that is what separates this from most other horror movies.",
1111,19 June 2001,Laclip,10," Excellent, Unparalleled Horror","This was one of the movie options to watch for my weather and climate class, and it was kinda a no-brainer choosing it since it's such a highly rated classic. It was a great movie and about as close to a good among us movie as you'll get. It was a lot of fun to watch and really well made. Even though this has a 4.3 on Letterboxd, I didn't have a ton of hype going into because I've never heard anyone say anything about it. I think to fully appreciate it you'd would have either had to have someone hype this movie up to you whole life or have been born when it came out, and I'm not in either of those boats. It's still a dope movie and I'm sure that I'll watch it again one day. Enough with the plot though, we are here to talk about the weather aspects of this movie since this is a science class. This whole movie in a Norwegian research facility that is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by miles of ice and snow. There were a few snow storms throughout, but no major weather events happened. I would say that the validity of the weather in this movie is pretty legit. They didn't try to do anything to special so it was pretty easy to get it right. The weather did have a pretty big impact on the movie though. Because of the all of the harsh snow storms they couldn't make contact with any outsiders and they couldn't just leave their base for most of it. At one point the thing turns off all of the heat so that they'll freeze to death. Overall, it was a really good movie and a it had some valid weather in it.",

I sure, the main idea of the film is about how simply people can leave their friends for saving their own skin. But there is a thing that disappointed me: lack of a good soundtrack.
