0,11 October 2018,cricketbat,8, What a crime thriller should be,"I like it when a movie can keep me guessing until the end, and Gone Girl just did that. Most of the time I didn't know where this film was going, and each new twist and turn was a surprise. You can't help but get pulled into the story. The actors all gave excellent performances, as well. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at some of them the same way again. This movie is what a crime thriller should be.",/
1,18 May 2020,cmalpelli,9," Mixed feelings, hear me out.","There's no denying that this is a great film and from what I've heard a great book as well, you can see that I gave it a 9/10 rating, but there's a catch especially for me personally with this movie. The shorts version I can tell you and with my hand to God no lie this movie single handedly put the nail in the coffin for my marriage without me even being the wiser. So for as much as I do appreciate the detailed and intriguing story, watching it years later after my divorce it sends chills through my body knowing that my ex wife and I enjoyed this movie together, and obviously me not knowing just how much she loved it but how it inspired her to go about divorcing me in the way that she did, be weary because there are sick people (men and women) in this world that will vindictively assassinate someone else's character and well being just to avenge whatever perversion that they're transfixed on in their own mind. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I'm just stating a fact that happened to me, I don't advise watching this for the first time with a love partner, it could unhinge the mind beyond a point of no return, I'm absolutely 100% serious about this, this is not a joke.",r

3,7 August 2018,bgar-80932,8, Interesting end,This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.,v
4,22 April 2015,bowmanblue,8," Gone, but definitely not forgotten","Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material.

Then he goes home and finds that his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) is missing.

6,11 February 2015,Mr-Fusion,5, This is what the fuss was about?,"The more time passes since finishing ""Gone Girl"", the more the aftertaste worsens. It did its job in keeping me guessing until the final credits, but with that bloated running time and those levels of hype, that can't be all it set out to do, right? Affleck and Pike are playing such bland characters that I didn't care what happened to either of the Dunne party. I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was just a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that she was alive.",w
7,1 March 2017,zkonedog,7, Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery,"Its a little tough for me to watch/review ""Gone Girl"" seeing as how I had already read the book. For a plot that relies heavily on surprise and misdirection, I already knew what was going to happen, and that obviously makes it a different viewing experience. I was very impressed, however, by how the film was able to capture the basic essence of the Gillian Flynn novel (maybe it helped that Flynn wrote the screenplay herself!).",/

9,19 December 2014,avik-basu1889,9," All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!","I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. ",w
10,11 January 2018,Prismark10,7, Gone but not forgotten,Gone Girl features an astonishing performance from British actress Rosamund Pike as a former New York socialite Amy Dunne who one day suddenly disappears on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary.,3
11,4 October 2014,TheLittleSongbird,9, Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best,"David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",0
12,11 January 2015,Lejink,3, Real gone,"Hate to burst the bubble (IMDb top 250, average mark over 8), but I just didn't get this David Fincher thriller at all. With its combination of unsavoury lead characters, jaundiced view of television reporting and fantastical plotting, I found it unengaging, unbelievable and I'm sure many more ""un's"" I could think of if I put my mind to it.",9
13,29 March 2015,moonspinner55,4, Cyphers and story holes...,"""Gone Girl"" is so smoothly-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from the picture with nothing but admiration and praise. An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband's family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives now deceased, the couple's marriage unravels and, before long, the wife turns up missing (their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen). Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in ""Gone Girl"" to engage our interest except for Fincher's jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****",7
14,16 February 2015,dierregi,1, If you are blonde and beautiful the police will believe everything you say,"Gone Girl is based on convoluted premise: a psychotic plot to frame somebody for your murder. This deranged idea is not popular for movie plots and could have been worth exploring. It was developed much better in the great film noir ""Leave her to heaven"", where the framing was done in a subtler way. ",9
15,6 May 2015,johaschrei,7," Good movie, reflecting witch hunt mentality in social media/TV","I never wrote a review before in my life so please excuse my poor attempt, but after reading some of the reviews I just felt I had to give it a try.",6
16,21 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,6, Fincher makes this worthwhile,"GONE GIRL is another epic-length feature from director David Fincher, in which he gets into the nitty gritty of the material like few other directors can. This one's based on a bestselling novel about a wife's disappearance in which the finger of suspicion falls on her own husband. It's a good whodunit-style mystery which twists and turns throughout and keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments, but I did find it rather long-winded and suffering from a lack of likeable characters. In Fincher's hands it's an enjoyable film, and it's certain that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike rise to the occasion to deliver lots of intense character moments. But at the same time I didn't really feel anything about what I was watching, and some of the moments feel very artificial and contrived, as if they could only come from a writer's mind rather than happen in real life.",2
17,1 October 2014,trublu215,10, If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.,"Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",/
18,21 December 2014,BoxOfficeKid,10, Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again.,"The first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing, the husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers. To the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not the case with Gone Girl.",?
19,6 October 2014,Danusha_Goska,2," Cheap, Contrived, Exploitative","""Gone Girl"" is a contrived, exploitative, pretentious film that aims for the middlebrow audience and hits its mark. The filmmakers insert ‚Äì no pun intended ‚Äì a sex scene every ten minutes or so, and alternate those with buckets-of-blood scenes of violence, and utterly predictable flashlight searches for clues of a Nancy Drew level of sophistication. If you want to see someone stabbed to death while climaxing during sex and bleed out like an upside down pig, this is the film for you. ",r
20,8 November 2019,mellotr,6, It's all over the place!,"I love a good Thriller, and when theirs a really good one, it's a smart movie for the people who analyze the movie and didn't see the end coming, and continues to make you think. This movie falls way behind in that category. Really? Ben couldn't have just walked out? Court order for DNA of the ""Baby""? Their are so many holes on how she tried to frame him, I could rate this as Swiss cheese. It was interesting at times, and you did want to see what happens next. However that lead to a anticlimactic ending. It's to bad it had a lot of potential.",e
21,14 October 2020,Stephan_fr,5, Gone girl is actually good???,"That's pretty much what 99% of movie buffs will wonder when they see the meta score on imdb for this thriller. It's actually decent, maybe even good?",f
22,2 October 2014,eddie_baggins,10, Fincher has done it again! A brilliant thriller with outstounding acting turns,"As if it wasn't safe to say already, but after Gone Girl there is  little doubt or argument to be made against the fact that David Fincher  is one of the most consistently great directors working in the industry  today, for Fincher's latest efforts behind the camera with this  meticulously made, perfectly paced and often thrilling story is  movie-making of the highest order. Gone Girl (exactly like it's source  text) is a mystery/thriller that steadily morphs into what can equally  be described as a darkest of dark comedy, a searing account of married  life and an edge of your seat police procedural, all elements that  combine to create one of the year's best films.  Fincher from day one has shown an uncanny ability for visual atheistic,  haunting and atmospheric surrounds and with the help of his composers  (this time once more teaming up perfectly with Trent Reznor and Atticus  Ross) finely moulded musical accompaniments and Gone Girl shows off all  these skills once more. The suburban surrounds of the world of Gone  Girl shun the safety in numbers feel that they provide these residents;  it's not dissimilar to a world akin to Blue Velvet where beneath the  grassy exteriors lies deep seeded secrets that threaten to tear at the  seams of idealistic marriages and those double lives we people lead.  Fincher relishes every element of Gone Girl from the mysteries through  to the reveals and like only a handful of movies each year this project  feels like the perfect meeting of subject and maker who meet in synch  to create such a finally tuned product. Fincher really has become the  master of the thriller genre, much like Scorsese with his mob pictures  and after Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and  now Gone Girl, there is a legacy to his directional work that will  forever be hard to match much like Fincher's continued fine work with  his actors.  Much noise was made initially by rabid fans of Gillian Flynn's source  novel about the casting of leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick  and Amy Dunne but after witnessing first hand one of the year's best  double acts by the two on form actors there will be little doubt that  the casting choices were staggeringly spot on. Affleck is at his  polarising best at Nick Dunne a man we as an audience are unsure of, do  we like this man or do we loathe him? It's refreshing to see Affleck  put in such an assured turn, from inappropriate smiling through to  outright rage, Affleck's turn is an award worthy one that in a less  standout year for the male acting category would be a turn featuring  strongly come February. While Affleck once more showcases a talent we  all know he has, the breakout turn from Rosamund Pike is the films  largest revelation.  Finally given a chance to chew through not only a high profile but  layered role, Pike excels as the ""amazing"" Amy at the centre of this  twisted and depraved tale. Pike truly creates one of not only the years  but modern day cinemas most memorable and unique leading ladies, a  creation who at any given time can be compelling, outrageous,  disgusting and calculated, it really is a stunning turn to witness and  it would be unwise to suggest that Pike isn't now head and tails ahead  in the female acting awards circuit. Surrounded by quite amazing  supports from Kim Dickin's dogged detective Rhonda Boney, Carrie Coon  as Nick's twin sister Margo, Tyler Perry (proving there's more to the  man than Magdea's fat suit) as high profile lawyer Tanner Bolt and  Barney Stinson himself Neil Patrick Harris in a box cutter sharp turn  as creepy rich man Desi Collings, Pike and her on screen hubby Affleck  are encompassed around by one of the years strongest ensembles.  Without spoiling any of Gone Girl's many varied and unexpected twists  and turns (this is the type of movie best seen with as little knowledge  as possible), this is a movie thriller of the highest order that  shouldn't be watched by those expecting an everyday murder/kidnapping  mystery, for what transpires throughout this tale is anything but your  run of the mill narrative. One of the most involving movies of recent  memories, Gone Girl is bitingly funny, white knuckle tense, starkly  violent and as we've come to expect from Fincher, quite brilliant. Gone  Girl is without question one of the year's best films, one of the  year's most unique films and one of the films of this year that you  can't dare to miss.  5 Gummy Bears out of 5",_

25,3 November 2014,bmcdannell,1, Astonishingly bad plot,"If this had been written and played as a straight-out dark comedy - and if it had been at least half an hour shorter - perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie. But since it has been presented as a serious mystery, it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking - that of disrespecting the intelligence and/or perspicacity of the audience. For us, the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen - and we've seen many! This was even worse than Babel! That said - and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory - the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot. So ladies and gentlemen, start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity: 1. Amy buys a car listed on Craigslist for cash so there's no record of the purchase. How about title and license? Where does she keep the car until she needs it? How does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2. Amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sister-in-law's shed with them. How does she get into and out of the shed without her sister-in-law (who doesn't like her) noticing? 3. The shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman. They don't notice the accumulating gadgets? 4. The gadgets are bought online. Who is signing for them? 5. When the gadgets are investigated, whose fingerprints will be all over them - if there are any? 6. Desi is supposed to have broken into the house, beat her bloody and kidnapped her. There's blood all over the kitchen, but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7. As he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious Amy, Desi picks up her diary, takes it to her father-in-law's place and attempts to burn it in the furnace. Why? 8. How does Desi know where Amy's father-in-law lives? 9. Several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until Amy winds up at Desi's lake house. Can nobody attest to Desi's being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping Amy? 10. What will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11. Desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner. Did nobody at the casino notice them there - including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12. Where does Amy's car wind up? 13. Phone records I: Amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed. No record of that? 14. Amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy - which causes her money belt to fall off. This apparently was an Acme money belt on loan from Wile E. Coyote. 15. A couple robs Amy of all her money. Being the psycho she is, are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16. Phone records II. What is going to be made of Amy's phone call to Desi? Sure it was from a pay phone, but isn't it going to raise any flags? 17. Amy self-inflicts wounds - supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras - to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped. Yet wouldn't the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18. Amy winds up in the hospital upon her return. They put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her - but they don't bother to wash the blood off of her. 19. Do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20. Nick knows that Amy tried to set him up for her murder, thus opening him up to a possible death sentence. He also knows that when her plan blows up, she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her (other than being male) in order to cover up her actions which, until that point, may have been criminal - but not capital - offenses. Why does Nick elect to live in the same county as this woman, let alone in the same house? I could go on, but I realized before the movie was halfway over that I had already wasted too much of my life on it.",t

30,11 October 2014,banana-83,1, An enormous junk heap of illogic and nonsense,"One of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling I have ever  seen in my entire life.  ""Gone Girl"" gets its title I think, from the fact that she was supposed  to be done away with (murdered and disposed of) but is really ""gone""  psychologically¬óshe is a pure psychopath.  The movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent, and  meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it.  Here's the pathetic execution of her plan:  1. he leaves the house one morning, and she springs into action.   2. she breaks the glass coffee table, pours about a half quart of her  own blood in one puddle, in front of the kitchen sink. That much blood  from a violent attack would be all over the room.   3. she flees, leaving the front door open.   4. A nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband (somehow  the neighbor knows exactly where he is.) But no one saw the wife leave.  5. The husband comes home. He has not a scratch on him.   6. he is totally co-operative with the police.   7. They eventually find her diary In a wood stove at the husbands  father's house. The wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only  partially burned; it really makes you wonder how that played out¬óthat  the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed, all  that work, cleaning up the blood at home, but not to burn the book, as  if he needed to make a special trip to his dad's house to dispose of a  stupid book. and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one  page which he could've simply torn out.   8. When the wife runs away, she only changes her appearance slightly  and then, instead of secluding herself, she makes friends with some  low-lifes, with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on TV.   9. she murders the Neil Harris character in an attempt to switch the  blame to him. That would then imply he was the one that drained so much  blood from her back at her home, he cleaned it up and he put her diary  in the wood stove (?!)   His car wasn't seen at her house.   He then kept her a prisoner, starved and raped her.Yet she found the  opportunity and strength to kill him, but didn't call the police from  his house to come rescue her. rather she jumps in his car and drives  all the way home.   10. upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the  bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged  kidnapper.   11. There is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping  crime scene¬óhouse on the lake.  12. The hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform, underneath which  she is still caked in blood.  This movie is just about the lamest piece of S**** I have ever seen.",

I didn't feel the time at all and I was totally interested in every scene and every single detail in the movie. The story is beyond amazing and the acting was spectacular. So intense and it keeps you guessing all the time and what is more beautiful is that it makes you always guess something and then discovers that you guessed wrong. Ben Aflleck was amazing. I really don't know what to say more, I just adored it, it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. it that type of movies that affects you in a very beautiful and deep way and you keep on thinking about it for so long and could never forget it,",
37,2 October 2014,BrentHankins,10," Every single element is incredibly, undeniably good.","My first exposure to Gone Girl came when I devoured Gillian Flynn's  critically acclaimed novel in less than two days, frequently succumbing  to thoughts of ""just one more chapter"" and finding myself still  engrossed some 30 minutes later. With its captivating characters and  painstakingly constructed mystery, Flynn's complex, multi-layered  thriller was the very definition of ""page turner,"" and when news broke  that David Fincher was interested in bringing the novel to life, I  couldn't think of a better pairing.   On the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben  Affleck) comes home to find the front door open, the glass coffee table  in the living room destroyed, and his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike),  nowhere to be found. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer  Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) are the first responders, and they  immediately get the sense that Nick isn't telling them everything - for  example, if the living room was the scene of a struggle, then why  aren't any of the photos on the mantel turned over? That's just one of  several unanswered questions that begin popping up as Nick is  scrutinized, first by the police, and then by the media as Amy's  disappearance quickly becomes headline news. Nick certainly doesn't  seem like a guy distressed about his missing wife, and as Amy's diary  entries (presented as flashbacks) begin filling in some of the blanks,  we start to wonder just what else Nick might be hiding, and if he knows  more about Amy's whereabouts than he's letting on.  In a wise move that pays dividends in the finished product, Flynn  herself was tapped to write the adaptation, stripping the story down to  its most important elements while still maintaining the frequent  juxtaposition between Nick and Amy's conflicting points of view. While  some purists will complain that the film lacks much of the novel's  nuance and subtleties, it's hard to find fault with a screenplay that  was written by the author of the source material, particularly when the  results are so impressive.  Fincher's involvement is another necessary cog in the machine, as even  with Flynn's screenplay this film could easily have fallen apart in the  hands of a lesser talent. Never one to shy away from the darker side of  humanity, Fincher obviously feels right at home playing in this sandbox  and exploring the terrible things that a once-loving couple can do to  each other in times of duress. This also marks Fincher's third  collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whose original score  once again perfectly complements the visuals by accentuating, but never  overpowering, the on screen proceedings.  But even with all these elements in place, Gone Girl still wouldn't  work without being anchored by absolutely stellar performances across  the board. Pike is at her career best, particularly in the film's  second half, and should find herself positioned as a major contender  for this year's award season. Affleck is no slouch either, being tasked  with a lot of the weightier moments and nailing them like a seasoned  pro. Affleck expertly plays up Nick's winning smile and boyish charm,  but there's also an almost uncontrollable rage bubbling just beneath  the surface, and his portrayal should give those Batman v Superman  detractors plenty to reconsider.   Some audiences may balk at Gone Girl's 149-minute running time, but the  film is so meticulously paced that it never really slows down long  enough for moviegoers to glance at their watches. Each scene is allowed  just enough time to breathe before we're rushing onward, and every  single component is so incredibly, undeniably good that you won't want  to miss a single second. Pound for pound, Gone Girl is 2014's best  offering thus far, and should prove to be stiff competition for the  rest of the year.  -- Brent Hankins",

I normally trust that whatever movie has an 8.0 rate or more should definitely be a great film. Well, I hope this is the exception that confirms the rule, because this movie might be one of the worst I have ever seen. Why? you must be wondering. Because of the last 30 minutes. Up until that point I was really enjoying it, generally speaking. But man, that ending is appalling, utterly atrocious, and plainly nonsensical! A great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes. The only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society. The rest should go down the garbage shoot.",

From the off this movie was slow, slovenly written, tediously directed with some half decent acting. I just could not connect to the characters, which were just there to be manipulated by the writer(a theme of the film). Plot - wife disappears, apparently killed by her husband, who becomes increasingly under pressure to be arrested (media and a rent-a-mob crowd holding banners!). Suddenly big twist as wife reappears to tell her story, and the film drags itself to an unsatisfactory conclusion with the odd pot shot at the amoral media (TV actually). The plot of the first half owes itself to 40s noir with all those pictures with Barbara Stanwyck and Lana Turner in - now regularly revisited in made-for-TV movies. Then the second half turns into 'Basic Instinct' with buckets of blood, and the will she - won't she get away with it trying to drum up some vague tension. We even get a sex scene, where the wife's panties never move but she is being entered by a right schmuck. Another case of the star actress does not flash but earlier a minor actress goes topless in a fumble with the husband!",

Now, I'm not a big fan of Tyler Perry's films but his acting is good. He had a wonderful performance in this film playing Tannor Bolt, Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) lawyer. He was really perfect for the part. For me it was kind of weird seeing Neil Patrick Harris playing a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Rosamund Pike and the parts she were in were well done! I mean she pulled that roll off! Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) was allegedly killed by her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck).

50,18 October 2014,TheAnimalMother,2, The Worst Hitchcock Film I've Ever Seen,"This film wanted so bad to be a Hitchcock film, I thought I was going to see Ben Affleck in a dress by the end of it. Not that I'd want to, and thankfully I didn't have to endure it. However I did have to endure this painfully bad film nonetheless, seeing as how I went to see it at the theatre with friends. Anyway, calling this film the worst Hitchcock film I've ever seen is about as much praise as it's going to get out of me. Nearly every scene in this film seemed overly forced and ridiculous to me. The entire film felt like a sarcastic farce, as if the filmmakers themselves felt their audiences were just a bunch of morons when they made this crapper. Maybe they are right for the most part, judging by the ratings on here. Oh well, each to their own. If you liked it, you liked it and good for you. I for one felt it was one of the worst big budget mainstream thrillers I've ever seen, in fact, maybe THE worst! I was wishing I conned my friends into going to see The Judge during and after watching this garbage. Honestly, what separates this film from your average Lifetime movie? Not much, slightly better acting and much better cinematography, that's about it. I couldn't wait for this overly long and incredibly dumb film to end. It seemed for a while as if it never was going to end, and I was stuck in some sort of movie hell. Don't waste your time. 2/10",
51,11 March 2015,graestella,1, Agatha Christie for the Internet Generation,"The mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes, but I gave it a second chance as the mystery developed. The boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn. But Affleck and Pike were so cold and mysterious, even with each other, that it was hard to like either of them. So where was your emotional engagement here? Only Margo was remotely interesting. This film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed. This was a film of two parts. The first part ran through all the clich√©s of the detective thriller. But we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it. In Agatha Christie books, when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing. As things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario. Then they get caught. End of Story! In this particular tale it was the diary. Why would Desi have taken it to a house he didn't know existed, and fail to burn it properly, when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? The cops would have seen through that in seconds, and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled. What about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? The purchase of the car, the credit card purchases of the electronic toys, the puppets, the Treasure Hunt clues ? None of which could be attributed to Desi, so someone else must have organised or staged them. And just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? All non ‚Äì sequetors that made no sense in the end. Columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel. But the cops just let her off ! The non ‚Äì examination by the medics of the blood covered Pike was utterly ridiculous. This hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply don't look for them. Don't let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if I get run over ! She would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping, but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm, both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged. We also got treated to homages to Fatal Attraction and The Hand That Rocked The Cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane, not just confident and calculating. This is the old 'male gaze' all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without it.",
52,23 October 2014,sami-9,1, Sad Commentary on Film Today,"Thought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining and depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and men as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in blood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then giving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in blood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow her to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With great emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now.",

For the first hour I kept looking at my watch,it was so slow moving. Ben Affleck was average in his performance. The acting of Rosamund Pike was way over the top,even though she played a psychopath. There was so much sex,oral sex,suggestive sex in this film for pure shock value or maybe to make a boring movie more interesting. But nothing could help this moronic film.At the beginning I couldn't even hear the dialogue between them.It was so garbled.The plot was silly in my opinion. There are more fascinating plots in real life. And the men portrayed in this film are spineless weaklings while the women are tough and crazy.For example,the crime stories of killers Jodi Arias,Casey Anthony,and all the other crime plots on 48 hours or Dateline are mysteries which are fascinating,as well as being true.Thankfully,I had a gift card to this mess of a film,so paid very little. Why it is considered the best new movie out this week doesn't say much for the calibre of movies made today. Do not waste your money on this very bad crime mystery.Better to watch 20/20,or 48 hours at home. I like David Fincher as a director but nevertheless was extremely disappointed.The lesson here is don't believe the critics, audience and/or ratings all the time.

57,11 October 2014,rainbowpoet,1," A Cavalcade of ""Deepities""","I've always considered David Fincher to be one of the greatest directors of all time (though 'Zodiac' was a mind-numbing, energy-draining train wreck, and 'Fight Club' is one of the most pathetic excuses for brute-masculinity-worshiping, apocalypse-craving, self-righteous, pseudo-philosophical, sexist-in-both-directions garbage I've ever seen, and possibly the most overrated film of all time, though there are certainly a few other contenders for that title). Still, Fincher was also responsible for 'Se7en', which is, by my index, one of the most powerful, engrossing, genre-defining films of the last few decades, not to mention his relatively recent direction of the brilliant 'The Social Network', his previous stewardship of 'The Game', and his laudable work on 'House of Cards'. So I was relatively certain, especially given its largely stellar reviews and a personal recommendation from one of my best friends, that after I went to see 'Gone Girl' this evening, I would have, at the very least, moderately enjoyed it, if not referring to it as a ""modern masterpiece"". In the end, what I enjoyed most about it was the pervasive running criticism in my head.",

This is no comedy, or is it? So, what is it about David Fincher's movies that include some shocking stuff without shocking me. I can observe without participating. Cold, maybe that's it. The passionate story is told without passion but with a feverish attention to the cosmetic veil that covers or masks the real story. I wasn't bored, just impatient and a bit put off.

Many other reviewers have nailed the stupidity of the plot and the absurdity of most aspects of the storyline so I'll leave that alone. Suffice to say that at the end, I felt as violated as Amy Dunne claimed she was. I can't believe that such a large group of professionals watched the rushes and felt satisfied with what they'd created. Oh and about the foul language - how did Bogart, Wayne, Heston, Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Davis and Crawford ever make an impact without the filthy language? Oh yeah - they call it acting.

People simply don't do what the characters do, and I'd question anyone's grip on reality if they thought it was feasible. It's completely bizarre that what is effectively nothing more than a classy thriller is being deemed to making any comment on rape or domestic violence, and even more so to personally condemn the actors for being in it. I could perhaps get on board if criticisms of the book or film were made in a context of how Hollywood portrays rape or violence against women (and am sure there are criticisms to be made), but this direct personal attack on those involved in the film based on something that no one has claimed seems misguided at best.

The case arouses considerable media interest, as Amy was the inspiration for a series of popular children's books written by her parents. Although bloodstains are found at the housed, the main weakness in the police case is the absence of a body and the investigating officer, Detective Rhonda Boney, wants to give Nick the benefit of any doubt. When, however, the police uncover Amy's diary, which reveals that she was living in fear of her husband, Nick is arrested and charged with murder. ",

I thought Ben Affleck was just great, but he didn't get the Oscar nom, well there was just way more competition. The David Fincher direction is very noticeable in the film and he has perfectly made another dark mystery, making it more effective with every twist. Rosamund Pike, she very well gives the best performance of the year for a female, also just acting in general. This woman knocks it out of the park and she embodies the twisted, insane darkness of Amy from the book. Tyler Perry was a huge surprise of all and he didn't ruin the film and actually improved it.

Well maybe not the sidekick, he was cool. I just couldn't relate to all of the pretentiousness of the wife's family or even Affleck himself. I mean, I even hoped her parents would die because they were jerks too. About the only person in that movie I found interesting was Affleck's sister, I think her name was Margo. The movie just failed to hook me in an hour and fifteen minutes. No plot twist can recover the amount of boredom I had at the one hour mark. Plus there were some very graphic scenes that didn't really add to the movie (not all, some very well expressed how disturbed individuals were).

The best part is as Rosamund Pike does her character she is a total psycho. The ending is not with waiting for. I was hoping for great trailers but there is nothing there. My understanding is the person that wrote the book stuck straight to here story in the screenplay and that reminds me why I read so few books. This is not ""Oscar worthy"" in any fashion.

I cannot believe this is the shooting script they signed off - the amount of plot holes and continuity gaffes is staggering. I cannot believe that all these highly talented people agreed to be in this hollow piece that uses all of its 148 minutes to say absolutely nothing. David Fincher is clearly a talented director, in full technical control of the medium, but after watching this, and having watched most of his previous films, I have to conclude that his films very often have nothing relevant to say. Technical prowess counts for nothing if the film has no soul, which is what I think of Gone Girl. I gave it a 4 for the acting, it is the only aspect worth noting here. The end is absolutely appalling, character development is shallow, and that graphic extended murder scene was pretty gratuitous, horrid and unnecessary.

The characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by Ben Affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character, which again makes no sense.

OK even if there wasn't a note confessing to all the crimes and ending the mystery and the movie, still, when they found all that stuff in (HIS SISTERS SHED!!!) why would they not go to the police then, no normal human being let alone two would think that the police wouldn't find it or try to hide it for a minute.

134,14 October 2014,lesleyharris30,10," Intense and Beautifully Acted, A True Modern Day Masterpiece,","Gone Girl is an incredible movie with an extremely well written storyline and an absolutely outstanding cast. This film is easily one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen, some scenes are truly terrifying, mostly because all of the events in this movie could happen in real life, and the built up of suspense is magnificent. Ben Affleck does a fantastic job and this is easily a career highlight for him, and although these movies are nothing alike, it does give me new hope for him playing Batman. The best performance was without a doubt Rosamund Pike, her character easily had the best dialogue, she didn't seem like an easy character to play and she delivered her performance perfectly, she didn't hold back, she was creepy, disturbing and in a very strange way, very likable, I really hope this will change Pike's career for the better, she's shown here just how talented she really is. I think the film is formatted exactly as a thriller should be, starts off very mysterious without giving much away about the main characters and gives us more information throughout, without spoon feeding us, and the further it goes the more thrilling it gets, which is very pleasing. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris,two actors who I would previously only associate with comedy, actually pull off genuinely great dramatic performances, I was skeptical about them starring in it but they were great, I really hope to see them in more dramas in the future, also a scene involving Harris's character, which I won't spoil, is certainly the movies highlight, a beautiful piece of film making. Beautifully filmed, unpredictable, thrilling, mysterious and filled with twists, David Fincher and everyone involved in this deserves a huge path on the back for making what I consider to be the best movie of 2014, I haven't given a film a perfect ten out of ten rating in a long time, but Gone Girl deserves it, a must see for all moviegoers.

135,3 October 2014,Kmark1293,9, Another hit for Fincher,"Gone Girl was one of my most anticipated movies of 2014 and surely, this latest effort in Fincher's career did not disappoint. This gripping drama follows Nick Dunne as a husband who's wife went missing and the case is on to find out what really happened. Based off the novel of the same name, the screenplay written by the book's author, Gillian Flynn, is a well executed script for a big screen drama.",
136,22 May 2018,mariahopkins-18946,10, Gone Girl one of the Best Film!,"Great things were expected of Gone Girl seeing as it is directed by one of the finest modern auteurs David Fincher and he delivers. This is a compelling thriller based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. Gone Girl- the book was ripe for Fincher to adapt and it is easy to see why- the book is filled with unreliable narrative, red herrings and twists. Acting is amazing from the ever-reliable Ben Affleck but it is Rosamund Pike as the missing wife who steals the show. Fantastic lighting reminiscent of Hitchcock, a deeply satisfying narrative and expert execution of the material makes Gone Girl one of the best films of the year and a must watch",
137,19 January 2015,brchthethird,9," A cynical, 21st Century look at love and marriage","David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, and for good reason. He's able to take ordinary or middling source material and spin gold out of it. Such is the case with his latest film, GONE GIRL. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick and Amy Dunne, a seemingly happy married couple who live in a Missouri suburb. However, Nick's life turns into a living hell on the morning of their fifth anniversary when he comes home to find his wife missing, and eventually a suspect in her disappearance. In case there are people who haven't seen the film (or read the book), I'll stop here to avoid going into spoiler territory. The film, for me, is a success in every category. David Fincher has yet again created a visually rich and technically superb film that is beautifully shot. The performances were also incredible, from a perfectly cast Ben Affleck as Nick to Rosamund Pike as his wife, Amazing Amy. In fact, Rosamund Pike is a revelation in this film and, in my opinion, gives the second best female performance of 2014 (first place going to Essie Davis for THE BABADOOK). She does an excellent job at portraying a manipulative, conniving woman and Ben Affleck was perfect as her affable husband. It should go without saying that this film does not paint a pretty picture of marriage, and in fact is downright cynical towards it. In a more general sense, it takes a look at the facades we put up for others and the degree to which we attempt to influence other peoples' perception of ourselves. How much is truthful, and how much is a lie? To a lesser degree, the film also examines the way in which popular media affects public perception. This is portrayed in the film by a Nancy Grace stand-in, Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle). And, believe it or not, Tyler Perry is great as Tanner Bolt, the lawyer that Nick hires to prepare his case, and also helps him do some image rehabilitation. Overall, I loved the film's acerbic wit and satirical edge, not to mention that the story takes a number of twists and turns that you won't see coming. This is one of my favorite films from last year, and I highly recommend seeing it.",

141,21 January 2015,parleon-thedon,10, Gone Girl - Review,"Gone Girl is a very dark mystery film. It has all of the elements of a who done it story. However, this film has a twist. The film has a big twist; when the twist happens the film switches gears. The film is about two and a half hours long, but that doesn't matter. When I watch the film, I feel like time fly's, and I'm left wanting more... that's a good thing. The film is extremely fast paced so you're going to have to keep up. I truly believe that this film deserves at least three viewings for someone to really enjoy it. If you watch this movie again and again, then you'll pick up on things that you didn't know were there. The score to this amazing film is eerie and also haunting. I feel like the music really blends in well with the story and scenes being played out on screen. The performances in this film are a mixed bag. I feel like Ben Affleck does his job, but he doesn't give a Oscar worthy performance. I Also feel that all of the other actors in the film only did their jobs. However, Rosamund Pike knocks it out of the park. I'm glad Rosamund is nominated for a Academy Award. In my personal opinion, Rosamund Pike out acts everyone in this movie. This is Rosamund Pike's movie. Rosamund is a rising star. I hope she continues to get roles as juicy as her role in Gone Girl. The film is full of twist and turns and I don't think you're ever going to guess what happens next. This isn't your typical who done it movie. This isn't your typical mystery thriller. In my personal opinion... this is director David Fincher's best work since Seven. If you really want to be entertained, if you really want to be on the edge of your seat, and if you really want to watch a film that will shock you, then I highly recommend Gone Girl for anyone who likes to be surprised.",

This movie isn't based on a true story but it is based on a novel by Gillian Flynn who also happened to write the screenplay for the film as well, and it is her screenplay that makes the plot during the course of the movie much trickier than the trailers may lead you to believe. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne a man whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) mysteriously disappears from their home on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary and Nick promptly calls the police to report his wife missing. The police officers investigating the case are Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer James Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). At first glance the house looks fine but is then promptly turned into a crime scene and Nick becomes the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance, which always happens in these types of cases. Every person in the community is doing anything and everything in their power to help find her. The evidence is very incriminating towards Nick and at the advice of his twin sister Margot (Carrie Coon) he hires a well known defense lawyer named Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). After Bolt is hired Nick finds Amy's high-school boyfriend who is a man named Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) and asks him some serious information about his past which I will not reveal in this review. Affleck's performance is what makes this movie so much more riveting, as well as Pike's Oscar nominated work as Amy, along with Flynn's screenplay, Fincher's direction, and the score by ""Nine Inch Nails"" members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who won Oscars for Fincher's ""The Social Network"" (2010)).

I am a big David Fincher fan but this movie literally made me angry in the end. First to start with the positives. In the reviews, the appreciations were focused more on Rosamund Pike than Ben Affleck. I think Affleck was simply exceptional and perfect for the role. As for beloved Rosamund Pike, I will never watch her the same way I used to. The supporting cast played their parts well, especially Margo(Affleck's twin sister). Moving on to the negatives, which were many in my opinion. Not spoiling anything for the viewers, how can the authorities be so inept at the end? There were so many flaws in the story told by the one of the lead characters. It seems everyone was so frenzied by the dumb wit media that they forgot to check the facts. The kidnap story was complete rubbish; tying marks were not accurate with the story, nobody checked the alibi of the perpetrator, nobody focused on the history of the so called victim(It happened before, didn't it??) and nobody saw anyone leave or move. Finally, nothing disappointed me more than the the end. How can someone live with that? What was the point of all this? I love David Fincher movies and can watch his dark classics repeatedly.

I keep watching in hope, something interesting comes, but in vain. It's just so dead, empty & jumbled, that lacks everything. Oh, by the way, there are lots of mistakes, I'm not going to mention all, but a few, for example: she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood, telling the story that she was raped. And nobody cleans the blood of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with lots of cops, plus husband, lawyer etc etc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together. It's just an enormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie! Oh and movie is so stretched... It's 2:30 minutes of boring, uninteresting & unrealistic plot. It's as bad as Fincher's ""Fight Club"" which is another overrated piece of junk. Just avoid this movie, do no waste your time on it.",

If the concept of the ""faked murder"" appeals to you, skip this train-wreck and go watch Ashley Judd, Bruce Greenwood and Tommy Lee Jones do it somewhat well. It's not happening here. The hidden baseline is a parody of what TV ""reality news"" does to shape public opinion, most of which is consumed as the truth by the ignorant masses. That I can agree with. Heck, it describes all of politics today. But the story itself is such junk - especially how the cops are complete idiots - and this woman's crazy schemes are consumed as truth. My favorite is when the investigators who question her toward the end ""hush up"" the cop pointing out the huge holes in her nonsense story, because of all she's ""been through"". C'mon guys, you can't write better than that?? If you want something suspenseful that will exercise your brain this will completely disappoint you.

It becomes a mystery we want to solve when the protagonist's wife disappears and his own innocence is called into question. At its core the film posed a basic but intriguing mystery as to the disappearance; viewers certainly wanted to know what happened to the Gone Girl, whether or not the husband was involved and, if not, who or what was the culprit in the unfortunate incident.

Upon finding out that David Fincher was the director behind this adaptation, I was sure the movie was in good hands. I'm not going to review the book, but I have to say it was incredible.

199,23 April 2015,hou-3,1, Disappointing,"All reviews are subjective but I think it applies with especial force to this movie, and I can see why opinions are so polarised. If you are happy to leave your brain at the door and go along with the roller-coaster ride then you're in the right hands - a very skilled director and script writer, good actors and no expense spared in production. Start looking at the plot holes and the whole experience becomes risible - even for a thriller this one is totally over the top. That said, there are a number of specific reasons why I found this movie beyond annoying. One is the absence of emotional engagement on the part of the cast, because disengagement is part of the character of the two protagonists. The result is that the viewer looks forward to the appearance of the secondary characters, like Affleck's sister and the detective, simply because they offer a minimal amount of emotional input. A second issue is the long recapitulation of events narrated by Pike about a third of the way into the movie, which is basically telling viewers they've been fooled and stalls the action for, what, about ten minutes? Also incredible is the idea that a woman capable of such intricate and sustained planning could be hoodwinked by the trailer park villains - it was pure plot device. I could go on. Suffice it to say that this is the cinematic equivalent of a page turner, superficial in the extreme and really disappointing for fans of the director's movies.",

David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" takes it one step further, focusing on a married couple. On the surface, the movie looks at the wife's disappearance and reveals the wife's unseemly side. But the sensationalist media's targeting of the husband is an equally important part of the story.

As an actor, unless he's portraying a cigar store Indian, Ben Affleck should stick to directing....which he's pretty good at. Rosamund Pike was good but it is not an Oscar winning performance.

The FBI would not get involved in a case like this, the prosecution for the real murder would have been in another jurisdiction, and even if it were not, the last thing a burned prosecutor would do is let go of someone who murdered someone and tried to frame someone else.

Seemed to have some resemblance to the Lacy Peterson case, in other words lost some otherwise originality. So you know what is going to happen what you didn't know was all the details of why, which found dull, I like more of a traditional mystery/drama. Personally didn't see any academy award acting. The ending was way to far fetched, just absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just take a position of ""Oh Well"", the group grope to interview her was totally unrealistic, I really was wondering if this was such a low budget film they just didn't have enough funds to complete the movie and they had to jam multiple plots in a single scene.

In ""Gone Girl,"" each scene failed to supply sufficient information or motivation for what each character did next.

The satirical cameo critiquing reality t.v. and CNN is effective. There was other interesting stuff for about 100 minutes, then the film spiraled into absurdity. (spoiler alert- basic plot) This is the tale of a perverse and sociopathic woman who has spent years manipulating men. Dangerously -- for Hollywood -- her key manipulations involve deploying feminist tropes against men, the better to get away with the crime. Well, that couldn't be tolerated for long, so 30 ludicrous minutes are tacked onto the film, to make us feel neutral about her and less sorry for the male victims. Secondary plots are silly and generally pointless, and some of the action is pure varnish. Enough grandiose discourse on Gender is offered to fill a dozen college courses, which is why this will never be a classic film.",
217,8 September 2015,sickofenjoyingmyself,8, Entertaining thriller with fantastic performances,"I watched 'Gone Girl' a while after the initial hype died down and I found it to be thoroughly entertaining. As far as a mystery thriller - the way the storyline is developed and the acting performances give it a real heavyweight quality. Rosamund Pike gives an incredibly terrifying performance and the most memorable scenes between her and the superbly creepy Neil Patrick Harris are highly effective. Up until that point there is an undertone of dark humour reverberating throughout the movie and a slowly churning fear that begins to accelerate and turns to an almost delayed reaction shock fear that hits you when you realize how chillingly convincing Pike's performance is. Ben Affleck plays his part with almost equal aplomb and gives his portrayal an unexpected depth and emotion. This is also the first time I encountered the charismatic Tyler Perry and look forward to watching him again. Finch has created a semi undefinable movie mixed with brooding dark humour, chilling moments of shock and foggy mystery. The ending was not what I expected. But as in life - things never always work out the way we wish them to. Definitely a movie you could go back to again and again.",

If anything it might be more interesting to watch following the ""me too"" movement than it was when it came out just before the me too movement. Although the media focusing so much attention on this one story seemed more difficult for me to accept in 2020 than it did around 2014. There are just so many crazy news stories in 2020 that this sort of narrative doesn't seem like the kind of thing that could spark the kind of public attention which is shown in the movie.

Here he keeps us impaled on the hook through a twisting, thrashing, contorting murder mystery where nothing, not even the victim, is remotely as it seems. It's a great ride, one which delights in misleading the viewer into endless amounts of incorrect assumptions, while also managing to spotlight several timely, pertinent thoughts about the excesses of a 24-hour news cycle and the public's gullible yearning for their next big chance to cast shame upon a pariah. Gone Girl is effective, dramatic, gripping and entrancing for most of its duration, but does overstay its welcome and begin to unravel in the last twenty minutes. With most of the answers already on the table, it's strange that the film lingers for so long after the fact, neurotically toying with its own plot holes and giving its audience time to do the same. That's not enough to completely undo all of the good that had come before, of course, but it's plenty to cast a little doubt.",

While it might not top Monster A-Go Go (and nothing ever will), as a fan of MST3k, this is not a statement I make lightly. I mean, I don't like endings where the antagonist wins to begin with, but it takes more than that for an ending to genuinely anger me. This movie has the antagonist win for unbelievably stupid reasons. I mean, she tries to frame her husband for murder, which would get him put on death row, when someone else gives her shelter she murders him, but only after she uses him to get pregnant so she can guilt her husband into getting back together. She is unapologetic about all of it, and at the end, THEY GET BACK TOGETHER. And it's not even like Ben Affleck's character is just oblivious, he knows everything, right down to the fact that the kid isn't his! But he lets her get away with it because... I dunno, because she makes great gnocchi! Better answer than the movie will give you! Considering she admitted to murdering Neil Patrick Harris in front of him, Ben's character comes off as being literally too stupid to live! And you know what the worst bit of it?

From the opening shot, I couldn't take my attention off the screen. It is directed with a level of professionalism and passion behind every movement, sound, word, and frame. It's an extremely unpredictable and effective thriller which had me feeling incredibly uneasy and off balance, which was a clear sign of perfect filmmaking. The cinematography was gorgeous and every shot was either stunning in terms of framing, or mind blowing in terms of the amount of work put into the particular shot. The performances were amazing, and I was consistently taken by surprise by the depth and complexity behind the tone and portrayal of every character. Gone Girl had an incredibly well written screenplay for such a rich, authentic, and captivating thriller. This movie was presented with an artistic way of going about developing characters, framing certain shots, and building extreme tension and unease. David Fincher's direction along with the immaculate screenplay and rich performances made this one of the best movies I've ever seen. Although this movie is phenomenal and very well done, it's a disturbing, graphic, and violent thriller which is not much of a surprise when you consider the past work of David Fincher.

234,15 October 2020,jromanbaker,8, Sickening But Compulsive,"This review is going into a large traffic of reviews so my humble offering will probably go unread. As a writer who has a smallish following of readers I am used to this, and this is why I prefer to give non mainstream films preference, which includes a large amount of semi-ignored LGBTQ film, older films that have sadly passed over the horizon of time or quirky shorts that get lost in the forest of what we call film. This film I did not even know was directed by David Fincher until I found a slimline copy of it somehow lost in my collection. I hate the title. It is a come and grab me title and I do not want to be grabbed. A lot of Fincher's work have similar pushy approaches; ' Seven ', ' Panic Room ', ' The Social Network ,' and of course ' Fight Club '. The latter has for me an overtly Gay feel about it , and the content of that scenario can easily have a Gay interpretation. And now ' Gone Girl ' which seems the darkest, most pessimistic of the lot. The message I took away from it was that we can trust no one or know what twists of perversion and horror they are going to inflict upon us; neither should we trust our own for hell is truly within and can destroy our sanity in the process of destroying others. I noticed too that one reviewer had said it had propelled his own marriage to a divorce. I believed him and this appals me, but such is the strength and power of Fincher's best work, and this is an excellent film. But do I like it ? No. There is a murder scene that is sickening to watch and after the film's semi-long running time I felt numb. Fincher has a vision of darkness and often claustrophobic savagery and he convincingly draws you in. During watching ' Panic Room ' in an Amsterdam Cinema a large rat literally ran over my body in the darkness. I took that as a sign that Fincher is dangerous, but then quite a few of our best directors (usually of the past ) are. But to return to ' Gone Girl ' it twists like a snake, and even dead wood Ben Affleck gave a superb performance, but it is Rosamond Pike's extraordinary acting that sucked me into the whirlpool. To sum up - see it at your peril, and see it alone for it is ultimately about aloneness and what the world conveniently calls evil. It is a vision too terrible to share with anybody or be responsible for them to see it.",

236,3 October 2014,Troy_Campbell,9," Not classic Fincher, but still astounding.","David Fincher's resume is arguably one of the finest among those still working in Hollywood today. Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network and Zodiac are all modern masterpieces; his latest, Gone Girl, is not in that league. Yet, like Panic Room, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, even second-tiered Fincher is fantastic. His direction here is more understated than usual, the Fincher trademarks ‚Äì sudden outbursts of violence, grimly lingering camera movements, misleading shots ‚Äì only becoming noticeable in the final act. He wisely allows Gillian Flynn's flip-flopping narrative enough room to breathe (Flynn's script changing direction from her own best selling novel which provides the source material), the multiple perspectives and hidden meanings ensuring you never know who to side with. It's not just plot twists and turns that keep you enthralled though, Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are superb as the complicated married couple; their chemistry-turned- tension is scintillating. Affleck's career turnaround ‚Äì after three astonishing directorial efforts plus impressive performances in The Town and Argo ‚Äì is now complete, whilst this will hopefully be the role that finally propels Pike onto the A-list where she belongs.

237,16 October 2014,ironhorse_iv,9, Amazing Amy has gone it! Gone Girl has gone to great lengths to make a really good thriller.,"Ben Affleck's new Chasing Amy is a great 'who-Dunne-it' thriller! It's one of the better films, I saw this year. There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold. The film tells the story of a man, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) whom returns home on the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to find out, that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. What follows is a mystery full of twist and turns that would leave you, breathless. Director David Fincher and author Gillian Flynn really makes that connection. Amazing use of unreliable narration, plot twists, satire humor and suspense. While, the movie may looks like a Lifetime Movie of the week on the surface, the movie is way smarten written. It really go depth into exploring the psychology and the dynamic of a long term relationship. You really get the dark side of marriage through the use of lying, deceit, manipulation, and dissatisfaction. Not only that, but I love how much the movie really parody the media coverage of murder crimes such as HLN's Nancy Grace. Nancy Grace is known to jump the gun at times, when there is a high case victim allegation. A good example of these are the 2006's Duke Lacrosse case and the defamation of innocent suspect Richard Ricci in the 2002 Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case. She really often blames suspects for their crimes, with little to no prove of them, committing it. You really get the sense of defamation, and dishonesty that comes with being put in a media frenzy where suspicions are running wild. You really can see how Nick Dunne's awkward behavior could be interpreted as characteristic of a sociopath. This is Ben Affleck's best work in a long time. Still, the best acting is in the movie is indeed Rosamund Pike. She is just insidious throughout the movie. Very creepy performance. She will probably be in the 2014 Best Actress Oscar contender for sure. The supporting cast is a hit and miss. Normally awful characters actors like Tyler Perry & Missi Pyle are just god-awful, but in this movie for some reason, they gave their best acting to date. They were very entertaining. At the same time, other semi good actors seem a bit disappointing like Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-lover Desi Collings & Kim Dickens as Detective Rhonda Boney. Harris looks and sounds more awkward than creepy. Very unlike his character in the novel. Harris even admits that his scenes were some of the hardest things he's ever shot. For Kim Dickens, she sounds more like a country bumpkin than a smart detective. Nick and Margo's parents aren't given nearly as much focus in the film. Adding the misogynist father would be a little boost to the plot. Once again, very unlike the character from the book. How Faithful Is David Fincher's Gone Girl to the novel? Without spoiling too much of the movie and book, the whole third act is new, but still have the same character arch. Author Gillian Flynn whom help with the screenplay, wrote a new esoteric happy ending for the film. It's by far, a better ending than the book. I really didn't like the whole memoirs idea from the book, anyways. There were a few missing characters and clues from the book, that wasn't in the film, but for the most part, those things weren't really needed. The movie is more brutal in the violence than the book. The whole sex scene remind me of 1991's Basic Instinct at times. I love the symbolism of the movie/book. Gone Girl is a story about puppet shows. Somebody is pulling the strings on the other, forcing their hands. Punch and Judy dolls are used throughout the film. Another one worth notice, is the board games in the beginning of the film. Mastermind & Life are used as background props as Nick talks about his anniversary to his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon). I love how the 'Amazing Amy' children books are foreshadowing the events to come. You really see how truth and illusion are woven into the fabric of the plot. You don't know, what's real and what's not about Amy's past. It also show, how foolish people are to only look at complex things in a simple one-dimensional childhood black & white matter. I love the word play within Amy's romantic treasure hunt for their fifth anniversary that has double meaning. It seems like romantic charming quest, but like everything else related to Amy: it's two-sided. One side is sweet and charming, while the other is insidious and vengeful. Amy is a wolf in sheep's clothing to the worst degree. I love the whole 'Cool Girl' speech. The Cool Girl speech has divided feminists over whether Amy is making a good point about women not changing themselves to fit the ideals of men or whether she's just condemning women who don't fit her ideal of what is proper behavior. Some critics might view the film as misogynist or misandrist. I have to say the movie is both. Both main characters are not good people. So, in every way, both shouldn't be viewed as a hero figure. What I love about this movie is how much, it change the genre. Here, instead of the psycho ruining the perfect wife's life, the perfect wife is the psycho. There were some things that the movie could had work on, better. It could had work on, more on the idea of how economy affairs marriage. I rarely see it in the film. Another would be fixing a few loose ends of the script as some of the prep ups seem kinda unrealistic. The movie is beautiful shot. The Eerie electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross sound a bit generic. It's a disappointment that it doesn't stand out. Overall: A well-made film that would end up as 2014 Oscar Contenders for sure. A must watch.",

Granted that Amy was a troubled woman (we discover that when we find out how she framed her ex lover as being a rapist) but there was never a profound problem in her current marriage to summon such intense action. Don't forget that she officially and supposedly forever killed herself as Amy before she had to change the plan and she was not nobody but a successful writer from a rich family so if she was Amy the maid who wanted to kill Amy the maid after running away with some serious cash to re-invent herself as lats say Jane, I would buy the story. But Amy the successful writer from a rich family killing her name for a husband way inferior to her in social class, physically torturing herself, hitting herself on the cheek with hammer and to live in a cabin swarmed with bedbugs... that's just ridiculous! Nick appeared to be a good husband, actually he never wasted her wife's money as she claimed. All he did was having an affair which looked pretty normal given the state of their marriage. ",

254,11 October 2014,zetes,10, Enormously entertaining,"I stepped away from horror for a few hours on Saturday to see this. I wasn't particularly eager to see it, but the reviews were too good for me to skip. I must say, it's amazing. I always say that Fincher is a good director, but he's completely dependent on the material he's given. Fortunately, the material here (a novel by Gillian Flynn, with a screenplay written by her) is excellent, and Fincher paces it beautifully. Also backing it up wonderfully is another great score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The story shouldn't be gone into too much - though I knew the two major twists and still followed along with giddy enjoyment to every moment - but it opens with unhappy husband Ben Affleck discovering that his wife, Rosamund Pike, has gone missing. Evidence points heavily towards him, but he insists of his innocence. Soon the whole world seems against him. My favorite part of the film was the satire of the 24 hour news media. Missi Pyle is great as a loathsome TV news host obviously based on Nancy Grace. There are tons of excellent supporting performances, including Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, Tyler Perry (yes, he's good!), Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Fugit, Casey Wilson and Emily Ratajkowski amongst others. My second favorite film of 2014 so far and Fincher's best work ever.",

It was adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own novel. I was not entirely sure if I would give this film a 3/5 or a 4/5, but finally went for the latter as, despite its massive length of 2.5 hours, it never dragged the slightest. Rosamund Pike seems to be getting lots of awards attention, but I thought Ben Affleck was equally good, maybe even better as he, unlike Pike, was also in it the full first half.",
256,8 October 2014,Sergeant_Tibbs,8, Jaw-dropping twists around every corner.,"There isn't a lot that hasn't already been said about David Fincher's latest murder-mystery Gone Girl. It only took the opening weekend for film reviews everywhere to be saturated with the buzzwords that are most certainly applicable to the film's effect and atmosphere, but not necessarily worthy of hyperbole. I haven't read Gillian Flynn's novel, I bought it a long time ago but haven't gotten round to it. I know want to read it just to get under the character's skin a little more. The film excels when its getting under the characters but moreso when it's pure chaos. It has a lot of interesting gender politics about the representation of men and women in the media, especially under rose-tinted or poo-tinted lenses. Although Fincher's portrayal of the media are quite cartoonish - especially with Missi Pyle who plays it like she would in a more radiant comedy - the absurdism is part of what the film has to say.",

The acting and direction promised to deliver a polished thriller, with deeper social commentary on the media and its corruption of the judicial process.",
258,20 February 2015,hectorleetaylor,1, Stupid waste of time.,"I finally got around to watching 'Gone Girl'. With all the hype, I figured it might be worth watching. It wasn't. My opinion is that this movie fails due to poor directing, awful acting, lousy continuity, lack of plausibility, zero suspense. The biggest issue was Ben Affleck. Come on people, he can't act. He doesn't act. I believe he could be replaced with a cardboard cutout. Rosamund Pike was little better, but that may have been a direction issue. Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon were the only two that brought game. Spoiler Alert, in my opinion, watching this move will spoil your day. The rest of this is just filler.

Ben Affleck has some talent, but I've never seen an actor's talent meter swing so radically from one side to the other. There's no redeeming value or consistency in anything Affleck does.

Wether it was intentional or not, I soon got over it and was fully hooked after the mid point. The immaculate detail of characters and a play on who to trust and root for was amazing. Precision of the ending should feel unsatisfied but it's not, more on the contrary. This overall was a worth while watch, minus an odd choice of editing in the beginning.

There were lots of mistakes. Lots of unanswered questions. A tidied up episode of CSI it's not. But is that the reason we watch movies? For me a good movie is about keeping me captivated, entertained, and I need to feel something for the characters. This movie did that and more. Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon were very convincing as a loving brother and sister. Rosamund Pike's performance as a psychotic killer rivaled Glenn Close's performance in Fatal Attraction. While I would probably not hire Tyler Perry's character to defend me for murder, his performance was a breath of fresh air. And then there is Kim Dickens. She was soooo good as the lead detective on the case, she should have been nominated for an Oscar.

Fincher classes up this trashy story and it's both a strength and a weakness, as he wisely never lets this become over the top sordid garbage, but also never allows this to be as fun when it wallows in its sleazy storytelling. Even still, the story is so emotionally cold and misanthropic, that there's fun aplenty from how twisted and mean Gone Girl becomes. Ben Affleck does good work, under playing his role, while convincingly carrying the weight of the stress of his bizarre situation. Tyler Perry's dialogue delivery as a high priced lawyer is sharp and witty and pulled off with his stunt casting. Rosamund Pike plays our Gone Girl who you will most likely not forget for quite some time.

The stereotypes of the cunning women was unwelcome. Amy's sudden turn to violence was absurd. Prior to slashing Doogie Howser all she'd been guilty of was fraud. How do you go from fraud to cold-blooded (and very bloody) first-degree murder without batting an eye? Also, all the cops were skinny dudes with ordinary haircuts. Been up close to a police force any time in the past 30 years? They're all skinhead bullies nowadays, not clean-cut gee-whiz do-gooders like in this movie.

Amy Dunne (Pike) plays out like an evil breed of Annie Wilkes (Misery) and Holly Golightly (Breakfast at Tiffany's). Nick Dunne is a blank and lacking in personality. Yet, for Affleck, the character works. Nick easily becomes the victim of his own stupidity and his wife's cruelty. ",
284,28 October 2014,krzysiektom,8, good and thought provoking,"It is a well made and intelligent film for adults, bleak and pessimistic in its outlook on people, women in particular. Maybe it went too far in the depiction of a failed marriage and of two people who fail to live up to mutual expectations. There are countless marriages that do not work but usually people just divorce, they do not turn out to be cynical psychopaths, even if they hate each other. But then we would not have a best-selling book and a film. What I liked is that Fincher is not afraid to ask whether marriage is basically a trap for two people pressured by the society and religion to stay together at all costs. The film is rather mysogynistic, it dislikes people. The women come off as even worse than men, usually stronger and more manipulative. The only character which is pleasant and not dumb at the same time is the female detective. Her police partner is well meaning but dull and stupid, the lawyer played by Perry is smart but cynical. Nick's sister, played by the attractive Carrie Coon, would be nice if it weren't for the signs that she is in love with her brother (in a non-sisterly manner) and psychologically hung-up on him. The film also undermines the myth that a child is always a blessing for a marriage, here the child allows Amy to trap Nick in their unhappy and twisted marriage. The production values are high as in all Fincher films and Trent Reznor's music is excellent - minimalistic and not overbearing but always stressing the point.",

Rosamund Pike's performance is much more ineffectual and troubling; Miss Pike is clearly just as new to and unfamiliar with the character she's playing as we are. Rather than eliciting profound wonder at the impossibly fickle and treacherous mystery that is the scorned female psyche, Pike's portrayal only manages to provoke some mild ire and a lot of disbelief.

297,7 March 2017,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,1," Boring, Ridiculous and Shallow","I read the book and absolutely despised it, mostly for its cookie-cutter characters and the bizarre overuse of sexual dialogue coupled with an incredulous mystery that was more silly than engaging. I was hoping maybe the film would be a bit of an improvement but nope, not a bit. If anything the film is worse. Too many long, dull and badly-lit shots, too many stupid and weird lines (""cool girl presents her mouth for f*cking and shaves her p*ssy"", what the hell?? Now there's one quote that you won't see up there on the 100 Best Quotes Times Magazine List!), too many characters who you wanted to strangle, from the psychopathic yet pathetic wife to the whiny busybody nerd friend. A serious lack of imagination and a serious injection of pretentiousness that just comes across as very annoying more than stylish. Somehow this waste of Kodachrome (or whatever film stock they used for it) has an 8.1/10 rating, higher than masterpieces like ""The Killing Fields"" (1984) and ""Christine"" (2016)? How on earth did that happen? Is the review system rigged? If not completely horrible, Gone Girl is at best terribly overrated. I was not a fan of most of the actors' jobs in this although I think they were just trying to work with whatever material there was. The soundtrack is totally unmemorable and boringly flat, as flat as the characters and scenery. Gone Girl could have been something better than this, but it tried too hard to be profound and ended up just coming off as shallow, petty and pointless.",

I'm almost certain the man could tackle any project and create gold; for the record, I forgive him for ALIEN 3¬Öthat was ruined by the studio, not him. GONE GIRL is what happens when Fincher dips his toe in the genre of Lifetime movies. Not surprisingly, it's way better than it probably should be. I was raised in a predominantly female household so I am very familiar with Lifetime and its brand of ""entertainment"", and I can't stand it. When I first read the premise of Fincher's GONE GIRL, I wasn't thrilled (it sounded so¬Ögeneric) but I was more than willing to give him a chance. He did not disappoint. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunne. We're guided through the beginning of their happy relationship and follow up through their marriage and eventual hardship during the economic recession. Things in the Dunne household seem shaky at best when the unthinkable occurs. Amy goes missing one morning, on the day of their fifth anniversary. There's evidence of a struggle and fears turn to those of kidnapping. The town rallies around Nick as the investigation becomes a national spectacle, but the media isn't being too friendly with Nick's, almost eerily calm, demeanor and secrets come to light that paint him in a horrible light. As the story unfolds in Fincher's creative fashion, we will learn: did Nick Dunne murder his wife?",

303,4 October 2014,ThomasDrufke,10, I Felt Like Something to Be Jettisoned,"Once in awhile a film comes around that throws your brain into so many places that it becomes hard to come to grips if you actually like it or not. Don't get me wrong I liked Gone Girl. I think it's a brilliantly directed film. But this film also ticked me off more than one I can remember. David Fincher films tend to have that effect on you at times. And a sign of a great film is one that makes you think for hours upon hours after viewing, and Gone Girl does that. It's one of the most twisted, obscure, and disturbing films I have seen. But not because any obscene images or gross out scenes. But because it is such a cynical view on marriage and relationships in general, or even just the human brain. You leave the theater asking, do people really think like this? Is trust a big enough issue to where a sustainable relationship is completely off the table? First of all, major props to everyone involved with this film. All of the performances are marvelous. Affleck is at his best and Rosamund Pike gives what is most likely an Oscar worthy turn. But it's once again David Fincher who is the star of the film. Every scene looks and sounds beautiful (thanks to a little help from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). Fincher directs with such ease that at times you feel like you're actually observing these events happen in Missouri and not in a theater. A scene in particular near the end of the film that was so perfectly directed and looks so unbelievably real that it's hard not picture Fincher getting an Oscar nomination for directing.",
304,8 December 2020,paul2001sw-1,7, Fincher versus genre,"David Fincher is a skilful director, and his 'Gone Girl' is compulsively watchable. But the movie ultimately comes up against the limitations of its own genre. It's not so much a satire (which paints an exagerated portrait of the world out of righteous anger at how things really are) but rather a piece of gleeful cynicism, a tale of horrid human beings each trying to ensnare the others in their plot. As such, it reminded me slightly of Tom Wolfe's famous novel, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities', but without the associated social commentary; there's potentially interesting material in the strange life of its female protagonist, but the film ultimately reduces her to a straight pyschopath, which to me at least is not so interesting. The ending is also a bit anticlimactic, as if the story is one trick short of a full house. I enjoyed it anyway, but Fincher has definitely done more stimulating work elsewhere.",

Actually from the very first minutes of the movie you know that the wife is responsible for all what is happening and that she faked it all herself to make the husband look bad - as a revenge for their unsuccessful marriage. On top of that we have really, really bad, fake acting (especially Ben Affleck). The story isn't realistic and sometimes behavior of the characters or their actions seem simply stupid.

As entertainment, the film tried to maintain suspense but that vanished once the wife's role in the ""disappearance"" was revealed. Like the sexually-repressed girl in Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion,"" you know she has problems (in ""Repulsion"" the girl's problem - which led to gruesome consequences-was androphobia, an abnormal fear of interaction with men). You hope ""Gone Girl"" will end with the woman being taken away to a mental institution and when it doesn't you feel disappointed--but then that's how the author wrote the story. Another film along this line is ""Les Diaboliques"" where two women conspire to murder an emotionally abusive man only to discover that his body has disappeared and there are reports of him being seen alive here and there. The ending is a surprise, but unlike ""Gone Girl"" the key to the mystery isn't given away so soon, hence that movie qualifies as a classic ""Thriller"" while ""Gone Girl"" is just fodder for psychology classes.",

So we have a movie weighted toward an ending, deliberately bleak, clearly unjust and for what? For entertainment? Entertainment of whom, those who go to dog fights to see one animal mangled by another? This movie ought to have a special rating - for sadists and masochists ONLY - you know who you are!",

The plot has numerous weaknesses but generally carries itself quite well. I watched it and considered any number of ways the story would end. Was he really the bad guy and she a poor mentally abused wife? Was she a crazed psychopath who would kill him in the dying embers of the film?

There was a good twist in the middle of the movie, but the beginning and the end were just plain boring. I was waiting for the story to pick up and the characters to begin developing. About an hour and a half in I gave up all hope. The plot twist happened and then it died down again. So, after a painful two hours (give or take), a nice shot of breasts that I would have really preferred not to see, multiple sex scenes that were really unnecessary, and the surprise c**t word at the very end just for good measure I grabbed my purse ready to leave and the credits started to roll.

The mood throughout the film complements with the mysterious conflict and I liked how Fincher made the idea of the climax extremely confidential.

We saw a murder or missing first, then the process of solving the puzzle and the caught or run of the murderer and c'est tout. But this is not the whole theory of Gone Girl. It's not even its principal idea. It goes beyond a simple missing or murder. It is like the creators want to show you a big house, but at first they pretend it is a big room, not a house. The point is the film starts when we find who really is in charge and what really is going on.

After an initially curious beginning 'Gone Girl' then tries to be so 'cleaver' it falls over its own foolishness. It has that look, sound, and feel, of so many other 'deliberately controversial' productions that come and go endlessly. Writer, Gillian Flynn has fashioned a yuppie story - then crammed it with yuppie dialogue, as if trying to outdo the crass situations and vile language of many others that went before this over-baked trendsetter. Her central characters are all unlikable, self-obsessed 'it's all about me' types and much, much worse. Her partner in crime, director David Fincher (House of Cards) attempts to squeeze so much nasty sensationalism into each sequence that it leaves the thinking viewer wanting to run from the room screaming...the whole thing then drags on for almost 2 ¬Ω hrs with barely enough story to cover 80mins max. The too-dumb-for-their-own-good situations and unbelievable grisly murder set-ups are too dark to even write off as black humour ‚Äì they're simply terrible. ",
366,21 January 2021,RonellSowes,6, Modish Thriller That Doesn't Fully Deliver,"On the morning of July 5, Amy Dunne(Pike) is reported missing by her husband, Nick(Affleck). However, the police's investigation draws increasing suspicion on to Nick for the disappearance and possible murder of his wife. At first it only feeds you the information that the characters in the film know and as they learn it. All evidence points to Nick and that he is a murderer. But the film also makes him seem sympathetic and leaves an underlying inkling that he's actually innocent. About halfway through the film, it reveals what really happened. Because of the way its played out thus far, it fills you in in the most ungainly way. By simply having Amy narrate what she did, why and how; it isn't clear why she's saying all this other than to explain everything to the audience. This is one of the clumsyiest deliveries of exposition possible and certainly doesn't fit in a film that tries to be so sophisticated. But it's there to shine some light on the situation, change the viewers perception and it gets the job done. From here on out it becomes more and more apparent that Amy is a cunning psychopath and the villain in this story. This performance earned Rosamund Pike an Oscar nomination and also served as a sort of break through role. For fairly obvious reasons, she's very convincing in the role. Another performance in this film which is often overlooked due to Pike's, is Ben Affleck's. Affleck combines just the right amount of the flustered victim while not appearing entirely lost and defenseless. I might also add that contrary to the previous two are Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. Neither are particularly good actors and they aren't well suited in their respective roles either.",

381,4 November 2014,zardoz-13,10, Nothing Short of Superb!!!,"Watching David Fincher's deliriously tantalizing whodunit ""Gone Girl,"" a melodrama about a troubled married couple wrestling with compatibility issues, reminded me of the film classic ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946) co-starring Lana Turner and John Garfield. Turner and Garfield played illicit lovers who arranged the murder of Lana's elderly husband so Garfield and she could indulge their lust. Eventually, each had second thoughts, and murder reared its ugly head. In ""Gone Girl,"" Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike experience somewhat similar woes. They are cast as a husband and wife who have lost their jobs and find their marriage unraveling with ugly ramifications. They embark on a nerve-racking odyssey through Hell with more outlandish things happening to them than you can possibly imagine‚Äîunless you've read the novel. ""Gone Girl"" constitutes another Hollywood adaptation of a runaway bestseller. Happily, for a change, director David Fincher hired bestselling author Gilliam Flynn to adapt her own work. Yes, I've perused Flynn's masterpiece, and she has exercised good taste and judgment in modifying her compulsive page-turner for the screen. Basically, this Twentieth Century Fox film release is about as faithful as any movie can be to its source material. Minor changes occur, and some characters have been eliminated. Nevertheless, nothing substantial has been altered. In other words, if you loved the novel, you won't hate what Fincher and Flynn have done with it. As much as I enjoyed ""Gone Girl,"" I'll concede the novel is slightly better than the film. Principally, Flynn cannot translate to the screen the depths of Amy's subversive thoughts. Meantime, Fincher has done an admirable job of orchestrating the 'he said; she said' shenanigans of husband and wife. Mind you, ""Gone Girl"" qualifies as more than just a spine-tingling exercise in suspense and tension where the authorities believe the husband is the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance. This movie succeeds on multiple levels as Fincher and Flynn skewer gender politics, scandal-mongering television news personalities, marriage dynamics, and essentially society in general.",

Throughout the movie, secrets will be revealed and the unexpected will ensue as we find out what really happened to the wife and how the marriage already was. The themes of dishonestly, media and perceiving are what make this movie important to see. If there wasn't important themes, there would not be importance and the movie itself would not have been as good. This movie is a first-rate thrill ride that has not been done amazingly since Inception back in 2010.

Not to dwell but the ending was so disappointing that it reminded me of an old low budget horror movie from the 80s that leaves an opening at the end for a sequel that would end up even more underwhelming than the original. I am not recommending that anyone skip this movie, just cut it off around the 2 hr 20 min mark and make up your own ending. ANYTHING would be better than the ending that played out.

402,15 January 2019,tabuno,7, Over-rated,"14 November 2014. I suspect why this movie is getting rave reviews and good box office turnout is due to its sustained measured suspense as a dramatic thriller where the who done it element becomes convoluted and layered with great emotional intensity as the audience is seemingly and subtly manipulated throughout the movie as to Ben Affleck's character and the apparent absence and presumed demise of his wife. Things become extraordinarily complicated that gives the audience a continuous shot of neurological brain transmitters of titillating endorphins.
One other pertinent fact that impacts my own personal experience watching this movie is that living in Utah where Susan Powell disappeared who lived in West Valley City, Utah and whose body was never been found and Josh Powell, her husband, was suspected in her disappearance and who later killed himself along with their two children. There were many parallels between this real event and Gone Girl.
But perhaps I am getting old; and watching this movie I'm reminded of Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in The War of the Roses (1989). If the movie had stopped two-thirds of the way through the movie with the first major twist, I might have really enjoyed this movie in its totality, but it continued with this odd twist that seemed like a guise for greatest as a film. Needlessly the audience is forced to watch a rather predictable sequence of events that seem creatively amazing but somehow it just seems tacked on with the appearance of genius. I can understand why this movie would seem innovative and offer up some new revelation of the human psyche not see before on the big screen.
Perhaps its just I was unfortunately lucky to begin to put the pieces of this mystery thriller together too soon, but this overly long, in places overly slow paced movie became too predictable, foreshadowing its scenes and the ending. For awhile the plot and characters were fascinating, the plot intriguing but eventually, the movie just seemed very good. Others might conclude this movie portrays a rather unique, albeit rarely seen complex characters who diverge from the ordinary two dimensional personas. While this might be true, there is something off-balance but not in aesthetic way, but detracting way. What David Fincher is striving for is one of the most difficult achievements in film directing. His effort is commendable, if somewhat unsatisfying for me. If the movie had been shot in the style and tone of say cerebral spy thriller The Russia House (1990) or Ben Affleck's The Sum of All Fears (2002), Gone Girl would have come across more in keeping with the icy, frigid psychologically tension and dramatic tone of the theme of the movie. One of the best examples of this conflicted tone might be Brad Pitt's character and performance as scripted in Interview with A Vampire (1995) or his scripted performance in the dramatic crime thriller Killing Them Softly (2012) or even Nicholas Cages scripted portrayal in The Weatherman (2005) or Daniel Day-Lewis in the drama filled There Will Be Blood (2007). Even the classic bitter sweet relational drama and alcohol-riddled theme of The Days of Wine and Roses (1962) has the oil and water imbalance that however is deliciously sweet and sour tone that this movie might have been well to have captured. Or take Nicole Kidman's harsh but memorable role in Margot at the Wedding (2007) or her role in Dogville (2004) or what happened to Brad Pitt in the superb mystery crime thriller Se7en (1995). Other edgy movie themed and uneasy but dramatic riveting movies that capture the paradoxical tone of beautiful ugliness include William H. Macy in Edmond (2006), Sam Rockwell's fascinating character in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), the dysfunctional family of American Beauty (2000), or Tom Cruise in Collateral (2004) even whose title is reflective of the dissonance of a battle where innocence is destroyed. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in director Stanley Kubrick seemed to capture both the cinematic beauty and the uneasy alliance between the unusual, fantastic in an artful and sinfully beautiful way with characters that sometimes lack in moral turpitude in his Eyes Wide Shut (1999) or take the sociological business war with its incumbent cold calculating businessmen of The Social Network (2010). Even Leo DeCaprio seemed to capture the decadent attractive sleaze character in The Great Gatsby (2013) or his performance as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). What seems to be missing is the more balanced background of the development of the relationship, a better visceral sense of the characters as they evolve which is conveniently missing during the movie, except with deliberate shocking sometimes unflattering flashbacks which was seemingly achieved with one character played by Christian Slater in He Was A Quiet Man (2007). The real fault in this very difficult film is that absence of the depiction of the behind the scenes of the false facades and the real persona essences of which even the characters themselves are unaware so as to reveal the hidden pane in Johari Window.",

At first glance, it seems predictable, but in fact, it is not. It has unexpected... not exactly twists or turnovers, let's say unexpected situation development. Unfortunately, in a manner of many movies these days, a fantastic 90 minutes story was stretched and raped to 150 minutes and the final blow to the quality of this movie inflicts Ben Affleck who is lousy by default. I never saw a movie where Affleck gives a stunning performance and even my favorite ""Chasing Amy"" is partially ruined by his sleaziness. All in all, replace Affleck and cut it under 2 hours and you'll get strong 9/10. But this way... 7, maybe",
405,1 September 2020,andrewroy-04316,8," A well crafted, authentic adaptation of a fun, twisting thriller","Gone Girl is one of the more authentic adaptations I've seen, along with Silence of the Lambs. Both make small changes to better suit the film medium but capture the all key plot points and more importantly, the tone and intention of the novel. The plot is pulpy and nothing exceptional in Gone Girl, but the way the story unfolds and the details you learn about the characters still makes it quite satisfying. The book is great for all the small details that make the characters feel so realistic and that you can understand their psychology, and the movie here does a fantastic job of translating those nuances into the characters and tone via strong performances and excellent direction from Fincher. Pike is a standout and scene stealer, and the movie truly rests on her ability to effectively convey Amy's psychology. She's fantastic - if anything, I wish Fincher had spent more time with her and given more details about her mindset, especially how she really felt early in the marriage, but it still works as her presence is rarely on screen but often felt. The third act in the movie did seem to sacrifice a bit of the psychological delving that I love most about the movie in favor of hitting the plot points and twists efficiently, but even then it's all so well crafted (especially the one bloody scene in the movie) that I was engaged the whole time. Very well done, great watch if you haven't read the book but also really satisfying as it captures the essence of the book and translates it to the screen seamlessly.",

I have to admit that Bed Affleck is not my favourite actor and up until this movie, I didn't really think that he can act seriously, but he pulls it off. However Pike is the one who steals all the spotlights. She is great as Amy and how she transforms from the quite wife to the psychopath that was actually hiding behind her perfect image.

Interestingly confusing at first whether or not he is the murderer, but soon resolves that question and takes the story forward. The transformations of look of the wife is spectacular. Acting- A grade. Plotting of murder-amazing. Characters- believable, even the wife is relateable inspite her actions. What she wanted is what people want from each other in today's relationships. Marriage is compromising self to get the love of the partner, and wanting the other to be as they like, it's this relateable theme which grabs the attention on a deeper level.

Many of us watch movies for entertainment and some of us in the audience also crave escape from reality. If you want to suspend your normal/intelligent life, this movie (notice I did not say film) might be for you. Early on, I caught myself thinking of Ben Afleck as the new Richard Gere, a guy who made good in one film and has now gone on to star in B-grade flicks thanks to his looks, but that is a slam to Ben, who likely just needs a better agent or help managing his cash. The acting from Ben and Carrie Coon (plays his sis in movie) is good and the staging of a tired (TV drama) plot is decent enough. Sadly, as the action escalates towards a climax, it becomes far too obvious that the intended audience is the somewhat brain addled bunch who enjoys daytime TV 'talk' shows and hyped-up news shows which hype up crime stories. If you can suspend reality and forget that cops (especially detectives following up on a possible murder/kidnapping and rape) check for fingerprints, dig through computer/cellular records, and follow up on even small leads, you might yet give this 'roll of celluloid' a five or more of ten.

449,16 August 2015,Floated2,9, Brilliant Over the Top Thriller,"Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home one morning to find that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing, amid signs of a struggle. Scenes of the case, and Nick, being investigated, are interspersed with Amy's diary entries, which cover the early, happier days of their relationship, and the darker ones after the recession hit and things took a turn for the worse. While the movie sets itself up for a modicum of ambiguity, it's actually relatively straightforward once it starts playing its hand. Gone Girl was a novel of two voices; here it's a piece of one set of actions and one of narrations, a different representation of each half of the relationship. If Nick and Amy are dysfunctional at best, Fincher and Flynn are the actual dynamic duo that make Gone Girl work, having made careful decisions as to what to reveal at any given time.",

Acting was good, no doubt about it....plot was good but, boy, did it get bogged down in the last 40 minutes!

Every review I've seen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and I'm amazed that what I considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such impassioned opinions. The storyline of a wife framing her husband for her murder is a tale that has been told many times before (and often told much better, imo). The plot was far-fetched with plenty of holes, as many reviewers have pointed out however, although I wasn't ""on the edge of my seat"", I was reasonably entertained. The antagonist was definitely despicable and I was rooting for Ben Affleck's flawed, yet good, guy and his twin sister. All-in-all, I would sum it up as unremarkable - worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just want to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard.

472,7 September 2019,Emily_Baines,7, A movie for today,"Although this movie was released in 2014, it should be remembered today with all those #metoo floating in the social media. Even if this movie can tell us about the nasty side of psychopathy or the terrifying side-effects of being in the spotlight, what I loved most was that finally woman was not the heroine of the story.
Usually, the woman is the victim which will regain her power and show off that she was right from the early beginning of the movie. Let's take The Girl on the Train or even Return to Sender with the same Rosamund Pike on the lead-role. In both movies, men are the bad guys with no good sides. And women always win no matter that sometimes there may be some of their fault in the consequences. However, firstly, this movie evolves as something similar to the films mentioned, evolves as a thypical thriller about a woman who fooled a bad husband, on the other hand, soon the character of a woman-role gets a chance to fully develop. And we see that the actions have consequences. And it is a rule for everybody, not only for men. And if this is not enough, finally the psychopath is not so charming as in American Psycho or The Clockwork Orange. All of the uncomfortable moments are presented here as well. Thank you so much for this!

The movie begins as a police procedural complete with the ""victim"" voicing over flashback scenes showing the married couple's progression from young lovers to boring married people. The first 45 minutes play out like one of those Lifetime movies where it is obvious to everyone (even dumb males) that all men are assholes and deserve every bit of misfortune that comes their way. Around the 1 hour mark, the story takes a remarkably sharp turn and it seemed as though there was hope for it being a good movie. Instead, the movie devolves into a steaming pile of bullshit.

But nothing ever messed with me more than Gone Girl. The movie starts in a very mild and secure way. It introduces the characters on their good side. But the more it moves on, the darker it gets, the more tensed it gets and the more it messes with you. I think its one of the best character developement in cinema's history. The camera shots are impressive, the actors facial expressions are intense and disturbing. One of the most powerful aspect of this movie is that its hard to imagine any of whats going on. Many movies have things in common, but this one doesnt have a lot in common with any other movies. The characters are impressively unique and the plot is almost unthinkable to my opinion. The twists are so frequent that you never have time to breath. Like a lot of other David Fincher movies, it introduces you to a fake safe environement and slowly drags you into a much more dark and tensed one. And all of this very subtly. An other quality that this movie and other Fincher movies have is that you can rarely tell what is going to happend, its one of the reasons why its so hard to look away while watching this movie. The structure of the film was really well made so that it didnt need a plot twist ending. It is one of the most unique movie ever made and I strongly recommend it to dark movies fan.",

It's also quite long, rather dull despite its pretense to be a thriller. All of it is, in the end, quite hackneyed - all the characters are stereotypes rather than actual people, and it's hard to care of way or another what's going to happen next. The fault lies mainly with the scenario (I haven't read the novel the movie is adapted from). The whole story is supposed to be about ambiguity: whose fault is it when a marriage spiral downwards? Are we dealing with a disappearance, a murder, or something else? Can a normal-looking person be evil? This is the type of stories Patricia Highsmith, amongst others, made a living out of: just think of ""The talented Mr. Ripley"". But Gone Girl is just flat: the problem is not so much that the two main characters are not likable - they are much worse: they are not believable. And most secondary parts: family, police, media... are also caricatures, something created to fit the story purposes rather than how actual people behave in actual life. This is the stuff that makes acceptable TV shows on rainy evenings. It's not good enough when you sit for two hours and a half in a movie theater.",

The overall impression is that there's an awful lot of 'borrowing' going on. Novelist/Screenwriter Gillian Flynn has clearly been frightened by Harlan Coben who is genetically incapable of writing a straight-ahead novel. He gives the impression that if he ends a novel and realizes it doesn't have at least eight 'twists' minimum, he bins it and starts another. Nothing particularly wrong with this. I read and enjoy Coben. Trouble is all the twists tend to merge into one large twist and in a bookstore/library I often find myself taking a Coben novel I've already read. Time will tell whether or not Flynn will turn out Gone Girls like cookie cutters. Fincher, on the other hand clearly enjoys nothing more than holding Joe Wright's coat whilst genuflecting as Wright aims yet another few thousand feed of celluloid directly at the 'Festival' circuit.

Tries to be a parody of the modern world where the media subverts any notion of the truth but the characters are nowhere near defined enough and so we never buy in to it (well I certainly didn't). No real development behind the break up of the couples' relationship - one minute they're having sex in a bookshop, next thing he's lost his job and they hate each other. Silly things like the way the Pike character drops her hidden money during the crazy golf scene, the way she eats a lot and dyes her hair but still looks like the absent wife and the jelly baby scene with the lawyer. Very contrived - worst case of plot manipulation since Crash. As for Pike's certain Oscar nomination, it's a really bad version of Glenn Close's routine from Fatal Attraction; blank expression and the odd violent outburst does not an Oscar performance make. Best bit in the film was the mistress' breasts which were a major highlight considering the dullness of the movie - to quote the Pike character: ""The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.""

The way it brims with cultural ideas characterises it as a social critique, while the elaborate structure of the narrative deconstructs and subverts the murder genre it purports to be upholding. The same ambitions strengthening Gillian Flynn's screenplay, adapting her own novel, crafts a very long and complex film, which is uneven in the way it displays brilliance but also some stretches of tedium. An early surprise in the film is how reservedly Fincher approaches the genre. He rarely moves the camera, focussing strictly on the actors under the dim and minimal lighting. The pacing of the film is also extremely leisurely, particularly as multiple endings prolong the film's duration. The understated approach commits the film and Fincher's admiration for genre filmmaking. Yet as a filmmaker appreciative of the brooding, bleak corridors of crime stories like Se7en and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Fincher is not reputable for his funny side. The first major risk of Gone Girl is stretching outside the genre conventions, reaching for satirical targets and humour, painting the media as caricatures, which tonally jars with the seriousness of the story. After all, this is a morbid portrayal of a corroding marriage between Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) who were once in love but lost their jobs and their money in the economic downturn and became angrier with each other's shortcomings. Their relationship is shown through two threads: Nick's interrogation by the police as he helps them follow clues Amy has left for him after her disappearance and flashbacks to the start of their relationship, narrated through Amy's diary.",

Basically Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home, it is the day of his fifth wedding anniversary, he finds his home wrecked and that his wife Amy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Rosamund Pike) has gone missing, she is the successful author of the popular Amazing Amy children's books, her disappearance receives large press coverage, especially for Nick who is suspected of murdering her, due to his awkward behaviour. Flashbacks reveal that Nick and Amy's marriage had been falling apart for some time, they moved from New York City to Missouri after the recession caused both of them to lose their jobs, Nick became lazy, distant and unfaithful, Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) uncovers evidence that there was financial troubles and domestic disputes, Amy wanting to buy a gun, and a poorly concealed struggle at the crime scene, it is also discovered that Amy was pregnant, Nick denies knowledge of this. Nick decides to hire defence attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), who specialises in defending husbands accused of murdering their wives, they work to improve his image with the public, including potential interview questions, answers and expressions. Nick starting doing his own investigation to find why Amy disappeared, he meets her ex- boyfriend Tommy O'Hara (Argo's Scoot McNairy), who claims that Amy framed him for rape, and after the discovery of many anniversary presents in the garage Nick realises what has happened, through flashbacks it is revealed that Amy faked her own murder. Amy had been planning for some time to get away from her husband, she formed a fake friendship with a local woman to form a convincing story of abuse and talk of her fake pregnancy, she fabricated a diary describing her fear of her husband, and on the day of her disappearance she left behind incriminating evidence and deliberately clumsy mistakes Nick would make, Amy then changes her appearance and goes to live in a campground. Amy is convinced Nick will be convicted and executed for her murder, but she has her money stolen by two residents of the campground, the only person she can call to help her wealthy former boyfriend Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris), who Nick previously spoke to, she filed a retraining order on Desi for stalking, but she convinces him of her fear of Nick and agrees to hide her in his luxury lake house. Nick's twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) is convinced of her brother's innocence, Nick's student and mistress Andie Fitzgerald (Emily Ratajkowski) does reveal her affair with him to the press, this cause concern for his interview, but Nick uses his interview skills he has learnt appearing on a talk show, where he apologises for his failure as a husband, and he swears he is not a murderer, his public image is improved, Amy is watching his performance on television rekindles her feelings for him. Amy plans to return home, so she seduces Desi to have sex with her, during she slits his throat with a box cutter, she returns home covered in blood, claiming that she was kidnapped and raped, Nick calls her a bitch for her actions, but he is cleared of murder, Amy tells him the truth, saying also that the man she watched on television pleading was the man she wanted to become again, Nick tells Boney, Bolt and Margo about all this, but they have no way to prove Amy's guilt. Nick intends to leave Amy and expose her deceit, but then she reveals that she really is pregnant, using Nick's sperm that was stored at a fertility clinic, he reacts violently, knowing that the press will bury him if he leaves her, feeling responsible also for the child, and despite Margo's objections, he reluctantly stays with her, Nick and Amy announce the pregnancy on television, it ends with them in bed, him wondering what she is thinking. Also starring Patrick Fugit as Officer Jim Gilpin, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Missi Pyle as Ellen Abbott and Casey Wilson as Noelle Hawthorne. Affleck is terrific being charming while hiding resentment for what is happening, and Harris proves himself a credible serious actor as the mildly sinister old flame, but Pike takes the film with her superb exceptional performance as the psychologically disturbed bitch who will do anything to get her own way. I was told this film may not be to my taste, that could not be more wrong, I found it one of the finest films I have seen in years, filled with dark modern relationship problems and invasive press coverage to keep you gripped, and many unsettling twists and turns that will make your jaw drop, it is a brilliant mystery thriller.

It hasn't always been so. For a number of years, Nicky worked in Manhattan as a journalist, where he met his brilliant wife, Amy (Rosamunde Pike). Also a writer, Amy grew up in the area, with two somewhat famous author-parents, who concocted a young lady's series of books called Amazing Amy. But, the economy took a nosedive and both young marrieds lost their jobs. At the same time, Nick's mother got breast cancer so the couple decided to move back to the Show Me State. Nick opens a bar with some of Amy's trust fund while Amy ponders her next move. One morning, alas, Nick is called home by a neighbor, who has seen his cat outside. When he arrives home, Nick sees signs of a possible break-in at their abode and Amy is missing. That's right, she's gone, girl. Meanwhile, there are scenes of Amy writing a diary, telling the details of how they met and how blissful early married life seemed. She also notes that the Missouri move has troubled her. But, now, she's missing. The police have few clues but believe a media event to ask for the city's help in finding her would be the best way to go. Reluctantly, Nick calls his in-laws and they rush to town, where they make a televised appeal for Amy's safe return. All too soon, Nick is attacked as ""not sorry enough"" and is fingered as the likely individual responsible for his wife's disappearance. The only person in Nick's corner at the moment is his twin, Margo, who co-owns the bar. With an increasing media frenzy, Nick is in the hot seat. But, there's more. There are secrets by the dozens to be uncovered, some for Nick and some big ones for Amy. What appears to be a kidnapping may be something else. Will she be coming home? Will Nick be sent to the slammer? This brilliant, engrossing thriller cannot be talked about in detail; otherwise, the twists are revealed. Let's just say ""what lies beneath"" may not be pretty. The cast is stunning, with Affleck and Pike doing grand work while Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens, and all of the others are fantastic, too. The watery setting is likewise intriguing. But, its the story, script, and direction that towers above everything else. Gillian Flynn, who wrote the novel, has fashioned a script that mirrors the book and is quite wonderful. As for the direction, David Fincher (with great editing, too) keeps the relentless pace and mystery in every moment. Equally good is his camera shots, opting to fade in and out with visual power.

One has seen this before - one of Fincher's influences, Kubrick, certainly had that with Eyes Wide Shut in a way - and will again in movies and fiction.

",
549,22 November 2014,khanbaliq2,8," Gone Girl is disturbing, yet undeniably entertaining.","When going to see this film I had no idea what it's about or what it'll be like. I only knew that David ""Seven"" Fincher is the director of the film. Two things become clear when you're watching Gone Girl - it's surprisingly entertaining and it's for adults. Only adults will appreciate the clever humor and characterization in this film. Most people have been raving about how good Rosamund Pike is in Gone Girl. She's definitely good but, in my opinion, Ben Affleck is the one who provides the best performance. In fact, casting him was a brilliant move. Affleck does expert work as the ""lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious"" Nick Dunne. With his excellent performance Affleck carries most of the film, especially the first half. The scenes that Affleck shares with Carrie Coon, who plays Nick's twin sister Margo, are some of the best in the film, easing the tension that's been building up. Coon is very good, as is the rest of the cast. Rosamund Pike, playing Nick's missing wife Amy, sure does deserve the praise that she's been given by critics. Pay attention to her facial expressions, especially in the second half of the film. Her attention to detail is commendable. She practically makes every second worthwhile. I've watched the cast interviews on the internet, and author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn has pointed this out too. I generally like British actresses, even if they are from the establishment. Pike looked terrific in her first film, the entertaining but ridiculous Die Another Day (2002), and she's delivered good performances in other films, like Barney's Version (2010) and Pride & Prejudice (2005). Pike is bewitching in the film, especially in the first half, but when it comes time to show ""amazing Amy's"" or rather ""pretending Amy's"" mental imbalance she's frightening. Even Tyler Perry delivers his first solid performance as Nick's attorney Tanner Bolt. The plot of Gone Girl is similar to a number of Alfred Hitchcock's films. In this mystery thriller a man is accused, maybe falsely, of a crime. What follows is compelling and often unexpected, as Fincher and Affleck examine dishonesty, the media, the economy's effects on marriage, and the way people perceive one another. For some time I couldn't figure out what the establishment message of Gone Girl is. But when I was writing this review it finally hit me - the message is that marriage is a difficult and unpleasant affair, especially after the initial ""good"" days have passed. Still, I recommend this film even if it does have this anti-marriage message. It's Fincher's most entertaining release yet.",
550,4 October 2014,dstafursky,5, Are you serious about that ending!!!,"To start with, the acting was phenomenal. The setting and editing was great. The movie built up rather nicely to the point of his wife revealing that she is truly an evil revengeful person. I seriously thought it was going to come to an end at the lake house when the past boyfriend would turn her in. At least that is what SHOULD have happened.

554,11 October 2014,matthewssilverhammer,8, Too Big and Imposing an Effort to Ignore,"To describe the plot of Gone Girl as ""nuts"" would be more than precise. Starting as a fairly rudimentary mystery, it becomes a twisting, twisted study of marital vows that keeps you guessing¬Öand rarely accurately. Do not be fooled, however; GG has problems. First, its identity: Is it a tense mystery, a comedic satire of media, a critique of the American family, or a messy mix of all of those? Second, its message: To say that the film has a pessimistic view of marriage is an understatement. Nonetheless, when focused on its strengths (enigmatic plotting, tense character arcs), GG will twist your heart right into your throat. The plot is impossible to fully describe spoiler-free. At its base, it's the story of a husband reeling from the disappearance of his wife and his own accused involvement. Other than some jarring overacting (ie ""Nancy Grace""-inspired pundit, crazed neighbor), the performances are strong. Affleck is a protagonist that's hard to root for, but I'm not sure we're really being asked to. He does a commendable job, leading us to analyze his every decision. There are stellar performances by Coon as Affleck's sister, Dickens as the detective, and Perry as the Cochran-like defense lawyer. The breakout however, and clear Oscar front-runner, is Pike, turning in a complex and disciplined performance as the titular Gone Girl. Fincher is a darkly-visionary director, and his murky eye is ever-present in this brooding universe. It only falters when he reaches to play in sweetness and wit, confusing the tone. Overall though, GG is a dark, foreboding crime-thriller that is much too big and imposing to ignore.",

On the other hand, guys will find ""Amazing Amy's"" Hijinks hoot-out-loud entertaining. (A little hint for any cerebral viewers: novelist\screenwriter Gillian Flynn couldn't possibly mean anyone to see any aspect of verisimilitude between Real Life and any events or characters in this tall tale, so she obviously means it to be taken allegorically, with ""Amazing Amy"" being George W. Bush and Suffering Nick a stand-in for Barack Obama.) Since IMDb says this comment is too short so far to be acceptable, I'll simply add a thank you to My Own Personal Gone Girl, who picked me up a while back as I was desperately hitch-hiking during an ice storm from Marquette, MI to Cape Giradeau, MO--where much of GONE GIRL was shot, jogging my memory.

Gone passion. Gone freedom. Director David Fincher creates another dark and disturbing thriller about a marriage void of feeling. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, husband cheating with a much younger woman. He co-owns a bar with his twin sister. His wife, Amy, is played by Rosamund Pike, a writer known as Amazing Amy. She sees her marriage slipping away and the passion drained. Central plot regards Nick arriving home to vandalism and his wife missing. Speculations circle around Nick's less than sympathetic presentation and a police investigation with baffled reactions. Fincher is one of the finest directors of his generation with films such as The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The screenplay is presented in clues, much to Affleck's dismay when dealing with the wayward manner beneath the vision of the law. The ending may be problematic to some seeking a peaceful resolution. Affleck plays off the frustrated persona of a husband restrained by feelings that aren't surfacing properly for anyone. Pike delivers one of her best performances as a wife under change and strain. Neil Patrick Harris plays an Amazing Amy stalker with a past given and a present of opportunity. Tyler Perry steals moments as a hot shot lawyer willing to represent Affleck. Carrie Coon is an emotional centre as his twin sister, a voice of reason who spirals into this tabloid nightmare as well. Its theme regards living with our choices and dealing with mistakes that render all good memories gone. Score: 8 / 10",

With this latest ""Gone Girl"" which is based on a best selling novel it's a good suspense mystery tease. The acting and chemistry is top notch with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as married couple Nick and Amy. It seems as if they are the power couple as they have money, love and success from their writing jobs as both are educated with wit and books. Still behind the scenes lies drama and hidden skeletons in the closets of both and when the 5 year anniversary hits Amy vanishes from their home, and strange clues are left behind and then the hype and drama builds thru the police and media around the case as people think that Nick killed and did away with his wife! Fincher does a good job of drawing the film out with discovery and drama build up as it leads to more tension and much of the film is told thru flashback.

This is object of a criminal investigation by the police during which several odd aspects of their marriage are revealed including Nick's infidelity with a young girl. The investigation leads to a murder suspicion falling upon Nick. But from a certain moment on the movie unfolds itself in two alternate sequences in a vivid rhythm: one around Nick and the investigation and the other one around Emy that is alive and running away to disappear and revenge herself by creating a scenery that would lead to Nick's conviction for her supposed murder. This is well told in images and dialogues and has good dramatic scenes and ends up more or less suddenly with a real murder committed by Amy on a former lover which she misrepresents as legitimate defence of a sexual assault. This changes her revenge course and the movie ends with them back together though not in a very harmonious mood. Not a very good ending according to normal moral patterns but this is a movie and not a moral lesson. Not a masterpiece but a movie worth to be seen anyway.,

The movie has a thoroughly lethargic pace holding the viewer at arms length for much of its 149 minute (too long) running time, with this vibration certainly supported by an opening hour suffering from a scarcity of electrifying moments. It's certainly clear that the flick benefits from David Fincher's typically meticulous sense of style. There are, it has to be said, a few stretches heightened by Fincher's directorial style. However the prolonged finale ultimately confirms Gone Girl's place as an entertaining but relentlessly padded-out piece of work, and it is now difficult to imagine that Fincher's output will ever again reach the heights of early efforts like Se7en and The Game.",

None of the characters were particularly likable and i found the casting of the twin sister odd as they looked nothing alike and she looks about ten years younger than him (i looked because it bugged me and she is actually nine years younger so this is really poor casting). I was getting infuriated by the old slipping out of the back doors without anyone noticing, i mean, really, twenty news trucks out the front door and not one thinks to sit out back, come on people!

583,2 February 2015,j-penkair,8, Human Is Horror,"I am a fan of horror films, but this drama / thriller manages to be scarier and more horrifying than the branded horror ones. It reveals how brutal and violent some people can become, while some others try to be moral and sane. I have this effect almost in every one of David Fincher's films, especially ""Seven"", ""The Game"", ""Zodiac"". He digs into the dark side of human heart, and found. I believe Fincher use a few selected unusual individuals as a platform to tell his stories, but it somehow feels a lot more universal than that. He makes us feel that these dark sides are all over and not at all unusual. Look at the character of Amy. Hers is not what one would easily come across. But we feel most natural to see her roaming around and planning her next sick moves. This is David Fincher's gift. He tells someone's story, and it becomes everyone's story. I am not native to the US, so I can't critique on how realistic it is as an American story. I saw some bashing at this film, perhaps to get its rating down a notch or two. But it feels real and around for me. An article is recently released on how and why Americans are so attracted at killing themselves. There is a linkage between the article's thesis and this film's plot line. A very free society has its weakness: it is so free a weak soul can feel so unattached and get blown away by just a breeze. In fact, I had been in the US for a few years, and start to understand how ordinary and un-winnable it feels to be an average American. The country has achieved a great success as a society, millions still yearn to go there, and yet it keeps pushing people for more and more. Is this by way of explaining random shootings, school killings, and serial killings in the US? If so, ""Gone Girl"" should be renamed as ""All Gone"" or ""Almost Gone"" to be appropriate.",

It is no wonder Jenner Garner wants to divorce him.

If I had to choose an alternative title for the film, I think 'Marriage Story' would be very appropriate. Ultimately, everything that happens in this story that begins with the disappearance of a woman announced to the police by her husband, is the result of what happened in the five years of marriage that preceded the events, and which, as in Noah Baumbach's film will be described widely through flashbacks and excerpts of the diary written by the missing woman.",

595,13 October 2014,cultfilmfan,9, Gone Girl,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of Gone Girl, with high hopes and expectations based on the reviews that I had read, plus also because of David Fincher's very impressive body of work. All in all, I would have to say that I liked the film very much, but I did not love it. I think one thing that may have impacted my decision a little bit, was through no fault of the film whatsoever, but of online movie critics. I was reading different reviews of the film online (some of professional critics and some not) and I just found that in the reviews that I read, too much information was leaked out and spoiled about the movie, so that when I went to watch it, there were certainly plenty of surprises, but all in all I mostly knew where the film was going and I now wish I had entered the theatre knowing nothing about the film and that probably that might have made a bigger impact on me then. The style and satire of the film was also something I had to get used to. The constant media coverage surrounding the characters and the events in this film and the police who were profiling to the point of actually being obnoxious, to me at first was kind of aggravating. As the film went on however, I noticed that this was some tongue in cheek and almost satirical humour from the point of view of the writer and director. Just the fact that today's media and news outlets control so much of our thoughts and perceptions about certain events and news stories and there is always some sort of media bias, or slant to each situation. Here in Canada, we have the network broadcaster, CBC, and I can only truthfully watch some of their news programs because I find that so much of it is slanted and biased with a more liberal, or left wing style approach and while that may be fine for some, I find their politically correct and skewered way of doing the news often annoying, not truthful and not to my way of thinking, or my attitude towards world events, or politics. I only watch the station sparingly. It does seem you get that kind of bias from whatever news, or station you watch and just some of the bias is more obvious than others. So, I appreciated the film's jab and poking fun nature at this subject as it has long been a beef with me as well. I had to get used to the obnoxious cops and newscasters in the film, but when I did I appreciated the satire all the more. A few other complaints about the film revolve around certain events and sometimes it almost did seem very implausible and unrealistic. After you have seen the film (no, I am not giving anything away), you look at the film and start to wonder why certain things went to such measures of the extreme to pull off other things and it just baffles the mind. Should one be impressed by this type of storytelling? Repulsed? What was the message, or theme that they wanted to get across to us the viewers? The film was interesting on a level where we break down the characters and try to analyze them and figure out why they are doing what they are doing, but in the end there was fascination on my part, some disbelief and just plain some stuff that I did not get. The film's length did not bother me, but I did feel that certain scenes especially towards the end of the film could have been trimmed down a bit and overall were just not necessary to the film, or to the plot. There were a few plot holes in the film that I had a little problems with, but now on to what I did like about the film. As a whole, Gone Girl, was in very capable hands and the filmmakers did mostly succeed in doing a very good film. The acting from Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and the entire cast was all excellent and almost certain to cause some acting nominations at next year's Oscars. The film was slick and stylish with it's lighting and creepy, but atmospheric music. The film did keep and hold on to my interest even though it was a longer film and it awakened a whole bunch of emotions from me while watching the film. I always think that if you watch a film and it makes you feel at least something, then the filmmakers have succeeded on their end of the spectrum. While the film is far from perfect, it is still a very powerful and chilling film that is very well done and worth watching, I just would not recommend reading too many if any reviews on the film before you actually decide to go and see it. I will be curious to know what The Academy Awards will make of a film like this. It certainly is a warped and very different film, but could that lead to Oscar gold? I look forward to when the nominations come out to see for sure. As for Gone Girl, it was very close but not enough to be a masterpiece, or a perfect film, but it still is very good and worth seeing at least once.",
596,30 January 2015,melanie-carter,2, So disappointing,"Well that's two and a half hours of my life I won't get back. Settled down to watch this film with high expectations. I love a good, clever thriller which has you guessing all the way through. This one is not. Its dreadful. Half an hour in, you realise it is meant to come across as an arty, intelligent piece all about control rather than the 'edge of the seat' thriller it is billed to be. We persevered, still thinking it may improve and half way through it picked up a little and left us thinking if the ending is good it will have been worth it. It wasn't. Loose ends all over the place, poor plot and merely acceptable acting will leave you scratching your head and still asking questions, even at the end. Mainly along the lines of 'Why did I bother?'",

It's dark and brooding and sometimes it changes suddenly and unexpectedly, and sometimes we get lost, but the more lost we get the better.

We were all enthralled watching this drama-thriller about a man whose wife had disappeared and the revelations about them both. Ben Affleck is the star with nice supporting turns by Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry (yes, the guy who's usually known as Medea!), Carrie Coon, Casey Wilson, and many others. However, the most compelling performance is from Rosamond Pike. I remember liking her as a Bond girl in Die Another Day but here, she's really on fire if you know what I mean! All I'll say now is you may or not be surprised by the twists and turns that happen in this film but you won't be bored, that's for sure! David Fincher has done it again! So on that note, I highly recommend Gone Girl.",

603,16 September 2019,arthur_tafero,6, Better Than Average Mystery - Gone Girl,"Rosemund Pike gives a Joan Crawford-type performance in this mystery thriller also starring Ben Affleck. But make no mistake; Pike steals the film away from Affleck with the greatest of ease. Although not in the same category as Meryl Streep as an actress (she just does not have the sincere believability that Streep has). Pike is a formidable actress. She is good-looking (better looking than Crawford or Streep), sexier than Crawford or Streep, but not as genuine or believable as Crawford or Streep. Crawford was a great actress purely based on her iron will which was clearly present on her screen persona; Pike has that commodity in common with Crawford. Crawford and Pike are both chilling and threatening; Streep is not. We as an audience believe that Streep is vulnerable, but would scoff at the idea that either Crawford or Pike had even the remotest chance of being vulnerable. And that is what separates Pike from other actresses of this era. She is incapable of being vulnerable. No one would believe for a second that she could be vulnerable. It would be like being asked to believe John Wayne in a lead role of a gay-oriented film is vulnerable. I've seen all of Pike's films and am continuously fascinated with her persona, even though she gives exactly the same performance time after time.(just like John Wayne). And ultimately, she is a very bankable star.",
604,7 October 2014,GeorgeRoots,10, David Fincher Firing On All Cylinders.,"With a director like David Fincher, you can expect a few things. The man has a speciality for creating extremely effective thrillers, and he's also very good at adapting and being faithful to source material such as 2011's ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"". ""Gone Girl"" is a best-selling novel from 2012, written by Gillian Flynn (Who also wrote the screenplay, and stated that it deviates from the novel). I can confidently say it has been a long time since I've gone to the theatre and been captivated by an entire movie. Sure there has been some stellar pictures out this year, but to actually sit down and be absorbed into a 2 hour 30 minute film and want more from it by the end is very impressive (Considering a majority of the year's biggest movies appear during awards season).",

When Nick becomes the primary suspect he tries everything he can to clear his name and find out what happened to his wife. This is a movie that you can not talk about too much because it would be an injustice to give anything away. What I can say though is that I have been watching around 7-10 movies a week in order to do these reviews and have gotten to the point where after 5 minutes I can predict exactly what is going to happen and 99% of the time I am right. This is a movie that stayed one step ahead of me the entire time and just when I thought I had it figured out it went another way. That added to the enjoyment of this and I just can not say enough about this movie. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time and I highly recommend this.

The couple are hiding some terrible secrets of their own and have become fed up. Amy takes matters into her own hands, revealing a terrifyingly psychopathic pathology to the audience. Throughout the film she plays everyone off against each other, exploiting stereotypes and the media to place scrutiny on her husband, showing just how much of our reality can be twisted by those who understand its true workings. The acting, directing and screenplay all contribute to a dark, twisted masterpiece that left me floored.

617,4 October 2014,Andy-296,9, Terrific thriller with a great performance by Rosamund Pike,"A terrific thriller by David Fincher. Twisted and manipulative, in the best sense of the word, this two and a half hours film is based on a very famous book I have not read. Ben Affleck plays Nick as a quintessential average guy. Some years ago she met the well-off Amy (Rosamund Pike, in a stellar, award worthy performance) while living in New York and they eventually married. When his mother got sick, they return to live in his Missouri hometown, where despite their successful facade as a couple, she feels understandably bored by living in a small town. So as the movie starts, we have Nick return to their home in the day of their 5th wedding anniversary, to find Amy has disappeared and there are violent signs in the house. He calls the police, and soon enough, despite his protestations of innocence, incriminating evidence starts appearing against him. The case becomes famous nationally, the media starts to hound him, and soon we know that their marriage was far from picture perfect. But was this enough for him to kill her, in case she is really dead?",

623,23 February 2015,leonblackwood,8, Brilliant and dramatic movie!,"Review: What an epic but great movie! The many amazing twists throughout the film were well put together and very entertaining. Right from the¬†beginning you are led to believe that Affleck killed his missing wife but when the story unfolds, it really does paint a different picture. As there might be people out there that hasn't seen he movie, I really don't want to spoil the plot for you so I will try my utmost to watch what I say. The plot is about a man whose searching for his missing wife, hence the title, but all of the clues lead to her being murdered by him. He then hires a lawyer to prove his innocence and with the help of his sister, the dark truth starts to unfold. When I saw the length of the movie, I was a bit skeptical about what to expect, but I honestly enjoyed this intriguing film which was well written, with some great performances. It shows how the media can paint a totally¬†different picture than what is really going on behind closed doors and how a woman scorned can make a man's life complete hell. For such a long movie, it could have done with a bit more footage at the end so there could have been an outcome to such a dark situation, but the director chose to leave it open. Before the mystery unfolds, I really didn't know who was the bad guy and who was¬†innocent so you have to put your detective hat on to piece the clues together, which was why I enjoyed the ride. I can totally understand why the critics didn't have a bad word to say about the film so it has to go down as a great watch. One not to be missed!¬†¬†",

626,23 October 2014,shawneofthedead,8," A thriller with lashings of murder, mystery and mayhem that thrills in more ways than you'd expect.","David Fincher is a great director - but not really one you would associate with the notions of marriage, romance and love. His name is more characteristically attached to dark thrillers exploring the depths of human depravity: the way a serial killer relentlessly hunts his prey in Se7en, for instance, or the curdling of friendship through the creation of a billion-dollar enterprise in The Social Network. Why, then, has Fincher turned his attention to Gone Girl? Because this tale exploring marriage, romance and love - adapted from Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel of the same title - tucks itself perfectly into his wheelhouse. Fincher brews an intoxicatingly bitter stew out of Flynn's characters and ideas, blending tragedy, loss and even farce into a fascinating film that's as shocking, bleak and entertaining as it is thought-provoking.",

Great flick!,"David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" wont disappear too much during movie awards season and box office fare because of its critical & commercial success. It is a prototype fine Fincher film. The flick stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, a writer who has fallen on hard economic times, but wait I am not Dunne yet. Nick also discovers on the day of his anniversary that his wife Amy is missing. Amy is also a writer who was famed for writing an ""Amazing Amy"" novel series. Nick turns out to be a suspect of his missing wife. But I won't reveal much more about the plot because then I will have lots of gone girls and boys from reading the rest of my review. Affleck holds game in his starring performance as Nick, but it was Rosamund Pike who reached a new peak in her promising acting career with her outstanding performance as Amy; it will be amazing if she gets nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, which surely is a shoe-in to happen. Believe it or not, Tyler Perry does not bolt it away and does credible supporting work as Nick's attorney Tanner Bolt. Neil Patrick Harris is hosting the Oscars, and also hosted us to a worthy supporting performance as Amy's obsessed ex Desi. Carrie Coon also delivered a cool Coon performance as Nick's sister Margo. Fincher's exemplary direction was not gone from this picture, and Gillian Flynn was in in her impressive screenplay adaption of her own ""Gone Girl"" novel. OK, I am about gone here.

This isn't a reflection of today's society nor is it a thesis on failed marriages. Based on Gillian Flynn's popular novel and mostly adapted to screen by herself, this contemporary thriller is powered by a dueling narrative that doesn't permit the viewer to take sides for half the movie. Flynn's cinematic adaptation is smart and twisted enough for director David Fincher ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'Panic Room', 'Girl with the Dragon tattoo') to delineate his nimble ability with dark thrillers. He then uses his experience of 'The Social Network' and 'House of Cards' to provide a riveting drama that revolves around some powerful characters who face precarious and changing circumstances, neither of which are favorable to them.

I've seen some people say that it was rubbish and basically funny as if it was accidental, but that really isn't the case - the wit I think is perfect. It's a silly (but very entertaining) plot and Fincher knows it.",

The actor choices were amazing, I would not be able to pick a better Amazing Amy myself. The movie was mind blowing. What I also loved is that they kept they script so close to the book. They really made an effort to present as a movie that was so close to the descriptions in the book. Not only the characters but also the environment.",

650,19 November 2018,jawneyfloros,1, torn,Review: I really didn't like this movie because it doesn't really offer me anything. It takes way too long to progress and there are way too many variables. The direction and screenplay aren't terrible. The casting and acting are terrible. Especially by Rosamund Pike as the wife and the supposed villain who orchestrated her disappearance. I didn't buy Rosamund Pike's performance because there is no real method to her action or then she is unhappy and he husband is cheating. All in all I would give this one out of a possible five stars.,
651,14 January 2021,Abdulxoxo,8, A well crafted film,"Gone girl is a dark, compelling and unpredictable thriller.
The story kept me intrigued the entire time. The first half is all about the investigation into Amy's disappearance, slow unraveling of Nick's dirty secrets, reminiscing about the troubled history of Nick and Amy's marriage as told in Amy's dairy. You're dole out with just enough information to make you think you've figured things out but then, here comes the second half with its wicked twist that changes everything, characters reveal sides to them that are quite shocking and intriguing, the story becomes much more thrilling, dangerous and deranged. Although, I find the ending to be a bit far fetched. Acting-wise, Rosamund Pike delivers a remarkable performance as the manipulative, mischievous Amy. Ben Affleck delivers one of the best performances of his career as Nick Dunne. The rest of the cast also contributed in making this movie an interesting story to follow. Technical-wise; The score, location work, set design, editing and cinematography all complement the narrative ably.",

653,20 February 2015,pc95,6, Loses it Towards the End,"I had high expectations for ""Gone Girl"" due to word-of-mouth, but sadly they weren't really met. This movie has some core problems and is a mixed bag. On the one hand the direction is good, and the acting fairly good, but on the other, the story is a mess and the dialog and chemistry often unsupportable. The movie runs a long feeling 2 hr 25 min and the preponderance of media embedded in the story feels like a nuisance and is annoying. Director David Fincher, who has done both worse and better work seems to have a good idea of what he wants from his camera - editing and picture- work are very good as is the music. Though Affleck and Pike are individually pretty good, their early scenes together do not ring genuine often thanks to far- fetched or clich√©-ridden dialog, and late in the movie the story has degenerated so badly that the dialog has little meaning in the final scenes. Indeed the the last 25 min has failed the story. The concept was there, but it got swept away. The resolution was unbelievable and awful. 6/10 for the first 4/5 of the movie despite sometimes poor dialog, but with good points for moody music. Mixed.",

Filming in the dark style that has become his trademark, Fincher treats his material with seeming indifference, apparently not finding enough compelling material to engage with and he settles for competent performances without nuance from leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Flynn's screenplay doesn't help: the twisting, devious plot as told by unreliable narrators that delighted and disturbed in her novel here gets a hurried treatment that seems to trivialize important episodes. Yet it's bloated where the novel was propulsive. Flynn's book was a cynical but identifiable take on marriage in America, marred by a fizzled, inert ending; yet here by the end she has turned her thesis into something larger and uglier, a violent war waged by calculating women against unwitting men.",
657,13 October 2014,Figgy66-915-598470,8," Thrilling, yet disturbing but totally watchable","13 October 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Gone Girl. A lot of people knock Ben Affleck and I'm not completely sure why. He was very watchable in this quite long but very gripping mystery thriller. On his fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Affleck), reports his wife Amy missing (played by Rosamund Pike) and what starts out as a seemingly ordinary disappearance is pulled apart by a media circus and very soon Nick is being accused of his wife's murder. It's easy to see how stories get out of hand when you watch how the media manipulate things to their own design and this film was scarily realistic, telling a tale from the husbands point of view, but not without a little manipulation from another source. Pike was a master in her part, and the supporting cast were well chosen as their mannerisms matched the script with varying amounts of disbelief and cynicism. Look out for Neil Patrick Harris, recently starred in A Million Ways to Die In The West but was famous at the end of the 80s for playing little Doogie Howser MD. As I said this film was long but well worth staying in your seat. Another interesting thing to note is that one of the producers is none other than Reese Witherspoon.",

659,5 April 2015,abdou-in,8, I've killed for you; who else can say that?,"Yes, this is a David Fincher movie; there are no fake emotions He really loves those stories, the stories where he can demonstrate how sick the human being is. I'm dazzled with the scenario, I really am! I always enjoyed what he picks - even though he wasn't the scenarist of course - But he always finds the suitable match for his movies. There is no happy ending, this is for others -- that's what I imagine him to say every time I watch his movies. The plot is breath taking, the movie is about 2h and a half for god's sake, and I didn't feel it at all. I wanted it to continue¬Ö I believe this is one of the most brilliant screenplays of the year 2014, a lot of things were set carefully, and with an artistic eye, Especially for the main thing in it, the dialog. David Fincher, well! This is not his best movie of course; I felt like he missed some crucial points in some scenes, something was missing as a final touch, some rubbish from the acting staff that he's responsible of, only minor not that big, it was great though as a general work! Didn't affect the story at all. Rosamund Pike played it well, a lot of changes in one movie, and yet! She kept it balanced, I would easily say that she could've got the best actress of the year, she was evil, lover, kind and sweet, and she was Amy the American babe girl. I wouldn't say the same about Ben Affleck, but he definitely was good, what a lot of people don't understand, is that his role made him look like that, his role dictated to be calm and not very emotional and reactive, that's why. The human being has a messed up mind, either you like it or not, this movie is a reminder of that, and the ending was marvelous and explained this point very well, there is no such innocence, it is what it is",
660,18 October 2014,mamalv,9," Amazing Amy, for sure.","GONE GIRL is certainly a thriller in the vein of a Hitchcock film. David Fincher is almost the reincarnation of Alfred Hitchcock in this tale of deceit and psychoanalysis. To understand Amy we must first understand her parents, and their obsession with the fantasy life that they created in books, Amazing Amy. They have created a childhood that never existed and thereby have created the psychotic adult. In the beginning of the romance we see Amy and Nick as a kind of urban couple who are in love. Their romance however drains away as life steps in. They lose their jobs, and go back to Missouri to take care of Nick's ailing mother. He was never too ambitious to begin with, he just sort of sits around living off his wife's trust fund. He is neither a good husband or good provider, and when Amy catches him cheating she sets out on a path of revenge. If you think you have the plot in the first 30 minutes of the film, think again. Nick knows Amy better than anyone else, and she does not have him fooled. There is a lot of blood and gore is in some of the scenes that may recall, Anthony Perkins shower scene in Psycho. Of course the shower scene will seem tame to the viewer of GONE GIRL, probably because of the era that Psycho was filmed. This is a good, if not great thriller with many twist and turns, and a ending that may not satisfy everyone, but is appropriate to the story of Nick and Amy.",

723,10 April 2023,nelliebell-1,5, This is a hate crime that should bring the Death Penalty,"I watched a version of Gone Girl with a number of edits in place, for instance we get a look at the young girl with whom The Ben Affleck character, Nick Dunne is claimed to be having an affair with. The information wishes to suggest that Nick Dunne is a University Professor who meets this particular young girl in a Creative Writing course that Nick Dunne is teaching. I saw what amounted to a very youthful looking young girl, in fact the young girl is so youthful looking that I too took a creative writing class however that particular creative writing class was in my tenth grade and the girls looked like her. That is how youthful the appearance of that young girl was to this opinion, if I would be quite the rude guy I would suggest that not only was Nick Dunne skirting the law but perhaps even rocking the craddle. This was as a result of looking at an edited version of Gone Girl in the unedited version the exposure is not quite the same. There is something that the unedited version does'nt seemingly understand that Matrimony is usually a shared experience, for instance it is not my money anymore than it is your money it is in a manner of speaking our money. The same can be said that is it is not my house nor is it her house it is our house. We do see that in fact the two, that is Nick Dunne and Amy Dunne portrayed by Rosamund Pike own a very nice looking private home. We know that because in short order we are transported to this couples to the approach of their 5th year anniversary and a scene takes place in the couples foyer. In the edited version which I saw first it is very surprising to see that there is some serious tension that Amy determines it is coming from Nick Dunne and with a inquiry coming from Amy Dunne Nick Dunne is shown shoving her. Indeed they have words, the edited version was not as serious looking as I found out when looking at the very same scene except it is unedited and in this unedited account Nick Dunne knocks Amy Down. This event is very nearly a shock, it is clear that Nick Dunne has committed a Sin and it is having a disruptive and even upsetting effect in his marraige. Amy Dunne I think makes a mistake when being very upset she tries to takes ""there"" money and leave her home, in effect she appears to run away. This causes a problem, like a shark who detects blood Amy was very fortunate that she was not murdered by those two bad people even though they ruffed her up a bit and took all the money that she had taken from the couples bank account. The picture show something of a ruse in the attempt to locate Amy Dunne however that is what I thought of the entire account in the Search to find Amy Dunne. I felt it was here that something as terrible as anything that this picture could come up with began to evolve. Neil Patrick Harris portrays something of a forlorned Fan of a sort with Amy knowing Desi Collings. She shows up at his home and is given something of a respite when Mr. Collings has no reservation in an attempt to rescue Amy Dunne. This is where I have a problem and I'am not able to allow this to be without a real reason why this needed to be otherwise things as such would just not add up. First the act was a pre-meditated event which she not only made her self very much available but had planned as the picture will show this hate that is so real to this viewer that aside from the very real fact that this was a Hate crime it was as well a premeditated event which when executed was done with such viciousness that there was a real personal hate that was made evident. It was clear enough to me and this is my opinion that that crime committed by Amy Dunne would of brought the Death Penalty. The crime that would require a life for a life must be placed properly as this character was more if you will robbed of his life but as well he was robbed of any life thereof, that is his opportunity for a future was denied by a willful perverted monster in this criminal act provided by Amy Dunne. It is that that is most sorrowful There is to much corruption as with the placating a victimized Amy Dunne as she stands in a blood soaked clothing with the FBI agreeing with poor Amy. She looks at Nick Dunne and indeed all this is a bit much to take. The shame to this film is the fact that all was building to the wilful execution and murder of Desi Collings. This film has as its pedigree the wilful planning(premeditation), the execution thereof and murder that is the Hate crime of one Desi Collings. There is more to this sordid affair because in truth both Amy Dunne and Nick Dunne are two bad people.",

Ben Affleck was never praised by his acting skills, and his natural apathy fits well to the character because in the book Nick is described as a guy unable to express his feelings and emotions. The movie doesn't make his personality clear enough as in the book, giving the feeling that Affleck is just delivering a bad performance, which he is not. Only those who did read the book will understand that no matter how low skilled Ben Affleck is as an actor, the character is exactly like that.",
728,4 October 2014,herbqedi,10, Unique and meticulously crafted spider web transcends genres,"I did not read the book of know anything about Gillian Flynn beyond the fact that she adapted her book for the movies screenplay. Therefore, I did not realize that this would be more for my money than an excellent suspense thriller or a did-he or didn't he movie. This turned out to be such a clever and meticulous spider web of plotting and counter-plotting, that it was difficult to keep up with all of its twists and turns. What made it especially difficult to keep up with once we were an hour into the film was that I kept laughing from the pitch-dark American-values comedy that flowed naturally from the situations and character's motivations. ",
729,23 December 2014,stock-1,10, Stunning Peace of Work,"Indeed David Fincher did it again. At the surface the movie script resembles a totally over the top fictitious story which could never happen for real, with the Find Amy Trust Fund and the nightly press coverage. Only occasionally once in a decade such a thing could happen in America but in the rare event it does the missing girl is either never found back or found dead. Press coverage of such events is these days mostly brought as aftermath after finding a dead body. Inside Gone Girl the audience is presented with a 'live' kidnapping where the wealthy parents within 24 hours setup a website with a trust-fund to find their Amy back, including day to day press coverage, like we have seen from the Madeleine McCann case. Gone Girl kept me watching for two hours and thirty minutes without even feeling the need for a break for a smoke or drink, which likewise only happens to me once in a decade. People who followed the McCann disappearance will no doubt do the same. A warning is at place though as the ending is quite unusual and will put-off a lot of McCannies including Amy's husband Ben Affleck who plays his amicable role as the Missouri husband very nicely. After watching the viewer will finally understand why it is that real rapers and sexual abusers never burn their hands on women like amazing Amy Elliot, and aim for the homeless and orphans instead. Is Gone Girl a movie which is only produced occasionally once in a decade ? It depends whether or not Hollywood is interested in doing a blockbuster about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann featuring its real details, which is no fairy tale as the Portugese Police department has made the entire dossier material available to the public, which has never happened before during the entire documented history of Interpol, Europol or the Metropolitan Police combined.",

736,21 February 2015,alexandercappelli,4, Disappointing third act brings the film down.,"When you break it down, Gone Girl was practically guaranteed to succeed. It has all the necessary components to be a hit film. Based on an internationally best selling novel and with David Fincher at the helm. Director of some of my favorite films including 'Fight Club', 'Seven', 'Panic Room' and the semi-biographical and surprisingly engaging, 'The Social Network', he has barely put a foot wrong in his career thus far. Ben Affleck, who is often hit and miss, pulls in a wholly believable performance. Rosamund Pike, who often appears quite stiff in her roles seems to fit perfectly with her character and her somewhat emotionless performance is perfect for this role. Add to that a wonderfully hypnotic soundtrack from Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor and you've got yourself a hit, right? Unfortunately this is not quite the case, as Gone Girl proves that it's whole is not equal to the sum of it's parts. The film begins with a suspenseful first act and an intriguing 'whodunit' feel that keeps you asking the right questions until we're introduced to some satisfying twists and turns in it's second act where things really heat up. It's by the third act though that Gone Girl begins it's steady decline in to unbelievability and fails to answer many glaring questions and plot holes that leave you with more questions than answers by the credits roll. I respect a film that encourages the audience to think and ask questions, sparking healthy post viewing debate. However, the questions I had when this film reached it's unsatisfying conclusion where not the existential, moral dilemma type questions that cause you to ponder the films deeper meaning and intricate metaphorical elements. What I was questioning was the validity of the films plot arc. I have no trouble accepting what would traditionally be an unbelievable turn of events in the real world, suspending disbelief is essential in most film viewing because we're not watching a documentary. Though when the lead character choices and actions of supporting cast do not sync with the verisimilitude of the film, one cannot help but become distanced by the implausibility of the events even when in the context of the fictional film world. There are plenty of mediocre films out there but it's particularly disappointing when one with so many strong individual elements still falls flat.",
737,10 December 2015,Rickting,7, A respectable adaptation of a superior property,"Gone Girl was an excellent thriller novel; brilliantly written and complex, it built on the suspense before undoing itself with an awful ending. Bold, but too anticlimactic. So it's pretty cheeky to promise the film with have a new ending but then not change anything. Still, Gone Girl is a solid 4 star mystery thriller. Nick Dunne tries to solve the disappearance of his wife, who he had a troubled relationship with, but everyone thinks he did it. David Fincher directs so you know you're in for something interesting. That prediction was correct. Fincher is a stylistic and meticulous director who never fails to deliver on stunning cinematography even in the most mundane scenes. He delivers once again. He and the cast are probably what led to the film being so successful. Ben Affleck is still a little muted, but this is a surprisingly good performance from him. Carrie Coon is excellent as his sister, while even Tyler Perry is surprisingly good. The show is stolen by Rosamund Pike, whose brilliant and chilling villainous performance creates one of the best movie characters of 2014. Simultaneously terrifying and sympathetic, she completely owns the film.",

The mood and the climate of the movie is set very well, making us feel like we are exploring an unexplored world, filled with secrets and mysteries. It's one of those movies with a very powerful stories and keeping us on the edge of our seats till the very end, and even more after the movie ends.

Even if the story was written to end this way, it could have been communicated far better and with far more realistic excitement. It seems like they just plonked it at the end rather than continue the story. What the hell happened? Did they run out of time or needed to release it by a specific date or did the original scriptwriter run off?

To be fair to actors, they did what they were supposed to do, but with such extremely bad, no point, shallow script, there is no way this movie could be even close to being acceptable, even if the naked- covered in blood-shower scene was performed by Julia Roberts and Anthony Hopkins. I mean that could have explained the high number of views and reviews but not the rating. With such hype and high rating, chances are you will probably watch this movie however, if you are one of those who actually value their own time and try to spend it on something worthy, then this is a one you should not waste your time on.",

While it scrutinizes modern journalism, public opinion, and the legal system, its main focus is on twisted thrills. Ben Affleck believably portrays the layers of an unhappy man who needs to put on a wholesome appearance, while Rosamund Pike brings an extreme dynamic that is impossible to ignore.

785,12 October 2014,PipAndSqueak,7, Flawed but engaging crime tale,"Early on in this film, especially if you are really paying attention, you get notice that the story has been augmented in order for it to 'work'. The story, in fact, is extremely flawed with some absolute howlers of action/incident that are just too far fetched to be given 'benefit of the doubt'. However, these flaws do allow you to pick through the story to your own conclusions. Yes, there is a shocking and perhaps surprising development in the middle. You don't spot this because the character involved is portrayed as a 'desirable' type with looks and money. This is another of the incoherent motes in this tale. My feeling is that the story would be more realistic if the genders of the two protagonists were reversed. As it stands, the hardest flaw to reconcile is why the Ben Affleck character doesn't just up sticks and leave? Why was he sticking around to reach an anniversary date to deliver the bad 'news'? Lots of hype around this movie, join the crowd of chatterers if you want because you'll need something to justify the two hours plus needed to watch it.",

I can not say that David Flincher has not done an incredible job as always and of course hats off to the actors and actresses, they were all amazing. But the reviews actually took my expectations sky high, that it practically fell from heaven right to hell when I walked in to the theater. I must say, it started off interesting, but probably 10 minutes in to the movie, I could conclude pretty much the rest of the story, and then it became dull. Maybe it is unpredictable to a lot of people, but those who watch a lot of horror and thrillers and might I say have a sick mind, it is very much predictable.

The first hour or so wasn't terrible, then the rest of the movie got progressively worse, and the plot holes more gaping, until the film mercifully concluded, but without any ""moral of the story."" I am genuinely saddened by the high marks given to this film, and I fear that the entertainment industry will give us lots more like it. The acting and direction were the only aspects of it that I could even consider worthwhile, but they weren't nearly enough. This film making IMDb's Top 250 (or Top 1000, for that matter) is a travesty. I can only guess that the ""plot twists"" were what appealed to those who liked it...I would strongly suggest that these folks go watch some Hitchcock films. This movie is garbage, needlessly violent, and lacking in characters worth caring about or even trying to sympathize with.

I found the movie insulting. Only a person recovering from a traumatic brain injury and drunk could suspend disbelief enough to enjoy this movie. Why not save the time and just shoot her husband instead of channelling Rube Goldberg to come up with such a complicated and involved murder scheme? The machinations of the scheme itself leaves clues at every juncture that ate a combination of alarm bells and fireworks. The director must think this demonstrates the genius of the wife (and movie) but it does the opposite. Sherlock Holmes is certainly not needed to solve this crime. Every five minutes the plot screams for an easy arrest. The ending tries to be clever, but only succeeds in being insipid. I realize it is a movie but I have to believe that a transparent frame-up that couldn't fool a room full of kindergartners, instead would be so precise and diabolical as to carry a plot for two hours. It was all cliche from the reaction of the media, to the ineptitude of the police, to the too-cool attorney, to the ripoff of ""Play Misty For Me"" in the passion sequence.

Fincher, in a word, is an artist. He creates incredibly intricate and memorable settings for his films through his unique and highly stylistic visuals. Every scene in every film is crucial to the exposition of the story and has been painstakingly defined to be as impressionistic as possible. Fincher is known for being a relatively challenging director that often requires countless takes for a single shot as to get it perfectly aligned with the his vision for the film.

831,27 October 2016,cdjh-81125,10, A Thrilling Mystery,David Fincher is the man when it comes to physiological thrillers and Gone Girl is one of his greatest movies with possibly his greatest plot twist. This is a film that is admittedly best on its first viewing for the intense mystery and whodunit that anyone can be intrigued by. The reason it's so investing is because they never rule out Afflecks character as a suspect and through flashbacks you even start to suspect him as well. The flashbacks are used perfectly they fill in the blanks as they should but add to the tension and mystery. The way this movie looks at the media and outside worlds perception of events forces the viewer to think about what they're mindset would be during a situation like this and makes the movie all the more fascinating. Like I said this movie is at its best on a first viewing but they thing that's really going to get people to come back and watch it again are the performances especially Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Affleck is just so believable in this film he's perfect at conveying his characters more scum bag qualities while also being very convincing at portraying the immense stress that he isn't under to prove his innocence. At first Pike seemed like a likable character with some real emotion to her but as soon as we discover what she really is it turns into without a doubt Pikes best performance. Tyler Perry was extremely entertaining as Afflecks lawyer he had great chemistry with the cast and really makes me hope that he'll come back to more dramatic roles like this. The ending of this movie is quite divisive at first i didn't know what to think but I soon realised that were meant to feel that way were meant to feel unsatisfied with the ending because that's how Afflecks character would feel. This movie of course is directed beautifully David Fincher creates for some dream tension and heartbreak throughout the run time. While Neil Patrick Harris was good in this movie I just didn't like his character and was a pretty annoying presence. ,

The same can be said for the soundtrack, particularly during the break-in scene.",

The first time I saw the movie, I didn't understand what was going on, whether Nick was a good person or not, Amy was crazy or not, it was quite confusing. Until recently when I watched this movie again, things were a little clearer. It's hard to ask for anything better than what David Fincher did. He did an excellent job. Converting books into movies is not easy. The combination between the present, which is Amy's disappearance with the past, and many complicated and fast-paced dialogues, makes it difficult for viewers to keep up with the film's progress at first viewing.",

From start to end this film did its job in keeping me on the edge of my seat for the entire runtime, something not too many films have done this year. Although i noticed that after the half way point it felt like a different but equally as interesting film that could have been approached differently and would have fit more with the original tone. Rosamund Pike puts in an Oscar worthy performance and leads the race for the award. She is definitely the most interesting and compelling character of the film but still doesn't take too much away from the other great performances. It was a fitting ending i felt for the film although it left me wanting a little more. Despite the slight dip in execution after the half way mark and the slightly rushed ending it didn't affect the overall quality too much as this is still a must watch film for the year of 2014. - 9.3",

I'm sorry but the ending wasnt plausibly. First thing Ben Afflecks character wouldve done in real life the second she reappeared with her fake kidnap story is Go on national tv and say how he never bought any of that stuff and that his wife had set him up for murder, taking in tow with him the previous boyfriend she had set up for rape & say shes admitted the kidnap was a fake and she murdered the guy in cold blood.. other points How does he suddenly become dumb?!? Obviously the babies not his it's the guys that she murdered hes last dude to cum inside her, also the guy she murder said he had cameras every inch of the house therefore theyd show her brutal murder and dipping her night dress in wine, for the cops to actually see. So major plot holes everywhere, it wouldve been most satisfying ending to see her caught out on all those things and arrested and jailed. Because of that ending I dont think I could rewatch this, I wouldve if not for that and it wouldve been good enough watch",
838,21 January 2015,pantelisandreou98,10, Anyone who loved Gone Girl the book will walk out of Gone Girl the movie with a sick grin on their face.,"On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behaviour have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? Flynn gets a rare chance for a successful author to adapt her book for the screen, and that's the second-smartest choice made for this project. The first was hiring Fincher to direct, a filmmaker who at his best works with a clinical and cynical eye, perfect for Flynn's prose. It's a marriage made in heaven, presenting another stuck in hell. Or more accurately, Missouri.A masterpiece of genre film-making. I felt like I was watching a long-lost Hitchcock classic (but one with all the sex and violence Hitch was only allowed to hint at). No spoilers. The less you know about the story going in, the more you'll enjoy it. Fans of the novel are in for an impeccable and precise adaptation of the source material. Fincher nails the tone and sustains it effortlessly for the entire running time. Just amazing! 5/5",

Gone Girl is able to take the plot of its movie which is tragic as is and spiral it out of control to the point of no return for the characters. The performances were all fantastic and Rosamund Pike was very well deserving of her nomination for best actress. Sadly the reason this doesn't fall under the category of a Perfect Movie for me is because of Neil Patrick-Harris' performance, whenever he was on screen I was taken out of the movie a bit, he should stick to comedies.

After reading the novel, I headed to the cinema days later to watch the movie. I was astounded by the depth of Fincher's direction, pace and vision of a novel so highly rated. What also helped was the author of the novel herself wrote the screenplay. This movie was everything the novel was and even more in my opinion. It was chilling and dramatic with each actor cast perfectly in their respective roles. There is no doubt in my mind that in the world of cinema, there is no other director that can bring audiences onto the edge of their seats the way David Fincher can. I loved his adaptation of 'Fight Club' and 'The Girl with the Dragon tattoo', but this was even harder. He had an even more complex story about relationships and betrayal, which had to be told from the perspective of both antagonists. Finally, high praise for Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike who could not have been better or more convincing as the flawed couple. Along with 'The Green Mile' and 'Mystic River', this adaptation of 'Gone Girl' is the best page to screen translation I have seen.",

846,3 January 2015,magnuslhad,9," twisty, engrossing tale","A man's wife goes missing, setting in motion a media frenzy that affects not only the husband, but family, lovers, neighbours and law-enforcement. There is biting satire to be had here, most notably on the institution of marriage. Why some people get married, and why some others stay married, defies all logic, and this narrative takes that premise to the extreme. The inanity of our media-soaked culture is also caught in the cross-hairs, as dumb tabloid TV personalities are revered, while peripheral players to the central drama clamour for their attention. Ben Affleck does an outstanding job as the hard-to-pin-down Nick Dunne. A few men will squirm in self-aware discomfort at some of the decisions Nick makes. Rosamund Pike gets to test her range and does not miss a beat, while Neil Patrick Harris takes on a tricky role, making the incredulous credulous. He is perhaps the only character who comes closest to receiving unreserved pity from the audience. The superlative element here is Fincher's pacing. The narrative is a masterclass in setting up and paying off on active questions, with three put in place and answered in each act. And it is the third act that will test the tolerance of some audience members, but delivers, for me, the deliciously dark ending this story requires. As much as we'd love to see pure justice delivered, it is, more often than not, the tawdry compromise offered up here that prevails. One of Fincher's best, and that's saying something.",

848,11 March 2019,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,8," A silver screen adaptation, equal of the titular novel's level of quality and intrigue.","''Gone Girl'' is one of those rare type of films which are at the same level, in terms of quality and character, with their original source, that is the novel. Gillian Flynn's ''Gone Girl'' is her third, in chronological order, novel that was published, after ''Sharp Objects'' (won the 2007 Ian Fleming Steel Dagger for the best thriller) and ''Dark Places'', a book which was also successfuly adapted to cinema film in 2015 by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, starring Charlize Theron. ''Gone Girl'' received wide praise and many compliments, and it is considered to be Flynn's tour de force, a crime/mystery novel narrated by -more or less- unreliable characters' point of view, a fact that makes the viewer to remain vigilant for the 2 hours and half that is -approximately- the movie's running time.
The story revolves around the two protagonists, Nick and Amy Dunne, a married couple which seems to be totally in love with each other at the beginning of their relationship, only to find out in time, that they fell in love with an illusion of the other that they built themselves. The intricate, though not hard to follow, plot of the film begins to unfold when in the day of their fifth's wedding anniversary, Amy (Rosamund Pike) disappears from the house and seems to be gone for good. Her husband, Nick (Ben Affleck), is shocked at first and seems to be willing to day what is necessary to find out the truth behind his wife's action, but slowly it becomes obvious that Amy had set him up for her -supposed- murder. Through Nick's conversations, mainly with his twin sister, Margo, the viewer discover that things were not what they seem and the marriage of Nick and Amy was far from being ideal. As the days pass and Amy is still missing, the police begins to unearth the clues that Amy had left them in order to incriminate Nick and after finding the -possibly- murder weapon they arrest him.
This is a -condensed- synopsis of the film's first one hour and the following 90 minutes has a lot of twists and turns in store for the viewer who must not lose his focus in order to fully enjoy the viewing experience of one of the best crime films of the year (2014). ''Gone Girl'' is a film, having two truly shady characters as protagonists which are hard to like, much more to identify with, but this doesn't mean that they are not brilliantly outlined and fleshed out, as well as alluring and enthralling. Rosamund Pike's performance is a great one but unfortunately Ben Affleck's acting is below expectations and perhaps with another actor in the role of Nick, ''Gone Girl'' would be irresistible. David Fincher's direction is impeccable -as always- and guarantees an unforgettable artistic achievement, a movie that the audience will remember for the years to come as on of the iconic flicks of the crime/mystery genre.

Rosamund Pike was chillingly good as a vindictive wife, Ben Affleck was great in interaction with his twin sister, I enjoyed watching their relationship, but in scenes with Pike he was wooden and not at all believable as a husband.

Fincher keeps the suspense high throughout the entire movie, just when you think the movie has been solved, new obstacles arise and it couldn't be more engrossing!The first half of the movie obviously focuses on the mystery of 'Where his Nick's Wife?', but it isn't until we figure out if she is alive or dead that the real excitement kicks in. That being said, the second half of the movie focuses on Nick and his colleagues trying to figure out a way out of the mess he is now in, thanks to new evidence, this is where the movie gets wild. Unfortunately, he is always one step behind the true monster and it's exciting to see him attempting to counter and disprove 'the perfect crime' and whether or not he will come out on top. The movie starts off as simple mystery thriller and then explodes into a much larger story with plenty of intricate layers to keep you guessing at the end game; and it also challenges you as viewer and forces you to pick a side (the lesser of two evils perhaps). Of course much of the praise must go to the author of the actual book, because she has created a truly captivating story. As of right now, it is safe to say that 'Gone Girl' is the second best movie in 2014, second only to 'Snowpiercer'. This is a must see for anyone looking for a fantastic mystery movie with some of the best acting of the year! ",
883,20 November 2014,thomas-w15,8, Too Dark for my taste,"Gone Girl: Not since I saw Prisoners last year have I felt the way I felt after seeing Gone Girl. In certain parts it makes you feel horrified by what happened and how they showed it happening. It is probably the darkest film I have ever seen. For what it is though, it was very well put together. With creepy good acting from Rosamund Pike and well guided directing from David Fincher, Gone Girl successfully disturbs you throughout the whole film. ",
884,14 December 2014,litgotica,6, Disappointing,"I'd been wanting to see it with great expectation, since I'd heard good critics and I think,or thought, Fincher was an interesting director. Seven and Fight Club were good, intense, demonstrations of this, and of Fincher's mastering of the genre.",

The mind of pure genius!","Shaken, Engrossed, Appalled, Disturbed, Marvelled and Amazed, these are some of the adjectives that I felt during the course of this movie. Wow! What a masterpiece of acting by Rosamund Pike. I haven't seen a better display bod female domination. She is evil, sharp, strong and pursuasive, all at the same time. I could not stop applauding myself on her subtle grey gestures. She planned a perfect plot in this movie effortlessly and had the others gasping for their breathes!! The whole movie revolves around her and never for even a second does she disappoints. The former bond girl could not have done anything better in her role.",

888,3 October 2015,pal05052003,8," A man is accused of murdering his own wife and is put through the media spotlight, making the situation a lot worse for him.","This movie is really tense. At first it seemed slow but things get more interesting as the plot thickens. I cannot imagine a better person to play the role of Amy, the disappearing wife, than Rosamund Pike. She definitely nailed it. As for Ben Affleck, his expression really fits the movie. He looks clueless, and is helpless with the situation. The other characters were great too. Carrie Coon, who played Affleck's sister, was also great. She helps highlight the plight of Affleck's character, and for a moment, also helped highlight his flaws. It is quite refreshing to see the good guys be totally helpless till the end of a movie that is not a horror movie. To be honest, the situation in the movie is almost like a horror movie for marriage, where the moral is: choose the right person or you will be stuck. p.s. though I rated this movie high, I don't think I will want to re-watch it. It is like the Saw series, enjoyable in the first watch but can't stomach another one. So if you want to enjoy it, make sure you have gotten rid of all possible annoyances.",

With so much dreck being wheeled out - we got stuck with a couple of turkeys in as many weeks - it is a delight to be in an audience that leaves an auditorium where they have been greatly entertained.",
896,1 July 2018,El-Ak,6, Fincher did a great job in building incidents and then collapsed all ! I am really not a fan.,"Okay , The movie had an average start even very slow then very quick rhythm giving away what was planned by the wife at once just before the middle then only focusing on that psychopath wife and the rest of the plot when an unplanned accident happened in her plan and then preparing for the ending which was a complete mess with lots of plot holes and unreasonable behaviours especially when both married couple had everything cleared the cards were exposed. The movie had a slow scheme then rising slowly till the end then collapsed with that mess that I felt you were afraid that the days would end before you finish the ending!. I am not trying to have a different opinion about that critically acclaimed movie but really the total scheme flopped from our director who only focused on bringing the wife to the screen with the more than good performance by Rosamund Pike and was a mess in the rest of it even the music didn't add anything to the scenes.

Ben provides a much needed outlet for those of us who have a mean spirit, because there is literally no reason to be nice to him. He is white, rich, snobby, elitist, selfish, posturing, conniving, and generally an untalented blob who has successfully traded on his unearned good looks, all the while keeping us guessing as to exactly how stupid he really is, and how much his screen roles differ from his actual persona. Okay. Now the way that the general story is told, with plot twists that actually make sense without being completely predictable, a person ought to stand back and give some credit to the other actors, the director, writers, etc. And, eventually, I will. In the mean time, though, I just like being mean to Ben.",

The events in the movie aren't necessarily impossible, just highly improbable, which can be a problem when you're expecting a realistic and grounded thriller.

Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and Carrie Coon pull off one of the best performances I have seen this year. Tyler perry is also great though he could have had more screen space. I didn't quite get the role of Neil Patrick Harris but still doesn't get in the way of the experience. This is a movie isn't as great as Seven but still noteworthy in David Fincher's Filmography.",

911,5 October 2014,j-madej,10," ""Gone Girl"" is a refreshing breath of fresh air, through perspective on genre that needed oxygen for quite some time.","Whenever I hear a rumors about an Oscar contention about a movie that I haven't seen it yet and I do not feel any type of interest after watching a trailer, I always come to a screening unsure what to expect and often my assumption is, that probably I will not like the movie. Specially if two main actors playing the leads do not belong to the group of actors I normally would spend the money to see. Mostly mainstream entertainment can be quite shallow, directed to mass audience which often is interested in form of easy going escapism rather then intellectual pursuit. I knew that ""Gone Girl"" was directed by David Fincher, director whom I deeply admire for his body of work, but anyone can have a bad day or a movie in his case. Fincher started in the commercial world and was known for his unique sense of visually narrative style that eventually translated in to a big Hollywood feature film career, arguably becoming top 5 best director in the business. Ben Affleck on the other hand is not my cup of tea. I always felt that he is overrated as an actor (his brother Casey Affleck in my opinion is much better actor) but got a second chance as a director and I think that is were he can develop further considering his earlier directorial success with Gone Baby Gone, The Town and specially Oscar winning Argo. Based on the casting alone I really thought that I will hate ""Gone Girl"" but how wrong was I. I underestimated intelligence of David Fincher and his understanding of the fact that movies are made in casting. What I mean by that, is that if you hire suitable actors to play a characters that in some way might be a part of who they are in real life they will be able to bring that persona to life and create a performances that are not forced, but rooted in truth, honed by the director who slowly becomes observer instead a parent figure that has to teach them how to act, or safe their performance in editing room. Rosamond Pike might get the nomination. The fact of her giving up on her vanity will help with that.",

A worringly realistic representation of a marriage on the rocks with two secretive and unstable characters. Both acted to the very highest level. This roller coaster of a movie plays on a perfectly plotted stage, medias power and the strength of a broken man. One thing let this movie down, its ending. After twists, turns and shocks I was expecting so much more from its finale. A miscarriage to what was a perfect build up. For this it lost half a star however this was regained due to raw and electrifying acting from Affleck and Pike. Plus equally majestic directing from the master of mystery thriller movies, David Fincher.",
916,15 December 2021,AndreaWeaver1,7, Captivating,"No one can deny that this film has become a classic thriller and one of David Finchers most popular films. The storyline is captivating and the definition of a slow burn; a beautiful puzzle unfolding before the viewers eyes. I found myself once again in turmoil over who to root for, bouncing between Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. The rollercoaster was enjoyable, however and the uncertainty kept me on my toes. In the end I simply settled on the fact that they were meant for each other. Neither spouse exemplified true character and I don't think there would be any way for them to be with anyone else while the other is alive. Obviously there was quite a bit more mental instability on the part of Pike's character, but one could argue that the grief of her ailing relationship drive her towards such measures, therefore shifting a portion of the blame to her husband. There is so much relational turmoil to unpack in this film, and I enjoyed the thought process surrounding it. Pike as a narrarator will always be a plus to me, and her explaination quickly became my favorite part. All in all, I was pleased with the movie and will certainly be watching it again.",

920,5 November 2014,Matt-144-792009,7," Gone Girl, watch it with someone you loath.","In Gone Girl (2014) Nick Dunn (Ben Affleck) comes home on the day of his 5th anniversary to find his wife, Amy (Rosemund Pike) missing. Naturally being the husband of a missing woman, Nick is suspect number one. The police investigators and media begin to dig in for clues as we learn that the picturesque marriage of Nick and Amy is not what it seemed. This film is an excellent pot boiler mystery for fans of the genre. Great edge of your seat entertainment. The movie is based on the book of the same name by Gillian Flynn, who also adapted the screenplay. The story and subject matter raised by Flynn's book says a lot about marriage, current societal morays and the evil nature of mankind. So what better Director than David Fincher, his first film since Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011) given his House of Cards break into television. He reteams with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the score. A score much more understated and less noticeable than their other collaborations. Ben Affleck is a very solid choice in casting, given his own real life back and forth media love hate relationship; gambling, cheating. He can turn on the charm and shut it down much better than he could earlier in his career. His range as an actor is improving with each film, which is key in a film that requires the viewer not to be sold on his guilt or innocence. Rosmund Pike, is hauntingly beautiful as the wife. I think this role will make the British actress more of a house hold name this side of the pond. The casting for this film had a lot of front runners in pre production; Maura Rooney, Natalie Portman and even Reese Witherspoon who ended up with a production credit. I think with the past roles they have played none of the other actresses could have pulled off the character of Amy as effectively as Pike. They have all played too sweet, that sugar would mess up the recipe for this film.",

The acting was very good, but then after awhile, given the misguided length of it, the acting became just good, without any superlatives. Could have eliminated about 45 minutes and I would have given it a 7 or maybe 8 - even the 6 that I did give it was probably 1 or 2 too many. That was more for the acting than anything else. Rosamund Pike, whom I'd never seen before, is a beauty (in the beginning) and quite good. The detective and the twin sister of Affleck were very good as well and Affleck also pulled it off. No fan in particular of Neil Patrick Harris, his performance seemed to be pushed into the film and then gorily pushed out of it without having the opportunity (or ability?) to do more. Tyler Perry was a bit too jovial and flip in his role, which he customarily is (in interviews) but I find him a pleasant character. The 2 trailer trash characters could have had their scenes eliminated (although they were good) and had her money taken in some other, briefer way. Too much time spent on her psychopathology without any indication of its possible root. All in all, I was itching to get up and go out much sooner than I actually did. Really disappointed.

A ""killer"" performance from Affleck and Pike, a great screen adaptation from the novel, a great score from Reznor, and some well-done creative liberties from Fincher make this one hard to not get into. It's hard to divulge much of the plot without giving anything away, but let's just say that I thought I was getting a straight forward story/murder mystery that would still be fun to watch but what the film turns into is much more.

In this movie, she goes one step forward and delivers a top notch performance as a sociopathic wife. I also liked the supporting cast out of which C. Coon shines.

Based on the popular novel, Nick Dunne's, portrayed by Ben Affleck, wife Amy, portrayed by Rosamund Pike, disappears. Nick, the focus of intense media scrutiny, becomes suspected of murdering his wife. The first part of the movie flashes back to Nick and Amy relationship, meeting five years ago, until the present day. Both the characters are writers, and the theme whether they are being their real selves with each other plays out. In regards to Amy's Disappearance, you know that only 1 of 2 things is possible ‚Äì Which it is ‚Äì That is revealed half way through the movie. Positives ‚Äì Carrie Coon's performance as Nick's Twin Sister Margo, whose character adds good humor and or spirit, while a lot of the other characters are often dry, and for the most part Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit's performances as the detectives investigating Amy's disappearance. I like Ben Affleck, I think he will make a great ""Batman"" - for this movie, certain scenes I would say he nails it, and certain ones, I would have wanted another take ‚Äì so an uneven performance. While Rosamund Pike isn't bad, I would not call it a ""Breakout ‚Äì Oscar Worthy"" performance, as I have heard it hyped.

Really, I tend to think it was because they spent a good chunk of their hard earned, hard to come by moolah on a dismal cinematic experience. I have noticed lately, bad movies tend to give moviegoers a rather jaded feeling when they are faced with the reality of giving away that hard earned money for a mostly negative experience. The eventuality of it all happens when someone else they know, friends or acquaintances, find out they saw a new release and then ask them ""how was it?"" The painful answer that is given must mask the true reveal of being duped by Hollywood. Go ahead and lie about how you really feel about the flick, even if that means you will give someone else the thumbs up to go ahead waste 2 precious hours they will never get back in their life. Hey! if you don't like it too bad buddy, I did, or at least that's what I told you anyway.

The quality of acting is brilliant, especially Rosamund Pike. The only exception being Missi Pyle as Ellen Abbott who I thought was awful, I cringed every time she was on screen.

About the movie itself I loved that the inicial scene was also the final scene. I also learned that to a lot of people that ending may seem disappointing but I completely loved it and honestly think that was the most appropriate taking in consideration the whole story. I also think that the baby wasn't the only reason that made Nick stay, my interpretation is that they are both kinda obsessed with each other but in different ways being the Amy way more extreme due to her probably being a sociopath or psychopath. But Nick can't leave her and this was pretty clear when his sister said that he wanted to stay and he kept quiet. They have a different and toxic type of love but at the end I really believe that they do love and are obsessed with each other.

Not much to mention on Ben Affleck, but the surprisingly frightening and psychopathic performance from Rosamund Pike might drive anger of one's nerves, and come to a conclusion that she is the perfect role.

This is for people who've already seen the film and who want to hear about other reactions to the ending. I think Pike's character would not have gotten away with killing her ex-lover and blaming him for her kidnapping. (Also, wouldn't the victims cameras have picked up on Pike's moves as she faked the rape using the spilled wine and wine bottle?) There's no proof his car was ever nearby, and no one seems to be curious enough about where the blood came from that was on her kitchen back home. Why weren't they curious about all the items in the shed that weren't used. Who buys golf clubs and never unwraps them? Other reviewers have talked about the half-hearted attempt to burn the diary. My problem, even if the police and FBI were incompetent about investigating her killing of her ex . . . . is why Afleck stays with her. She has no soul and he can't stand her. He's going to throw away the next eighteen years to be with this soulless maniac because she has used his sperm to impregnate herself? He's going to save the kid? Fat chance. That kid will be witness to one of the worst marriages in history. He will grow up with no evidence that families are a place where there is warmth and love. Good luck with that. And anyway, I just don't buy that Afleck's character could put up with her for that long. He hates her. He has her pegged as a sociopath. How can he throw his entire life away like that? I liked him up to that point. He had played his hand so well. Then Ffffffffffffffuf!",

989,31 October 2014,riteshshergill,8, As Much Rosamund Pike's film as David Fincher's,"Yet another Feather in the cap for David Fincher. He is a magician at extracting above par performances from his actors and such is the case with Gone girl. Essentially it is the story of a sociopath (Rosamund Pike's character) who gets married to the ideal guy but later realizes that he was far from ideal. Ben Affleck's character (Nick) wins her over by being somebody he is not and once they do get married, Amy realizes he is not the guy she married. Hence her frustration at making all sorts of compromises within the marriage. As the years go by, she becomes more and more disillusioned and the last straw is when she finds out that Nick is seeing somebody behind her back. This for her is the last straw and she comes up with a plan to frame him for her murder. For the better part of the movie, things go according to plan for Amy up until she gets robbed while hidden away at a lodge. From there things take a turn for the worst and she ends up back where she started. Only problem is that Nick knows what she is capable of now yet has to live a life of compromise with her. That is the end of the movie. There are plot holes.. especially with Amy's story, the one she lets the media and the FBI believe. The first is that when she gets robbed at the lodge, the girl who robs her doesn't recognize her but she knows that she is a woman in hiding. So that is one loose end as far as Amy is concerned. If the girl ever recognizes her and comes forward to tell the cops that Amy was staying at a lodge instead of being tied up in a lake house Amy is finished. The second thing is that we don't see her turning off the cameras at the lake house before framing and killing Desi. But she would've doctored the tapes anyway.. The final hole in her story is that she says that Desi hit her with a blunt object and apparently she lost a lot of blood from the head wound. Problem is there is no head wound when she comes back. Surely the doctors would check her for a concussion after the way she says Desi assaulted her when he 'took' her. And knowing the FBI, they wouldn't get taken in so easily by her subterfuge. They would definitely investigate further and find out the holes in her story. Especially the part where everything ties in a little too conveniently for Amy. Therefore, I believe the ending could've been better. Amy is on thin ice and her story is full of holes.. only a matter of time before the FBI finds out about her. Its just sad that Nick gave in so easily. 8 for the haunting soundtrack and very good performances from the cast, especially Rosamund Pike.",

997,11 January 2015,InMyHonestOpinion,8, Marriage will be the death of you.,"Gone Girl There was a large amount of buzz surrounding this film, already it has won a plethora of awards with more to come this year. Is the film worthy of so many nominations? Perhaps, it all depends on what you want from your films I guess. I guess we have all heard the joke when someone does or say something negative towards their married life ""I'd only get 20 years for murder yet I've got a life sentence with them"" This movie is pretty much that jest put to film. Nick and Amy Dunne are due to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. Nick gets home to find that Amy is gone. Amy is somewhat of a minor celebrity due to her parents writing a series of books based around her younger life called ""The Amazing Amy"", due to this a lot of news reporters ascend on the small town determine to help find Amy. Nick is quickly determined to be the main suspect but without a body the police and services can only accuse him and hope he confesses. A large scale missing persons hunt is arranged, everyone on the lookout for the missing body presumed that Amy has come to her husband's killer hands. As the investigation goes on more and more is discovered about the so called happy couple, more and more it's apparent Nick is guilty but how will the authorities actually catch him out. The screen writer for Gone Girl is actually the same person who wrote the novel Gillian Flynn so you wouldn't expect too much of a difference between the two, but that's actually not the case. There are a lot of things that were in the book that was missed in the film adaption whether that was the directors idea David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club) or Gillian just decided they were unnecessary is unknown, either way the film still works for what it is. The film stars Ben Affleck (Jersey Girl, Good Will Hunting) as Nick Dunne the man/husband accused, who actually does a decent job portraying his character. Rosamund Pike (Jack Reacher, Wrath of the Titans) plays the missing victim Amy Dunne and by far is the standout of the film, she is very convincing in her role. Neil Patrick Harris (How I met your Mother, Starship Troopers) plays Desi Collings one of Amy's ex partners for his small amount for screen time his performance is quite memorable. Carrie Coon (The Leftovers) plays Margo Dunne Nicks sister and again is very good in her role. David Fincher is definitely up there as one of my favourite directors directing some of my favourite films over his career and again I can now add this to my list as another job done well. He has a fantastic eye for details and knows how to get the best out of everyone he works with. Gone Girl is a film you can only really see once to enjoy it in its entirety. A second viewing will always be on the cards but there are no more surprises unfortunately so the second viewing is more to pick up their pieces you missed first time around. I can understand why a few people didn't enjoy the film but I think you need to look at it as a whole picture not just segments. There a lot of flash backs which keep you wanting and needing more, there is enough here to keep all thrill seekers happy. Gone Girl again isn't one for the kids due to some very violent and quite disturbing scenes. It is a great film though and deserves a watch at least once.",

In my opinion, it can be said that ""The Lost Lover"" is not so obvious in comparison with other David Finch movies, but if the people and things that appeared in the previous David movie are us If it is difficult to contact, then marriage really needs a real reflection.
Marriage may not need to be given a definition, either as sweet as some Mary Su movies, or just facing each other. More is full of compromises. Marriage seems to be just for the reproduction of future generations. The society gives people an impression that we do n't know how fertility is so straightforward and violent. Maybe their story is still far away from you, but think about it, is it true that marriage has made you hypocritical and learned to disguise?
Perhaps the film is not as detailed as the book portrays, but the film does give some people who haven't been in contact with the original work a chance to reexamine the marriage. So what are you thinking?",

1027,4 October 2014,lwood28,9, One of My Favorite David Fincher Films Ever Made,"Gone Girl is probably one of my favorite David Fincher films he has directed. The story for Gone Girl is amazing even though it's slow in the beginning but it gets even better during the 2nd act. The story keeps you hooked until the very end. And the story gets crazy and crazier as the story goes on. The acting is very good everyone did great. This is probably one of the best performances Ben Affleck gave and I think Rosamund Pike deserves to be nominated for an award for her performance. Also Tyler Perry gave a good performance too which really surprised me. This movie is based on a novel which I read and the story follows really close to the movie. One thing that they should've changed was the ending. Now I liked the ending but I wished that the filmmakers changed it up a little bit like a ""I didn't see that coming"" moment. If your a fan of David Fincher films check this movie out. If your into mysteries I highly recommend checking this film out you won't be disappointed.",
1028,9 July 2021,kajalkashsinha,7, Overall good,My original rating was 9 I reduced two points for bad ending. It was annoying that she got away with everything got her husband back and a kid. Her husband should have also left but he didn't. I believe there is no perfect crime in this world. Killer leaves some remains behind. There was so many loopholes through which she could have been caught. Like she was not present at his house for 6 days and he was there staying alone. Cctv footage only have one faked video all of the footage would have shown a she was not forced to stay with him. Her ex boyfriend was also accused like this for rape both crime should have linked together. It's not like every man is bad with you raping you and being violent with you . If it's happening then it's common to accuse the victim. May be the problem is in the victim. Victim is framing the crime.,

But nevertheless, entertaining throughout. ",
1031,7 April 2019,ben06,5, Not bad but not good,"Where to begin... Ok the bad and then we can end on the good.
Firstly the plot as it unfolds is predictable at best, there aren't really too many omg I never thought that would happen moments. More like...oh... I kind of thought that was gonna happen. The story gradually just gets more and more ridiculous to the point where you just think why am I still putting myself through this. Plus the plot lines just full of holes. For one Afflek calls the police before even checking with anyone else where his wife might be and then they launch a press release and a statewide manhunt inside a week of her ""vanishing"" he THEN calls her parents to see if she's with them.. Ok he does a really crud job pretending he's sad she's dissappeared but then they were looking to get a divorce so that could be allowed. Moving on we find out that his wife has staged her death to frame him so he gets lethal injection just becuase they had a few marital problems, then runs away only to get busted, meet her ex, slit his throat pretend she was raped and then return back to Affleck somehow insemminating herself with his semen when she didn't want kids!!!!! On a positive note, the camera work and special effects are decent. Story line is mediocre but it does keep you gripped until the end... Certainly nothing to write home about.",
1032,7 May 2015,ItalianBombshell,3," Going, Going, Gone","Man. Sssssiiiiggghhhh...... I was so excited to see Gone Girl. I'd seen the interviews on Jimmy Fallon. I'd read a few reviews that didn't contain spoilers. I was so ready for the ride. I suppose this should be the point where I let y'all know that I simply don't care for movies, television shows that contain gratuitous violence, sex, foul language, and/or violence perpetrated on children. I realize this severely limits my choices, but not really. The key word here is gratuitous. If the film could be done without it and still be as powerful, it's gratuitous. Gone Girl is the Prom Queen of Gratuity. Ben Affleck isn't my favorite actor, but I really appreciated his character and his performance. I do feel like we have seem this character so many times though. Uninvested husband, selfish, adulterous, and slimy. The character is unimaginative, but purposefully so. However, ""Amazing Amy"" is a character that has depth. The fact that her book series, written by her mother, was an actual toy in the early 90's was very distracting for me. I bought the original ""Amazing Amy"" doll for my almost 23 year old daughter for Christmas in 1996. My daughter's doll, thankfully, couldn't be any further from the character of Amy if she tried. But, it was a distracting point for new throughout the story. Amy and Nick, Nick and Amy. Throw in a twin for Nick (Margot) and an incredibly successful/wealthy sweet if patents for Amy, and the plot is even more boring. Boy from the wrong side of the tracks woos rich, troubled girl looking for a bad boy. But, again, deliberately so. Casting becomes surreal with characters that are supposed to emulate Nancy Grace and other criminal pundits that amass and swarm through any major criminal case in our social media these days. The actress was dead on, presenting the exaggerated persona of Nancy Grace to perfection. Sela Ward and Tyler Perry are bit players without any real issues or merit in the film and could have easily been portrayed by no name actors without taking anything away from the film. Neil Patrick Harris does his best at reprising his creepy fall side; seen for one if the first times in this season's installment of American Horror Story: Freak Show. Harris is creepy. But, again, deliberately so. In fact, the character was presented and portrayed without any real imagination or depth. Just a creepy dude with the hots for a crazy chick . The fact that he was naked, murdered while having sex, is really inconsequential. No one really cared because the man wasn't developed to be Anthony more than used. Murdered? Yeah, well, OK. He was creepy. The very much hyped storyline wasn't one that we've never seen before. Amy is a criminal mastermind. I had it pegged by the time she was ""gone""...showing her methods and steps really wasn't all that imaginative either. She was written to be a psychopathic maniac. And she played it exactly as was written. Her lack of emotion was distracting for me. I know we were supposed to be lead by her good looks, her sexual prowess, and her wealth. I wasn't. Neither was my spouse. We were verbally pointing out mistakes made, every time, like....""she used the Punch and Judy mallet, the cops found it, her prints are all over it. He never touched it. Didn't they dust it for prints? And if they did, did they Luminol it too? Bloody fingerprints on the mallet would still show."" Or,""what about the stupid wood shed? All those purchases hidden in Margot's shed. They ran the financial reports, thought he stashed it all there. Did they dust for prints there? No."" And, one of my favorites, ""There are cameras everywhere in the Lake House. But not in the master bedroom? Ummmm, no. We see the camera. We also see that Amy kills him with the box cutter. But there's no camera leading to or from the bathroom or in the bathroom? No camera leading from the kitchen where she obviously took the wine bottle and knife she used to rape herself with? "" Plot holes a semi trick could drive through. And the wrapped Clear Blue Easy pregnancy test before the interview.....Ummmm, yeah, no. All pregnancy test sticks show positive if left long enough."" This was supposed to be the ""must see"" movie. I bought into the hype. I was ready. We were ready. Our date night movie. The most fun was poking holes through the story. So, I guess there's that. Gone Girl. More appropriate title would have been ""Snapped:The Movie""",

Up to here it was very good, but from here on, it goes south, badly! I do not want to ruin it for you, just in case you want to watch it, so I am not going to put any spoilers in, just enough to say, the second half of the story lacks believability, it almost insults your intelligence and indeed those of the law enforcement officers. - Direction, is good - you quickly get to know who is who, and can easily follow the story and the characters, though you just as quickly get to guess what transpires afterwards (and scratch your head in disbelief at the end )! - Acting, is solid, if not brilliant, Ms. Pike is certainly the queen of this movie, though Ms. Coon is a very close second. Mr. Affleck plays his usual ""look at me, I'm stoooped"". Over all enjoyable enough to watch, ultimately let down by the story, which goes daft half way, if only more thought was given on it.",
1050,21 January 2015,nurit-horak,2, lacks credibility in it's portrayal of women characters,"""Gone girl"" is a dramatic film (2014) directed by David Fincher (""The Social Network"")with Ben Affleck. The film follows the story of Nick and the disappearance of his wife Amy. Amy and Nick are presented from their early days as a couple, through the bumps in their relationship and up to the film dramatic conclusion. In the film are three main female characters: Amy, Margo (Nick's sister) and Rhonda the detective (Kim Dickens). The three portray a spectrum of female representations from the most problematic one (Amy) to the most positive (Detective Rhonda). Amy is seemingly the perfect woman. She begins her life as a daughter to parents who write about every experience she has as a child in a successful book series called Amazing Amy. Although the success of the books allows Amy financial freedom it also interferes with the relationship between her and her parents, since it is clear that Amy could never be so perfect as the character her parents have created. On the other hand it seems that in her relationships with men Amy tries to be ""amazing"" as possible or at least in the relationship with Nick as the film describes a sequence of events that mimic a romantic comedy with no connection to reality. Unfortunately this lack of credibility also appears in the rest of the events of the movie. ",

He's a pretty decent actor, in my point of view, but not great. It's amazing how the movie turns the detective work towards us, the viewers; we have to analyze the crime instead of our main character doing it for us. We are the detectives. Could this man be involved? Did he plan it? Or is this a misunderstanding? Just like the trailer, I won't spoil it for you. All I can say is I did not expect what I saw. Rosamund Pike's performance was brilliant. I look forward into seeing her at the Oscars. If they hadn't nominated her, they've haven't even seen the movie. I know she was nominated for a Golden Globe but she deserves more than that. If you liked Fincher's Se7en, I'm sure you'll enjoy the hell out of Gone Girl.

1062,3 November 2014,reoroy,9, An immensely clever movie.,"I watched "" Gone Girl"" yesterday. Its an immensely clever movie directed by David Fincher who is the genius behind the 1999 movie, "" Fight Club "". The movie stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as his wife Amy. Neil Patrick Harris plays Amy's ex-boyfriend Desi. Rosamund Pike portrays troubled Amy Dunne beautifully. This could possibly be her best performance till date. She actually manages to overshadow Ben Affleck's performance in this movie. Her main motive is to keep her husband on a tight leash and one needs to watch the entire movie to find out if she manages to do so or not . Neil Patrick Harris' performance as Desi in this movie is a complete departure from his usual comic roles. He manages to do a good job. Last but not the least, Ben Affleck's performance as Nick Dunne is mesmerizing to say the least. Nick Dunne isn't a faithful husband and he has a very very short temper and is extremely insecure. Which is why his wife plans to teach him the lesson of a life-time. The lady who plays Nick Dunne's sister has also done justice to her character. I have tremendous faith in David Fincher as a director. He has always made sensible movies and I'm sure he is going to make many more good movies like this one. :-)",

1074,1 February 2015,alex-ostime,8, Gone Girl is a 2014 American psychological thriller film directed by David Fincher,"Late to jump on the bandwagon, I only recently watched the highly talked about Gone Girl. Hollywood in keeping with trend, decided to cash in on the success of the best selling book and adapt it into a movie. This is somewhat of a hit and miss topic for Hollywood, there's a myriad of injudicious decisions to put novels on the silver screen in order to replicate its success, such as Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' by Douglas Adams. Conversely, there have been many felicitous film adaptations, from the blockbuster hits of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter to the lower budget more independent films such as American Psycho and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Despite the film garnering so much publicity prior and upon it's release, I was very much in the dark as to what the film was about. The name Gone Girl conjured up chick flick imagery in my mind, I thought it was perhaps a film about a girl finding independence and self- empowerment ‚Äì how wrong I was. Gone Girl is actually a very somber film, the performance Rosamund Pike gives as a psychotic wife resolute on framing her husband really elevates the film's acclaim. Like many I was captivated by her portrayal, I thought she struck the balance between sanity and psychopathy very well, her character for me alluded to Kevin Spacey's in The Usual Suspect in how she was the devil in disguise. Though it is important not to overlook her co-star Ben Affleck's performance who was also a sound addition to the film. Affleck like a fine wine, seems to be improving as he ages, not to say that he was a particularly bad actor, but his repertoire was hardly an illustrious one. His critical acclaim as a director and performance in Argo suggest he is starting down a more revered path (i certainly hope he doesn't go astray with his role as Batman). Affleck was an appropriate choice for the role as the character he portrays mirrors his life and relationship with media in many ways. On several occasions he's been scrutinised by the public in the past and he manages to draw upon these experiences to convey into his character. One of the things that stood out for me was the film's tone and pacing. Despite being a lengthy film, for the most part of it I was constantly intrigued, each scene builds in suspense from the last leaving the viewer wondering what was going to happen. David Fincher the director, truly is a master of his craft, and dark thrillers are his forte. It seems he has a trademark for creating scenes which leave indelible marks on the viewer (take your pick from Fight Club and Se7en) and in Gone Girl he certainly swung for the fences again with one particular twisted scene. I'm talking about the scene in which Rosamund's character slits the throat of her faithful ex- boyfriend during sex. This moment came completely out of the blue for me, it was so gruesome and graphic, the cinematography and blaring intermittent fog horn sounds made for such an original scene. This scene was near the end of the film, and I was eagerly awaiting the climax, but sadly the ending of Gone Girl really fell short and somewhat detracted from the film in what could have been a masterpiece. Alas, Gone Girl doesn't claim that status but nonetheless it was still a thoroughly enjoyable film and to me certainly another one that David Fincher can add to his port folio of accomplished films.",

Comparing a film to a book is like comparing a yacht to a private plane; Sure the literal purpose and end result are the same, but the means and the experience between Point A and Point B are built to appeal to different tastes.

1081,21 May 2020,o-43050,7, Gone Love,"The two-line narrative is a narrative structure that crosses the narrative between the bright line and the dark line, the main line and the branch line. From this film, it can be seen that the male is the bright line, the female is the dark line, the time is the main line, and the diary is the branch line. The narrative structure breaks the previous single-line narrative structure. The shooting skills of the two lines are intertwined. On one side is the police officer 's investigation of Nick and Nick 's review of love. On the other hand, Amy 's diary records gradually lead people to Nick as a murderer. The murderer's facts, under the continuous emergence of evidence and clues, the audience constantly doubts and corroborates his judgment and reasoning about the entire missing event, the interweaving contrast between the main line and the branch line, the two clues support and contradict each other. This means that the audience must constantly overthrow their prior experience with the film, so as to establish another kind of reality in the process of viewing the film, to achieve the reconstruction of the event and the film, and ultimately judge the story's organization and morality. Let the audience truly integrate into the film while enjoying the film, conduct in-depth thinking and interaction, guide the audience to explore the truth, and give the story a unique tension.

There are so many holes in the plot it resembles a pair of my favourite jeans and the characters are so idiotic and, in the case of the police, plodding that it does the book (which everyone tells me is amazing) and modern police methods a disservice.

He is merely a small detail in her transition from the 'All American Girl' to a complete psychopath. ,
1105,6 October 2014,blakelogsdon1,8, Gone Girl helps me cope with the loss of my cheating ex-wife,Gone Girl is a film based on Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel about a couple whose marriage is on the rocks when the wife mysteriously disappears. The husband then becomes a prime suspect in her disappearance. David Fincher pulled off another great feat with this cinematic experience. Gone Girl is high up in the ranks of best Fincher films.

Gone Girl is directed by the Mastermind behind movies like Fight Club,Se7en,The Social Network,Zodiac -- David Fincher -- He just completely blew my mind. Another classic from the ACE Director Fincher. If you think Gillian Flynn's Book is good then you are definitely gonna love this movie. Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot Dunne ,as husband-wife, is a Mystery thriller with some amazing twist and turns that takes place with these couple and how the world & media reacts to them. Movies also goes deep into the thinking of a psychopath and his victim. Fincher directed the movie Perfectly, literally. Star of the movie is - Rosamund Pike - phew!! that girl just nailed the role of a lifetime, an amazing find by Fincher with a perfect role. Ben Affleck is good too but his character is not too expressing, so it was okay. Just 3 hrs ago i thought no movie can outdo the Fight Club, well that thought just got changed. MUST MUST WATCH!!!",

It's well acted by all concerned, although the two leads are hampered by minimal characterisation. Ben Affleck is handsome but naive and fairly dumb.

I've watched more than 2000 movies and I can assure you that even if you like the movie the ending will destroy all those feelings.

First they are described like if they were a perfect couple, but the spectator realize quickly that everything isn't as simple as it seems. In the search of the truth to find back Amy who's missing, you discover that anybody can fake it ¬Ö I enjoy a lot this movie. Usually I am not mad about thriller movie but this one is really gripping ! The movie isn't all about the investigation. Indeed, it takes place in a small town in the United States of America and gives a real criticism of the actual society like in the scene where a women comes not for give some help with the investigation to find back Amy but just to take a selfie with the husband's missing girl and post it on Facebook ! In addition, there are a lot of flash back and you only understand the all story at the end of the movie. The end is really unexpected and well introduced in the film. That's why, I recommend this movie to everybody ! However after have seen this movie, you may have some doubts about the people who are around you.

The cinematography is captivating, the storytelling is masterful, acting is flawless, and the score sometimes turns into the sort of gut-wrenching throbbing and pounding that not only underscore the scene, but rivet your eyes to the screen and set your heart racing.

They have to decide what the story is actually about and discriminatingly pluck snippets from the source material to tell it effectively, all while staying true to the author's intent.

1174,16 February 2015,rs9017720,6, The biggest mixed bag of 2014,"I had high hopes for this movie, but that was probably because I knew nothing about it. I thought it would be a neo-noir, but in the end it plays out more as a thriller. In the first act, Nick realizes his wife, Amy, is gone and believes she has been kidnapped. He seems unshaken at first, which was to make the audience think he killed his wife. This is quite odd however, since in the end it was revealed that he had nothing to do with his wife's disappearance. As this goes on, his wife's diary entries are shown on screen which gives the audience an insight into the couple's past. At this point, I was still looking for small hints and clues in the text, but my attempts were all for naught. The press is outraged at Nick, and believe him to be the killer, but things get more complicated when it is revealed that Nick has been having an affair. This seemed out of character for our ""everyman"", and I first saw it I raised an eyebrow, but its far from the least believable thing presented on screen. That would come when, halfway through the movie, it is revealed that Amy is alive, journal entries war lies, and she wants revenge on her husband for cheating on her. The movie wanted my jaw to drop, but instead, my eyebrow was raised. Her plan is to frame Nick for her murder in the most complicated way possible so that he goes to jail. Instead of just killing him, or whatever. Nick eventually realizes his wife's disappearance was a clever ploy and hires a lawyer, who gets people to track her down. This plot point is only addressed like, one time though, and never comes into play. However, while Amy is away, she is robbed and the pair who did it realize that there is something odd about her. This should have happened a long time ago since the two have watched reports of Amy's disappearance WITH HER IN THE ROOM but this plot point is also swept under the rug. Amy goes to a casino and, by pure coincidence, stumbles upon one of her exes. He takes her into his house because he's an idiot, and she slowly begins her plot to frame him as her kidnapper. For some reason. Seriously, her motivations can be pretty much summed up as ""I was CRAZY the whole time! (except when I wasn't)"". Meanwhile Nick wins over the press and people for apologizing for cheating on his wife. Amy see this and suddenly doesn't hate her husband any more (again, CRAZY! (maybe)) and kills the guy she was with. She then returns home and everyone believes her story, despite holes that even Nick points out. Even his lawyer and the detective working on the case just leave, fully knowing the truth about Amy. Amy then tells Nick she is pregnant with his sperm from the sperm bank and Nick decides to fake his love for her to rise his kid. Then one of the worst endings of all time happens. After all this buildup, the complicated plot, the suspense¬Ö it ends. The movie just, cuts off. This is not an ending you have to think about, either. the writers just didn't know how to end it, so they just did. What the hell. So the plot is full of holes, the characters change their entire personalities in the blink of an eye, and it's on the whole the second most overrated movie of the year (second only to Interstellar), but it is extremely suspenseful, well acted and beautifully shot with great music and a disturbing tone. On the whole, it really is the biggest mixed bag of last year's cinema.",

Gone Girl was seemingly the only thing people were reading that summer and yet when it came time to hand out literary awards, it was completely shut out of the conversation. This is likely due to the fact that those awards are rarely given to any novel that is so neatly slotted into a single genre, in this case mystery. But Gone Girl had become such cultural juggernaut that it was inevitable that it would be adapted for a wider audience (read: moviegoers).

Affleck's performance is campy at best as he trudges around looking like a deer in headlights for most of the movie. The movie also has a ridiculous and completely unbelievable ending.

If what Affleck does is called acting then my pet hamster is Einstein. I logged on here out of curiosity to see how the movie ended and am now thankful that I had the good sense to turn this tripe off early. The detective strolling into Affleck's house with one hand gloved and a cup of coffee in the other whilst chatting to Affleck in what should be a sealed off crime scene was laughable. She and Affleck stroll around the crime scene house chatting away about random nonsense and occasionally the detective whacks a crime sticker on something that might be evidence that she happens to see. How anybody in this dreck got nominated for an Oscar is a mystery?...but perhaps not given the utter nonsense coming out of Hollywood over the last few years. One of the worst ever.

In this movie there were many lies told and evidence to make these lies seem truthful was faked. This movie made me wonder if the same thing happens in real life and how much it does happen. Do people fake evidence and/or lie in court? If so, how many people actually do this? Is the ""truth"" that court trials are supposed to find out the real truth or a truth that people think is the truth but it isn't really. How are they supposed to know if the witnesses are actually telling the truth or just lying? How do they know that the evidence wasn't faked?",

I just sat and thought what? What just happened? Really? This is the end? OK, I just watched it and am angry. If I expected something that trivial I maybe would not write this review.

1187,1 December 2014,harsh-kabeer,10, A necessary antidote to our misplaced modern love!,"Gone Girl is fascinating, and an interesting and amusing take on a dysfunctional marriage (Aren't all marriages dysfunctional?!). I would rather recommend that one should not approach the movie as a mystery suspense or thriller movie. Because that is secondary. The real story is the functioning of a couple, the real genre is the marriage. When two people, passionately in love, come together to tie the knot and say their ''till death do us part'', what happens? Are those fairy tales we watch real? Do we all live happily ever after? The brilliance of the movie lies in its surreal story that is told in an unambiguous, definitive way. There is not a shadow of doubt to as what happened in the movie, but the story itself comes somewhere from the dark recesses of the emotional labyrinthine, a thought we dared not to think, an idea killed at its inception. That is what Gone Girl does. And that is exactly what Fincher loves to do. Tap the darkness. But its darkness is also why sometimes movie indulges in excesses. It is as if Fincher just couldn't get enough of it and overdoes it. Like a child bestowed with the toys he had wanted all along, Fincher just couldn't let it go. Also up to three fourths of the movie, the scale seems to be nicely balanced between Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck, but after that Ben Affleck seems like a victim and the wife as the abuser which many may think to be misogynistic in portrayal, but for me it was just unfair and a blot in otherwise a brilliant take on marriage. In spite of these flaws, Gone Girl is a fantastic movie. Gone Girl ridicules the notion of true love set by the standards of our happily ever afters and the happiness in marriage that this society preaches. Our insatiable diet for the happily ever afters. But then the movie also talks about the beauty of it (as both confess they bring out the best of each other), and it is what makes it so twisted and self destructive. A deal with the devil! Apart from love and marriage, the movie also sets out to give light to the illusory nature of perception propagandized by the media. The movie in the first half is itself ripe of manipulation and debauchery feeding off the ideas that we are too eager and judgemental to make. And how Fincher mocks at us! Brilliantly acted by Rosamund Pike with an able support from Ben Affleck and rest of the cast, it is a must watch. I loved it. And the ending was perfect. Any other ending would have just spoiled the whole movie for me. For me, the blood stained Rosamund Pike in the arms of Ben Affleck with Affleck whispering 'bitch' in her ears while the crowd applauds true love will remain the most iconic 'romantic' scene ever. That scene in itself is an antithesis to all those stories of soul mates and happily ever afters- a necessary antidote to our misplaced modern love!",
1188,5 October 2014,Chrismeister,8, The Media has Full Control.,"Gone Girl, it truly captivated me from the very moment it began. An intriguing, engaging and enthralling ride from start to finish. The performances were excellent across the board, Ben Affleck is an actor that continues to shake any doubt from my mind about his talents both in-front and behind the camera. He shines here in a role hand picked for him by David Fincher, as Affleck is familiar with media scrutiny himself. But the real powerhouse performance was by Rosamund Pike, playing the missing wife. She goes to places I would never have expected and continued to shock and surprise me as the film progressed. The entire film builds up and up, the darkness filling every shot more and more. What appears to be a classic hunt for a missing loved one turns into something far more disturbing and sinister. So much of this was helped by a brilliant ad campaign. This managed to reveal very little about the films twists and sub- plots, while remaining entertaining and peaking my interest.The atmosphere created in this film was largely fulfilled by the score. The music was so ominous and dark, it really helped to add to the disturbing and uncomfortable sequences. David Fincher has always been a director who can create incredibly detailed and rich narratives, and his dark, brooding cinematography really adds to the original source material. Gone Girl is one of Finchers finest films, it is one that will remain in my head for many months and perhaps even years. It will be one of the true greats of 2014.",

They should have just finished the story by having him get revenge on her, but instead, they get some ex- lover involved to take the blame for everything and get killed too. The husband and wife live happily ever after at the end of the movie! How could he even live in the same house with such an evil manipulative psychotic murdering bitch?? How stupid are the police and detectives in this movie? I could go on and on, but you can read the other bad reviews to see how ridiculous the plot and entire movie actually is.

All elements that combined make a really good movie. Add David Fincher's direction and a couple of great twists, you've got an exceptional movie. Gone Girl has no limits in the development of the story. It shows exactly how the public's opinion is fondamental in one's ongoing confrontation with social values. Values that can even alter one's following the principal of ""Innocent until proven guilty"" if they're broken. Nevertheless, the presence of a new and compelling part of the story, is just enough to turn the tables. For the public is gullible, and can be swayed if approached properly.
Rosamund Pike brings to life a character and a performance that is just unheard of. Able to cry on command, ruthless and with a tongue like a serpent. Next to her stands Ben Affleck, who offers a great portrail of a well behaved, edjucated and yet frustrated man, who wishes his wife just didn't exist.

I saw some ads that led me to believe it was about a wife disappearing, so I agreed to watch it with a friend who had rented it. Big mistake. The story line was interesting at first, but the characters ruined it. There wasn't a single character I liked in this film, and I didn't care what happened to any of them. The main characters - the husband, the wife, and the husband's sister - were not people I would want to know. They seemed to be begging for trouble on bended knees, and they got it. This is supposed to be interesting because...? I told my friend I needed to leave, but I didn't tell her that it was because I hated this movie and didn't want to watch another minute of it.",
1210,23 October 2014,sanda_mo-1,10, Dark and twisted - Fincher at his best,David Fincher is David Fincher and in my eyes he can do no wrong (because cinematically speaking he simply never does). Gillian Flynn's book got intense reactions out of its readers. It's a type of story that people either loved or hated and I have a feeling the same will happen with the film. I loved the book but I loved the movie just as much. This ended up being one of those rare situations in which I really did not mind changes made to the story - I think it has a lot to do with the fact that it was the writer herself who was adapting the book and that's probably why the changes did not take away from the impact of the story.,

And worst of all even knowing that it is worth viewing the entire movie to the last minute I will give them that, but it is by all means a real let down on society that we have to simply accept the ending. The film industry used to produce movies that were both classy and intellectually driven. This movie tears it all down and delivers a punch of reality not wanting to see or even know of.

While masterfully shot, this story is boring, long winded and entirely implausible. On a deeper level, Gone Girl becomes disturbingly offensive as the story unfolds. Mirroring the real life murders of Laci Peterson and her unborn child Conner by husband/father Scott Peterson in its set-up, Gone girl takes a turn half-way through which is a slap in the face to survivors and victims of domestic violence. This film perpetuates the narrative which abusers depend upon to control others through invalidation and gas- lighting. At its core, Gone Girl has nothing to say, nor original story to tell. By ignoring the overwhelming statistics of the number of women killed and then disappeared by their abusive spouses, Gone Girl is a significant set-back to the movement to end domestic violence. ",

Because this movie committed the cardinal sin that the media doesn't like --it actually criticized the press (and made them the lazy indolent villans they usually are). You can see it very obviously in the character who shows up towards the middle of the movie who's obviously based upon Nancy Grace.

1221,2 February 2015,Qwillprojects,7, Gone Girl...who came back,"Gone Girl was advertised as the suspense thriller of the year! Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. The only way to break this down is to break it apart, as the film began it wasn't long before I knew what the plot was (about when Nick arrived home to his missing wife and a staged break in). I said to myself ""oh the wife did it, she's setting him up"", the reason this was evident was because there were no other characters of importance introduced in the film it was only logical. Nonetheless, as I watched this plot unfold with Nick trying to stay one step ahead of the police, who desperately want to pin the murder/disappearance of Amy on him. About halfway in, a little over an hour Amy's ingenious plan is revealed about how she goes about framing Nick to get him put in jail. Now Pause right there, at this point the movie could have ended and been a very solid film. But there was still an hour and 20 minutes left, where we go to see a string of what I would call pointless short films attempting to tie into the first half of the movie. There was no real Need for Tyler Perry's character, he did not add or subtract from the film. Rosamund Pike stepped out of her typical supporting female role to command your attention in this performance. Understanding this was an adaptation from the book, there are things that the book can elaborate on that film cant, or shouldn't for that matter. In this case David Fincher should have found a better way to execute the third act.",

Not only was I surprisingly impressed with Ben Affleck in this film but the entire supporting cast did a tremendous job of selling this tense set of circumstances.

Those familiar with the book, which starts out as a portrait of a seemingly perfect marriage and quickly turns into a literary trip down the Autobahn, will not be disappointed. Fincher, working from a script adapted by Gillian Flynn, weaves through every twist and turn with ease, helped along the way by a beautiful, yet subtle score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The end result, a two and a half hour ticking time bomb dropped in your lap that you can't wait to explode. Once again, Fincher delivers a dark, twisted vision that is a perfect mix of all of his films, rolled tightly into one violent little package. ",

It is well made and the performances are all fine, although none of the characters really is as deep as they might should have been. Except maybe for Neil Patrick Harris character, which comes of as extremely bland to me. But I think the main problem with the movie is, that the reveal that Amy is still alive comes before the half of the movie, I think it would have been much more interesting to see him build up as more of a bad guy, because as soon as you see her alive, you know all is a scam and what Ben Afflecks character really did to her is totally unclear. He might have hit her, but he might not. It really felt this was some kind of end of the movie reveal that turns everything around, but then you have still over an hour of movie left and that doesn't make much sense to me. The story in itself isn't too bad, but of course not very believable, to put it mildly. And some of the dialog is hard to listen to because it's just awkward and doesn't work.

And the idea of the wife getting back to him after all that, even more. Unfortunately, this film didn't make the most of it, mainly because the plot is rattled with holes. Even if the police and the FBI agents were complete idiots, there are things that make the story extremely unconvincing. The diary didn't burn entirely. After the wife appears in the end, there are no signs of wounds that would have caused such excessive bleeding consistent with the marks in the kitchen. And I don't think people get released from the hospital all covered in blood. Amy's story in the end, when she talks to the police in the hospital makes absolutely no sense and it is really hard to believe the FBI agents accepted it just like that.

Holes will exist in almost every film, and who have not seen it yet, will notice this a few in this movie, as well as some very surreal situations ..

Great acting and direction all round....with my only gripe being about the rather poor audibility of some scenes, particularly in the first 15 minutes or so. Yes, the characters here are talking in low voices - but I would prefer to be able to make out the dialogue. Not an issue if you have the DVD and can switch on subtitles of course.

I am a really big fan of Gillian Flynn's three novels and Gone Girl was the one who drug me to read the other three. I honestly declare that while watching the movie at home with my wife yesterday, I was very sure I was seeing the pages turn in front of me as if I am re-reading the book, yet the content was missing. I really liked in the novel the bond of Go and Nick in the movie; the Amazing Amy's psychological disturbance, and the utterly unfair missing link of the twins' father. I must admit that Ben and Rosemund were truly great in the movie however there were things I did not like or did not want to like, since I had such a great passion for the book itself. Amy was evil in the movie but she is a demon in the novel. Nick was a coward in the novel but it showed he was not that much of a coward in the movie. I gave the movie a 7 because of Flinch and the smart directing. I also loved the cinematography and the story telling, where in the book it is different when we see what Nick tells us and then we see Amy's point of view. All in all the movie was good, at least it brought the book to life. I am still wondering about the ending of both the movie and the novel, I still cant decide which has a better one!",

It would make a poor afternoon made for TV movie. This is not to denigrate all those who strive to achieve entertainment in that genre. In fact I have seen a few afternoon ""real life dramas"" that leave this overlong piece of overlongness in the bin The acting was formulaic. they must all be congratulated on keeping a straight face and carrying on with such a convoluted, preposterous plot. I felt most sorry for the female detective who starts out strongly and obviously in awareness of her legal obligations and then ends up dealing with an army of stupid plot twists that nobody in their right mind could give a care about. Which reminds me! What was the point of Ben Affleck returning his dad to a care home? Don't waste my time again!",
1281,15 February 2017,majaho21,2, Totally disappointed,"Gone Girl is supposed to be a mystery/thriller but does not fit into the genre. If fails at the first premise of a thriller - the plot's not serious and it insults the viewers' intelligence. *Spoilers* Police officers who investigate the disappearance of the leading female character (Amy) don't strictly follow the usual criminal procedure. For example, there were forensic experts at the ""crime scene"", that is, in the house of the Dunnes, but they didn't immediately search surrounding sheds or the garage. The prime suspect (Amy's husband) was allowed to enter and exit the house whenever he wanted,even after the police had found out the kitchen floor, which everyone was walking across the previous day, was covered in blood. The middle part of the film gives the viewers a very interesting plot twist. The focus changes from a ""guilty"" husband to an intelligent, revenge-seeking and deranged wife.As Amy put it ""I'm so much happier now that I'm dead"". Amy had a plan to frame her husband and her wit and ideas are quite entertaining. In my opinion this should be enough to bring this film to an end. Unfortunately, the story becomes silly and subplots completely redundant at this point. Why the scene when Amy smashed her cheek bone with a hammer? Why did she naively drop the money bag behind the motel?, Why was the character of the stalking Mr Collings even introduced - to bring more crazy and psychotic creatures to the film?, Why was Amy covered in blood during the talk to the police?, Why did Amy's husband stay with her? I think it would have been better if the film hadn't got lost in the surreality. The average viewer can't help him/herself from counting plot holes.",

This film evidently asks me and indefinitely asks you that is it good to be married or is it really a correct path that you are going if you are cheating on your wife just beacuse you are not happy with her. This is a crime thriller with dark comedy which keeps you on the hook even after the film is finished by leaving lingering questions taken by the character's situation. Rosamund Pike is so flawless even in the movie and as well as doing over the top drama, so does Ben Affleck. In the end she says that what she did was all for her husband.

I get that Fincher tried to make Neil Patrick Harris a red herring, but it doesn't work when he is too over the top that he's obviously not the villain. I haven't read the book so I don't know if it is a successful adaptation or not, but as a film I though it was enjoyable, even if it did lose focus around the second act.

As an avid movie lover who's disappointment in current movie productions, I was glad to have not been told the entire plot in the previews.

1304,15 February 2015,jasonpfaff23-240-274112,8, Fincher doesn't make bad films,"I find David Fincher's films based on fiction (like Fightclub) more imaginative versus his non-fictional projects (Social Network), and I'd put him alongside today's top directors like Aronofsky and Nolan easily. Gone Girl (adapted from the novel by Gillian Flynn) touches on marriage/relationship themes like other notable films (Revolutionary Road, American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut), but with deeper satire and an 'up to date' stance. Fincher has a way of reflecting the more interesting parts (and dark corners) of the collective consciousness (especially Americans) in a humorous way, sometimes veering towards an artistic activism of sorts (but its just 'entertainment' and simply pointing out issues will not magically make them go away). I wasn't sold on Rosamund Pike's performance until later in the film and it was nice to see a more raw and fanatical version of her than usual. This film's attitude and satire reminded me of films by Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), plus older films like Heathers (Michael Lehman) and Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone). Gone Girl is ambitious in that it reaches for a wider audience in obvious and more subtle ways, infusing the 'law of reflection' to play with our minds (notably challenging our perception of who the antagonist is)- there are no 'winners', just human beings perceiving from their own experience (nicely balanced male and female point of view), resulting in a zero sum score. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide an appropriate and subtle soundtrack.",

Gone Girl is trying very hard to be like the overrated Prisoners (2013 in the way the story is told and the way it looks. I hate this ""new"" slow quasi absurd way to tell stories; portrayed as real/believable and at the same time totally unreal/unbelievable. This is a hopeless and a boring ""new"" trend in Hollywood at the moment. Even though I thought Nightcrawler (2014) was an okay movie it follows the same boring concept. In my book either you try to tell a believable ""real"" story or a fictional story. You cannot be both, it is simply impossible. This is no new trend, Tarantino and others have use this method of telling stories for a long time. So don't be fooled by the good reviews, this movie stinks on almost all levels.",

1325,27 January 2015,balzano_receipts,10, Magnificent Thriller!,"Gone Girl is a very dark suspenseful film. It has all of the elements of a mystery story. However, this film has a major twist. When the twist happens the film switches lanes completely. The movie is almost two and a half hours long, but that doesn't even begin to capture everything. The movie was brilliantly written and directed. From the cast to the acting to the camera angles; this movie is sheer perfection. When I first watch the movie, I felt like time flew by, and nonetheless I was left wanting more... but that's an awesome thing. The movie is slow moving for the first 20 minutes so you just have to be patient but it becomes extremely fast incredibly quickly and the pace is so fast you'll have to keep up. (No bathroom breaks!) I truly believe that this movie deserves for the audience, for someone to really enjoy it, to watch it at least 2 or 3 times. If you watch this movie over and over, then you'll notice things that you didn't know were there the previous times you'd watched it. This movie is intense yet haunting. I feel like the music really creates the suspenseful image, also; it worked extremely well with the plot and acts being played out on screen. The performances in this movie are outstanding. I feel like Ben Affleck is mysterious and lustful and plays the part perfectly. I also feel that all of the other actors in the film went well above their standards. Rosamund Pike absolutely knocks it out of the ballpark. I'm ecstatic that Pike is nominated for a Academy Award. In my personal opinion, Rosamund Pike, well there's no other way to put it other than she plays an upstanding psychotic woman. This is Rosamund Pike's big break. I hope she continues with her acting career and the acting skills she portrayed in Gone Girl. The movie is full of twists and turns and I don't think you truly see what's headed your way. This isn't your typical mystery movie. This is not your average suspenseful thriller. This is by far director David Fincher's best work. If you really want entertainment, if you want to be on the edge, and if you really want to watch a film that is completely unpredictable, then I HIGHLY recommend Gone Girl for anyone who likes to be surprised.",
1326,13 October 2014,erinsm,7," Great Actors and Concept, Poorly Executed","Nick and Amy Dunne seemed to have the perfect marriage. Amy is a writer, worth millions and well known for the ""Amazing Amy"" series she writes, an embellished tale of her life as a young girl. Amy is married to the love of her life. But her seemingly perfect marriage begins to unravel when Nick's relative becomes ill, forcing an unwilling Amy to give up her posh NY lifestyle so that the couple can move to the small town of Carthage, Missouri to help his family. Amy becomes further perturbed when both she and Nick lose their jobs and she discovers shortly before their fifth wedding anniversary that he is having an affair with a young college student. A distraught Amy then hatches a brilliantly twisted plan: to disappear, commit suicide, and frame her husband for her murder. Unfortunately, what should be the best part of the story comes out less brilliant and more banal, highly convoluted and overdone despite a nearly immaculate performance by lead actors Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Amy reveals a highly paranoid fear that Nick may kill her in lengthy journals that are later revealed to be mostly fake. She turns their anniversary clue game into another opportunity to frame him, forcing Nick and his sister Margo, along with Nick's lawyer, Tanner Bolt, to find Amy before they run out of time. As they search, Amy escapes, taking on a new identity. In the end, Amy meets her match in a former love, Desi Collings, whose obsessive feelings for Amy frighten her so much that she kills him in order to escape, faking the story of a captive rape victim to endear herself to the public even more and allowing her to return to Nick. A worthwhile thrill ride, one has to admit that most of Gone Girl will leave the watcher shaking his or her head.",

1328,2 August 2015,kevinlienhagen,8, Great Movie (Do NOT listen to these 1/10 reviews),"Contains Spoilers This movie was amazing. That is not what this feedback is about, this is about all the angry haters which give this a low score for unpropability. So yes, movies have plot holes, and a movie with this much attention to detail is bound to have some mistakes. But these people giving hate reviews are so narrow minded (or stupid) that they DO NOT see what really happened. Here are some examples. 1. The diary. Desi did NOT burn the diary, and this is so obvious i do not see how people thought this happened. The police also know Desi did not burn it. The husband did this to protect himself, and this is what he did there when the alarm went off. You also say ""but why didn't he properly burn it"". The wife changed the password so it would look like the alarm went off and stop him from burning it properly, thus causing the police to find it later on. This is even shown in the movie! 2. The cameras. I get that if you analyze the situation she might have done unexplainable things infront of the camera, but common, she is smart in this movie. She have probably stayed cleared of them and made the footage show another story. Also being his prisoner does not mean she is crying 24/7 and he is hurting her 24/7. 3. The injuries. She was raped, and had wounds consistent with that. She had rope marks etc. She didn't claim to be injured in other ways. The blood was from HIM, and they knew that. I am guessing she asked to have the blood on her for the media to feel sorry for her, and to help her story. 4. The kidnapping itself. I get that this is a hard one, and yes, this one is flawed. But here is what happened - Desi forced himself into the house. He flipped the table, and went on a rampage. He then took the club and hit her. Yes, he did not use a knife. She obviously got knocked out and bleed om the spot. This is why there is not blood all over the place. I get that its a lot of blood for a hit in the face, and they could have kept it down, but this is somewhat plausible. Lets say she bleed out of her nose, this explains why there is not blood from her to his car. Easy to control. 5. There are so many small things you could find wrong, but that matter little and probably have an explonatiom, the movie just does not show us this because its already 2,5 hours long! All the ""major"" plot holes these people have found are wrong. They just cant pick up all the small details, and see that a movie cant show us every single explonation without becoming a TV series! Great movie, would recommend, but it requires a brain if you are out to find mistakes that aren't there",

There wasn't a performance in this film that wasn't overacted or forced...I am assuming that the actors were attempting to make the connection that the female lead was portrayed in caricature in children's books, hence the wooden, almost comical performances, or caricatures, of the roles they were playing in terms of plot development. I hated the actors for knowingly portraying the characters of what could have been an engaging, enthralling story in such a fashion...it almost came off like a comic book version of the story (e.g. Sin City). The delivery of lines gave the movement of the story a rapid-fire, ""thump-thump"" pace that distracted from the overall flow of the storytelling. If you want to see an effective homage to noir done right, rent ""Basic Instinct"" and stick this mess on the shelf to collect dust with the other poor thrillers (thinking of several David Caruso bombs of the 90's).",

This is a tougher ask than The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, because the film is a very different creature if you have read the book, the category I fall into. It's a book famous for its twists, and there are many, so Fincher had his job cut out for him when pinning down the reasons for making the film in the first place, which are not entirely answered ‚Äì which turns out to be the greatest problem with Gone Girl, even if shying away from making a statement has become something that we who love Fincher automatically know to associate with all his films. In my previous Fincher reviews, I've called this struggle the adman versus the creative ‚Äì perhaps auteur is a better word there. The very choice of Gone Girl as a subject piece for Fincher tells us he has placed the auteur on the back-burner and he's out to make one of those Fincher films that seems to be saying something meaningful at its surface, but in reality is doing nothing more than adhere to a zeitgeist. He's done this with his last three films, including Gone Girl, a thing we critics fumblingly call ""style over substance"" but is more the thinking adman's ability to zero in on what we want to watch on our big screens (and subsequently small ones ‚Äì both of which are comfy Fincher territory) even if its tricky to know exactly what it is that he is selling.",

1364,30 March 2020,arindamkalita-11041,8, Thought-provoking,"So, the Academy award nominated movie Gone Girl was adapted from 2012 novel with the same name. This movie is about a husband whose wife goes missing. And now, rumors are going on everywhere about what happened to this girl? Where is she now? Is she a victim of some kind of abduction? Is Affleck involved in this whole thing somehow? This is without a doubt one of Ben Affleck's best performances ever. He is so perfectly fits in this role. Rosamund Pike is also excellent in this movie.
As the movie progressed, it continuously got darker and darker. It really makes you think differently about the way we view the media, about the way we view the news and about the way we make our own judgment afterwards without even knowing anything about them at all. That's something this movie shows so well; about how the news and the media can affect a situation. What I love about this movie is that there are so many hidden dark secrets of both the main characters. The story is very dark and also very rude. The various twists and turns in the movie come in a very perfect and natural way. That is a great screenplay done by Gillian Flynn. Tyler Perry was also great in this film. Neil Patrick Harris is just about okay in his role. All in all this is a flawless, well made movie, dramatically powerful and wonderfully directed.",

This movie also makes an ironic ""roast"" to the media, by showing the dirts of the actions of the media, that many times (try to) choose a scapegoat just to divide people's thoughts and bring more audience.

1371,19 October 2014,fernestar,8, Gone Girl. She be gone!,"I wasn't planning on seeing Gone Girl, but I'm glad I did. For a movie that has a listed running time of 149 minutes ‚Äì which translates to 3 hours plus of cinema chair buttock time ‚Äì it engaged for the entire period, with no lulls or 'boring bits'. At its core Gone Girl is a dramatic mystery, although moments of humour and horror are applied to provoke audience reaction ‚Äì a particular standout moment had everyone in the cinema looking at each other with ""damn', did that just happen!"" across their eyeballs. You'll know the bit. The situational drama becomes ridiculous and convoluted - but at the same time is entirely believable. To allude to the plot would ruin much of the surprise, but the initial premise of 'girl is missing' is built upon to reveal a far more interesting tale. The polish of the movie should hardly be surprising really ‚Äì David Fincher (Fight Club, Social Network) continues to direct story adaptations to a very high standard, capturing the ambiance of suburban America and providing a commentary on the role that sensationalised media and the age of instant communication can have in preconceiving instant judgements. Oh yeah, and the circumstances surrounding (some) missing people. The acting performances are delivered very well across the board. Ben Affleck's second coming continues (let's hope it carries on for Batman vs!), but it is Rosamund Pike that really stands out. She has been in a lot of films I've seen recently (A Long Way Down, Hector and the Search for Happiness, What We Did on Our Holiday) with Gone Girl delivering the most complex and complete character performance yet. It wouldn't be surprising to see recognition come awards season. Added to the great direction and quality acting is another grade A theatrical score from Trent Reznor ‚Äì the electro classical combination creates genuine moments of disquiet and tension at key points as the plot unfolds. So why wasn't I hyped for Gone Girl in the first place? I mean, the movie doesn't really have any faults. Well, it was a case of the trailer judge hitting the hammer and missing the mark. The trailer looks like it tells you the entire story, in what felt like a desperate attempt to garner interest ‚Äì but that was a very incorrect assessment by myself. If you like good quality drama stories, take the time to watch Gone Girl, it doesn't feel like 3 hours.

I am capable of suspending disbelief for the sake of a good story with unexpected twists but the twist in this story comes so early that the viewer can spend the next hour pulling apart everything that is wrong AND everything that goes wrong with the plot from that point on. My first signs that the movie was in trouble were when a nation wide search is conducted a missing woman wouldn't consider a better make over? Maybe black hair? just an idea. As for killing her rich stalker ? This is where the story goes from OK to ridiculous. Camera footage in the house ,alibi, the diary?.. it felt like the last 30 mins was supposed to be 1.5hrs and they shortened the movie and expected us to just assume that checks were done by the FBI etc. A sign of good story is where you read IMDb goofs and go ""hey I didn't notice that "" not finding yourself constantly saying to yourself ""hey...that would NEVER happen"".

Its like the movie shook hands with the devil. An innocent soul murdered having no justice. Even in the end. Plus that woman Amy. She was so gorgeous in the beginning but began to annoy me later as hell would annoy heaven. Yeah. She was supposed to be the bad girl. But she was cast so horrible. Her character was later disgusting I actually wished he killed her. This movie went all good and seemed so promising until it revealed to have no justice. Its like encouraging women to commit disgusting crimes like she did and simply get away with it. Men to be manipulated like puppets. This is just ridiculous I felt bad watching it. It changes the image for women.,

I thought the way the story develops and twists was brilliant. About half way through I thought it was all going to be about The husband and keep you guessing as to whether he had killed his wife, but then - bang - it all changes and takes a different direction. Loved how the story developed and some quite shocking bits too. So why only 6? Quite simple. The end! The very last scene totally spoilt the movie. This is a story and movie that needed to be concluded and it wasn't. The cliff hanger end just does seem appropriate for this story. I don't mind movies that do this but this movie should have finished the story. Totally ruined it for me. Sad but it probably means I won't watch it again. Really disappointed.",

Amy is portrayed smart and psychotic but it does not mean that she is soooo brilliant that she can come up with a plot which is flawless and make sense to all the audience. The film clearly shows how there is pressure from the society and how much people loves Amy. Police looks at evidence when they investigate a case. Furthermore, they are just town officers.

The movie messes with your head which to me is far better than another mindless shoot-em-up, explosion-happy Hollywood time-waster. I suspect the negative reviews here are from the transforming, talking robot with attitude from space, movie crowd who are quick to point out a plot hole in movies they don't like while completely ignoring the massive elephant in the room plot hole in their favorite movie.

I was so thrilled to watch the movie! 45 minutes in, I was so filled with disappointment and anger that I couldn't even finish watching this disgraceful piece of trash. Rosamund Pike completely ruined the entire concept of ""Gone Girl."" Not only did her cold, monotonous, almost masculine voice destroy the role of Amy, but so did her stark, uninviting appearance. Absolute terrible choice of actors overall. There was so much lack of emotion and tone that this ruined the movie alone. As a side note, the actress who played Margo did a poor job too. In the book, these characters are lively with high emotion, taking the reader on a psychological roller coaster ride. The movie almost put me to sleep. Overall, a very, VERY poorly-done rendition of an extraordinary novel. Gillian Flynn, I am very, very sorry you must endure this.",

The main elements that I loved about the movie was that it gave us the urge to investigate the case before the police does and find out a logical solution. But I can assure you that no one can. It was also very realistic in view. It was presented in a way that an average viewer would see a crime investigation at home on T.V news. I can very well say the acting was awesome. The movie is unbelievably long but you wont feel it to be long and I believe that it was a tough experience to emulate. Fincher has done it again.,

1424,25 April 2015,sphanish,8, gone girl is an epic drama about vengeance and betrayal put together in a twisted manner.,gone girl is an amazing movie. through its 2 hours 30 min run i never felt that the movie was drifting off its premise. it had me at the edge of my seat through out and couldn't wait for the mystery to unravel. gone girl had me wrapped like a cold blanket of ice and the soundtrack only helped to make gone girl a chilling captivating experience(would like to take aside and give a thumbs up to Trent reznor and atticus Ross for doing such a wonderful job on the score). along with an amazing story gone girl also had strong hold of amazing acting and i do think that casting in comedy actors like Neil Patrick and Tyler perry who both have starred in strings of popular comedy movies was a pretty dumb thing to do. at the end i guess it worked well because both Tyler and Neil bring nothing new to the table. this is equalized by the amazing performance delivered by Rosamund pike and surprisingly good Carrie coon. who i got to admit did a pretty good job. Ben affleck in this movie is at his average. altogether gone girl is an amazing drama mystery movie with some really good acting and music and is a fun watch. it wouldn't let you down at any moment and you get what you expected.

Mystery films are among my favorite genres and this is one of my favorite films. It grabbed my attention from the start and I was interested in seeing what happens next and very interested in how it was going to end. There is a great twist in this movie unlike any I have ever seen.

The Gone Girl is a beautiful sweet and sour satire to the modern family in which the institution of marriage is observed and analyzed from a cold and ironic angle. The whole movie is a trial in which each character is analyzed and over-analyzed only to show the absurdity of doing this thing in the first place. No wonder that Kafka novel is called ""The trial"". The book/movie shows the beautiful and sacred mission of marriage which has been transformed by our natural imperfection (craziness included)in a show for a given audience (mass media, family, neighbours, etc.), a peer pressure factor that gives out sentences in the name of everything but reality. The movie/book is about acceptance. The domestic blame that the author beautifully is moving around for us to accept is only the bait that will take us nowhere. The author is kind of saying us, ""grab a mirror""... and use it.

1459,14 March 2020,Sleepwalker04,9, David Fincher hits the ball out of the park.,Wow...Gone Girl is easily the best film of last 10 years for me. Seen it multiple times already. Rosamund Pike was born to play Amazing Amy. She has gone beyond amazing. Oscar would have been nice . Rest of the cast is great too. Ben Affleck does justice to his character. Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens also shines in their respective roles. Amazing film by a great Director who knows how to get the best from his actors. Must watch.,

1461,13 January 2015,ashane-mizanian,9, A fantastic thriller !!!,"This might be the most amazing story writing skills in years maybe. An amazing thriller. But the movie is too long and and lack of realistic. But the acting skills were amazing. But I think Neil Patrick ( Desi ) needed more character development into it hence his acting must be praised. And the directors were able to play with our minds by drivings us more and more into the movie. I recommend this movie for people who are above 18. Not because of the sexual scenes or behaviors, this movie tells a story about a cheating husband and a crafty wife. So it is obvious that people need experience in order to feel this movie. Overall I must say "" Best thriller in decades ! """,

I know, that sounds crazy, but that is how I am left after watching this movie.. I was psyched to see another Fincher movie and I went in to it with high hopes but an open mind. It starts slow as molasses and that isn't necessarily bad when it is done well. I think the idea here was to really feel the emotions and the pace of what they were going through at the start of the story. The last hour or so is really great but when I think about great movies I think about movies that keep me entirely fixated for the duration. This movie did not, I could have been cleaning the kitchen while watching this and not stop and just watch. So that is why I say it could go either way. I have really enjoyed Ben Affleck in his last couple movies. He is the kind of actor you love or hate and I don't hate him. The final word is this movie is through and through Fincher, very interesting plot, and long and slow.",
1465,12 January 2015,Nydezsh,10, review on movie and novel,"Flynn, whose novel the movie is based on, has done a wonderful job with the screenplay. With the plot cutting back and forth in time, and everything coming together in the end, it's just amazing to witness the story unfold. It is evident that the director has made the movie with extreme care and effort. Every scene has a sense of dread and movie has the intended effect of eliciting a chill down your spine and a sense of shock and disgust. The score and picture quality also add a creepy feel to the entire movie. Ben Affleck who plays the husband, strikes the right notes and manages to make you empathize with him. Its Rosammund Pike, however, who plays her mysterious character in a way that is both mesmerizing and chilling. The scenes of nudity could have been toned down a little, but with such a movie, I was expecting it anyway. The controversial ending was one of the main issues I have with the movie. Of course, it's based on a novel and followed the same story, but I would have wished for more closure than what was provided. I was more shocked at how abrupt the ending seemed, than any of the other frequent shocking revelations throughout the movie.The movie is a flawless piece of entertainment that will keep you gripped for its entire runtime and leave you wondering about it for days. If not for the ending, I would be completely satisfied with it. If you have read the book and know the ending, this should be the best movie this year for you. But if you haven't, just don't expect a great finish and you should really love the flick. I will go with an 10 out of 10 for this great tale.",

1474,29 October 2014,cristinamaymi,10, The Gone Girl Impact,"When Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, was over and the lights in the theater were starting to slowly brighten, I was unable to get up from my seat. What had just occurred in front of me was, well incredible. I had never seen a film before that was so predictable but not. The mystery drew me in but the intensity is what kept me there. With every passing minute I was clutching my seat, widening my eyes, and waiting (very impatiently) for events to be explained. The movie starts with Nick Dunne (Affleck) starting the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to his wife, Amy Dunne (Pike), at a bar. There he talks to his sister, the bartender, about the struggles he is experiencing in his marriage. When he gets a call from one of his neighbors that his cat was outside of his house, he rushes home. There he not only finds the cat but the front door is open with nothing in the house to be found other than what looks like a struggle in the living room with a broken coffee table and flipped over furniture. When Nick goes looking for his wife in the house he cannot find her and automatically calls the police. As the police start to uncover hidden details in Nick and Amy's life, including Amy's diary of secrets, the finger is pointed at Nick. As the film goes on you cannot help but try to solve the mystery that writer Gillian Flynn set up, however the plot has so many twist and turns that it is nearly impossible to keep up. Director David Fincher uses a lot of key lighting to enhance drama and suspense. The use of color in Amy's diary to represent different entries is also very telling in the long run. This film is the best film I have seen all year and it is because of the strong and intense actors, Affleck and Pike, and also because of the production and delivery of the film its self. It was clear that every detail from lighting to sound to camera shots was put together with precision and thought. I find the scariest films to be about what could really happen in what seems an ordinary life, and for Nick and Amy, the nightmare has just begun.",

It is an unforgettable beginning, one that comes to mind abruptly late in the film when the chaos has come full circle, and Nick is standing at the exact same spot in the early morning, except this time the curb is lined with television trucks.",
1477,17 March 2015,maddiemooox,9," Thrilling, convincing and very realistic","One of the things I really liked about the film is that even by watching the trailers, interviews and critic ratings I still had no idea of what I was in for. Gone girl has to be one of the best, well directed, well casted films I have seen all year. I thought the dialogue was very unique, the acting was very convincing and it left me speechless when the end credits finally came up. 'Gone Girl' is a very good example about how people are treated in the media on a regular basis, and the way people are shown to the world and judged and how intimidating attention from show hosts, reporters and journalists can be and how it changes the way you look at people in the media. This is the first time I have seen Rosamund Pike in a film and I thought she did a brilliant job of recreating Amy. I loved the relationship between Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike and how well they created it for the big screen, both of their characters where extremely convincing and even though you feel like you shouldn't care about Nick near the start of the movie, as it gradually took off I really did care about Nick and that does say something about his character. The storyline was very unexpected in some cases, it was very gripping and interesting there was not one moment where I felt like it dragged or took a while to build.",

1485,24 July 2016,nishanthzerocool172,9, Gone Girl - Movie Experience,"Marriage, in most sense, is a socially recognized union between two people that establishes rights and duties between them, including their children and their in-laws. And in most cases, that union doesn't last for a very long time. Questions arise between the spouses that lead to many challenges. What are you thinking? What are you feeling? What have done to each other? What will we do? My first praise goes to the story (or the screenplay) because the common subject of marriage problems after a recession has been beautifully twisted in the most conniving and manipulative manner. The novelist, Gillian Flynn, has penned the screenplay herself. I don't know whose decision was that, but it was a good decision in the end. The unfolding of each character, the non-linear narrative jumping between happy times and bad times of the couple, and the twist that leaves you mesmerized makes us completely attached to the characters. My unique experience from this movie is that my fellow peers had failed to notice many dark humorous dialogues, and most of the times I ended up laughing alone in the theater.",

Amazing screen play but still there were a bit of scope to be improved. Negligible flaws which are easily Identifiable and they are illogical too. A lot of good scenes will keep you enjoy watching the movie. Too many twist aren't really made it bad. Many cases you will try to interrupt your own side of the story, the moment you try to switch you will be brought back again to the same space where you were lost.

The cops get off quite well considering the regular ""robbery gone wrong"" or ""suicide"" conclusions for real life cases. The television opinionaters could have come straight off air with their bloviating b s and the complete lack of consequences for their actions and hyperbole. Having worked in media for over thirty years, I'd strongly suggest not instantly believing what is presented for your consumption, especially if it slots in nicely with your belief system unless there are facts, verifiable facts and actual evidence, not just words and beliefs.

Don't forget the masterful eye of David Fincher. Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is surprisingly good after those Madea movies he gets this, Neil Patrick Harris is good, anyone you see is good, and the twists and intense is no less than great this is one of the best movies I seen in while, certainly best movie so far as this year but it's going to be tough to beat Gone Girl. I got to say I did see one twist but it was only like a minute before they shown it. I couldn't stop watching it I didn't want it to end and that's the Only movie I ever saw to say that and I have to praise this movie for this achievement and thank you for making this movie Thank You",

1522,15 November 2014,D_Dijkstra,6, Not worth your money if you've read the book.,"If you know how the book ends, I would not recommend that you spend money to watch this film. The book is much more complex and layered than the film, while the film has a relatively simple narrative which strongly simplifies, while nothing much is added to the original story except for a parade of explanations. I believe that the central plot twist, which is clear enough from the first shot, is explained a total of six times. Are there really people out there who need something explained to them six times in the space of half an hour? Also, the role of product placement in this film is a further indicator that the people who made this film believe that you are an idiot. One of the first lines of dialogue between Nick and Amy goes something like 'I see you're drinking some delicious Belgian wheat beer'. Then, a bottle of Hoegaarden takes up half the screen for some time. After this ridiculous display, it takes around half an hour to feel remotely sympathetic towards the leading characters. If I heard someone talking about Belgian wheat beer in such a manner, I would punch them in the head. Later, in someone else's fridge, there's your bottle of Hoegaarden again. Not to mention the first few minutes of the film, which are basically an advertisement for Volvo, and the brand name SONY that appears on screen every ten minutes. I imagine that this movie is quite good if you have not read the book which I strongly recommend, and if you can get past the fact that you are being force-fed advertisements throughout. I should also mention that Neil Patrick Harris is a bad actor.",

Typical and average so I gave it a 5. I'm just glad I read a review with a spoiler so I didn't have to actually watch the movie just to see if the ending was exactly what I figured it would be from watching half of the trailer.

The book was pretty damn good, no question, but Fincher takes Gillian Flynn's novel/screenplay and elevates the words into hypnotically watchable cinema. Easily his most unusual cast(Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris and TYLER PERRY?!) and yet every single actor is PERFECT and even though she wouldn't have been my first choice, Rosamund Pike is incredibly sinister and calculative as ""Amazing"" Amy and definitely earned her Oscar nomination for Best Actress that year. It's not Fincher's most provocative or disturbing work but it's still one of his very best films and without a doubt worth more than one viewing to really take in the collage of performances, story, music, sound and indelible images. It's truly one of those movie you should before you die",

So, the obvious question that everyone has is did Nick Dunne kill his wife? At first it may seem like an obvious American thriller film. A family member is missing, their family and the police is trying their best to find him/her but, Trust me it is a lot more than just that. It is not possible to define this film in one sentence.

In real life this would never happen! Amy would just leave and with her Harvard degree, find a better husband.

However I can bed charitable and chalk this up as being fanciful and unreliable recollections or imaginings of Amy. What i can't excuse, on the other hand, is the myriad plot holes that i won't even bother to detail because they're all told in the 'Goofs' section.

Amy gets away with murdering a man on 'framed' evidence provided by cameras that would also have recorded her arriving with him unbound and wandering freely on her own over a day or two? And, as is pointed out but never addressed, how does a woman bound for days get a hold of a box cutter? Sorry, I don't buy it as clever.

As a lover of the novel, I have to say the movie not only stays true to it's material, but also enhances the mood. Through his lighting and shadow techniques, he shows inner turmoil and degradation. Fincher cuts through scenes like a butcher, but the beautiful cinematography makes the cuts precise. His yellow-sepia to black and white contrasts are breathtaking. Without any dialogue, you could follow the film completely by color and lighting alone. But the film doesn't stop there. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create, ""creepy elevator music"", that eats at you and makes you cringe at every scene like ""nine inch nails"" on a chalkboard. The acting is also superb. Rosamund Pike delivers a performance that will be talked about and analyzed for years to come. She could start a whole new outlook on female roles forever. Affleck has never been better, and is the perfect casting choice for the ""average"" guy. Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, and Carrie Coon are possibly the best supporting cast I've witnessed yet in a modern thriller. Overall, this movie has a lot of hype and a lot of pressure forced upon itself, and it delivers on all it's promises. It also makes you think twice before getting married.",

The cinematography works beautifully with Trent reznors soundtrack to carry the pace of the film. slow methodic when it needs to be and quick and gripping at other moments. Fincher is a masterclass film maker who created a style that works beautifully with his cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, they have a special talent for making the gritty dark underbelly in life look oddly clean, pretty and always captivating.

This is why I was a little bit disappointed with the film, I ended up a little bit upset that Ben Affleck (I mean his character) does not come up with any way to free himself from her lie and expose her. It was not a bad film, I just had more expectations and pretended something a little bit more real since the tension and the initial story were very well presented, but I think there were enough loose ends to give another twist to the story at the end that the one given presented as if there was no way out when, in my opinion, the scenes and the story clearly reveal some tracks to ruin her plan.",

David Fincher proves once again that he is among the best at what he does, and it's clear that everyone involved in this production brought their 'A' game. The writing is excellent, the cinematography perfectly captures the mood of the piece, the editing is exquisite (especially in one particularly gruesome scene, which I won't spoil here), the score is haunting and fits the images like a glove.

Fincher have a predilection for dark mysteries, but more to the point, they have a shared fascination with the psychology of dark mysteries like Zodiac or Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl's central mystery isn't simply one of evidence and alibis, but rather one of impulse. The film is based on a wildly popular novel (that I haven't read) by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the apparently pretty faithful screenplay. It is certainly a twisty tale. It starts out as one thing, turns into something else and then turns into quite another thing altogether. Whether it is the story itself or Fincher's amazingly precise handling of it, I don't know, but somehow the shifts flow smoothly and never jar ‚Äî at least, they never jar more than they're meant to and always feel like part of the whole fabric of the film. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, especially the end. I felt like I was watching a long-lost Hitchcock classic. Fincher nails the tone and sustains it effortlessly for the entire running time.",

Whenever a new scene reveals, your gut tells you something bad is about to happen, and that feeling drags on to the last minutes of movie. David Fincher did a fantastic job directing this movie and made a great adaptation to the book. The cast also deliver a solid performance, enough for you to be in their shoes and empathize with their motives. The movie is a twist of lies, manipulation, media distortion and obsession. The truth of the story is however you want to see it. It's thought- provoking and definitely worth seeing more than once. ""When two people fall in love but they can't make it to work. That's the biggest tragedy."" This simple quote will be a lot more powerful after you have sit through 2 hours and a half of this movie.",

However, I felt that it never really was able to successfully get its feet underneath itself. Mood seemed to be one of its major problems. Secondly, the character of Amy was brilliantly portrayed by Rosamund Pike. BUt too often I thought the character was a bit over the top. Many times I found myself whispering to myself that there was no way a person would go this far to reach the goal they wished to achieve. On the directing side, Fincher never disappoints with shot selection and lighting. He is a master of lighting or there lack of. I though this was more of a tight script than say Zodiac, his worst film in my opinion, but nowhere near the masterpieces of Se7en, The Game or Fight Club.",

The most well-known supporting role for me is Neil Patrick Harris, a familiar character from the series ""How I met your mother"". A good cast, in my opinion. The film takes two and a half hour, and remains enthralling until the end. Excellent work by director David Fincher (House of cards, Zodiac). I'm very positive.",
1571,6 October 2014,sammieflorence,9, Bravo to Flynn & Fincher,"Excuse my language, but I feel the only way to describe this movie is as follows: unfuckingbelievable. That being said, I've yet to get around to reading the novel, but am trying to get a hold of a copy! ",

1573,12 October 2014,ardahanapaydin449,10, Definitely have to take some Oscars,"I really want to say that in my opinion David Fincher made one of the best movies of 2014. ""Gone Girl"" is a very good movie for almost in every way. Also I can easily compare this movie with one of the best movies of Fincher 'Se7en'.",
1574,25 July 2017,mardemjr-info,7, The cool things in the movie,"It involves a lot. Great drama / suspense film. Is a rather effective and somewhat sombre book adaptation. One of the themes of Exemplary Girl is precisely this: the opposition of journalism to sensationalism. The need for newspapers and TVs to exploit every fact and to set up a condemnatory structure at any cost, based on any ""evidence.""",

1576,4 July 2016,NasroBourbia2,10, I can't stop thinking about Gone Girl,"I can't stop thinking about Gone Girl. Not because of any maddening, unresolved plot twist; it's just emotionally draining. If I had written this review immediately after walking out of the screening, the only thing I'd be able to say is that we've been given another brilliant- yet-imperfect David Fincher movie that fits neatly alongside the director's other recent works, The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.",
1577,2 November 2014,Dreamwiser,8," Sexy in many ways, twisted and crazy!","I watched ""Gone Girl"" by myself, must say I enjoyed this movie. I even felt some desire from time to time to enjoy Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike), a little too much even maybe. She was great for the role and she did an amazing job, and have I mentioned how stunningly beautiful this woman is? It doesn't matter how twisted she is I still love her. Ben Affleck (Nick Dunne) playing the husband he does a great job with this role as well; a bit modified and different. I truly felt sorry for (Nick Dunne) several times during the movie, poor dude.",
1578,25 November 2016,JonMuller,10, An excellent thriller made by a master filmmaker,"I seriously believe David Fincher is one of the most talented directors working in film today. The way he's composed and worked on such a variety of different thrillers is amazing, and has one of the best track records of a director in recent memory. Gone Girl, now a little over 2 years old, is still a masterpiece and holds up as the best of the best of the ongoing decade so far.",
1579,1 November 2014,gaurav-zadgaonkar,10, Marriage-A Undying Loving Relationship Or A Sin Of Knowing a Person So Well,"My Review For Gone girl Is marriage is such a complicated thing? We all know it has its ups and downs can marriage can be dangerous too? How well a person can understand the other person in just 5 years of there relationship ?. All this question rush through my mind when I left the theater with a heaviness in my heart. I read the book Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn 1 month ago it was such a great experience of exploring such dynamic characters and Gillian Flynn does it so well that the story gets deeper and deeper in to the horrors of marriage. The movie starts off great with the line which is also the starting line of the novel an if look at it carefully you will understand that the movie completely justifies the novel except the movie doesn't go deep in to amazing Amy fantasies story books as they have written in the book. David Fincher nails it again,the atmosphere of all the scene and the lighting effect are just as perfect as they gets when you read the novel this movie gives you a remainder of Hitchcock classics suspense movies. Ben Affleck was amazing, cool guy the kind of character who keep all his fears secrets inside his stomach and doesn't give you a slightest of the hint when you look at his face and Hats Off to Rosamund Pike the greatest on screen performance of the year she truly deserves an Oscar Noam and Margo played by Carrie coon was too perfect and all the other characters was also great. The ending of the movie will be a part of the discussion because I can say that the people who haven't read the book are the people who will not like the ending. The message you get is like marriage is like a cigarette you know from the start that the thing is going to kill you someday but you couldn't leave that because that is the only thing that you need when you are alone or under stress so its an undying relationship. So go rush to the theater and this movie will make you day",
1580,10 November 2014,chaitanyasky,7, Review of 'Gone Girl',Gone girl follows the life of a prodigy Amme during her marriage. The never-quitting girl she is; tries to elicit wrath on her husband on getting to know of his extra-marital affairs. The climax which develops is really mind-blowing. Well things are left for the viewer to form an opinion about. ,
1581,20 October 2014,jamillah2,6, Loved the book,"As a huge fan of the book I was worried the movie wouldn't live up to it. Fortunately, they did a pretty good job capturing the general tone of the book and how absolutely crazy Amy is. The movie was much kinder in its portrayal of Nick than the book. It ended with me feeling kind of bad for him vs when I finished the book I thought of him as a spoiled narcissistic ""Man-child"" who by staying with Amy would thankfully not mess up the life of an unassuming nice girl. The idea of NPH playing Desi was great casting but the movie didn't really show how psychotic he was. In the movie, it was nice to actually Amy play out her escape plan from him as well as her initial disappearance vs in the book when they were referenced as things done in the past. To those who haven't read the book, I hope they enjoyed the surprises as they were revealed! I was in shock as I read! All-in-all, it was nice to visually experience and enjoy that wild story.",
1582,14 December 2014,joshua_mvp_lloren,9, Gone Girl. A dark and thrilling masterpiece.,"When I have 1st seen the ratings that the movie had, I was doubting that it was overrated. I thought that the movie would be boring and too predictable for the audience. However, watching this movie to the end changed that. Watching this movie for 2 hours and 30 minutes has been very entertaining. The movie have truly changed my impressions and opinion on Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. I mostly remembered Ben Affleck from his movie Daredevil which was not a very good movie for him, but his portrayal as Nick Dunne in this movie makes you want to kill him in the start and makes you love him in the end. Rosamund Pike's portrayal as Amy Dunne is hands down, one of the best performances that an actress has done this year. Her lovable and kind personality at the start is great, but her chilling performance in the end was amazing. David Fincher once again blew my mind with his beautiful and amazing way of story telling and directing this movie. I forgive you for you had shown in the ending of 7ven. Overall Gone Girl is an amazing movie that would entertain you from start to finish. This movie is one of the best movies for this year! (P.S. not suitable for children; lots of nudity and sexual activities, violent at one scene)",
1583,4 November 2014,stevegipson73,7, A solid movie that really keeps you glued,"I must say I enjoyed this movie, a solid movie that really keeps you glued, anyway the film starts a bit too slow for me, where Affleck's wife goes missing as we tried to put the puzzles together about his wife whereabouts.... but except that it's a great film, sickly and twisted. The entire twists in the movie was really well placed I didn't see it coming.... ",
1584,26 May 2015,hosseinyazdani1376,1, wasting money and time to watch,"The most stupid movie I have ever seen,without any doubt. A movie which contains foolish ideas and foolish scenes too. In +18 part,there isn't sign of love,just +18 acts to attract pervert guys to watch. Movie's Scenario seems completely unusual and hard to imagine them in real life.For example how many people would care about missing a author of children's stories?but in the movie we see like all people in USA are worry about her.An other example is Mass Medias reactions,in which I my self believe that never a media would accuse a brother and sister to incest because they can have legal complaint and claim for their rights which we see incest accusing.",
1585,4 January 2015,pyb007,8, Great storytelling,"First, I really don't get the aggressive negative comment about the plot or its consistency. Compared to let's say 95% of any other American movies, Gone Girl is far ahead. The director chose to focus mainly on its characters and on the storytelling rather than on tiny details, and it worked well for me! ",
1586,12 January 2015,mooky-210-917116,10, One of the best thrillers I have ever seen.,"There is nothing I like more than a good thriller. That is, without a doubt, my favourite genre. That being said, it is quite rare that I came across one that really has me absolutely gripped from the opening minute to the very last. At best I have only come across some pretty great ones. however, 'Gone Girl' definitely takes the prize for the best one that I have ever seen.",

Unfortunately it cannot be re-experienced but I cherished my first watch. This movie...what a thriller!! I LOVED this film and felt quite a frustration at the ending: Fincher's goal with the ending, however, was to have the viewer feel the same frustration the main character felt, a sensation I have never experienced in a movie. Loved it.",
1589,26 November 2015,javo_angeles,9," To bad reviewers, Did any of you pay attention?","You are all nitpicking about things that if you give it another watch (which of course you don't) would realize how the whole thing makes sense. There are things obviously that would never happen in real life, like letting Amy leave the hospital with blood (I admit this is kind of dumb), and a bunch of other things wouldn't happen in real life because this is a f***ing movie, this is f***ing cinema, go and complain about how aliens would never invade earth like in Independence Day or Transformers, how it's impossible for us to create dinosaurs out of amber, the errors you are all complaining is pure bull***t. Amy can make police and the rest of the people believe she was being held hostage by Desi, because she always acted submissive and scared of him when he was around, she also made the paper of being seductive, like she was pleasuring him, if police saw the tapes, she would still win, her part would be convincing. If Nick leaves Amy, his life would be ruined just like the rest of Amy's exes, the media has an important way on the story. This is just a part of how one of those ""plotholes"" makes sense, I will not elaborate on everything else because you people, could see it for yourselves if your were paying attention on the important stuff. You all should be banned from IMDb and the internet.",

Praise is obviously deserved to Fincher and the whole cast.",

1592,12 June 2015,tamara-a_98,3, It was too twisted that it became pointless...,I thought the movie was pretty much pointless. I could not understand the message behind it. At first I was like okay it's about revenge or it's about showing how Amy is going to defend herself after she was mistreated but then all of this was betrayed when (spoiler alert) she goes back to Nick like nothing ever happened.,

1597,19 March 2020,joemellison,9, Makes me scared of getting married,"David Fincher's immersive and intimate direction has enabled Affleck and Pike to create a truly terrifying depiction of how humans will alter their own personalities to get what they truly desire from a relationship.
Affleck's excellent performance really takes the audience on his emotional journey to hell and back, and his interactions with all of the supporting characters feel incredibly genuine, and exactly how anyone would react should they go through the same emotional trauma that he does. However, the true star of the show is Rosamund Pike. She is able to portray so much escalating hate over the course of the first half of the film, and her cunning personality really shines as she is able to manipulate those around in order to fit her ever adjusting motives as the landscape around her continues to alter in different ways.
All in all, the direction, acting and cinematography all come together in such a way that conveys a message of hate and how far someone will go to make the person who has hurt them the most suffer even more than they have. The film ends in such a crushing way it gifts the audience a new perspective on their current morality.
David Fincher continues to solidify himself as one of the undisputed best director of modern times.",

IMDb has done that for you & me already...why would I need some dipsh_t to write it again in their review? I don't! And nobody else does! It's pointless to write it and all you're doing is wasting other people's time! It is beyond annoying, when you're reading reviews, and you keep seeing the same synopsis repeated over, n over n over again. Another thing...we know who it's directed by and who the actors are because IMDb puts all that information on the film's title page! You don't need to tell me that! I know it already! You're not professional critics, just write what you thought of the movie and be done with it! ",
