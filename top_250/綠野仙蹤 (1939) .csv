0,26 December 2008,hitchcockthelegend,10, Timeless classic still entertaining the masses as each new generation comes in.,"Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.",/
1,4 May 2013,AlsExGal,10, Perhaps the most well known and watched film in history?,"This film predates my birth by 19 years, so I've seen it as a child when it was an annual event on network TV, stretched out to hours in length, believably due to commercials and maybe not so believably today due to the network hosting and talking about the film a little during breaks.",r

3,12 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, My childhood favourite!,"I am 16, and I still love this movie. I grew up watching this, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Meet Me in Saint Louis, and I never tire of them. Judy Garland is wonderful as Dorothy, bringing a sense of vulnerability and sadness to the role, making Over The Rainbow more poignant than it already was. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are really entertaining as her three friends. Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins were great fun too. The wicked witch of the west scared the life out of me here and still does, and even Frank Morgan does 5 roles to great comical effect. The songs are just fabulous, and so is the cinematography and the stunning scenery. True, the film isn't completely faithful to the book, but why does it have to be? If I had one minor drawback, it would be the singing voice of the Lion, but apart from that, this movie is a must-see! 10/10. Bethany Cox",v
4,29 November 2014,utgard14,10, Flawless,"The most difficult thing about reviewing The Wizard of Oz is finding something to say about it that doesn't begin with ""the best."" It's hard to argue that this isn't a strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor. It's such a gorgeous looking movie. Funny, sentimental, sincere -- it's a masterpiece that I've been in love with since I was a little kid. I've never grown tired of it and I hope I never do.",i
5,13 November 2005,nycritic,10, Finding Her Way Back Home -- To Our Hearts.,"Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ, with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new, it can't be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives, especially as children, has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced, the terror of entering the Wicked Witch's lair, her transition from little girl to wise young woman, and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.",e
6,7 May 2006,robb_772,10, A true cinematic milestone,"Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.",w
7,3 September 2015,anaconda-40658,10, Garland's Oz.,"The Wizard of Oz (1939): Dir: Victor Fleming / Cast: Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Margaret Hamilton: Sensational treasure about mind and imagination. Judy Garland plays Dorothy, a farm girl who, in the midst of a tornado, is spirited away over the rainbow to the glorious land of Oz. She is greeted by numerous Munchkins after her house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. This angers the Wicked Witch of the West who demands the ruby slippers, which have appeared on Dorothy's feet. To return to Kansas she must follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and seek help from the wizard. On the way she encounters a scarecrow who needs a brain, a tin man who needs a heart, and a cowardly lion who needs courage. Skillfully directed by Victor Fleming whose luck had him direct this film and Gone With the Wind the same year. Garland graces the screen with her innocence and beautiful singing voice that belts out ""Over the Rainbow."" Margaret Hamilton plays the menacing wicked witch whose defeat is one of the great scenes due to its simplicity. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are wonderfully cast as Dorothy's companions. Margaret Hamilton gives a menacing performance as the Wicked Witch of the west. It regards important things taken for granted. Triumphant visual wonder that renders that ""you're not in Kansas anymore."" Score: 10 / 10",/

Our grandmothers were watching it while they were just little girls and our grandchildren will enjoy it as much. Its values will never be outdated. One of those that define expression ""classic"". Only a shallow viewer could consider it to be just a fairy-tale for children, because this masterpiece is much more than that and its depth covers all generations. Although it's almost 80 years old it still resists the teeth of time, even visually. Its costumes and special effects are extremely outdated but still effective. I admit, it would be very interesting to see how it would all look like with today's technology, but I think this is one of those shrines that should not be touched.",8

15,29 August 2014,Uriah43,10, A Pure Delight,"This movie is a pure delight. I remember back when I was young that it would come on television once a year and whenever it played it was like watching it for the very first time. It was both wonderful and magical. Even today it is a joy to watch and having seen it at least fifteen times that in and of itself is quite remarkable. At least for me. Be that as it may, I think it is important to inform new viewers that this movie was made back in 1939 and as a result it doesn't have the computer graphics or any of the technology used today to enhance the special effects. But what special effects it does have is still pretty good even by today's standards. Add in the music and performances of Judy Garland (as ""Dorothy""), Ray Bolger (the ""Scarecrow""), Bert Lahr (the ""Cowardly Lion""), and Jack Haley (the ""Tin Man"") and the end result is something that I don't believe can ever be duplicated. In short, not only is this movie a ""classic"" in every sense of the word but I believe it ranks in the top 3 films of all time.

21,7 April 2005,Vancity_Film_Fanatic,10, Will continue to enthrall for generations to come!,"One of the most cherished fantasy films to ever grace the screen, ""The Wizard of Oz"" stands as a crowning achievement in 1930's film making. The special effects are highly impressive considering the limited technology available at the time, not to mention they are infinitely more endearing than most CGI effects present in today's films. The lavish sets, impeccable costume design, and glowing Technicolor help to create a convincing and enchanting Land of Oz. And though obviously filmed on a soundstage, the sets never seem confining; thanks largely in part to the meticulous backdrop paintings used to add depth to the foreground. The musical numbers are quite lively & catchy -- never slowing the pace of the film -- except perhaps for the Lion singing ""King of the Jungle"". Judy Garland truly shines in her portrayal of Dorothy, perfectly capturing the wide-eyed innocence of her character. She definitely deserved the special Oscar she was awarded for her performance. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and Frank Morgan as the Wizard also turn in praiseworthy characterizations. Definitely timeless in every sense of the word, this film is recommended to those of all ages  a 10/10!",f
22,3 February 2014,ma-cortes,8," Classic fairy tale with dazzling fantasy , colorful images , impressive songs and enjoyable roles","Marvelous tale in which Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland , she had to wear a painful corset-style device around her torso so that she would appear younger and flat-chested) is swept away to a magical location in a tornado and being transported on the land of Oz she embarks on a quest to see the Wizard (Frank Morgan , he plays various characters) who can help her return home . The film opens in sepia-tone academy ratio for the Kansas scenes, before widening out and blooming into full color in Oz . There appears Dorothy and her dog when she is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. She's helped by the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) , but she's also in trouble with the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton, many of her scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely, her performance was thought too frightening for audiences) . Reluctantly drawn into the problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Dorothy must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. On her way she meets the Munchkins (they are portrayed by the Singer Midgets, named not for their musical abilities ,the troupe came from Europe to immigrate and escape the Nazis) , a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger , face makeup wore consisted, in part, of a rubber prosthetic with a woven pattern to suggest cloth) who needs a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley who wrote additional dialogue) who wants a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bet Lahr , he wrote additional dialogue , too) who desperately needs courage . Putting their arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry they transform themselves not only into the great and powerful helpers of Oz but into the better friends as well . ",_

30,10 May 2014,ironhorse_iv,9, We're off to see the Wizard! The Wonderful Wizard of OZ! This movie is so magical!,"Directed by Victor Fleming, the 1939 musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is probably the most well-known and commercial adaptation based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. While the film is so dated, it's still watchable even today becoming part of American pop culture. The film is known for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters. The movie starts out amazing black and white, with Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), a young farm girl who lives with her Aunt and Uncle, in Kansas in the early 1900s. She decide to run away, due to Dorothy's dog Toto, biting a neighbor. Before she can get far, a tornado comes up, carried her and her house to the Technicolor world of Oz. Dorothy find out that the only way to get home is to find the Wizard (Frank Morgan). With help from Gilda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) and some new friends on the way, like Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin-Man (Jack Haley) and Cowardly Lion (Bert Lehr), they make their way to the Wizard on the dangerous yellow brick road, where the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) is looking for revenge for Dorothy accidentally killing her sister. All the actors were wonderful in their roles, playing multiply complex parts, bringing the comedy and music and dance alive. Still, it was bit over the top. All the actors also play the farmhands in the beginning, making you wonder if all this Oz was just a dream. That was the main different between the film and the book. There were other things that the film change, such in the case of Dorothy's age. Shirley Temple was originally wanted for the role, but since they couldn't get her. They got Judy Garland and had to change the age from 7 to 16. They even wanted the blonde curls that Temple is famous for. The wig was top heavy and kept getting mess up, so they took it out, and went with Garland's natural hair. It's creepy in a way, that Dorothy was literally based on Frank Baum's daughter that die in childbirth. Frank Baum was known for his medium spiritual belief, and you see it in the character of Professor Marvel (also Frank Morgan). It's believe that the Wizard character represent fault power leader. The Wizard can be allegory to what Baum thought was fault power leader at the time, such as President McKinley who introduce the Gold Standard, in which many historians believe was represented by the Yellow Brick Road. Oz is indeed: an abbreviation that stands for gold, a hot political topic of the day where people were rallying for fixed gold and silver ratios. Some believe that, the Wizard in the film represent Franklin D. Roosevelt who was known to make illusions to sound strong and look powerful, when trying to present the New Deal to Americans at the time. Emerald City is allegory to Washington D.C that looks like money, but in the end, the film, it was dull white. If the novel, Emerald City look was based off the White City in the 1893's Chicago World Fair. Then 1939's Emerald City was the New Deal, Washington D.C. Then, all of Dorothy's friends could be presented as Coxey's Army, an group of unemployed workers made out of farmers (Scarecrow), laborers (Tin-Man) and free silver supporters (Cowardly Lion). It is said that the Lion represents 19th century politician William Jennings Bryan, who was viewed as someone having a load roar, but no power or bite. Honestly, in the book, the Bimetallism Ruby slipper were really silver. There were a lot of things that wasn't in the film that was in the novel such as the visit to China Country, Queen of the Field Mice, the battle with Giants Spiders & Kalidahs, and the attack of the armless Qualdings. Talking about missing limbs. Civil War vets with prosthetic limbs were inspiration for the Tin-Man. There is a tale that Tin Man was indeed a munchkin named Nick Chopper. The screenwriters wanted Tin Woodman to be a hardened criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. The torture of being encased in the suit had softened him and made him gentle and kind. Wow, that's really dark. Another dark urban legend claimed that, in the film, a Munchkin could be seen committing suicide by hanging by the neck from behind a prop tree and swinging back and forth in the left background, but it was just a bird. There were a lot of weird rewrites, like a spoiled, selfish princess in Oz outlawing music and others. The role of the Wicked Witch of the West was also enlarged for the movie. While, the Witch of the West in the novel was less evil. I think this role fit the film, well. Mad props to Hamilton for continuing the role after getting badly burn during production. There are at least 44 major differences between the book and this movie. Nevertheless, the film was far more faithful to Baum's original book. Still, they almost cut the most famous song from the movie, 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' written by E.Y 'Yip"" Harburg. Glad, they kept it. The song ""The Jitterbug,"" was instead delete. The film footage for the song been lost, but you can find the 'Jitterbug' footage rehearsals on newer DVDs version. I still dig the other songs. ""Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead"" ""We're Off to See the Wizard"" and ""The Merry Old Land of Oz"" are some of my favorites. The movie always have great special effects, and top production value for the time. Still the story is lacking an overall moral and there were lot of not necessary extra scenes that could be cut out. Overall: a great movie that will forever be known as one of the greatest movies of all time. I have to agree.",

32,19 December 2005,Jim-Eadon,10," Enchanting, almost nostalgic art!","With trepidation I decided to watch The Wizard Of Oz, for I have memories of it from when I was five, 32 years ago. My memory was of a flying house, and of a laughing witch, who didn't quite look like the witch I saw yesterday, but that is false memory for you! Of course yesterday I saw the movie as a hardened adult, as opposed to a pure innocent, so philosophically I am a different person. Even if there were no nostalgia in memory, there would have been, I feel sure, a sense that the morals of this movie would never be repeated today. We live in a world where even infants' dolls have been sexualised with makeup. Of course no time in history was innocent, but here we had a media that put warmth above ""cool"", charm above cynicism. There is something of a relatively European feel about Oz, a sensation I rarely see with Hollywood, with the magical The Lord Of The Rings trilogy being another example. The movie was an absolute joy to watch, such pleasure from movies is rare to be had, and I cannot recommend this enough, not just as an antidote to MTV-generation philistinism, but as a genuine work of art. No doubt much has been written on the skill and joyousness of the acting , the amazing sets, the imagination, the witty songs, the metaphors and the songs, all of which are perfect. I recommend showing this to all kids, it has so much more depth than the tacky, merchandising-driven modern stuff they ingest! And equally I recommend it to grown-ups, for we need this therapy more than the kids :)",
33,16 November 2013,blazesnakes9,10, We're off to the see the Wizard. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.,"In every childhood's dream, we all have been inspired to be somewhere. Some have the dream to become someone in a different place. An place where speculation is an key point in that particular environment. Some dream about being in an place, where wonder and joy filled up their imagination. When Frank L. Baum wrote the book, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", his vision was much more different than the movie's adaption. In 1939, The Wizard of Oz was made into a motion picture. It is not only a motion picture for audiences, but a motion picture for all generations. The movie tells us about how Dorothy, played Judy Garland, set off on an adventure in the colorful, lively world of Oz. But, before even being situated in the world of Oz, let's start from the beginning. In the great state of Kansas, Dorothy is happily living in her little Kansas farm, with her aunt and uncle. But, an mean landlady named Mrs. Gulch has a grudge on Dorothy because Dorothy's dog, Toto, bit her. She is ignored by her guardians, who are helping out on the farm. Then, the movie strikes a major chord, and from there, The Wizard of Oz begins to unfolds as Dorothy sings the musical number, ""Over the Rainbow"". Soon enough, an huge tornado threatens Dorothy's home and eventually, Dorothy lands in the wonderful world of Oz. From there, her adventures will unfold and set the viewers on a vivid, magical, journey through Oz. Dorothy begins to make new friends with the people she comes in contact with. But, like any other fairy tale, there's always evil lurking. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens to take over Oz, and so it's up to Dorothy and her friends to make it to Emerald City to see the Wizard. There are supporting characters in The Wizard of Oz that consists of The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion and The Scarecrow. Each one of those characters want to achieve something during this journey to see the Wizard. The Tin Man wishes a heart for his body. The Cowardly Lion wishes to be brave and have courage to stand up against his fears. The Scarecrow wishes he had an brain. Over time, The Wizard Oz had been broadcasts on local television stations over the last 30 years. It is till being shown on TV as of today. But, what is about The Wizard of Oz that makes the movie worth-watching? Well, there are a lot of reasons to speculate on that question. First of all, the original Frank L. Baum's novel was a dark allegory on historical figures being represented as the characters in the Wonderful World of Oz. In this movie version, those elements are thrown away. Second of all, the movie's appeal is to everybody. A lot of parents would take their kids to see The Wizard of Oz every time it is shown on TV or at the movies. In my opinion, The Wizard of Oz is timeless classic. This is a movie that is based on the tradition of magic. We, as the audience, are stunned when we see the world of Oz. Not only the set design of The Wizard of Oz is spectacular, but also, it has a juvenile feel to it. The spirit of the movie really makes the movie more pure than any other movie that is meant to seen by children. The Wizard of Oz is juvenile in its tone, especially the leading role of Judy Garland. For me, Garland is probably responsible for making the movie appeal to children. There's a deep meaning to the movie's argument on whether Dorothy's dream was real or fictional. This was significant when the movie was released in 1939. In the end, her dream is validated as being a dream. MGM was willing to gamble on The Wizard of Oz because it was the most expensive production at that time. The end result was an great-looking, very appealing and dazzling story of magic. The musical numbers in the movie are compelling and is full of joy as we hear Judy Garland's splendid singing voice that makes it all the more purer. It is a unforgettable classic that will live on for many centuries. And, also, there's no place like home. ★★★★ 4 stars.",

35,17 September 2014,georgecoffeynewyorker,10, Fantastic Score Great childhood movie,"Well what a movie this classic was. I hadn't seen this movie in years. I can vaguely recall it even. However when I went along to it, It slowly came back to me. And I MEAN slowly. The plot was quite simple, in that Dororthy(Garland) is shushwed up ie swept up in a tornado into a fantasy land. The tornado was so real like, the one in Into the Storm(Review here). It was so impressive. So anyways, Dorothy then is found in a new place and is woken up to Munchkins. Then it is found that there are TWO wicked witches. One of the East)(whom was killed with Dorothy's house) and the Wicked Witch of the West(Hamilton). The Good Witch is also there and helps Dorothy out. Dorothy wanted to return home. However she has to Follow the Yellow Brick Road. People who know me, will know my love for music in Movies. Well this one surely did not disappoint me. I was happily singing all the songs. One thing I did notice was that the songs that were being song I was saying to myself: ""Oh so this is where the song came from"". On the way to the Wizard, Dorothy encounters Scarecrow(Bolger), Tin Man(Haley) and the Lion(Lahr). She told them as she met them on her travels, that she's going to the Wizard in the Emerald City to ask to be sent back home, while so Scarecrow wanted a Brain, Tin Man wanted a Heart, and the Lion wanted Courage. So a conflict ensues with the 4 of them and the Witch. As with any childhood movie, the Winning character is always what I want all the time not the ""baddie"". Then quite a shocker for me personally. Not sure abotu the rest of yeeee, but the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Lion and the ""Wizard"" are all her own family. Which I was saying: ""Isn't that....."" etc., Great childhood movie. Ohhh and the quotes, just unreal. One quote: When the Lion was requesting his Courage: ""What makes a King out of a slave? Courage!"" and the most one quote that really went through me: Considering my heart was broken by my first ex: You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable."" and another quote relating to the heart: "": A heart is shown not by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others."" So the movie ended on as always with a childhood(well the one's I've seen - hhaha) on a positive note. The Wicked Witch of the WEST, had been defeated. Dorothy was heading back. It was made out to be of a DREAM.",

I can remember being scared to death by the witch. Her laugh gave me the heebie-jeebies. Movies from this era were so well made. To attempt to make this kind of production today would cost much more than any film made. Today computers make special effects so easy. Back then you had to very ingenious to have believable special effects. This is one of my top 10 movies off all time. It makes you feel like a kid again, and isn't that what a movie is suppose to do, take you to another time and place. Those that don't understand are entitled to their opinions, but they really don't understand the real world. The more advanced the mind, the more need for play (or fun and escape).

But I would hazard to guess that 99% of North America know the absolutely timeless songs, and the constant barrage of famous quotes. Even watching it again, when I got to see it on the big screen which was awesome, I was shocked by how many literally epically famous quotes are from this one movie. Considering when the film was made this had to be a stunning feat for film making. The special effects lack in some aspects and then in other ways it is truly astonishing. The painting backdrop of OZ definitely looks dated, seeing it again, but then you look at something as small as the Scarecrow/Lion/Tin-man's make up and it is really quite astounding. The film is simply fun and a little bit dark at times creating one of the most well known villains in film history.

Dorothy's extraordinary journey in the Land of Oz is funny, touching, valuable and rhythmic! Even the overload of sentiment and moral doesn't bother me in this one. The story couldn't be more sappy or politically correct but I don't careit's a visual masterpiece for sure and the importance of this motion picture in the history of cinema is inescapably. The Wizard of Oz practically is a complete chapter of cinema-history itselfreferenced, spoofed and honored in numerous other titles. A must-see fairy-tale that'll escort you to an imaginative and colorful world where wondrous characters live, evil has to be fought and important life-lessons are educated.

48,15 August 2014,moviemattb,10, A Film For All Ages,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and to this day; it is considered to be timeless. Everyone knows the story, characters, music, magic, fun, etc. This is a very memorable movie because again everyone knows the movie very well. The movie is based on L. Frank Baum's book, and there had been many adaptations for ""The Wizard of Oz"" which it was during the silent film era; so I guess you can say if the movie that I'm reviewing is somewhat like a remake of the original silent movies or not. I know that the movie had went many production changes along with the original director Richard Thorpe getting fired for lacking the movie's spirit. So now that we have what Dorothy Gale looks along with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, Victor Fleming taking over the director's chair for making such a wonderful looking movie, and making OZ look beautiful in Technicolor. I do know that he did not direct the Kansas scenes because of his commitment to work on another production from MGM studio's ""Gone With The Wind,"" which I never saw and don't know if I should see it. Maybe I should but I still don't know because I felt that movie stole the Oscar for Best Picture for not letting ""The Wizard of Oz"" win, but I digress. As I was saying about the Kansas scenes, they were pretty much much filmed by King Vidor. With that said, I thought the cast were perfect, and they do manage to bring their roles to life. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale and she will always be remembered for playing that kind of role. Ray Bolger was fantastic as the Scarecrow along with Jack Haley as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton does a memorable job to played the evil Wicked Witch of the West. The production design in this movie are sensational, and it does look a place where anyone fantasize in their own world away from their home. The cinematography is beautifully well shot for OZ being filmed in Technicolor, and the Kansas scenes being filmed in a Sepia tone. The special effects in this movie are quite special for the used of matte paintings; witch being melted; holographic head of the Wizard of Oz; and most of all the tornado. The tornado itself looks really good before there was any CGI by today's special effects. The movie ""Twister"" from 1996 does used CGI for the Tornado, while this movie was all done practically. The songs in this movie are indeed memorable such as ""We're off to see the Wizard;"" ""If I only had a Brain;"" ""If I only had a Heart;"" ""If I only had the Nerve;"" and everyone's favorite ""Over the Rainbow."" The movie never gets tiring, and anyone can watch this movie as much as they want to because the movie's premise along with the pacing goes by very well. I wish I can say more about this movie, but everyone who has seen this movie had already said about what makes this movie so special. As of that, they are very much right. After this movie was made, there were more ""OZ"" movies that appear on the big screen as ""The Wiz"" based on its play which it is not a good movie and never saw the play. Also, there were two more ""OZ"" movies that were made by Disney such as ""Return of Oz"" and ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Those were good movies, but none of them were as good as the original timeless classic. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is never going to die, and it will live on forever. This is a film for all ages for both children and adults. As Dorothy would say ""There is no place like,"" to me I say ""There is no great OZ movie like this one."" I give ""The Wizard of Oz"" a perfect 10 out of 10.",

50,22 August 2016,oOoBarracuda,10," ""Anybody can have a brain, that is a very mediocre commodity.""","The Wizard of Oz is one of the films that changed the way I look at movies. First enjoying The 1939 film by Victor Fleming as a childhood favorite, revisiting the film, proved it to be so much more than a kid's movie. When I was about 20 and in college, I really started appreciating film as the art form that it is and respecting it as such. In gaining this new understanding for the medium as a serious art rather than mindless entertainment, I sought out favorite films of mine to see if I could gain any deeper understanding of them, and perhaps, appreciate or enjoy them more. One of the first films I watched through this new lens was The Wizard of Oz. Starring Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, and Billie Burke in the film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz follows a small town girl into the world she discovers as she only wishes to return home to the life she didn't realize she loved. No matter how simple the film seems on its surface, Baum packed quite a punch in his book, which was more than adequately transferred to the screen.",

So much has been said about it before that there's almost nothing left to say. Having said that, what else can I say than that ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is perfect? This classic seems to endure from age to age, generation to generation. So what is it about this film that works so well? The plot is ridiculous beyond all reason, but that's not the point. There's something about the film that makes me cry at the end every time. This is the film that teaches us to believe in who we already are, that ""There's no place like home."" There's also themes of the power of friendship, courage, etc. Combined with ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""The Yellow Brick Road,"" and more of the best original movie songs ever written, everything about this film works. It's humorous (""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain""), touching, entertaining, and 100% engaging. In my opinion, probably the best film of 1939, maybe even slightly better than ""Gone With the Wind."" If you're one of the handful who hasn't seen this film, you've truly missed out. It's not just a classic; it's an American past time. Absolutely perfect.",
52,6 July 2006,GOWBTW,10, A superb classic!,"Who would ever think of a fantasy that would leave an impression that would last for a lifetime? Well, Victor Fleming made ""The Wizard of Oz"" with a cast that would make a successful movie happen. Judy Garland as the ever impressionable Dorothy Gale really makes it sparkle with her sly wit and sultry voice. And that footwork with those ruby slippers, very graceful. Ray Bolger, another great dancer. Looks great as the goofy Hunk, and his role as The Scarecrow. Man that takes a lot of talent I really like that. Jack Haley, really good play both Hickory and The Tin Woodsman he had a lot of guts to help the others in distress despite having no heart. Bert Lahr as Zeke and The Cowardly Lion now that's a riot! ""Put 'em Up!"" Put 'Em Up!"" Why he's supposed to be the ""King of the Jungle"" now he's The ""Chicken of the Jungle"". Pure encouragement is what each one needed. The bronze screen beginning is really cool, who needed that black & white format? And the character that really made my blood boil is that dirty old Miss Gulch(Margaret Hamliton). She was bad to the county, and Dorothy was right, she is nothing but a mean old witch! Especially when Dorothy was in that tornado and saw everyone she knew. She killed the Wicked Witch of the East with the house, the Munchkins thank her. She used water on The one of the West, the guards thanked her. I guess Oz owed her a debt of gratitude, I guess she is welcomed to Oz at anytime! This movie is a surefire classic, and it is great for the whole family. Which in fact it really is! Rating 5 stars!

53,23 September 2022,GusherPop,10, A True Masterpiece,"As a child I simply did not notice whether a movie was in color or not. The movies themselves were such an overwhelming mystery that if they wanted to be in black and white, that was their business. It was not until I saw ""The Wizard of Oz"" for the first time that I consciously noticed B&W versus color, as Dorothy was blown out of Kansas and into Oz. The switch from black and white to color would have had a special resonance in 1939, when the movie was made. Almost all films were still being made in black and white, and the cumbersome new color cameras came with a ""Technicolor consultant"" from the factory, who stood next to the cinematographer and officiously suggested higher light levels. There were cast changes, too; after Buddy Ebsen, as the Tin Man, had an allergic reaction to the silvery makeup, he was replaced by Jack Haley. Musical numbers were recorded and never used. Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) was seriously burned when she went up in a puff of smoke. Even Toto was out of commission for two weeks after being stepped on by a crewmember. This deep universal appeal explains why so many different people from many backgrounds have a compartment of their memory reserved for ""The Wizard of Oz."" Salman Rushdie, growing up in Bombay, remembers that seeing the film at 10 ""made a writer of me."" Terry McMillan, as an African-American child in northern Michigan, ""completely identified when no one had time to listen to Dorothy."" Rushdie wrote that the film's ""driving force is the inadequacy of adults, even of good adults, and how the weakness of grownups forces children to take control of their own destinies."" McMillan learned about courage, about ""being afraid but doing whatever it was you set out to do anyway."" The Wizard sends them on a mission to get the Wicked Witch's broom, and it is not insignificant that the key to Dorothy's return to Kansas is the pair of ruby slippers. Grownup shoes.",

55,4 November 2002,movibuf1962,10, An institution on television.,"For me, OZ wasn't a movie so much as it was a family ritual. It was so embedded in my childhood and puberty, that I no longer thought of it as a movie- especially since it had an annual pilgrimage on television. I was still in diapers when it aired on CBS- the first time. That network's contract with the film only lasted until 1967 (I was just five then), and then the film switched its airings from CBS to NBC between 1968 and 1975- though CBS would take it back and air it yearly until the end of the 20th century. I watched it during the NBC period, and it was always introduced with the NBC peacock- with a special reminder that the first 19 minutes were in black and white. We would always circle the date on the calendar, and it always seemed to be a Spring broadcast, usually on Easter Sunday. And when the tornado sequence ended with the house crashing down, you could hear a pin drop in our living room. My favorite part of the film- since I was five- is watching the film change from b/w to the color of Munchkinland simply by opening the front door. (I saw the film years later as a college student in a real theater, and this scene actually brought whistles and applause from the audience!!) That's what I remember the most.

59,8 April 2020,LeonardKniffel,10, The Best Musical Fantasy Ever,"Generation after generation, this downright bizarre little movie continues to fascinate viewers with its imaginative and surrealistic sets and score. It has created a cottage industry around a little girl from Kansas who ends up over the rainbow, only to find that life in a dream is as often a nightmare. What is so durable about the film is the way the elements all work together to tell a story that is enthralling no matter how many times you see it. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is the quintessential musical. Seeing it at just the right age somehow seems to make it watchable repeatedly at any age. The music is fully integrated into the story line. Everybody sings-except, of course for the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys. Evil beings don't sing. In addition to ""Over the Rainbow,"" consider how memorable are ""We're Off to See the Wizard"" and ""If I Only Had a Brain."" Much has been written about this film, and it even spawned a Broadway play, ""Wicked,"" and a reworked version as ""The Wiz"" starring Diana Ross, but there is simply no equaling this. And look at the casting: Judy Garland seems too old to play Dorothy-until you think that a girl going through puberty on a prairie farm, with no parents and no playmates but ""three shiftless farmhands"" might be the perfect candidate for Oz. Margaret Hamilton as the wicked witch has defined witchiness forever, and Billie Burke's irritatingly sweet voice convinces you that she really is a witch when she tells Dorothy that she knew all along how to send her home. Ray Bolger's dance sequences as the scarecrow are phenomenal. Jack Haley Jr. as the tin man is suitably sappy, and Bert Lahr couldn't pull off the cowardly lion any better than he did. (And those costumes must have been miserable to work in.) Lastly, the venerable actor Frank Morgan is perfect in his blustery role as the wizard and his various guises. BTW, if you wonder what the wicked witch's minions are singing in the ""Winkie Song"" as they march around with their spears, it's nothing more than ""O-Ee-Yah! Eoh-Ah!""

Sure it has a rather simple story, but it's a resonant film that features groundbreaking visuals (that famous twister scene, anyone?), themes that can relate to anyone (courage, having a heart, etc), famous music that became a part of pop culture lore, and just a simple fantasy story that is fun to watch and is suitable for all ages. The story itself has the feel of a 1939 movie, but those visuals are still mightily impressive. The twister scene is just amazing, and it still fathoms me to see how they created all the flying objects seem realistic. The production design is amazing as well, as we get a very colorful film.

After giving this movie a fresh look, after not watching it for a few years, I still noticed that there were those few parts that I absolutely loved! I think the special effects in this movie are great! I loveeeed when I was younger, and still do, the color changing horse! I also liked the entrances/exits of the Wicked Witch with the smoke/fire! Another great special effect is in the very beginning when the tornado hits and the lady is riding by on her bike, and as she passes the window, she gradually gets closer to it; at the closest point she turns into a witch. I love the fact that Dorothy's uncles in the beginning are the same characters or representative of the same characters as she finds down the yellow brick road (scare crow, tin man, and the lion). I also like the whole general meaning of the movie. I think that it is a great children movie because of this. It teaches you that you have to look within yourself to find the parts of you that you are missing; you can't just expect someone to give it to you. Overall, I love this movie!!!!!!!!!",

The sets, the music, the story of running away to a far off land somewhere over the rainbow held genuine and deep appeal. Unlike many kids, I was never actually that scared of the flying monkeys, nor did I think the Munchkins were that odd, they were just well dressed little people to me. Oz always seemed so great that I couldn't help but wonder why Dorothy wanted to go back home so badly. Oh well, she did and that was really the engine to propel this story. As an adult it's difficult to separate my history with the film but I will say that the 'lesson' of finding happiness where you started isn't really such a solid outlook to base your life or life decisions on.

Margaret Hamilton, a former school teacher would play the evil witch in this version. The supporting cast of characters included munchkins that earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The munchkins introduced it's audiences to dwarf sized adults many of us for the first time.

It is fun from beginning to end even to a 42-year old, with excellent portrayals of all the well-loved characters from the L. Frank Baum novel. The closest thing to an issue I had was the cowardly lion's 2nd song about being the king, but even it had it's merits.

We all know the story, but I'll recap it here. It's about a girl Dorothy from Kansas(played by the immortal Judy Garland) having struggles at home being noticed(in black & white), then a tornado comes, she goes into a fantasy world(in color) where a lot of her family is portrayed behind the Oz characters. She eventually learns that there is no place like home after struggling to get back there thru many trials & tribulations mainly coming from the evil witch of the west. This is the basic story, but it is told with such inventiveness with excellent set pieces, songs, costumes and storytelling that keeps you interested to the very end(which changes to black & white). After watching this, I now understand why this movie & it's stars have been immortalized in filmdom for all time.",

She didn't seem to get much love from anybody in Kansas, and Elvira Gulch is bound to come back for the dog (providing the cyclone didn't kill her). Another thought: Why is Glinda such a masochist? She appears to watch out over Dorothy and her friends from the heavens, but where is she when they really need her? Why are the residents of Oz so happy to see the Wizard leave? It's a big celebration, yet he's their ruler! Wouldn't they be sad to see him go? Also, there is no scene depicting the Wizard's unmasking of himself to the people of his city. How do they know he's the Wizard? Has he been behind that curtain since he arrived? A sketchy plot like this--which invites more questions than it answers--really shouldn't result in such a joyous picture, but it does. I remember when they re-released this to theaters in 1972 (after years of showing the thing on TV every year) and people lined-up down the street to see it again. That's the power of good movies.",

72,3 May 2013,zurnd,10, The Greatest Fantasy One Could Embark On,"In 1900, Lyman Frank Baum wrote a story about a little girl named Dorothy who was hurled away from dusty Kansas to the magnificent land of Oz, filled with talking Scarecrows, wicked witches, big headed wizards and magical shoes. This story was so successful upon it's release that several film adaptations have been made throughout the years, but it wasn't until 1939 when the world first saw the film that is probably the most well known and admired film of forever more. The Wizard of Oz is the pinnacle motion picture of many of our childhoods, for we saw it at a very young age and it augmented our lives and points of view. Some consider it their favorite film, others consider it a icon feast, I however see it as the greatest fantasy one could embark on. This is one of the greatest tales ever told (both the movie and the original book) and every time I set my eyes upon it, I realize more and more how much I love this film and just how legendary it really is. The Wizard of Oz is THAT film, the film everyone has seen more than once and it's imagery and surroundings are very hard to rid from the mind. It's characters are relatable and very vivid to look at (Would you believe Bert Lahr's Lion costume was 90 pounds!) and the songs the characters chant are songs everyone can sing, for everyone has heard them so many times and know the lyrics by heart.

I've been told that the audiences gasped when Dorothy walks out of the house and everything is in color. It is a transition to a magic place, made possible by cinematography. Growing up, we got one chance a year to see this. It became the highlight of an evening. It was usually on a Sunday night. The individual characterizations and incredible songs are the stuff that dreams are made of. I'm especially fond of Jack Haley's Tin Man. When he sings his song and then pounds his chest, finally releasing steam from his hat (a funnel) it's amazing. Those flying monkeys haunted me for years. Someone had a nightmare some time before dreaming those guys up. The amazing thing is that there is hardly a person who couldn't sit down and run through the plot of this.

This is a movie I never get sick of. I am 19 years old and have been watching it every year since I was 5, and I am a huge fan of old movies.
All the actors in the movie are phenomenal but my most favorites were Judy Garland, Margaret Hamilton and Bert Lahr. Their characters were the best because even though the witch is evil, I loved the Wicked Witch of The West and all her lines because she made me laugh a lot, Dorothy was a very caring character to Toto, the lion, the Tin Man, and the scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion was always a character I related to as someone who gets nervous a lot.
I will say though, the only thing I don't like about this film is what happened to Garland behind the scenes. If you do research, you will find out she had to not have sleep for 72 hours and overworked her, and whenever she slept it was only for 4 hours. Her mother and Louis Meyer also started her on drugs during this time as well, as well as have her barely eat.
All that aside, if you have never seen this movie, you are seriously missing out! It is one of the best movies of all time. 10 out of 10 for me. A+",

84,12 August 2007,keesha45,10," ""Poor little kid, I hope she gets home alright""","Professor Marvel needn't have worried about Dorothy. She had what another screen icon displayed in an equally memorable role 30 years later: True grit.The 'true grit' that Mattie Ross admires in Rooster Cogburn was something she also possesses and I find a lot of similar character traits in Mattie and Dorothy. In 1939, audiences then loved Garland's performance as the girl who survives falling into a pigpen,losing her dog,riding out a tornado,then has to battle a witch and an obstreperous wizard on her journey back home. I mention the Duke because her Dorothy and his Rooster role both netted them Oscars in their somewhat similar careers. Her Oscar was a smaller honorary statuette (which she called a ""Munchkin"" award) given for her work as Dorothy. The Duke's Oscar was close to an honorary one also. It was far from his best work and his other nominations for THE ALAMO and SANDS OF IWO JIMA were much beneath his better efforts in RED RIVER, THE QUIET MAN and THE SEARCHERS, just to name a few. I think the older members of the Academy voting the awards wanted to give Wayne the prize for his body of work to that point, partly because they were a bit shocked at the popularity of THE MIDNIGHT COWBOY, an X-rated film that garnered best actor nominations for Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. I think the Academy knew they both had long careers facing them and would be up again for awards, and they do have 3 Oscars and 11 nominations between them. The other two actors up for the award then were equally deserving. Richard Burton had received his sixth Oscar nomination and went on to a record seven nominations without wins and Peter O'Toole had picked up his fourth nomination and just this year broke Burton's record with his 8th non-winning nomination. I'm sure a lot of the voting members felt O'Toole and Burton more deserving of the Oscar, but sentiment for the aging Duke won out and it was probably a very narrow margin of votes that carried the day. While the Duke's Oscar came near the end of his career, Judy's came when she was just getting started. But like Wayne's Rooster role, her most honored and beloved screen character represents just the tip of an iceberg. She earned two other Oscar nominations and sold a lot of records and was a popular TV performer. As John Wayne could never overcome his western/war hero screen persona (and probably never really would have given that up), Garland was never able to find a plum part like Dorothy again either. That's not to say she went totally downhill from there. By all accounts, she had an outstanding career, plagued though it was by personal troubles. But Dorothy put her star up in the cosmos and she could never reach that high again. Her plucky character and her memorable friends and foes in the enchanting world of Oz set this film apart as one of the greatest of all time and deservedly so.I just saw this on the big screen at my neighborhood Garland Theatre. Although like millions of others who had seen this on television more than once, it was still a great story brought to life by the magic of cinema. I don't know if I suddenly became allergic to popcorn, but the climax brought tears to my eyes. Few films do that for me and I was surprised at my reaction to what I thought was an old chestnut I'd seen more times than I can remember. Maybe I'm just getting old and decrepit and overly sentimental for the good old days or maybe it's because this film can still carry a powerful message to new generations seeing it anew. I'd like to believe it's more of the latter than the former. Dale Roloff",

Frank Baum stories with screenplay from noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf and about a dozen others that contributed to dialog including tow of the film's stars Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. The film received six Academy Award nominations winning two for Herbert Sothart's musical score and original song for Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg. It lost the 1939 Best Picture and Best Art Direction Academy Awards to Gone With the Wind and Best Cinematography to Wuthering Heights but incredibly lost Best Effects yo The Rains Came. Director Victor Flemming had a good year in 1939 directing both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, two films that endearingly live on for generations. Great cinematography here from Harold Rosson who had a 50 year cinematography career that began in the early silent films and ended with Howard Hawks El Dorado in 1966. Veteran film editor Blanche Sewall skillfully edited this piece but over the years so much of this film has been cut up for television that it wasn't until recently that it's been restored to near it's original form. A fantastic cast with Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Amazingly Burke who plays good witch Glinda was 54 years old at the time. Five years older than Frank Morgan and 17 years older than Margaret Hamilton.

They show everything for real what kids once didn't even dream of imagining - they are graphic, loud and if there's a morality lesson to be learned from it at all it's sugar-coated beyond recognition. The musical classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" is different. Starting off on a farm in Kansas, a plain kind of reality shot in black and white awaits. A genuine surprise move for its time the film then dives into the Technicolor fantasy world of Dorothy's dream, only to eventually emerge back where we set out - in the reality of life, unchanged in color, but full with experiences gained from the journey enriching what once seemed drab and plain. Thus the ""Wizard of Oz"" is a coming of age movie that deals with anxieties and how to overcome them - with a bit of brain, heart and courage things are half as frightening as they seem, and we are reassured that even wizards are just plain human.",

You do not get to be hearty, gutsy or brainy by some magic, these don't come from a wizard, but by experience and learning who you are and what you're capable of and what defines you indeed; I must confess I've found this identity quest very much appealing.

The entire Munchkin scene is like a little opera. And to think that this film was not appreciated in its day. Probably people saw it as a children's film which it certainly is not.",
113,21 February 2010,johnmschofield,10, A magical moving picture that for me will never lose its lustre,"Like a lot of the people on this planet I have watched this film many times but in order to get some idea of the events leading up to its creation I looked at the trivia section on IMDb. How this film actually made it to the screen is just amazing and how it actually turns out is absolutely stunning when you read some of the problems there were in just arriving at the cast and main crew list. I find it curiously satisfying that the film turned out to be so magical. Not being in the position of knowing anyone who was around at the time the film was made I can only speculate why after all of the problems surrounding the making of this film it turned out the way it did. I choose to believe that it was down to the professional attitude of those who were involved. Maybe that is a dewy eyed attitude but the film was actually made and all the rest is other detail. I know that I was captivated by it all the way through and found the whole experience extremely pleasant. Unfortunately I did not see it as a child but I am told by some who did that their reaction was the same jaw dropping captivation as mine. I don't really look too deeply into why I liked it so much, I do not know enough about why something works, scene construction or camera angles or whatever I just know this works and I know I am not alone in liking this film. If you were looking for a description of a plot or synopsis in this review you will not find one here because there are numerous other reviewers who are infinitely more eloquent than me. For anybody watching this film for the first time please don't look for the goofs just enjoy it for what it is. It is a fantasy and one of the best if not the best ever made.",

The movie makes you feel as if you are in this magical world along side Dorothy, as if you are lost as well. Everything from the characters, music, set design, and story line makes us fall in love. The Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Tin-man seem like old friends and are easy to relate to. They each touch on a fear that most people have on some level. The Cowardly Lion shows fear (in general) and uncertainty. The Tin-man shows vulnerability with oneself and emotions. And the Scarecrow lacks self-worth dealing with intelligence. And even Dorothy, she represents the fear of being lost, and leaving your comfort zone. The characters help the audience connect to the movie more, and become more emotionally invested. Not only is the characterization great in this movie, but just looking at the it all is nothing less than beautiful. The elaborate sets and colorful images makes your eyes dance around the screen. This movie was made when color was first still being introduced, and even though it wasn't the first colored movie, it definitely was the first that really took advantage of the use of color.

When Miss Gulch takes Toto away, Toto escapes and runs back to Dorothy. Soon, she runs away from home, and runs into Professor Marvel. He's a fake psychic that tells her that her Auntie Em is sick, so Dorothy and Toto run back home, then a storm comes and takes Dorothy and Toto to Oz, a place over the rainbow. She lands in Munchkinland, and the house accidentally lands on Wicked Witch of the West's sister, which pisses her off and Dorothy magically have the ruby slippers on her feet. Glinda, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy to see the Wizard so she can get back home. On her way, she befriends Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion, who also seek help from the Wizard.

The musical numbers really stand out and even when the movie is over some of the tunes, actually just about all of the tunes was stuck in my head. The musical numbers all just really stick and although the adventure is simple it's memorable. Some of the virtues and morals in this movie can be questionable to some, but it's well blended into the story. In fact the musical numbers and the journey in this is more memorable than ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"". Especially since it has musical numbers like ""Over the Rainbow"".

This is an absolutely incredibly made film. Huge lavish sets. Technicolour like that was never seen before. Wonderful performances. Visual effects I can't believe were possible in 1939. So far ahead of its time in terms of scale and technicality and what was being done with the camera at this time. It truly is the perfect film in every way. And another thing I thought about for the first time is that so many films are timeless classics and you think they will never be remade. But then inevitably at some point many years later there comes a time when it does start to show its age in small ways and could benefit from a revitalisation for modern audiences so they do get remade. This is one of those films that you just simply can't imagine being remade. And 83 years later and still Hollywood hasn't dared touch it. Any remake made today would pale in comparison. It could still be many many years before anyone even considers it. This is a remarkable testament to how far ahead of its time and what an accomplishment it truly is.",

Directed by the same director of ""Gone with the Wind"" in the same year, Victor Fleming has helped to bring L. Frank Baum's timeless children's' stories to life on the big screen. The story tells about Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto, who get sent to the land of Oz, after their house in Kansas was sent in a tornado. Along the way, they meet singing munchkins, a scarecrow in need of a brain, a tin man in need of a heart, a lion in need of courage, a beautiful kind witch, flying monkeys, a green nasty witch, and a wonderful wizard of a green city. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of my all-time favorite movies for many reasons. It's a movie for all audiences to enjoy, and it's perfect for the whole family. The performances by Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, and Margaret Hamilton as these wonderful characters were quite memorable to watch on screen. The characters are memorable, the art direction and costumes are imaginative, the story is timeless, and the music is still wonderful, with all of those classic songs we used to sign to as children. The songs never leave your head, and you always want to hum to them. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a beautiful memory of our childhood, and it brings some heartwarming moments of love, courage, and how home matters.

162,3 July 2000,Brian-272,10, A Timeless Classic. A Film For All Ages. Remember There's No Place Like Home!,"The Wizard Of Oz is by now a cult classic. So many themes and principles are present to name a few there's boredom, escape, exploring new adventures, dreamed fantasies, wicked enemies becoming witches, friendship, journey and discovery and finally learning the true meaning of home and family. This movie has been seen by a billion people many like myself have viewed it a couple hundred times. Many good things can be said about this beloved 1939 classic Oz is simply more than just a movie about a dreamy Kansas farm girl who takes an unforgettable trip down the Yellow Brick Road to a magical fantasy world. This film made Judy Garland(Dorothy) a star, just to mention Garland brought a certain sex appeal to Oz she was one of the most beautiful actresses of her time it was tragic her life ended so young. For some unexplained reason I tend to have sexual thoughts and feelings now every time that I now watch Oz I can particularly relate to my own past intimate relationships with females when viewing Oz, but I now see the trigger factor is the beauty of Judy Garland. Margaret Hamilton is perfectly cast as The Wicked Witch of the West her wicked looks use to give me nightmares as a child when I would view Oz, but as time past and I matured the terror went away. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are all lovable characters hey wouldn't it be great to have friends like that on earth to help guide you on your journey of life. This film became a national institution, thanks to perennial TV airings, the Technicolor brilliance of Oz, and the song ""Over the Rainbow"". Many believe Oz gives a message of a continued journey that travel should be a regular that people should continue to travel and see new lands meet new people and search for answers. I instead take the message of Oz as there's no place like home. I have found this out from my own experiences. The world happens to be a very cold and cruel place as in comparison to home love, comfort, and support which are present. Knowledge can be found at home, and home is where the heart is, and courage is found inside your home. Remember there's no place like home.",

In the 50's, we could not wait to see this movie, especially once a year on TV. But, seeing it on the screen was awesome. Last week, we took our nephew to see it, and I was amazed at how many people never saw it on a big screen. Guess we were lucky, it only cost 5 cents. Anyway, I have not read all the comments, and most are from out of the country, but if anyone travels thru Chittenango, NY---it was the home of L Frank Baum. His grandson still lives there, and every year, they put on a spectacle. The first time we drove thru, I was amazed, to see all the streets, yes, paved with yellow bricks. The businesses? They all had names like; Dorothy's place, or Oz gift store (I don't actually remember what they are, even thought I'm 45 minutes away.) But again, if you are going thru upstate NY, central NY---it's really pretty, especially this time of year, in the fall. Speaking of falls, they also have a pretty waterfall.

The film itself is full of ironies: it was released in August, 1939 to an indifferent audience and bombed. Producer Mervyn LeRoy was so financially damaged he swore never to put another cent of his own money in another movie. No adaption of Oz has ever been a hit in it's initial release. The film didn't achieve it's classic status until it was recycled on TV in the 50's (more irony: the vast majority of the first TV audiences viewed it in blazing black & white, taking out much of it's color transforming wallop).

The others that I've seen are either like sequels or something or they just add in a bunch of random garbage. As the first movie to have color, this movie was amazing when it came out and it's still pretty good today. Although color is normal today, it's interesting to see what people thought was incredible in 1939. According to IMDb, several Wizard of Oz movies are scheduled. I think that they need to stop them just as much if not more than they need to stop Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. In short, this movie is worth seeing at least once.",
179,8 February 2021,TheHonestCritic,10," This is quite simply, one of the greatest family films in all of cinema. How does it hold up today?","""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), every time I watch this movie, I feel like a child again, which is the sign of a timeless film. This movie is so good, that it has managed to find a place on my top 10 all-time favorite family films list. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is, a girl from Kansas named Dorothy ends up in a tornado and eventually winds up knocked out. During that time, she dreams that she's in a mythical land called Oz and must find a way to get home. From there, it's non-stop fun and adventure as Dorothy and her newfound friends set off to find the wizard who could possibly help her find a way back home. Now, at first glance, the plot doesn't really sound like it's that big and engaging. However, the story is written so brilliantly that it keeps you fully invested and having fun all the way from beginning to end. I won't say anything else about the plot at the risk of spoiling it for those who might not have seen it yet. But, let me say this, the plot line is exciting, fun and it also has a few dramatic scenes as well. Those elements are what really carry this film to the next level and equate to a perfect family movie! As far as the acting goes, it's nothing short of sublime from all of the actors and actresses. Every single cast member nails their respectable character flawlessly. But, the two shining stars are Judy Garland as Dorothy and Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West. Those are two of the best performances you will ever see in any family film. Judy Garland does a phenomenal job as Dorothy and Margaret Hamilton is stellar as the Wicked Witch of the West. Their character portrayals make this movie all the more stronger. The rest of the cast is just as brilliant! Remember, a supporting cast is only as good as it's main cast. Every character stands out no matter how long they are on-screen. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really give this film a stunning atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are outstanding. They do get a little dated at times, but overall, the special effects still hold up today. Fun fact, this is one of the first full-length movies to be filmed in color. Back in the 1930's, film was expensive as you can probably imagine, especially color film. It was a risk to make the majority of this movie in full color. But, at the end of the day, it was a gamble that definitely paid off. Every time Dorothy enters the land of Oz, I always get chills as it transitions from black and white to color. Imagine the audience's reaction in the theater back then! Finally, the soundtrack is perfect and it sets the perfect tone for the story. Kudos to songwriters Harold Arlen and Herbert Stothart. Your film score is phenomenal, it helps bring it to life and it gives this movie it's own unique identity! ""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of the greatest family films of all-time, as it should be. To this day, it still holds up perfectly and is a timeless masterpiece. Seriously, what else can I say about it that hasn't been said already? Another thing, this movie is based on the book, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" written by L. Frank Baum. I have read the book before, it's very well-written and enjoyable. However, this film does the original book justice and then some. This is an example of where the movie is better than the book itself. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. To end my review, let's have a moment of silence for the cast of this film, as all of them have passed away. They may be gone today, but their legacy, including what they left behind in this movie will last forever. If you haven't seen ""The Wizard of Oz"", go see it today, especially if you have children. I guarantee that your kids will love it just as much as you and everybody else who has seen it at some point. Regardless of your age, this film should be on everyone's must-see list. Go watch it as soon as possible, or the Wicked Witch of the West will haunt you in your dreams!",
180,5 January 2013,amandaroseobrien84,10, Four Year Old Me's Obsession,"I think every kid has THAT MOVIE growing up. You know, the one you watched every day & had memorized. The Wizard of Oz was my movie. It was my life. This movie is one of those classics that could not be improved upon by modern film wizardry. If made today, the Cowardly Lion would most likely be CGI but he wouldn't have the personality Bert Lahr gave the character. One of the most depressing things that has happened to the filmmaking process, in my opinion, is how many movies are just people standing in front of a green screen with all the magic added later by computers.

Last month or so, I saw it in a theatre for the first time with my movie theatre-working friend as it celebrated it's 80th anniversary. When Professor Marvel mentioned Isis, we both cracked how that word now inspires dread and when the Scarecrow mentioned some jokes about brains, I mentioned a certain President. I also mentioned to my friend how the only part I didn't like about the movie was the Lion's singing about being the King of the Forest as it really stopped the movie and not in a good way. The role of Dorothy was perfect for then 16-year-old Judy Garland even though the girl in the book was originally a pre-teen. And Thank Goodness calmer heads prevailed and her signature song, ""Over the Rainbow"", was not cut out! It won that deserved Oscar as did Judy for that special miniature Academy Award she got (though I hope she later replaced that with the more standard size!)

We all know Judy Garland and the dreamlike story, but it continues to work for me due to it's altruist quartet together on their journey for personal completion. As they often meet up with the terrifying Margaret Hamilton and her army of flying monkeys, the struggle to find their way home is rewarded by the self help revelations which seemingly grant each their wish. There's movie theaters where we can escape, AA meetings and their like where we can seek self improvement, and there's home, of course. But there's no place like Oz that puts them all together",

An experience that is not easily forgotten. It remains for me the best children's film ever made, thanks to Victor Fleming and his marvelous cast. Considering the technology of the cinema back in 1939, it was truly remarkable in many of its effects. There are some magical moments, Judy Garland's heart felt singing of ""Over the Rainbow"" (never equaled by others), and the early monochrome scenes in Kansas with the approaching tornado, the first view of Oz in colour, the Witches feet rolling up under the house, the walk through the enchanted forest and the field of poppies, the initial meetings with the Scarecrow, Tinman, and the Wizard, the Bad Witch melting under the water, and the farewell to Oz. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch, remains one of the screens most frightening characters. Perhaps the Munchkins are allowed too much screen time, but once Dorothy starts her journey along the yellow brick road, and meets her strange companions, it's a joy to behold. A film that both enchanted and frightened me at a very early age, as indeed did Walt Disney's ""Snow White"" a couple of years earlier. Perhaps many future generations of children will find the thrill of Oz still alive and well in this remarkable production.",

""Oz"" is such a strange movie, in some ways so creaky and old-fashioned, in other ways so incredibly ahead of its time. Few films I've seen during my lifetime have such a complete vision as ""Oz"" does---such painstaking care went into the look and design of the film; it's as if the filmmakers really did create a whole other world for this film to take place in. It's odd that during a time in American film history, when movies were being cranked out like cars on an assembly line, a film could feel like such an auteurish product (increasingly odd, since the credited director, Victor Fleming, actually shared directing duties with several others.

It's charming and quaint, relic of a bygone era where naivete was a-okay and being earnest wasn't seen as a handicap. Loaded with unforgettable lines and classic songs, nothing feels elbowed-in or insignificant, and I say that as a viewer with very little patience for musical interludes. Sometimes it's nice to just climb into that time capsule and relive your own childhood (as I have to think a vast majority of the current population first saw it at that age), but it also serves as an impressive example of thoughtful, creative filmmaking. The famous mid-scene switch from sepia tones to full-blown Technicolor remains especially stunning, a masterful reveal that immediately brings the land of Oz to life with a roar, and the intense, colorful landscapes that light up every scene never let up. A few seams may show here and there, particularly around the matte paintings in recent HD transfers, but in some ways that works to the film's benefit. Clearly, a tremendous amount of love and care went into this one, and that still radiates as warmly today as it did almost eighty years ago. Well-balanced, evenly paced and visually dazzling, it's aged stupendously and stands tall as a cornerstone of family cinema.

Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has become a beloved movie standard which is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. This classic movie touches the heart and invites each viewer to relive a childhood sense of wonder and adventure. How many have grown up having viewed this 1939 movie not necessarily recognizing its cutting edge impact during the transitioning from black and white to Technicolor? It is interesting to contrast other musical adventure cinema to The Wizard of Oz. More recent movies such as Annie, The Sound of Music, or Mary Poppins do not capture and stretch the imagination holding dear specific scenes to our hearts as does the story line and characters in Oz. The songs that each of the character sings along the journey to Oz representing meaning and inspiration to us individually.

The costumes are a noteworthy aspect, with each one being so different and so detailed it deserves some praise. Somewhere over the rainbow is beautifully iconic as well as many other aspects of this film, spawning many years of tributes, remakes, spin offs, and parodies even.

From childhood, Dorothy Gale left me awestruck with her beautiful voice and her red ruby slippers. The whimsical, fantastic nature of this film makes it ideal for families and children, but one of the reasons that The Wizard of Oz has stood the test of time and become such a classic is that it isn't just for children, but for people of all ages. It inspires a sort of nostalgia in many, and it allows the modern-day viewer a glimpse into a simpler age of film-making. The lack of CGI despite the exotic nature of Oz dates the film and simultaneously adds to its charm.

Maturity is a sobering catalyst of realism which often extinguishes the merriment of candy coated mountain tops and melting lemon drops. Nostalgia, however, is the last hope one has that connects them to that place somewhere over the rainbow. Watching this film as an adult sometimes creates a feeling of confounding dismay. Why can't I? Is the question I ask as I sit in the unemployment line or spit shine my useless, but nicely framed college degree. As I sit here broke, burdened and depressed by the tribulations of my adulthood, nostalgia finds its way into my gloomy existence offering a map to emerald city. How dare Dorothy lie to me, by igniting my ambitions as a child only to let me down in my adulthood. Is this the fault of Dorothy and her fellow conspirators or has the interpretation of her experience changed? I guess I will go with the latter since I know now that the place somewhere over the rainbow is still attainable, however, this place has a refurbished sense of meaning to me. This place exemplifies a spiritual paradise that can only be attained by faith. Here on earth, the daily grinds of life will always find a way to kill what little hope I have left, but money, credit cards, and SallieMae can never purchase the true feeling of spiritual freedom otherwise known to me as that place somewhere over the rainbow.

Those who resign themselves to the safe harbor of postponing efforts to take on risks and challenges have their character development set in time. The characters in the movie, the cowardly lion, the heartless tin man, and brainless scarecrow all symbolize the character flaws in Dorothy's real life adult friends back home. To some degree, Dorothy collectively had each one of those flaws. We see in Dorothy an intelligence, courageous, and a good-hearted young lady. When Dorothy suffers a concussion and drifts into a coma, she mentally commits herself to overcoming those flaws. A mental challenge known as the trip down the ""yellow brick road."" Her initial expectation was to painlessly be cured by Wizard of Oz and sent home. The Wizard, however, prescribed an arduous journey that would put to test all her capacities. She would have to confront evil in the world, in the form of the Wicked Witch of the West. From her trial and tribulations would emerge her renewed self. In the process, she would show care, compassion, and a deep concern for her companion's safety and well-being over her own.

What made this such a great film is the use of imagination and the friendships between the characters. Another amazing thing about this movie was the cinematography. There were lots of great shots with special effects used to highlight the magical moments in the scenes. A lot of the characters had very enthusiastic and vibrant personalities to them which I think makes them more enjoyable and relatable. I also think the way the characters were written had a huge influence on future stories and movies. In most films and television shows, the evil/villain character always has the same type of high pitched evil sounding cackle, and I think this came from the Wicked Witch of The West. Another great aspect of this movie is the way Fleming weaved all the musical numbers throughout the story. I think each song came into place at the right time and nothing seemed out of place.",

The part I loved the most was that Dorothy befriended the characters of Oz, despite some of them not showing her kindness initially.

Despite being made pre World War II this movie is magical. What makes the movie really enjoyable are its colorful characters who take you onto a journey with catchy songs. Although Judy Garland was story-wise too old to play Dorothy, I don't think anyone else could have done it better here.

Released in theaters as early as 1910, audiences wanted more from these early attempts. They wanted more, than just guys in bad horse costumes, cheezie bat costumes and effects, that even audiences in 1914 felt, did not look good. The film industry was not ready for the kind of storytelling, that L. Frank Baum needed to have, in order to make these films appealing to the audience of the day. These types of films needed more time to pass. They needed Hollywood to evolve and grow more. They needed to wait until 1939.",

270,14 May 2019,josephkinion,9, Nominated for best Picture (1939),"Dorothy Gale lives with her dog Toto on the Kansas farm of her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. Toto bites Miss Almira Gulch on the leg, and she obtains an order from the sheriff for Toto to be euthanized. She takes Toto away on her bicycle, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, and she decides to run away. She meets Professor Marvel, a kindly fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart. Dorothy races home, arriving just as a tornado strikes. Locked out of the farm's storm cellar, she seeks shelter in her bedroom. Wind-blown debris knocks her unconscious and the house is sent spinning in the air. She awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.The house lands in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz. Glinda the Good Witch of the North and the Munchkins welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, arrives to claim the slippers, but Glinda transports them onto Dorothy's feet first. The Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy, then vanishes. Glinda tells Dorothy to keep the slippers on and follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where she can ask the Wizard of Oz to help her get back home.
On her journey, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain, the Tin Woodman, who desires a heart, and the Cowardly Lion, who needs courage. Dorothy invites them to accompany her to Emerald City, where they can ask the Wizard to help them too. Despite the Witch's attempts to foil their journey, they reach the Emerald City and are eventually permitted to see the Wizard, who appears as a large ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke. He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.
As the foursome and Toto make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch captures Dorothy and plots her death in order to remove her slippers. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don the guards' uniforms, march inside and free Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase and surround them. The Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, causing Dorothy to toss a bucket of water, inadvertently splashing the Witch, who melts away. The guards rejoice and give Dorothy her broomstick.The Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises, until Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the ""Wizard"" as a middle-aged man operating machinery and speaking into a microphone. Admitting to being a humbug, he insists that he is a good man but a bad wizard. He then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his hot air balloon. He reveals that he, too, is from Kansas, and worked at a carnival when a tornado brought him to the Emerald City. He was offered and accepted the job as Wizard due to hard times.
As Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto, distracted by a cat, leaps from Dorothy's arms. As she pursues Toto, the balloon disembarks with the Wizard, leaving Dorothy. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy the ruby slippers have the power to return her to Kansas if she taps her heels together three times repeating ""There's no place like home."" Dorothy complies and wakes up in her bedroom surrounded by her family and friends, including Toto. Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real and says she will never run away from home again. She then declares: ""There's no place like home!""",

Whatever, the colours, all those mythical scenes, ""Over the rainbow""... It's a classic and that's that!

And yes, no one needed to spout out those 4 letter words that in todays world are somehow mandatory for good acting & film-making. And what a wonderful idea. Start the film in black & white. Then, when landing in OZ, they used a most effective technique of switching to color as the house door is opened for a first peak outside. Also, credit the gifted supporting actors, whose characters played so well against each others personalities and obvious shortcomings. The simple innocence of the Dorothy character bolstered by the incredible musical talents of Judy Garland made the film an all time classic.

275,19 October 2016,tayshea26,10," ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz""","The Wizard of Oz is a mesmerizing tale that takes viewers to an enchanted land beyond their wildest imaginations. It's a land filled with bright colors, memorable music, and a wicked old witch, played by Margaret Hamilton. Dorothy Gale, played by the incomparable Judy Garland, gets whisked away from her farm in Kansas to a magical land called Oz. After learning that her house killed the Wicked Witch of the East, a group of jolly munchkins points her in the direction of the Emerald City along the yellow brick road. While she and her dog Toto are traveling this road, she meets and befriends a witless scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a rusty tin man (Jack Haley), and a cowardly lion (Burt Lahr). The four friends then embark on a journey to see ""the wonderful Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan)"" in the Emerald City. This is a perfect movie for children of all ages and their families to enjoy. But beware, some scenes might be a little scary for younger children, such as the ones with the Wicked Witch of the West. However, the movie incorporates many funny and enjoyable scenes. The combination of these different scenes makes the movie especially entertaining. Writers Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar Allan Woolf, did a spectacular job adapting the movie from the book. The acting is superb by each and every one of the characters. You can tell that the actors and actresses became one with their characters, making it really believable for the audience. Adrian Adolph Greenberg did a wonderful job with the costumes. The makeup was also very well done, giving the impression that characters such as the Scarecrow, were real people. The costumes and makeup were imaginative, adding to the overall magic of the movie. The setting and props did an excellent job of making Oz seem like a real place. The special effects helped add even more to the realism of Oz. My absolute favorite thing about the movie was the marvelous singing and dancing. The music is catchy, and makes you feel like you want to sing along. The dancing goes especially well with the songs and was amusing to watch. All in all, The Wizard of Oz is unforgettable story, sure to be a hit for years to come. It's a movie you can watch over and over again and it never loses its magic. I know I'm definitely going to add it to my list of favorite movies. So be sure to watch it with your family and friends, I can promise you that you won't regret it.",

""Gone With The Wind"", which swept the Oscars that year, was also a masterpiece of Technicolor, and like this film, a classic of America cinema. There is much to admire in ""Wizard Of Oz"", which has taken its place in cinematic history as America's most beloved family classic. Drawn from the novel by L. Frank Baum, this was not the first version to appear in film. Dramatic silent film renditions were made between 1910-1914 ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and ""His Majesty, The Scarecrow Of Oz"" based on the Baum novels. But this was a phenomenal musical version, starring Judy Garland in a signature role. She portrays Dorothy Gayle, a girl from Kansas who lives with her Aut Em and Uncle Henry and seems to have a difficult time fitting in. Before long, a tornado whisks her away to an enchanted world of elfin creatures called Munchkins and a beautiful enchantress Glinda (Billie Burke) who tell her that the only way out is through an audience with the mysterious Wizard of the Emerald City. Dorothy and her dog Toto start down the Yellow Brick Road and encounter a trio of characters which have become household names - The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), The Tin Man (Jack Haley) and The Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr). The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton in a terrific performance) is after Dorothy, hell-bent on killing her and retrieving the powerful ruby slippers. The unforgettable songs like Follow The Yellow Brick Road, Somewhere Over The Rainbow by Harold Arlen became top American songs of the 20th century. This film is pure magic, unlike anything of its time. When Dorothy leaves behind the dull, black-and-white world of Kansas, audiences are literally transported from the earlier black-and-white films of the 20's and 30's to the new and vibrant world of Technicolor, which is Oz. This film not only represents the Golden Age of early Technicolor cinema, but it is a story that has a powerful theme of returning to one's home, of finding one's identity. Dorothy, far from being a flat character, journeys from awkward, flighty girl to courageous, mature young woman who has acquired a sense of self and, whether we believe she dreamed Oz or lived it, she can now live her life with a renewed sense of confidence. This movie can never go out of style. It remains a classic of American cinema. Enjoy!",

A 30 year old teenager from Kansas has a dog to be executed, and rightfully so, for biting old ladies in their own gardens, but the dog escapes and comes home, so naturally Dorothy decides to run away from home and meets a gypsy who unrealistically helps to convince her to go home instead of take advantage of her, and that's why a tornado begins and Dorothy runs home just in-time to see all her family and friends are saving their own lives in a shelter instead of looking for her.

281,30 June 2020,baileycrawly,10, A Cinematic Masterpiece,"The Wizard of Oz was a technical and visual marvel when it was first released in 1939, pushing the boundaries of what could be accomplished on film. Despite numerous behind-the-scenes issues that marred the production, it was a film that wowed the world and propelled Judy Garland into superstardom and an infamy that would be viewed simultaneous to her name years and years after her passing.
Now, in 2020, The Wizard of Oz is every bit as fresh, entertaining and moving as it was the day it first came out. Judy's stellar performance of Over the Rainbow never fails to bring tears, Margaret Hamilton's deliciously malicious cackles still terrify, and Frank Morgan's Emerald City is still as pretty as it ever was before.
With the help of Warner Bros.' fantastic 4K transfer, The Wizard of Oz looks even nicer, bringing out the absolute best the original nitrate negatives had to offer, bringing us closer to what Oz looked like on set than we've ever been before.",

It is not so much as a deal breaker but more like something to take note of. However I do believe that this is a film that would significantly cater to the tastes of some people.

Plus, its sanded edges make for a somewhat 'vanilla' experience. Still, the picture is mostly enjoyable and is practically the definition of escapist fantasy. 6/10",

Dorothy the protagonist lives in the country, surrounded by corruption (for example, a mean-spirited local woman has relatives in high places, thanks to which she easily gets the local judge to sign off on an order to put down Dorothy's adorable dog Toto), crime (when Dorothy runs off to save Toto, she doesn't get more than a few miles from her house before coming across a vagrant who tries to rob her, and would've probably tried worse if the weather hadn't suddenly kicked up), and frequent natural disasters in the form of twister tornadoes. It's pretty much Hell on Earth, and it's no wonder that Dorothy is desperate to leave this dreadful place, to which effect she sings a very moving song in the beginning. ",

My dad made it a habit to speak to Mr Dee every time he came into the store and loudly say ""HELLO MR DEE HOW ARE YOU THIS FINE DAY?"" He said that this greeting was also a way let people know that Mr Dee was not a little old lady.

The film was based on the novel and ever since it's release, it has been recognized through out decade after decade, and till this day, people could still confirm this film as a great movie from their childhood. When I watch this film, I get a warm feeling in me that just glows. Even when I was not in the best mood, this film was always their to cheer me up. The visual style is still fantastic, even to this day. It's like a flash of color in your eyes, and that Emerald City still shines like a diamond. The characters are still great. Dorathy is a farm girl who's tired of her life in the farm and dreams of a world full of imagination. Scarecrow is without a brain. Tinman is a human tin without a heart, though is still sentimental and compassionate. The Cowardly Lion is a hilarious Lion who's...well, a coward. And The Wicked Witch is a symbol of childhood fears. Man I remember how much she scared me when I was a child. That black attire, green skin and cackling voice would have kids running for their moms. What else is there to say. The music is done very well and the musical numbers are great. My favorite is when the lion sings about what his life would be if he had the nerve to become king of the forest.

Basically Dorothy Gale (seventeen year old Judy Garland) from sepia coloured Kansas runs away from home, only to return to the house and get caught in a twister. She lands in a coloured world that appears to be ""over the rainbow"", Oz, greeted by Gilda the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) and the Munchkins of Munchkinland. Then appears The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) who threatens Dorothy after she killed her sister (the Wicked Witch of the East), and having the ruby slippers put on her feet. To be safe Dorothy starts a journey, following the yellow brick road to the Emerald City to see the Wizard of Oz. Along the way she is joined by the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) who wants a brain, the Tin Man (Jack Haley) who wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who wants courage. They reach the Emerald City and met a scary Wizard, who says he will only grant their requests if they get the broomstick of the Wicked Witch. Of course when Dorothy is captured by the Witch's winged monkeys, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion go into the dark castle to save her, and she is eventually killed with a splash of water. The Wizard (Frank Morgan, also playing Professor Marvel, The Gatekeeper, The Carriage Driver and The Doorman) reveals himself as a normal man, but he does and give the three friends a brain (a diploma), courage (a medal) and a heart (a heart shaped ticking clock). After The Wizard floats away in an air balloon, Dorothy says a tearful goodbye before clicking her toes and repeating ""There's no place like home"" (number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes) returning to sepia Kansas with Auntie Em (Clara Blandick), Uncle Henry (Charley Grapewin), Hunk (Bolger), Zeke (Lahr) and Hickory (Haley). Garland is enchanting, the three boys joining her all get their moments, Hamilton makes a great Wicked Witch, and with magical songs to sing along to, it is a perfect family film. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Herbert Stothart, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects and Best Picture. Judy Garland was number 82 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, she was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 28 on The World's Greatest Actor, The Wicked Witch of the West was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 99 (""I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!"") and number 4 (""Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."") on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, ""Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead"" was number 82, and the Oscar winning ""Over the Rainbow"" was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 3 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments (for the Witch and flying monkeys), it was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Only very insecure cinema reviewers and ""film school"" professors (that is, those dudes who think that they--and they alone--are on the verge of ""understanding"" CITIZEN KANE) could rate the disjointed Orwellian newsreel above ""Dorothy Gale's"" epic journey to Emerald City. One of these flicks features a Yellow Brick Road; the other, a rotten sled. One film is dominated by the Wicked Witch of the West; the other, by a drunken hag. Aging, alcoholic, gold-digging showgirls are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, but WHO ELSE could curdle your blood by demanding to know ""WHO killed my sister?"" Or by threatening ""I'm going to get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!"" ""Charles Foster Kane"" may have become ""unstuck in time,"" but his hop-scotching through the years can't hold a candle to ""Billy Pilgrim's"" anachronistic adventures during SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. (Don't even TRY to picture Mr. Welles caged--in the buff--as he's ogled by alien zoo-goers, along with a similarly unclad Double D Lady!) CITIZEN KANE lacks even ONE chart-topping hit song. (Can you imagine how much better it COULD have been if it had opened to the strains of ""Ding dong, old Chuck is dead!""?) Though both KANE and OZ are met to be scathing critiques of American monetary policies as of 120 years ago, when KANE's sledding gets tough, it breaks a snow globe. OZ, on the other hand, keeps its eye on the crystal ball, never losing sight of the fact that the Yellow (Gold) Brick Road is a Dead End Street. Kane pulls most of its punches, devolving into the bathos of maudlin sentimentality. Conversely, OZ promises us that heroes can lead a Popular Uprising against the Established Order, ""liquidating"" the Fat Cat One Per Centers who think that THEY can Lord it over We True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label Working Stiff Citizens forever!",
329,1 February 2010,Aaron1375,7, My guess is that this is not what the writer of the book envisioned.,"The film has a certain charm about it and considering the time period it was made in it was a very well made film. However, I am betting the writer was not envisioning a musical with people dressed in what looks like Halloween costumes. Once again for the time I am sure they did the best they could, but looking back on it the characters of the Scarecrow, Tin man, and the Lion just are not that impressive, granted they are great for a child to see as that sequel that Disney put out years later had some freaky stuff that spooked me as a kid. That would be more my style now so that is why I am commenting about it, I am not really wanting to disparage this film it is just that my tastes have changed and this is not going to be a movie I can really sit through now. However, I remember it fondly from my childhood so I give it a seven which is a rather good mark to me. The witch was excellent, I do not know who played that part, but she convinced me that she was the bad witch. And while I normally do not care for musicals, the songs in this film were nice and catchy and did not detract from the film as the song sequences in other films tend to do for me. The cast is good, though I do not think Judy Garland should have been Dorthy. She seems to old for the part and at times it seems a bit strange when she is talking as she is talking like a twelve year old and she looks like she could be in her twenties. She has a nice singing voice though so that makes up for it a bit. All in all a good film, I would suggest a remake that had more edge to it, but I figure they would screw it up royally. I do want to try and find that ""Return to Oz"" movie though as I hear it was rather dark and at times had very frightening imagery.",

She does so but as she arrives, the family is in the cyclone cellar; hit by a shutter, Dorothy is knocked unconscious. When she wakes, she is dreaming, and the house has been carried off by the tornado. Objects whirl by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle from whose basket Toto escaped earlier; only she turns into a witch on a broomstick. But the house lands safely; and a strange land greets her eyes; female voices sing, garish-hued flowers sprout, and amid ponds there is a yellow brick road and a central plaza. A rainbow-colored bubble approaches; from it steps Glinda, Good Witch of the North. Dorothy finds out her house has killed the Wicked Witch of the Munchkins' land. She has to admit she is no sort of witch; but she becomes the little people's heroine for her deed anyhow. Then out of smoke the Wicked Witch of the West, the other witch's sister, appears and threatens Dorothy. Glinda transfers the dead witch's ruby slippers to Dorothy, warning her to keep them on always. Wanting to get home, Dorothy is advised to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where the Wizard can perhaps help. Along her way, as she goes on with Toto, she picks up three companions--a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman, and a Cowardly Lion. They all need help too--one lacks a brain, the second a heart, the third courage; so they accompany her, hoping to get help also. The Wicked Witch writes, ""Surrender Dorothy"" on the sky after trying to steal the slippers when poppy fumes fell the quartet; Glinda wakes them by causing a snowstorm whose chill revives the quartet. In the Emerald City, they gain admittance to the palace. The Wizard, a great talking head, knows why they've come and demands they fulfill a mission first--fetch the Wicked Witch's broomstick from her mountaintop castle. With no choice, the quartet heads for Winkieland and their battle. Flying monkeys kidnap Dorothy and Toto; the others follow to rescue her. The Witch demands the slippers for Toto's life. She tries to remove them from Dorothy's feet and is nearly electrocuted. As an hourglass measures Dorothy's life expectancy in red, Toto escapes. He finds the others, who penetrate the castle and rescue Dorothy. They are recaptured. The Witch starts to execute them, setting fire to the Scarecrow. Dorothy throws a bucket of water on him, splashing the Witch, and she melts to nothing. The people there rejoice that they are free of her. Back at the Palace, Dorothy requests their reward. The Wizard balks. Then Toto pulls aside a drape about a booth, revealing a little man frantically working dials and levers--the Wizard. he admits, ""I'm a very nice person, but a very bad wizard."" He is able to point out to the three companions that they've already got what they were after; their rescue of Dorothy has proved that. He gives them symbolic gifts. Dorothy wants to go home. He offers to take her there in a balloon--that's how he got to Oz. Leaving the Scarecrow and the others in charge, he takes his balloon up. Toto jumps from the gondola, and Dorothy, running after him, is also left behind. But Glinda arrives and tells her the ruby slippers can help--all she ever had to do was want to go home more than anything. Dorothy follows her instructions and finds herself back at home, lying in bed with her Aunt and Uncle tending her and the farmhands looking on anxiously. She tells them about her dream and says, ""There's no place like home!; the film fades out on her radiant face. The Kansas portions of the film, were in sepia tone; Oz was always vivid technicolor.This film as fine special effects and vivid production values. Cinematography by Harold Rosson and the production design by Malcolm Brown contributed to its strength. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf along with author L. Frank Baum received major credit for the screenplay. The film was directed by Victor Fleming; King Vidor shot the sepia tone sections. Many contributed to the dialogue; Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg wrote together or separately most of the songs included. The art direction was by Cedric Gibbons, sets by Edwin B. Wilis, costumes by Adrian. Judy Garland had to play a twelve-year-old girl; camouflage was required. Jack Haley was not the first choice for the Woodman, nor several other principals for their roles. But the cast included Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch and Miss Gulch, Billie Burke as Glinda, and Frank Morgan as a host of characters including professor Marvel and the Wizard. Charles Grapewin and Clara Blandick were the Uncle and Aunt Em. And the feature was also enhanced by the presence of dozens of little people as Oz's denizens.",
353,8 December 2017,justinmethe,9, My favorite musical of all time.,What a classic! THE WIZARD OF OZ brings back so many memories of when my parents first showed me this beautiful movie and it was great to re-watch it again after a few years. A beautiful movie that starts off perfectly in black and white and then transforms to color as we enter the magical land of oz. The colors are so vibrant and the sounds and musically flow beautifully within this musical and are also extremely catchy as well. The comedic characters such as the scarecrow and Tin-man are hilarious as well. Watching such iconic films for the second or third time such as this one are always so much fun because you know you're going to be able to just sit down and watch a great film and can maybe try and catch those details that you maybe missed the last time you watched it. Those details that act as the foundation for these movies such as the intricate lighting and beautiful colors. This film will forever be one of the most iconic musicals of all time.,

But anyway I had the option of watching this film for a cinema history class I am taking and I realized I couldn't remember the last time I sat down and watched it, so I did. 
This movie still has everything. A beautiful soundtrack and score, great acting and singing. It's so well done and nearly everything this movie does still holds up pretty well today. Sure you can tell leaves are plastic, or where the backdrops begin, but the backdrops are beautiful! And the plants are laid out with great detail so as to seem like Dorothy and her friends are really in a poppy field, or a cornfield. This movie is so well rounded with its attention to detail. Every stage of their journey has a unique and identifiable look to it. The costumes are so fabulous and ornate. The Cowardly Lion has always been my favorite character and I love his outfit and his physicality in the role, leaping about on the rocks in the jungle and his wagging tail.

370,25 December 2006,bdl7431,10, A piece of Americana,"I have been reading many of the comments on this film - both positive and negative. I would like to add a perhaps different slant to this discussion - First, why did it come so popular? Think about the year of its release - 1939. The world had just gone through the Great Depression, the winds of World War II were starting to blow with Hitlter's invasions and the Japanese invasion of China. There were a number of excellent films released that year - Gone with the Wind for example - but why did this one hit a cord? It's fantasy theme, simple story, use of color and (for then) very good special effects (the TV set that was used for the Witch's crystal ball is an example - RCA would display one at the 1939 World's Fair to the wonderment of fair goers)are all reasons why this became so popular. Yes, some of Judy Garland's acting is not particularly inspired - she has basically one look, that of constant wide eyed wonderment and confusion - albeit appropriate for the film, although I cannot envision Shirley Temple, who was also being considered for lead, being able to pull off ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" with the same power.",

372,1 July 2006,mrs_james_marsters_1,10, A Musical Masterpiece,"The Wizard of Oz, directed by King Vidor and Victor Fleming, (of Gone with the Wind fame) is really what is referred to as one of the classics. It has earned that distinction by charming generation after generation, thanks to numerous re-releases and annual TV broadcasts. It's one of those movies that has transcended the medium of cinema. The songs are not only perfect, but they actually integrate well with the plot and tell the story that the characters are unable to put into words. Quotes such as ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."" and ""I'll get you my pretty... and your little dog too!"" became apart of pop culture and the breakaway hit ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" won an Oscar for best original song in the original music category. The special effects were really ahead of their time and the stark contrast between the black-and-white Kansas in the beginning, compared with the explosion of colors when Dorothy enters Oz really made this movie something special The warm, bright colors of Oz opposed to the cold darks of the wicked witch's castle provide a wonderful contrast for the eyes. I particularly found the cast in this movie quite compatible, with Judy Garland in the lead as Dorothy and with Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr playing the scarecrow and tin man. I find it hard to imagine what it would have been like with the original intended cast, including Shirley Temple as Dorothy. But 20th Century Fox would not loan its top star.

It is both a coming of age story about responsibility and being true to oneself and a whimsical adventure. Utilizing the use of Technicolor in contrast to black and white, we see Dorothy come into her own in the world of Oz, a place where trees are offended if you take their fruit, and anything can happen. In the end Dorothy learns that she always had the ability to get home, but had to learn and grow from her adventure to reach that point. When she returns home she is reunited with her family.

It's basically a feature length episode of ""Barney and Friends"", with better production values. Performances are extremely exaggerated, which is intentional, but they are also insufferably awful and nauseating. This is the most obnoxious band of protagonists I've seen in a long time. So much so that it makes the film impossible to enjoy. Some of the songs are good, but some are garbage. Don't even get me started on the castle sequence.

The scenery impressed me because of all the time and effort that must have gone into creating it.

As i got older, i started buying a copy for whatever format was hot at the time, VHS, Video CD, DVD, onto Bluray. Now as a fan of 3D, i love new releases being filmed in native 3D,but was never a fan of the idea of converting classics into 3D. When i heard The Wizard of Oz was being converted, i about fell over. How could they do this!!!? Well, it happened, and i resisted. That is until i saw the Bestbuy Metalpak. I purchased it solely for the 2D copy and the Metalpak. After a couple months of staring at that Metalpak sitting with all my other Steelbooks and Metalpaks, i decided i had to have a look for myself. So, i watched The Wizard of Oz in 3D, and was blown out of my mind. Even the best conversions out there have several instances of ghosting or other 3D anomalies. NOT THIS RELEASE! This 3D conversion is absolutely perfect. The depth is perfectly deep throughout, and there's no foolishly implemented gimmick shots of things protruding from the screen where they shouldn't be. Even the coloring, which tends to fade in 3D, was bright and popping.

And like many other ""classics"", this one just doesn't do the trick for me. Right, you have to watch these films(other example: THE SEARCHERS with John Wayne) with an open mind and from the point of view of years ago. I can accept that, as I can also accept the other style of acting and film-making. But what should really make such a film timeless? Right, the story. And this film just has one of the most ludicrous stories in movie history, even for a fantasy: not once have I even smiled(besides with the bits that were later used to parody in THE SIMPSONS, AFTER HOURS, NAKED GUN,etc.), not one moment was there a feeling of suspense(the characters were simply never in danger), not once did  you get involved in the story and, most of all, the story was filled with gaps. The film however has some beautiful scenery and though I'm not a big musical fan either, I found the songs rather enjoyable.

Dorothy's venture into the land of Oz focuses on the imperfections faced by humans in life, and shows how people are similar in this way and have the ability to unite and search for the answer to their imperfections together. The ""creatures"" Dorothy encounter throughout her journey are all diverse and interesting in their own way, yet they are relate-able in a sense that they all seek something in common. The land of Oz itself is also defined, as the viewer is shown the bright and positive settings and locale as well as the dark and malicious. I recommend this film to just about anyone.

The story is simple, Dorothy and her beloved dog Toto are transported to the brightly-colored world of Oz after a tornado hits Kansas. She wants to get home but must first follow the yellow brick road leading to Emerald City where only one person can help her--The Wizard of Oz. Along the way, she makes three best friends in the form of a talking Scarecrow, a heartless Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion. She also faces wits with the Wicked Witch of the West who is after those magical ruby slippers. Everything about this film is superlative. The cinematography is gorgeous. We start off in a black and white Kansas where the landscape looks dry and desolate. Then the film transitions to an eye candy Technicolor world called Oz. It also has ingeniously-written musical numbers performed by some of the greatest talents of yesteryear. Judy Garland leads a wonderful cast full of paramount performers. Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley are unforgettable as Dorothy's three sidekicks. Frank Morgan (in 5 roles) is terrific and Margaret Hamilton is wickedly fun as Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch of the West. Kudos to the director (or directors) for creating such an endearing film that brings jolly entertainment to people of all ages. This is by far, the greatest fantasy, musical, adventure, moral story of all time!",

We just seem to have always known what it was, how the songs go, and each and every character. Whenever we think of the musical genre for movies, some of us automatically think of ""The Wizard of Oz."" This has been one of my favorite movies since I can remember, and every time I watch it, it keeps getting better and better than the last time I watched it. Although the storyline, characters and costumes are all well developed and elaborate, the best parts of this movie was always the music and the effects. I was always blown away from the switch to old time sepia to full blown bright and bold colors. The music and sounds are the key point to the movie. Music is what keeps audience involved and wins hearts as well as the sound effects that drag the audience even deeper into the movie and creating a even stronger relationship with the movie.",

402,10 October 2005,PWNYCNY,10, It's Not a Children's Story,"An interesting treatment of the human unconscious can be found in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming and featuring Judy Garland, Margaret Hamilton, Billie Burke and Frank Morgan. A young adolescent girl, Dorothy, living with her aunt and uncle on a farm in Kansas, is threatened with the loss of her dog, Toto, who is not only her pet but her best friend, confidante and closest companion. Powerless to prevent Toto from being removed from the home (Toto had bitten Ms. Gulch, the town sour puss), Dorothy runs away from home, taking Toto with her. On the road she encounters a kindly traveling salesman who through clever trickery convinces the highly suggestible girl that she must return home at once. Now alarmed, Dorothy rushes back to her home but on the way a tornado is fast approaching the farm. When she finally arrives home, the family has taken refuge in the cellar and cannot hear Dorothy's frantic banging on the cellar door. Now terrified, Dorothy and Toto rush into the house which is shaking violently from the tornado which is now directly over the house. Dorothy is struck on the head by flying debris and is knocked unconscious. She awakes to find herself in a strange new land called Oz where she meets many interesting characters and experiences many adventures as she struggles to find her way back home. She is told by the good witch of the north that she has to follow the yellow brick road. While traveling on the yellow brick road Dorothy's fortitude is repeatedly tested as she fends herself, Toto and her friends against the wicked witch of the west, a violent and malevolent figure who blames Dorothy for the death of her sister, the wicked witch of the east, and has vowed revenge. Finally, after finding the Wizard of Oz, who is revealed to be a fraud, Dorothy is preparing to leave the land of Oz by floating back to Kansas in a balloon. But her plan goes awry when Toto jumps from the balloon and Dorothy follows leaving her stranded as the balloon floats away; at this point she awakes and is disoriented, adamantly insisting to her family and farm hands, who are standing around her, that her dream was real. Dorothy however has changed. At the start of the movie, she is behaving like a frightened little girl, whining and cranky, but after she awakes she has matured and is now aware of the power and strength that was buried deep inside her unconscious and which surfaced in the dream and is now part of her consciousness. Besides presenting a unique and provocative story, what makes this movie particularly effective as a work of art is the strong acting, especially that of Margaret Hamilton whose portrayal of the wicked witch of the west, with her loud, cackling laugh, ugly, distorted sneer, and greenish skin, is the epitome of evil. Far from being campy, this movie explores several psychological themes, including consciousness vs. unconsciousness, developmental issues, inter-familial dynamics, the nature of dreams, and behavioral issues, and highlights virtues such as courage, fortitude and loyalty, delves into the nature of conflict, the nature of terror, provides a credible portrayal of separation anxiety, and explores gender roles and death. Further, a particularly intriguing feature of this movie is that both the protagonist (Dorothy) and antagonist (the wicked witch of the west) are strong female figures locked in a life or death struggle in a hostile, unfamiliar environment. Indeed, the wicked witch of the west directly commands an army while Dorothy directly commands three male figures, including a lion and later the wizard of oz himself. The male characters are portrayed as being dependent, indecisive, vulnerable and subordinate to the females who dominate all facets of the story. And what makes this movie even more impressive is that it was produced not by mental health experts but by a Hollywood studio wanting to create a commercial product based on a book for children written by a journalist. The movie also features several songs that have become iconic fixtures in contemporary western culture and still attracts a large audience, seventy one years after its initial release. The Wizard of Oz may be the most-watched movie in history.",
403,2 November 2020,kristenwthomas,9, One of the most influential American films,"As it stands today, I think a lot of the praise for the Wizard of Oz is not as much a reflection on the film itself, but in its cultural significance. The story is pretty straightforward, the characters are fairly one-dimensional, but the film was also not meant to be highly layered or complicated. But the technical innovations in the film and the memorability of the characters are what has made it such a classic film. Dorothy is a great reflection on the optimism and hopefulness of children. The scarecrow, lion, and tinman emphasis the importance of thinking, courage, and love to younger audiences, and are also fun characters to watch. ""Over the Rainbow"" is of course such an emotional and beautiful song. Some of Garland's later renditions of it are even more heartbreaking, as her life was extremely tragic, including the treatment she underwent during the production of ""The Wizard of Oz"".",
404,16 November 2020,c-hendron,9, The Wizard of Oz (1939),"There's a reason this film has stood the test of time. The film itself is simple and lighthearted, with characters that are reminiscent of innocence and what we value in ourselves and others. The technological advances that were used in the creation of this movie were groundbreaking at the time, and they show it off with the beautiful cinematography and bright, vibrant colors. The musical numbers flow perfectly into the story and never feel out of place, and all of them are catchy to boot! ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" will always be one of my favorite songs of all time, and Judy Garland's rendition in this film is still so wonderful to watch. You can clearly see the impact that this film has had on the film industry in the decades following its release. The acting performances were great all around, making these whimsical characters feel relatable and realistic to the viewer. Overall, you can't go wrong with The Wizard of Oz. It's a great watch for any and everybody.",

We know the bad people are bad because they are gray (or green)and black colored. The songs are boring. The lessons are commonplace; similar to what you could read in a fortune cookie. The biggest rip-off of all was that Glinda just toyed with Dortothy all along. She could've left Oz anytime. ripoff. Has Dorothy learned anything from this? There's no place like home. yay.

The songs in this film are just as iconic as the lines, and that's really saying something for this film. ""Theres no place like home"" likely is known by nearly every single American just as ""Over The Rainbow"" is known country wide, no matter the age of the viewer.

410,29 November 2018,junshiwilda,5," 👎Charming, but not aged that well.","Many critics and audience label The Wizard of Oz as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history. It is in the top 250 in IMDb, has a 100% critic rating in meta critic, and in rotten tomatoes it is considered the best movie ever made. I do agree that this is a classic and it is a ""masterpiece"", but it seems to me that this movie has not aged that well. Watching this now I feel like the special effects are really unrealistic and the acting is not horrible, but mediocre. Many critics and audiences talk about the ""magic"" this film has, but I sadly was not able to understand what the ""magic"" of this film is. To be honest I felt like watching a play being caught in video rather than watching an actual movie, and it doesn't have anything that uniquely distinguishes it from the original story by Frank Baum. I am not saying by any means that this movie is a cinematic failure or anything, and it might have had the ""magic"" back in 1939. But watching it now, it feels so outdated, and like I said too mediocre. I would watch it for instance if I was bored and they were showing this film on Disney channel or something, but it is just not worth saving some time to watch it.",

I think the most impressive parts about this film is the detail in the settings and backgrounds of each cut. Everything from the witches castle, which is actually a real castle and is currently for sale for 3.4 million dollars, to the land of oz with the yellow brick road and the munchkins.

I used to watch it every now and then when I was young, and I knew the words to quite a few of the songs. I hadn't seen it in a while, but, I still knew what I liked about it. When I was little, I used to be absolutely horrified of the Wicked Witch, and the Tin Man was my absolute favorite character. Since then, I am no longer afraid of the Wicked Witch at all; if anything, I just sort of hate her, because she's mean. I think that it is just a good movie through and through. It's very charming and colorful, has a good deal of humor, and you can sort of get sucked in to the story easily. Of course, they changed it a bit from the book, which only a few years ago, I didn't know about, but I much prefer the movie to the book.

The scenery and the costumes really put it above and beyond. The acting is terrific, as well. The film used three-strip technicolor. The detail is was amazing. Judy Garland played a wonderful Dorothy. The flying monkeys still cause me to look away. If you play it side-by-side with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"", it's twice as good. The shooting and cinematography is great. The splicing of black and white with colored shots is nice. For example, Dorothy sees her Aunt Em on the Wicked Witch of the West's crystal ball; she is then replaced by a vision of the Witch. Aunt Em appears only in black-and-white, while the Witch appears in the crystal ball in full color. It's a cool effect. It's also a good movie. I recommend it.",

In the beginning when Dorothy is on still on the farm Zeke and Hunk make references that I didn't pick up on the first time I watched it. One of the things that Zeke said was, ""Have a little courage"" which is funny since he is the Cowardly lion. Some more irony that comes in this scene is when Hunk says, ""Your head ain't made of straw"", this is also amusing because Hunk is the scarecrow. All of the characters in the beginning of the film before Dorothy has her dream are in her dream. For example Miss Gulch is a mean old lady that is trying to have Toto be put down. Dorothy says to her, ""You wicked ol witch"". Miss Gulch is the Wicked Witch in Dorothy's dream.

453,27 June 2020,jayjaycee,7," Bewitching, yet flawed","""The Wizard Of Oz"" is a 1939 fantasy musical directed by Victor Fleming starring Judy Garland and Frank Morgan. The latest target of my adventure of reading pieces of classic literature was one I have always had a connection to, even though I have never in fact given the original novel a read. More thanks to this famous adaptation, the classic story of a young girl who desires to go back home after being stuck in a fantasy land, is still relevant and the modern pop culture can't be imagined without it. Not only has it created one of the most iconic songs of all time, it also had a major influence on the everyday language use and on countless films, not only adaptations. While the original novel is not as present in the heads of our modern society as it was back then, this filmization and several others that followed are responsible that the myth is still alive today and popular for children that were born more than one hundred years after its initial release. What stroke my eye the most while reading it was that it, indeed, was primarily targeted at children, especially younger ones (despite having some utterly gruesome undertones). In direct comparison to the works I have read previously, this one is conceptualised in a simple way that entitles even the smallest ones to comprehend it fully. If it was a music genre, it would be easy listening, for it doesn't only consist of a plain pattern and story, but also doesn't do much about complex descriptions of the plot it wants to depict. In the matter of authorial technique, it is far away from being a masterstroke, but what it wants to stand for is what makes up for it and made it an enjoyable novel. While it shares the same feeling of oddity with Lewis Carroll's masterpiece ""Alice In Wonderland"", the story by L. Frank Baum simply lacks the complexity that the other one has had, what has drawn a lot of criticism to him. Yes, it isn't quite as multifaceted as some others, but still I got to say that this comparatively simple story was still enchanting by all means. That's why I was totally curious about this legendary adaptation that the majority of people claim to be an absolutely masterpiece. It always states a problem to watch titles that are considered as such, as it might happen that I really don't share this opinion, and with this film, it happens to be the case again. Before you begin to verbally lapidate me, let me say that I wasn't displeased with everything that this film had to offer. First of all, I was pleased to recognize the basic story of Baum's novel and that the basic outlines of it were used, despite some changes. At times it was shortened, at times it was heavily altered, but all in all, it was acceptable, as they at least managed to depict the characters and their traits correctly. Aside from the pleasant fact that the screenwriters have made some positive changes as well, and fleshed out Dorothy's life on the farm in Kansas by, for example, adding real life counterparts to the creatures that will later on be her companions and friends in Oz, the leading performance of Judy Garland is by far the main reason why this film is all but terrible. As if she had jumped directly out of the pages, she embodies everything that made the little Dorothy what she is in the book. She is lovely, sweet, innocent and absolutely the way she is described as in the source material. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale and Dorothy Gale is Judy Garland, that is not only something you just say, it's an undeniable fact (what sadly was a curse for her later career, though). Furthermore, her singing voice makes her portrayal even more superb. Wait a minute, did I say singing voice? Well, I in fact did. This is how we come to the biggest issue I have with this adaptation. While I am aware that there are also musicals of that same story, I thought it was rather irritating to see that they included this approach in this version as well. Sure, they wanted to produce a direct opponent to Walt Disney's ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"", but the music in this film doesn't even closely touch the spirit of Disney's animated feature. Except for Garland's legendary representation of ""Over The Rainbow"" quite in the beginning of the film, all other songs were either pointless or embarrassing. I personally love musicals, but in this case, the musical aspects feel utterly out of place. The weird song the Munchkin people sing isn't only too boring, but also too long and after that the songs are performed in the same manner. Also, they became quite repetitive and that was rather annoying than entertaining. There is also a similar problem with the performances of the side characters, mostly the lion, the scarecrow and the tin man. What they did in here could be best described as classic overacting, and that still would be an understatement. I am aware that a little overacting is crucial aspect about musicals, but even in this standard it is just too much, and it became trying and annoying and distracted from the story immensely. The time they spent on elaborating exaggerated characters and singing meaningless songs could have been effectively invested in fleshing out the plot and adapting more of the charming scenes of the original book (there were plenty missing!). Despite the quite long runtime of roughly a hundred minutes (in the context that it is a film for children), there is barely anything exciting happening that stuck with me afterwards. After the admittedly formulaic and repetitive introduction, the four friends embark on mythical journey that has enough obstacles and enemies prepared. At least that was the case in the novel, where much more things stood in their way than they do here. Even if the Wicked witch of the East appears more frequently here and poses some kind of a threat, the story simply loses its grip along the way and didn't do enough to humour me. The most I can recall about this film is the unnecessary singsong and not really any bit of the plot. Of course, I remember how the witch was easily defeated, how the dog Toto was the real MVP in this story and how they eventually received what they were promised, but sadly, that was all. No, in terms of narration this film didn't really score for me, but of course I wouldn't let this review end without a classic happy ending. By far the most outstanding aspect about this film that deserves most recognition is how it is designed. Considering that this film is now eighty-one years old (!), the overall style is simply jaw-dropping. That it was filmed in Technicolor makes it the classic that it is to this day. While the sequences in Kansas are brownish and bland in terms of the colouring, the world of Oz is literally wonderful and indescribably multi-coloured and beautiful to look at. The fact that it made productions that came long after this look like complete fools already says everything about how breath-taking it is. All in all, this movie is a bewitching adaptation that despite some creative discrepancies and infamously extreme difficulties on set manages to still be watchable and enjoyable. Aside from the fact that they shouldn't have made it a musical in the first place, all other actors except for leading lady Judy Garland are awkwardly overacting, and also the narration should have orientated itself more on the source material instead of desperately attempting to be a direct opponent to Disney. Therefore, the cinematography and overall design stand out in this case, from the faithful costumes of the odd settings, they managed to make it look exactly as it was described in the novel. It truly was way ahead of its time in this matter. Furthermore, the moral of the story, that friendship is the most important thing in the world and that there is no place like home, were also perfectly conveyed here and easily understandable for children. It is delightfully crafted and despite some major flaws worth to be called a decent adaptation. Legendary, yet not perfect. Before I forget: Am I the only one who thought that it was just touching to know that the day Judy Garland died, a tornado rampaged in Kansas? Life imitates art, as if it was destiny.",

With a perfect treatment of colour and a delicious music, the movie is a superb chant to fantasy and has influenced lots of films than has come after (for example ""Mary Poppins"", does anyone can avoid the likeness being inside the picture and arriving to Muchkinland?). The film is sometimes quite childish (well it is a film for kids), but it is never sweety, it arrives to a perfect level of cuteness than cannot be but congratulated.

The Wizard of Oz is one of those films. In fact, it is likely the prime example, being possibly the most famous movie ever made: ""Somewhere over the rainbow"", ""We're not in Kansas anymore!"", the Wicked Witch of the West, munchkins, ""Come out, come out, wherever you are!"", ""Ding dong, the witch is dead!"", the yellow brick road, ""We're off to see the wizard"", ""There's no place like home"" - it's all so iconic, all the way up to the ""it was all a dream"" ending, which remains perfect (""And you were there!""). And yet, the consciously grand reveal of the vivid colours of Oz is *still* simply magical. Crazy to think that Victor Fleming directed this and ""Gone with the Wind"", two of Hollywood's most celebrated classics, in the *same year*. Judy Garland here gives one of the great child performances in screen history (she was 16). Notwithstanding some banal musical numbers and annoying ""comedy"", this holds up as well as any film from 1939. As discussed above, I won't bore you with evaluating Oz as a charlatan and symbol of capitalist greed, giving the heroes hollow recognitions of attributes they already possess; or explaining the obvious farmer/industrialist/politician allegory, or how the return to sepia suggests a bittersweet ending, because you've heard it all before and, honestly, who cares. The idea is to instill a little childlike wonder in the viewer, and remind us that there's no place like home - that, it does. So yeah, it's good, but you know that already since you've seen it.

THAT was the only cool thing in it. And that only probably 'cause you wanna slap her yourself for being such a precocious non starter",

It was filmed in Technicolor, and had the ballad Somewhere over the rainbow. There was a dog Toto in the Film too. The Film is a classic now and very well beloved. Hollywood actress Judy Garland played Dorothy Gale in the expensive project.Judy Garland received her star on the Hollywood Boulevard.",

Engaging plot, brilliant scenery and costumes, lots of good humor, terrific acting, music, and one of the most iconic villains of all time. Most importantly of all, it has some great lessons to be learned. It's hands down my favorite movie of all time. Don't miss this one!",

490,22 March 2009,charlytully,10, Ambrose Bierce Will Find the Devil in the Details,"While this is my favorite movie of all time primarily because I saw it on TV every year growing up (and could scare my little sister by humming the Witch's Theme any time it was cloudy outside), Ambrose will be seeing it for the first time with adult vision (as he was 97 years old when it premiered), so he will like OZ for reasons different from my initial reactions. L. Frank Baum's original OZ title was the last book Bierce read aloud to his grandchildren, prior to his ill-fated tie-in with Pancho Villa. I presume Baum's fantasy (primarily an anti-gold standard screed) will be fresh in Bierce's mind when he's fully thawed out. The author of THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY will no doubt agree with me that this is a case where the movie is actually BETTER than the book (along the lines of Peter O'Toole's LORD JIM or William Hurt's recent TUCK EVERLASTING, which barely topped its outstanding youth novel). What he'll notice his first time through OZ (which did not dawn on me until college) is all the dark undertones of Emerald City. Even if unaware of Judy Garland's off-set torture by her foster dad Louie Mayer and his henchmen, Ambrose will be perceptive enough to see how the innocent children's tale is totally sexualized by shoe-horning a young woman with a duct-taped bosom into a role (Dorothy Gale) more appropriate for Shirley Temple. This subliminal perversity is what makes OZ the quintessential American film experience for any age--particularly Bierce's robust 207. He'll also get a special kick out of MGM's crass substitution of in-heat ruby red slippers for Baum's original silver footwear (which no doubt caused L.Frank to turn over in his grave, seeing as how this totally castrated his main purpose for writing OZ in the first place!).",

494,10 February 2014,wolfmoon2,10, Wizard of Oz is a remake?,"I was very disappointed to find out that the original Wizard of Oz was filmed in 1925. Thereby revealing this film was not only a remake, but the story line had been altered. Uncle Henry was supposed to be a bad guy. Dorothy was supposed to be a princess, and originally from Oz. After watching the original, it takes away from the 1939 remake. Has anyone ever seen the all black-and-white 1939 version? I remember watching this movie as a teenager. I spent time trying to track down the munchkin that supposedly hung himself on set, and other urban legends. The worst part was the movie being released on DVD, for those that wanted to believe the legends were true. It revealed that not only were these legends false, but brought out other flaws in the film. I would like to see the original film receive at least some credit.",
495,8 June 2022,EdwardtheBlackPrince,7, Follow the yellow brick road,"The Wizard of Oz is often considered by many ones of the most famous movies in film history. Based on the children's book ""The wonderful wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum. It tells the simple story of a young girl named Dorothy( Judy Garland) who when a tornado come through on her family farm in Kansas wake's alone with her dog Toto in the world of Oz a strange and colorful world where she soon finds herself on a journey to meet the Wizard of OZ who can help here get back home. Along the way encounters an assortment of friends from the scarecrow, The Tin man, and The Cowardly Lion. All while dealing with an evil Wicked Witch. A very simple plot yet despite that thing this it still makes for a very appealing family film The cast is a very colorful Buch. Judy Garland for her time was a very beautiful and innocent-looking actress. In many ways, it shows through Dorothy's character as a whole. She's not satisfied with her life at home and dreams of a place of her own choice. In many ways similar to Alice from Alice in Wonderland She witnesses these things, but pretty much accepting of what's going on pretty quick. The rest of the cast like a scarecrow who is so energetic and optimistic they all give good performances. The Wicked Witch what's there to be said about her? Isn't much to describe the original depiction of a Witch the big nose, point hat, and flying broomstick. The cackling it's an iconic character who is just evil for the sake of being evil and that is okay. The music is good though some of the songs can be rather selective. While I've never really cared for the Munchkins. I found them more annoying than lovable and fun. Over the Rainbow and off to see the Wizard are classics. The film also has a legacy for its visuals. Being one of the first feature-length films to use technicolor It does bring a lot of the scenery to life. When you go from the sepia tone to Dorothy opening the door for the first time. It's like when you see Willy Wonka's candy room for the first time. You do feel like you entered a different world. Along with the background Mat-paintings. The Shot of the emerald city alone is a piece of art. Even the costumes for Scarecrow, tin, and Lion are pretty good for 1939. So yeah it simple film by today's standards, but the Whimsicality charm, and artistic tone for the time is still a classic for all ages.",
496,27 September 2005,momama,10, Classic!!,"Can you remember the first time Dorothy opened the door to Oz and it was in COLOR??? It still makes me excited!! This movie has all the hokey standard Hollywood gimmicks--home is the best place of all, good girl vs evil ""witch""--but you still find yourself rooting for Dorothy every time, and waiting patiently for them to get the witch. It never grows old for me!! Even with all the pre-production problems this movie underwent, it is a visually stunning movie (the afore mentioned change to color being the highlight). Judy Garland is perfect as the young naive girl who thinks she can find happiness ""over the rainbow"", and the rest of the cast is sublime, especially Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch--and yes, she still can give me goose bumps!! Might be a little scary for really young kids, but it's sooooo much fun!!",

Munchkintown was a riot of color that left a lasting impression, Billie Burke, as Glinda, Good Witch of the North, was the incarnation of grace and beauty - and was there ever a more hideous Wicked Witch than Margaret Hamilton? - She scared the Hell out of me and gave me nightmares for days afterwards - talk about a tribute to an actress's performance. It's hard to believe that Ray Bolger as a second choice for the Scarecrow - the Studio originally wanted Jack Haley, who, ironically, became the TinMan! The wonderful Frank Morgan, whose kind nature brought such sweetness to his portrayal of the Wizard was a second choice - the studios wanted W.C. Fields, whose sour nature would, I believe, have left a bitter, aftertaste in the role of Professor Marvel which I believe Frank Morgan fulfilled far more capably. A glorious production.",

What viewers don't see today is that Toto wondered off into Miss Gulch's garden and was chased out by MIss Gulch with a broom. She threatens to take the dog or at least report Dorothy and Toto to the Sheriff, which she eventually does. DOrothy runs from Miss Gulch toward the farm and when she reaches the entrance road to the farm, the new broadcast version picks up the story.

In a way one of the most famous movies of all time has really made the world blind to the true magic that Oz has to offer. How many people do you now who have read the books? Not very many right? The books are just fantastic (most of the time). But for some reason whenever someone tries to adapt closer to the books (AKA 1985 Return to Oz) people are to harsh to it. Leonard Malton and Siskel and Ebert hated that movie because it wasn't the 1939 version. Granted over time people have realized the magic behind the books and Return to Oz (Seriouly I'm like the only one who likes that movie was better the then this one) and I'm sure the years to come people will grow attached as well. So just a recap, I like this movie always have and always will. But at the same time I think it's a little on the overrated side. If you haven't read the book or seen Return to Oz I strongly suggest you do so, it's time to know the truth.",

The score is memorable, the sets of the film are full of life, and overall the movie has very much like a fairytale or storybook feel to it. The lighting and color seemed a bit washed out and overdone at times; I think it's because the film was never advertised to be in color so they wanted their audiences to experience the wow-factor of a lifetime. Despite any dull moments or scenes that today would make you cringe or skip past it, overall this is a movie that will always age in a positive manner for years to come.

This movie ""captured my imagination"" when I was a kid, and to see it now, after over twenty years was to rediscover it. Honestly, it was like seeing an old friend. However, I got even more out of seeing it now than I did as a child. Aside from the awe-inspiring land of Oz, the brilliant use of Technicolor to suggest another ""world,"" and the tender performance of Judy Garland, this film contains little bits of Wiz-dom that make it that much more enjoyable years later. Warm performances from Frank Morgan, as Professor Marvel/The Wizard of Oz (among other roles in the picture), Ray Bolger, as Hunk/The Scarecrow, Bert Lahr, as Zeke/The Cowardly Lion, and Jack Haley, as Hickory/The Tin Man, all add to the sincerity of the film. Margaret Hamilton is great as the heartless Ms. Gulch and the sinister Wicked Witch of the West. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially anyone with children.

533,26 April 2009,hemang-patel,8, Wizard of Oz,"The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a fantasy musical film from MGM during its golden years. The actors that play the Oz roles are Ray Bolger (Scarecrow), Jack Haley (Tin Man), Bert Lahr (Cowardly Lion), Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch of the west), Frank Morgan (Emerald City Doorman/Cabbie/The Wizard's Guard/The Wizard of Oz), and Judy Garland (Dorothy Gale). Also all these actors and actresses (except Dorothy Gale) play a double role in Kansas and Oz. The Kansas roles are Ray Bolger (Hunk), Jack Haley (Hickory), Bert Lahr (Zeke), Margaret Hamilton (Miss Almira Gulch), and Frank Morgan (Professor Marvel). During the opening of the movie there is a message saying, ""For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put it kindly philosophy out of fashion. To those of you who have been faithful to it in return...and to the Young in Heart...we dedicate this picture."" This makes the movie sounds like it's a fantasy for children or more or less for little girls. As the film progresses Dorothy comes in the farm to complain about Almira and how she is being mean to Toto the dog. Later Almira comes to take her dog with a sheriff warrant. As she rides the bike back to town with the dog in the back in the basket, the dog escapes and runs back to Dorothy. As soon as the dog comes back Dorothy realizes that Almira is going to come back and she decides to run away. As she is traveling she runs into professor Marvel, whom she asks if she can travel with him. But later the professor decides that he doesn't want her to come with him some he makes up lies about Dorothy aunt getting sick. As Dorothy rushes back to her aunt's farm there is a tornado by the farm. Locking the animals away the farm residents decide to go underground. When Dorothy arrives the tornado is close to the farm and the trees are flying off the ground as Dorothy runs to the house. This scene doesn't make sense because on average a tree weights more than a human being. Dorothy hides in the house and the window hits her; resulting she gets knocked unconscious on the bed. When she wakes up she realizes she is inside the tornado and she sees Almira riding her bike laughing and Almira turns into the wicked witch. While the tornado stops she realizes she is in some fantasy land (Oz). Dorothy is accused of being the savior of the munchkin people because she fell with her house on the wicked witch of the East that controlled them (munchkin people). The mayor of the munchkins calls it the day of independence because the death of the witch. Later Dorothy goes on a journey wearing the ruby slippers that the wicked witch of the west wants. While on her journey to meet the wizard that can take back to Kansas she meets a scarecrow (that is not scary), a tin man (who needs oil), and a tiger (who is a coward). While they are on the journey the wicked witch of the west plots a plan to put the crew to sleep. It works but only the scarecrow and tin man are not placed under the spell. They start yelling help and the good witch of the north makes it snow and wakes them up. They reach the city and all the residents are wearing green as they freshen up the wicked witch of the west come and scare the residents by spelling surrender Dorothy, leaving everyone in panic. Dorothy realizes that there is no wizard of oz and she breaks down and starts crying; as she is telling her story about her aunt getting sick the emerald city door man hears her and takes her to the wizard. When they see him they are petrified of the great fire and the floating head of the wizard. The wizard decides to grant them their wish only if they bring the broomstick of the witch of the west. Dorothy and the three go and search for the witch in the haunted forest and Dorothy and her dog get kidnapped by flying monkeys. Toto escapes to look for the other three and takes them to rescue Dorothy. Dorothy kills the witch with water, which is one of the worst endings one can think of. The crew gets the broom back and goes back to the wizard of oz and Dorothy discovers that he is a fake. Wizard leaves Dorothy and the good witch of the north arrives and tells her the truth that she can go back whenever she pleases. Then Dorothy awakens with her aunt and friends there and she tells them her story of fantasy. This picture is a little bit childish but it can be easily the movie of the 1940's, because of the color tone added to the black and white picture as soon as Dorothy goes into her fantasy state. The cuts and scenes of this movie are in a proper sequence except for the fact when she is in the tornado and the house falls there needs to be more details. When the house falls the scene doesn't show the witch getting hit and the impact of the house falling. The wizard of Oz is a movie that is remembered and cherish by many younger generations. The lesson learned from this movie is that running away is never good.",

Dorothy is played by Judy Garland she is a young girl on a farm in Kansas surrounded by her family. Until a tornado comes and knocks her in to a deep dream that know one ever imagined before. She wakes up to a fantasy world surrounded by good witches and bad witches. These witches are people she know's in real life but her imagination takes control of the whole world. She is along side her uncles played as the lion, the scarecrow and the tin man. Of course you know what path she takes to get out of the fantasy world, the famous yellow brick rode. She has to get to the wizard of Oz but comes across conflict between the wicked witch of the west. How will she overcome this obstacle, i guess theirs only one way to find out. I highly recommend showing this movie to a group of young kids.",

Judy has a sweet, powerful, golden voice which can echo in the dark and become so unforgettable, and Judy was so ahead of her time during her career.  I think it's wonderful that her daughter, Liza Minnelli, who I also adore, carries on her mother's legacy.

539,15 September 1999,Tommy-92,9, Succeeds becuase it's got a timeless lesson that we can all relate to,"Every person in America (and most people all over the world) that is over the age of 5, but usually younger, has seen The Wizard of Oz.  Just about all of them have undoubtedly seen it more than once, either on video or on its yearly TV broadcast.  Why is it so popular and such a part of our culture?  My guess would be that it hasn't gotten old one bit, even though it was made 60(!) years ago, and there is a reason for that.  No matter how old you are, no matter what generation you're part of, you can relate to Dorothy (wonderfully played by Judy Garland) as she yearns to break free and find something somewhere else, but when she finds that something, discovers it's not so great because it doesn't have the familiar comforts of home. Home is what matters, or to quote it for the umpteenth time, there's no place like home.  Everyone feels that way, so we can all relate to her because we all know what it feels like.  Yes, it's got marvelous splashes of color, gorgeous scenery and costumes, great acting and wonderful, classic musical numbers, and that's also a large part of its appeal.  But, whether we want to admit it or not, when you narrow it down, the main reason it was seen by so many people in theaters, by even more people on TV, and now by thousands of kids on video, (And some adults, too.  Admit it!) is because it's timeless and has a lesson that is not dated and has never lost its value.  Say you love it cause Judy's got pretty shoes, or because you've watched it every year and it's just a tradition, but when you look deeper, that's the real reason.",

If you can, see it in a big theatre (revival houses seem to run it during the holidays around Thanksgiving to X-mas) because the technicolor is truly amazing on the full size screen.  A DVD copy on a big tv will also yield things you may not have seen before, like the wacky flowers growing out of the munchkins' shoes, which I'd never previously noticed.

The best part of the movie in my mind is that there are several different characters with their own very different personalities. Another great part of the movie is how advanced the special effects were. The scene where Dorothy gets caught in the twister and she sees things fly by her window seems pretty advanced for 1939. This movie is great because of how it appeals not just to children, but adults too. One of greatest things about the film is how the mise en scene is incorporated into it by director Victor Fleming. Mise en scene is a wide array of elements seen on camera. These different elements in the Wizard of Oz include the set and how it is arranged, the characters and their different dynamics and the props used by those characters. As I have stated in my title I think this movie is amazing and it has had one of the greatest impacts on films we see today. In the film The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming, Fleming understands the importance of mise en scene and utilizes his set, characters, and props to lift the mise en scene to a different dimension which, in turn, has enabled his film to become one of the true classics and most renowned movies of all time.",

Judy Garland does a fantastic job as well as her three companions but, Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West is second to none. I believe she was even burnt a few times. Without Hamilton's brilliant portrayal of such an evil character, the movie is just not the same. The munchkins are nice and Dorothy's ruby red slippers are sparkling but, when the witch comes around everyone runs and hides. Until they realize that all they needed was a bucket of water lol.

If I were to write a story with parallels this movie would be a great example to look at. Part of the parallel writing included having the main characters show up in Kansas and Oz and the non main characters only showing up in Kansas or Oz. The workers on Dorothy's aunt and uncles' farm in Kansas were also in Oz. The worker that told Dorothy to have a brain was the scarecrow, the worker who told Dorothy to have a heart was the tin man, and the worker who told Dorothy to have courage was the lion.

The movie, in terms of cast, score, production is exciting, entertaining and thrilling. The movie is sure to get glowing reviews for decades to come. However, there is a difference between a review which states the obvious about cast and production, and one which goes a bit further. Despite its grandness, my overall complaint about the movie is a problem not specific to this film itself, it is the industry problem of not staying true to the book for any number of reasons, particularly sensitive issues. Sadly, the more movies one reviews which have their beginnings in literature, the more visible the altering of story lines becomes visible and troubling, as do the motives for such alteration. The Hollywood credo seems to be that Issues of politics, social condition, religion and race must be handled ""delicately.""
 
After decades of study, what we now know about ""The Wizard of Oz"" is that it is not a simple fairy tale for children. That the book was banned in libraries across the country, and religious leader called on movie house to ban screenings, should give you enough pause. The story itself is a social and political commentary on America and the rise of populism, the challenge to the US monetary gold system, the struggle of farmers and factory workers and so on.

THen as you are transported into this technicolor world, surrounded by short people and talking objects and creatures, you imagine a world that is perfect (except for the wicked witch of course) After seeing the movie, you are captivated by the imaginative world that has been created inside your mind.

There are the occasional scary scenes of intense suspense and music that may frighten someone under three, but even these pass and are only part of what the screen presents you.  The casting is perfect, the set design still amazes me.  Dedicated and simple renditions of great ideas will trump the highest technological achievements if that technology serves a flat story or a poor imagination.  The Wizard of Oz certainly qualifies as one of the more imaginative movies of all time, and the skill the players and the technical aspects only further its quality.

Dorothy's life in Kansas is limiting, spending her whole childhood listening to her parents. In her most intimate moment she sings ""Over the Rainbow"", a slow track that was almost cut out of the film, and later went on to win Best Original Song at the Academy Awards. It took me many watches throughout my life to realize the characters of the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion appear in the first portion of the movie as some farmers. When Dorothy first escapes, she meets odd Professor Marvel who is played by Frank Morgan; Morgan later plays many characters in the land of Oz, including the Wizard himself. I do remember Miss Gulch, the bitter old woman attempting to have Dorothy's dog taken away from her, being the Wicked Witch of the West. This is made explicitly clear when Dorothy's house is swirling through the tornado and the old lady is seen flying in her bike, which turns into a broom as she is dressed in a stereotypical witch outfit. So it's a small cast, really. At least until the Munchkins appear, after Dorothy opens the door of her house to Munchkinland.",

So if you want a good version of Wizard of Oz watch one of the cartoons most particularly one of the anime versions since they seem to go by the book. The other thing that is wrong with this movie is how Dorothy's character was butchered in the book Dorothy is this spunky resourceful little girl who doesn't need rescuing but Judy Garland plays her like this helpless damsel in distress and that's not who Dorothy is .

Watching the film today, it's safe to say that these things are just as terrifying as they were 15 years ago. But more importantly, in terms of entertainment, the movie definitely still holds up. It's one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. The costumes, set designs, and vivid on-screen colors are a piece of art on their own. Add the elements of musical numbers, action-filled scenes, and many unique, dynamic characters, and you have something pretty remarkable. The fact that it was made in 1941 astounds me. Recently, I have been watching many movies from this time period, but this one always stands out above the others One scene that backs this up comes towards the beginning of the movie, as Dorothy leaves the sepia-toned world she knows and enters the dynamic, colorful world of Oz. I recently learned that no color editing was done throughout this scene. Rather, they painted her house sepia-colored and even painted a double this way. Then, as she exits through the doorway of her house, the double steps out of the shot, and Judy Garland steps in, wearing her baby blue dress and sparkling red slippers. So much thought went into those few seconds of the scene, but, because it was so well thought-out, it became something masterful. I think a lot of people would say that this specific scene is etched into their memory. Even if you can't enjoy the story, it is easy to appreciate the production for what it is.",

This film set the bar too high to be touched. It was the largest production of it's and any other time.

I absolutely love how the film went from no color in Kansas to having color in the Land of Oz; I thought that was very clever. Judy Garland was fantastic as Dorothy; I think she portrayed her perfectly and her singing voice was amazing.

605,12 August 2010,Lucifershal0,3, Wasn't that magical to me.....,OK the reason I gave this film 3/10 is because its not as good as the original books. Personally I like Return to Oz a lot better than this film. I can't stand musicals personally and this is full of musicals. I have an 8 month old daughter and when she gets older I am going to introduce her to Return to Oz instead of this film. I think she would relate and like the 2nd one a lot better than this. Honestly if it was not for the musicals this movie would get an 8 or 9 easily! The actors/actresses are great in this film which make it the classic it is. I do enjoy the story of the film and the characters but it just isn't up to par with the sequel in terms of fantasy. The 2nd one is so much darker than this which makes it much different in terms of what I like to watch. If you have not seen this movie you have to watch it but go rent or buy both films. I am sure your kids would like Return to Oz better than this one.,

Nevertheless, I was surprised by how well I responded to it when I watched it on the big screen some 15 years or so after I thought I had outgrown it. The energy and wonder of the film still hold up and I was reminded of so many movies I have seen in the last twenty years that borrowed things from this movie.

Following the tornado she ends up in a peculiar land, this new land is in color since it is a position of tangibility, where her issues can be carried on an excellent scale and be managed. The story attempts to tell the message that our lives are sure to contain frightening and challenging experiences, but by making companions with the best parts of yourself and refusing to give the obstacles a chance to shield you from seeing what's great in life and what's great in other individuals, there will dependably be encouraging points throughout everyday life.",

The movie was made really well and the color was very advanced for it's time. the significance of this movie is how people want things they already have, but dont even know it. in example, the lion wanted courage, but he helped fight the wicked witch. they all wanted things that they already had. overall, I really liked the movie and it's a classic that everyone should watch.",
644,10 April 2019,ldawg-60150,8, My shoddy explanation of the meaning of this movie,"Throughout the movie, there are two ""in your face"" meanings of the story as a whole. During the film, you see the ""brainless"" scarecrow who feels he's very dumb, the ""courage-less"" lion who feels he lacks courage and the ""heartless"" tin man. But through their journey, you see the scarecrow, lion and and tin man display all their respective qualities that they feel they lack. At the end of the movie, during their encounter with the Wizard of Oz, he tells them that everything they had thought they lacked, they already had. This hammers home the two not-so-subtle meanings of the movie; Don't judge a book by it's cover and don't let anyone get you down and tell you what you can and can't do/are and aren't.",

And think about that! 6 out of the 100 narrowed down from over 50,000 thousand films ever made!!! I'm so happy. I hope they re-release the film in 1939 to celebrate the 100th anniversary!

The Wizard of OZ is the epitome of knowing your craft and performing well. Now you'll be lucking if you can watch a movie where the people can act let alone act, sing and dance. Judy Garland and this awesome cast perfected the term triple threat. Now everything is so technologically advanced you don't need to be good at your craft, everything is synthesized or lip-sync'd. It's also a movie that lasts for generations, even with all the special effects we have now, the sets and customs are still amazing to look at.",

The only reason I didn't rate this 1 star is the fact that I am aware that it was filmed in the, like, 1930s so I guess there were different standards back then.

657,30 January 1999,jeanie-6,9, Incredible Writing!,"This ambitious musical works on every level, despite the fact that it detours quite a bit from the original book from L. Frank Baum. The story, as everyone already knows, centers around young Dorothy (age indistinct in the film) and her search for ""home."" During her wild adventure, she survives being carried by a tornado and dumped into a surrealistic place called Munchkinland. Here she meets both the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Glinda, already knowing how Dorothy can return to Kansas, sends her on an arduous journey down the Yellow Brick Road, where she meets the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion. Throughout the film, each character clearly shows that he or she already possesses what they covet most, but the realization does not come until the end of the film.",
658,2 April 2004,cironick,7," A long review of The Wizard of Oz for my Film As Historical Literature Class, covering the story and it's symbolism.(SPOILERS INSIDE!)","The Wizard of Oz is a film best described as a metaphorical dream. It presents issues on two levels: those of a young girl, Dorothy Gale, a poor farm girl from Kansas who faces losing her dog to a nasty old woman, and those of a grander scale, like government evils and inefficiencies, and farming in arid Kansas. Under the guise of a children's book/movie, the story of The Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum is thought to be an allegory of the economic state of the Midwestern US and the Populist movement, of which Baum seemed to be a supporter, during the time that it was written. While the movie shows this, it was also changed to show more general ideals to reach a broader audience. Let us first look at the beginning of the film, and the characters. Starting on a dusty, windswept, desaturated Kansas farm, which seems to represent Dorothy's bland orphan life and presents the challenge that Dorothy is trapped in Boringsville unless she does something about it, the movie shows us the young, honest, pure, All-American girl Dorothy. Miss Gulch, a miserable crab of a woman, high up on the town's governmental ladder, is threatening canicide. Toto, Dorothy's dog and the only thing that brings joy to her otherwise black and white life, bit Miss Gulch, and now the old shrew is threatening Dorothy to take Toto away and have him killed. As Miss Gulch leaves with Toto, Toto escapes and finds his way back to Dorothy. The two then try to run away, but their plans are halted by a tornado. The next thing you know, Dorothy and Toto have just landed in Munchkin Land. Her house has landed on, and killed, The Wicked Witch of the East. The munchkins rejoice and Dorothy is rewarded with the witch's ruby slippers (which some believe represents ""the 'inner spark' within all of us""), then sent on her way down the Yellow Brick Road to see the Wizard of Oz about getting back to Kansas. The Yellow Brick Road and the Ruby Slippers, which in the book are silver, are said to represent the gold and silver standards (monetary systems used during the 19th into the 20th centuries in which the paper bank notes were backed up by either gold or silver.). The main themes of the movie revolve around the idea of a better tomorrow, and there being ""no place like home,"" and this Yellow Brick Road may also pose as a sort of ""shining road to a better tomorrow/home."" As the film progresses and Dorothy and Toto make their way down the Yellow Brick Road, they meet and befriend several characters. First to come along is the wise yet uneducated Scarecrow, representing the hard working hay-brained Kansas farmer who, despite his own view of himself, is smart, but lacks the education to prove it. Then comes the rust-frozen Tin Man, symbolic of the industry worker-compassionate, strong and sturdy but lacking a physical heart. Finally we meet the Cowardly Lion, king of the jungle, but afraid of everything. William Jennings Bryan, the thrice-defeated democratic presidential nominee who had many Populist views, such as bimetallism (having both gold and silver standards), is thought to be the model for the Lion. He was known as a great orator, but as they say, ""his bark was greater than his bite,"" and Bryan had little power. Upon a more general view, the Lion may stand to represent the nobility of those who give up solely thinking about themselves and fight in defense of others and fight for what they know is right. The five go to Emerald City to ask the wizard for help, but they are sent away at first. Later the Wizard tries to intimidate them as they ask for their wishes to be granted. These scenes resemble the relationship between the higher government and citizens/lower government. The five are sent away at first because they could not possibly be important enough to speak to the Wizard of Oz, and when they finally do get to see Oz they come face to face with a giant, threatening, floating green head barking sternly at them. They only later discover, thanks to Toto, that Oz is just an insecure old man, with no real physical power, much like how government officials want us to think they are omnipotent deities. In one of the final scenes, the Witch is destroyed simply by being splashed with water. This is symbolic of the washing away of evil, but also, according to some sources, the Witch represents the dry Kansas soil. Her dousing can be seen as the taming of Kansas farmland. This point of view fits more with the book than the movie.",

I saw it as a ten year old or even younger, on a big screen theater. Spoiler. I was disappointed that the Wizard of Oz was a humbug. I think I had great hopes of watching a wizard doing marvelous things. Spoiler He does not help Dorothy. And he occupies the Title above the marquee. Watching Angela Lansbury on the 70 Anniversary Bluray, it was not surprise to me that she said that the film showed losings. Maybe not many kids could stand the above facts. Angela Lansbury also states that 85 million Americans go in 1939 to the movies every week, and that it was the 65 percent of the whole population, but this was not a favorite.

and the Lion (power) in search of their manifestation and reclamation. And just as we have projected our safety into the Wizards outside of ourselves, like government and religion, they can only help by pointing to the fact that is we have always had the power to go home in the slippers of experience we wear and it is only by an act of compassion, Dorothy trying to put out the fire on the scarecrow and melting the witch instead, do we overcome

It's not going to have ground-breaking special effects (by today's standards), or amazing computer generated sets/landscapes, or superb make-up/creatures. It is a simple film with a beautiful moral and, honestly, what more do you need? Judy Garland shines as Dorothy, coming through as very natural and honest. You believe her, and you believe in her quest. And her voice... it is so filled with emotion! There is a reason why this film has remained so prominent in our culture. It obviously did something right. If not, its songs wouldn't be murmured on the lips the lips of young children to this day. We wouldn't be seeing Oz merchandise in Targets and Wal-Marts all across the US. It wouldn't have a set air-date on huge television networks every year for going on fifty years.
