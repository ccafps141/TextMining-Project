1,1 July 2009,planktonrules,9, Very well made--tough to watch.,"Warning--This movie is NOT for young kids or those who do not wish to see violence and adult content, as it's rather brutal and the language is pretty rough. Now I am not complaining about this, but this is clearly an adult film intended for adults. It's hard to really do this sort of film without making it this intense--just be forewarned. In addition, this is a very tense and unpleasant sort of film--be aware of this before watching.",r
2,14 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10, 'Born To Kill' - The best Vietnam war movie of all time,"SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. ",e
3,16 September 2013,AaronCapenBanner,7, R. Lee Ermey.,"R. Lee Ermey dominates this Stanley Kubrick directed Vietnam War drama, as he plays profane, no-nonsense, ultra tough Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who belittles, browbeats, and insults the marine recruits in brutal boot camp training. Vincent D'Onofrio plays a slow-witted recruit who gets it the worst from Hartman, until he finds out that he is quite good at shooting... Mathew Modine plays ""Joker"", since he has an overt sense of humor that also captures the attention of Hartman, whose relentless, unmerciful verbal attacks take their toll in ways he didn't imagine... Film then picks up later, as Joker is a war correspondent for Stars & Stripes, who witnesses first hand the insanity of Vietnam...",v

5,10 December 1998,Peach-2,10, Kubrick is genius.,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master.",e
6,22 December 2006,brujay-1,8, The movies finally got Parris Island right,"Though I've read only a couple of dozen of the nearly 500 comments on this film, I didn't see any from ex-Marines who'd had the Parris Island experience. I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the '68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s. ",w

8,18 July 2006,ReelCheese,8, Fascinating Despite Come-Down,"The first half of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is so intensely entertaining that director Stanley Kubrick can be forgiven for the slight come-down that follows. The opening scenes draw us into the strict world of ""maggots"" training to join the ranks of real men, otherwise known as Marines. We see the characters humiliated, yelled at like children, beaten and, in one tragic case, broken down. It's an unpleasant yet fascinating place to visit from the comfort and safety of our living room couches. Yet once the action shifts to the Vietnam War, when you would expect even better, something is lost. The characters seem less real and the atmosphere less intriguing. Overall, however, there aren't many faults to find with this effort, but be forewarned that it's certainly not for younger viewers.",r
9,28 April 2002,Agent10,10, Kubrick's version of Vietnam,"Stanley Kubrick always managed to bring something new to his palate whenever he made a film. He brought dark comedy to the screen with Dr. Stranglove, an epic story with Spartacus, and a film more important for its efforts than box office potential in the film Paths of Glory. This is what makes Full Metal Jacket so entertaining.",w
10,4 October 2009,wes-connors,7, That Giant Sucking Sound,"The unifying theme of Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is that Vietnam put American in the toilet; each of the film's three parts, or ""Acts"", has characters in what is repeatedly described as ""a world of s--t."" The men are successful trained to kill - but, they do not know when to kill, who to kill, or why anyone should die. Narrator protagonist Matthew Modine (as James ""Joker"" Davis) not only wears a ""Peace"" button on his uniform, but also has written ""Born To Kill"" on his helmet (to illustrate the duality of man). The reason for the war is explained, ""We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out."" ",0
11,28 June 2017,alanbenfieldjr,9, Full Metal Jacket 30 years later,"Strange, as I sat to watch Full Metal Jacket for the first time in years, what I remembered most was Lee Emery's Sgt Hartman's rantings and Vincent D'Onofrio. In fact, it was Vincent D'Onofrio's Pvt Lawrence, known as ""Gomer Pyle"" that made this Stanley Kubrick film, truly memorable. I'm noticing this more and more as I get older and revisit old films. The performances, certain performances, even in supporting roles allow a film to keep growing with the passing of time. Full Metal Jacket a shattering film or I should say, two shattering films. The first part, the training, the intro is a masterpiece practically impossible to match up, so, the second part doesn't match it. But, still. A film-experience. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance even more powerful now, 30 years later. Enormous! The British skies over Vietnam is another reminder than an artist's eye knows no boundaries.",9

14,3 August 2013,Marc_Israel_365,6, From boys to men to boys,"Events of dehumanization as learned scene by scene as coldly dictated by director Stanley Kubrick. Our Marines are always rallying around something white trying to hold onto their own values, themselves and, overall, their sanity. Much like ""The Deer Hunter"", this anti-war film is broken down into two parts, one prior to war, and then into the beast itself. While one movie shone an extra light on those stateside, Full Metal Jacket stayed with our boys and to what was left of themselves; their boyhood instincts (to defend each other) and their Mickey Mouse marches which drove the point home. This cold film doesn't bring you into each character as others might, but war is not about one person, is it? It is full of dogma (first to go, last to know), direction (our marines got lost) and dehumanization (see the first hour alone to hear the non-stop rant of Gunnery Seargent Hartman (Lee Ermey). Brutal and darkly funny, this is what I held onto as our narrator, Joker (Mathew Modine) is simply trying to fend off the brainwash, while it bounced off of Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) whose story tells us all Kubrick needed to say. That is why the second half of the film in Viet Nam seemed only to serve the audience a follow up and adventure as to what happened to some of our original boot camp marines. I still found the film both detached and personal, as if I was trying to fend off the disgracing of my viewers' soul. I like this film due to that internal struggle of whether or not to view war as acceptable.",6
15,13 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Superb, one of Kubrick's best","I like Stanley Kubrick, and I love his films, especially 2001, Barry Lyndon, Paths of Glory, Dr Strangelove and this, his penultimate film. Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding. Kubrick's direction as always is superb, as is the acting especially Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. All in all, one of Kubrick's best and one of the best war movies you will see. 10/10 Bethany Cox",5
16,1 March 2022,FKDZ,7, FMJ,Arguably the first half of this movie is what this movie is remembered by. It's a incredible piece of acting and writing. It fully engages you and doesn't really let you go. Though it does at a moment become predictable where it will end. But being the bare witness to the demoralization and dehumanization of humans to turn them into killing machines is somewhat unmatched.,6
17,3 January 2006,WriterDave,9," In a World of S**T, they are not Afraid....","Kubrick's films are generally more accessible and mainstream than he is often given credit for. As gritty and unflinching as his take on the Vietnam War is, this is for my money his most mainstream work. Kubrick gives us a ""grunts-eye-view"" of military training and combat in a war that was particularly unpopular and well documented. This was the first war to be fully televised on TV, and Kubrick pokes fun at the soldier's awareness of this, and of the dubious nature of the propaganda put out by the military's own front-line reporting. Here we get a world-wind tour speckled with dark humor (but never too much politics, a similar stance that benefited the recent ""Jarhead,"" which owes a world of debt to this film), excellent use of pop music (who thought Kubrick could go all Scorcese on us), and brutal sequences of hard-edged violence.",/
18,30 November 2004,guy-bellinger,9," Still modern today, all too modern.","One of the greatest war movies ever, a statement very few will dispute. I will therefore not illustrate this point : thousands have done it before me, often brilliantly.I'd rather lay the stress on Kubrick's modernity in ""Full Metal Jacket"". Indeed the USA being once again at war, it is interesting to compare the way they wage war these days with the way they did back in the sixties. And the comparison is edifying. Just apply the following statements to Iraq and you will realize NOTHING HAS CHANGED : - the marines are trained to become killing machines without being taught minimum knowledge about the people they come to defend. - the boys know nothing about the Vietnamese and reason according to American standards : for instance ""Cow-Boy"" complains half-jokingly half-seriously that there are no horses in Vietnam. Another example is the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse Club hymn after fighting, which strikes as particularly out of place. - they try in vain to impose democracy through gruesome violence and destruction. Such similarities abound and testify to the film's absolute - and unfortunate - modernity. I wish Kubrick was still with us. I also wish George Bush and his advisers had seen this masterpiece and - most of all - understood its message. They would have avoided another bloody war doomed to fail.",?
19,1 March 2022,thomasgouldsbrough,8," ""The dead know only one thing - it is better to be alive""","Full Metal Jacket is an excellent war film. All the characters are very well written, and represent very common characters in the military. There's always a class clown, a hardened individual that's respected, and someone who just isn't capable. The acting of Vincent D'Onofrio in this is exceptional, he only has a short amount of screen time, but his story is very sad and impactful. The second half of the film starts to become less enjoyable, but nevertheless it's still a good film.",r
20,22 August 2003,auberus,8, `The dead know only one thing: it's better to be alive',Mr. Stanley Kubrick was not a prolific director. After 71 years walking this Earth he left us with only 16 movies among which some of the most powerful cinematic experience to date. `Full Metal Jacket' is part of Mr. Kubrick's list of masterpiece and was released 12 years before his last movie `Eyes Wide Shut' as War always precedes Denial.,e

23,29 March 2022,jamesrupert2014,8, Brutal anti-war film flirting with satire,"Marine recruits are followed as they endure basic-training at the hands of an abrasive drill instructor and are then deployed to Vietnam in 1968. This was Stanley Kubrick's almost over-the-top contribution to the trend in 'Nam-based anti-war films in the late 1970s and 1980s and may be best known for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman's (Ronald Lee Ermey) eloquently imaginative foul diatribes as he torments the neo-jarheads, especially pudgy incompetent Pte. Leonard (Vincent D'Onofrio ), or 'Pyle' as he is immediately christened. The war scenes are quite good, especially the lengthy set piece about the VC sniper in the ruined factory and, as expected from the auteur, the cinematography and direction is excellent. Many of the characters seemed to be almost caricatures, with minimal 'back story' and 'new names' (their boot camp nicknames remain with them), and although this was likely part of the 'message', I found some of the marines, notably 'Animal Mother' (Adam Baldwin) bordered on parody (as did Pyle's demented grimacing when he finally cracks under the consent abuse at the hands of the sadistic Gunny). Good but not quite at the level of 'The Deer Hunter' (1978) or 'Apocalypse Now' (1979). The 'Mickey Mouse Club' closing scene is memorable.",=
24,10 June 2006,StayPuft003,8, Two Parts,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a film of two parts. The first part deals with the basic training of the Marine Corps being built to become killers. R. Lee Ermey gives one of the best performances i've seen as the intense drill instructor. For most of the first part, his speeches and training tactics are very funny, but soon you realize that he does not care about these men's lives and only wishes for them to be killing machines. We realize this when he asks the trainees about some famous snipers, like Lee Harvey Oswald, who was trained to shoot in the Marines and how he respects that man for getting in so many shots in such a short amount of time and hitting his moving target twice. He truly honors Oswald. He dehumanizes them, especially a fat private by the name of Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). Pyle makes a few mistakes, and soon we see that the Sergeant is out to get him and seems to want the rest of the trainees to dislike him. And this Sergeant knows how to hold a grudge. There are a few spectacular scenes, and the first ten minutes are the best opening minutes to a movie I have ever seen. I was into every second of the basic training scenes, from the opening montage to the disturbing but brilliant last scene, the final confrontation between a few main characters.",t
25,11 March 2006,shannonphoenix,10, A Movie that you will always wonder about,"""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of the legends of any service person in basic training. As a young recruit in the Army, we talked about it, and we talked about it further and it is one of those movies that you always find something new to say about. The beginning, the young men come to be trained as ""killers."" And it is at this point where you may realize later that not everyone is meant to be in the military, example, Leonard (Pyle.) He is a nice kid with probably a good sense of humor, probably liked among for his sense of humor and would have done better in college, but instead is in the Marine Corp where he does not fit in well. Then you have Hartman (excellent portrayal by Gunny Ermy) who has the heartless job of making killers out of these young men. It is here that you question if he is truly mean spirited or is doing what he knows he has to do by being as hard as he can so that these young men will survive the horrors of war. This is a point that I think is sometimes missed. Joker, a rather smart young man, attempts to take Leonard under his wing and the two become friends until Leonard messes up and is given a ""blanket party"" by the rest of the platoon. Hartman is the reason for this, but behind this hides another reason; he has to make them tough and solid so that they will work as a team and have each other's backs in combat. He knows this to be true, but no one else does. This sends Leonard into a psychotic break and for a while, Hartman begins to show interest in Leonard due to his progress. Joker, noticing the change in Leonard, does not bring this to anyone's attention and thus begins his journey through his own private war because he believes from his inaction, he may have been the cause for the aftermath of the confrontation of Leonard and Hartman and the eventual fate of Leonard.",t
26,9 July 2001,zetes,10, This film's divergent halves confuse too many people,"People just refuse to use their brains. They love the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and then basically give up on the second half. It is depressing. Don't you think you should at least try to understand why the film is split up like that? In fact, despite what so many people think, Full Metal Jacket is a perfectly structured opus - one of the most original pieces of art ever created. I am not going to get into it, but I will just say that it is YOUR JOB AS A VIEWER to figure out the connection between the two halves. 10/10.",_
27,14 March 2006,barnabyrudge,7," Foul-mouthed, gruelling snapshot of Vietnam.... intentionally unpretty and bleak (which is, ironically, both its strength and its weakness).","Stanley Kubrick made surprisingly few movies considering that he was credited as a genius film-maker. For example, he allowed seven years to elapse between The Shining and this Vietnam War film. Well-made as it is, Full Metal Jacket is not without certain flaws and is by no means top-drawer Kubrick. However, it is punctuated with incredible moments in spite of its shortcomings, including a gruelling opening-act which details marine training at Parris Island and ends with a hair-raising showdown between a grunt and a gunnery sergeant. Also, the film's bloody climax, with its inconclusive clash between the American forces and an enemy sniper, is simultaneously tense, frightening, ironic and meaningless.",u
28,8 July 2021,nickenchuggets,9, Marines are not allowed to die without permission,"On the surface, Full Metal Jacket doesn't really resemble a movie Kubrick would make. In my view, he'll always be remembered for directing some of the most intelligent and grandiose films ever constructed, such as 2001 and Barry Lyndon. This movie dumbs down its writing quite a bit, but I'm pretty sure this was done on purpose so the movie could appeal to more people. A common complaint with Space Odyssey is that it's too difficult to understand, and to be honest I don't think anyone truly understands it. FMJ is fairly straightforward, and even though the dialogue is not as ""intelligent"" or classy as other Kubrick movies, it's still smartly written (if that makes any sense). The movie follows America's interest in the volatile situation rapidly playing out in southeast asia, which eventually leads to american soldiers being deployed there in larger and larger numbers. Before this occurs, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is busy introducing a batch of new marine recruits to the hell that is going to be basic training. He berates the men, screaming into their faces and telling them ""they're the lowest forms of life on earth,"" but this is only because he wants to see them succeed. One recruit, Private Lawrence, is singled out by Hartman and mocked relentlessly for being overweight, and as Hartman says ""so ugly you can be a modern art masterpiece."" Lawrence is later given the unflattering nickname ""Gomer Pyle"" by the sergeant after he proves time and time again that he is incapable of following simple instructions. Later, Lawrence is paired up with Private Davis (nicknamed Joker by Hartman after he catches him doing a John Wayne voice during training), and a donut is found in Lawrence's locker. Hartman goes on a rant and says how he has tried very hard to help Lawrence, but he has failed. So from this point on whenever Lawrence makes a mistake, he will punish the entire platoon instead of him. Meanwhile, the other future marines tease Lawrence, which leads to him somehow getting much better at aiming with his rifle. Some time later, the men graduate and are officially marines, but Lawrence appears more and more mentally unstable. Joker finds him in the bathroom area, cleaning his rifle and shouting at the top of his lungs. Hartman wakes up, demands Lawrence hand over the gun, and Lawrence kills him. He then sits on one of the toilets and turns the gun on himself. The second portion of the movie focuses on the actual war on vietnam, in which Joker is now a correspondent. Unfortunately, by the time he gets there, it's 1968 and the Tet Offensive has just begun. NVA forces attack the base Joker is stationed at, but are beat back. Later, Joker and some other men are sent to Hue city, where some of the most violent fighting of the war would take place. Some of the men with Joker are killed by a Viet Cong sniper, who is later discovered to be a young girl. Joker executes her after she was shot previously. The girl is dead, but she wasn't the only casualty. The other was the civilized version of Joker. FMJ is probably the most well known movie about the vietnam war other than Apocalypse Now, and it's a strange combination of humor and a disturbing display of psychological illness. When I first saw the scene that involved Hartman getting shot, I thought that was at the end, but no. Lawrence's death is only the beginning. The casting in this movie is excellent, with my two favorite characters being Hartman and Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin). Ermey's performance as Hartman is nothing short of hilarious, and he's portrayed as a reckless, foul-mouthed drill instructor who screams, curses at, and sometimes even physically hits his recruits in order to straighten them out. Ermey was also a marine in real life which definitely helped his acting. Animal Mother on the other hand is a bloodthristy madman who Joker later encounters during the battle of Hue. He doesn't really have much going for his personality other than his M60 machine gun he carries everywhere, but he's the epitome of a tough guy. Like I said earlier, this movie is typically ignored in favor of Kubrick's more stylish and elegant movies, since this one contains tons of cursing, violence, racism, and other things that are really out of character for him. Regardless of its lack of similarity to his other movies, Kubrick definitely showed how competently he could put together a movie about the vietnam war with Full Metal Jacket.",r
29,30 November 2013,rch427,3, Immensely overrated,"""FMJ""'s reputation, combined with Kubrick's name, elevate the film far above its actual merits. Here are my specific criticisms: ",v
30,1 September 2002,Theo Robertson,7, A Film Of Two Halves,"FULL METAL JACKET has one of the most bizarre structures in film history. The first half of FMJ is rightly regarded as being one of the great segments of cinema . Kubrick/Herr/Hasford`s razor sharp script takes us on a blackly comical tour of the horrors of basic training with Sergeant Hartman , private Joker and Leonard Lawrence being the central characters , but then the film cuts to the battlefields of `Nam with only a couple of characters like Joker and Cowboy linking the two segments . Also disappearing is much of the first half`s wit with only the irony of American firepower bringing down tower blocks in retaliation to a sniper being the only real clever and knowing aspect to the script . It`s confusing too because with the exception of Joker and co. the rest of the film doesn`t really tie in with the basic training segment , perhaps the film would have worked a lot better if the entire film was taken up with the basic training ? And I can`t help noticing that much of the terrain doesn`t really resemble the jungles of South East Asia , as everyone knows FMJ was filmed in and around London and it often shows. Still it`s a film worth watching if only for the basic training scenes which are certainly more convincing than those seen in HEARTBREAK RIDGE . A couple of questions though ...",
31,9 April 2021,andreascaloni,8, VERY GOOD WAR MOVIE,"Full Metal Jacket is well directed and boasts of a talented cast. The film has great moments but isn't always intriguing. After the awesome beginning, the middle part of the movie is slow and not gripping, the exciting moments return only near and at the end. Kubrick seems to want to tell us a story to show how the war affected the characters. He made it.",
32,3 June 2006,extravaluejotter,9, Born to Kill?,"During the first part of this movie, set in a USMC training camp for the ""phony tough and crazy brave"", Gunnery Sergeant Hartman cites Lee Harvey Oswald as an exemplary US Marine marksman. The scene perfectly illustrates the total reversal of moral standards in modern warfare.",
33,14 July 2015,bkoganbing,9, The making of marines,"Thirty years after Stanley Kubrick did Paths Of Glory about the futility of World War I Kubrick did Full Metal Jacket about the American experience in Vietnam. The wars were incredibly different and the French were fighting on their own soil, still the frustration of war and the stupidity of the high command make these films markedly similar.",
34,31 January 2013,classicsoncall,9," ""It's your hard heart that kills.""","Kubrick's scathing anti-war message begins immediately with a harrowing twenty minute indoctrination into Marine boot camp training that leaves little to the imagination. The acclaimed director hammers the viewer with the relentless battering of young recruit Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant (R. Lee Ermey), and effectively captures the dehumanizing aspect of preparing killers for the defense of their country. However I'm not convinced that Matthew Modine was the best choice to demonstrate the duality that Kubrick was going for with his 'Born to Kill' helmet juxtaposed with that peace button on his lapel. He wasn't a colorful enough character and didn't demonstrate a set of core values that one could relate to, as his own anti-war sentiment seemed to surface only when the picture shifted to 'in country' as Viet vets used to call it. In fact, none of the soldiers here are particularly memorable, not in the way Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Defoe are remembered for their portrayals in ""Platoon"". The picture is at it's wicked best during the early boot camp sequence, but loses some focus during the battle at Hue City. The identity of the sniper was a clever twist, and I think this is where Kubrick most effectively demonstrated the duality he was going for, by showing us that it wasn't Joker's hard heart that made him pull the trigger, but his compassion for another human being. He then brings the absurdity of all war home by having the soldiers return to base camp while singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme song. The post-Viet Nam decade brought forth a significant number of critically acclaimed films, and it's tough to choose a 'best' when you have such offerings as ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" in the mix, all of which have strong statements to make about the inherent inhumanity of all war.",
35,14 March 2019,rachelgallit,8, Wry and Horrific,"I had no context doing into this film, and boy was I surprised. Pleasantly so, I will admit, but surprised and shocked nonetheless. This grim and gory film about a young Marine Journalist and his training, combines dry humor a complete disregard for any sort of decency in regards to graphic violence or language. Joker suffers through personal and large scale atrocities of war, and witnesses madness and clinical sanity alike. The inhumanity on the part of the American troops is showcased both in the treatment of the Marine trainees and of the Vietnam enemy, which Joker responds to with humor, in an effort to remain sane and in control. Stanley Kubrick uses an immersive camera style, where often the shot follows continuous action, so that the audience feels almost present in the scene, and as if one was following along behind the characters. The shots are most often wide angle, and meant to show the uniformity of the troops, and how they are crushed to be interchangeable in training.",
36,10 August 2020,briancham1994,6, Two films in one,"This film is essentially two films in one. The first half I would rate 8/10. It is a great and brutal portrayal of the way that the army grinds down human beings. One recruit cannot keep up and tries to take matters into his own hands. The second half I would rate 4/10. Despite being a war film, it is quite slow and boring and this was a total let down. I kept thinking of the first half and wished that was the entire film. I would rate it 6/10 overall.",
37,18 October 2005,supah79,7, Like all Kubrick films it requires multiple viewings,I always thought of Kubrick as the poet amongst the proza's in Hollywood. Kubrick always tries to tell a bigger picture than he's putting on the screen. But it requires the viewer to see beyond the images. I had to see this film a second time to fully grasp what Kubrick was trying to show me.,
38,10 August 2006,DeathFish,9, Amazing Kubrick does it again,"This is another Kubrick masterpiece that has pleased people all over the world. This time it is a different kind of a war based movie, and I have to say that it is one of the best if not the best war movie of all time. Many people write that the second half of the movie is bad, or even horrible. I agree that the first part of the movie is the best part, because it shows a completely new side of the lives of marines. No other movie has ever showed that base camp training episode as well as Kubrick does it. It is very psychological and painful to watch these men braking down and then rise as cold-blooded killers. No one shows that as well as ""Gomer Pyle"". As many others I think that the drill Sergeant gives this movie an extra spark with his comical lines and hard personality, he actually makes you laugh, and even so you really get to hate him. The second half is the actual battle in Vietnam. This is where the movie is more similar to other war movies, but yet it is unique. Kubrick is all over the place throughout the entire movie, the camera and sound effects along with the music keeps reminding us that this really is a Kubrick film. The second half is without doubt also amazing, because of the uncensored madness it makes you sick with sorrow and hate. The sniper scene is of course one of the strongest and most terrifying scenes of the second half. Also the interviewing part is a very good idea I think, Kubrick finds yet another way of showing the different mind states of these men. That makes the characters even more real and makes you even more sympathetic for them and their destinies. In every way a breathtaking movie from start to finish. Kubick uses all the methods of making a good war movie, and then some. Besides that the movie is filled with intelligent and poetic lines, beautiful details and symbols, and some of my all time favorite movie quotes. This movie leaves a stain and it will always be high on my personal list of movies. Watch it, enjoy it, watch it again and love it. 10/10",
39,19 April 2006,Hitchcoc,9, Why Was He There?,"This is such an uncomfortable movie to watch. I understand what the Marines do. There is one lead fighting machine and they are it. I like to think that what is done is a lot more humane. I believe that one can be toughened without being dehumanized. The character of Pyle is singled out. It seems that if one wanted to terrorize a group of recruits, you don't just focus on the one weak link. This guy should have been shipped out. He was never going to make it. Some guys achieve strength through suffering. He continued to submit to the horrors of boot camp despite the over the top attacks on him. If I wanted to show a definition of sadism, I would use this movie. Now, I agree with a previous writer that in wartime, the carelessness of one man could cost the lives of others, and the sergeant was making a point. But was Pyle becoming a better soldier? Did he ever becomes a better soldier, or was his spirit broken almost from the beginning? There has to be something to be said for the endurance of this man and how long he lasts, even if he fails. The ending did not surprise me. I anticipated it.",

Not really against him or anything, but I have actually seen very few films by him. In fact, other than this one, the only other film of his I have seen is ""The Shining"" so of these two my experiences have been mostly positive. This film starts out great in my opinion with a well organized basic training section. You get to meet new recruits as they get their head shaved, then you get to see what a Marine has to go through to be a Marine and suffice to say there is no way I could do what they do. Not only do you have a crazed Sergent constantly yelling at you and demoralizing you, I just could not handle the sleeping quarters and all that comes with basic training as I have social anxiety problems so I most likely would try to get away or off myself. I would not do what the one guy does here though. The second half of the film is a bit weaker and not as strong plot wise as the first part. This may have been done on purpose as to depict the Vietnam war as disorganized and chaotic and if that is the case it is done well. Just not enough plot structure for my tastes in this section of the film, still good, it just can not quite rise to the level of the first portion of the film.

""Full Metal Jacket"" shows how Marine life is not child's play, and the Drill Seargant from Hell(R. Lee Ermey, aka ""The Gunny"") really performed well in this movie. It is set in Parris Island, S.C., were the main Corp was locate to whip these civilians into shape. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman(Ermey) is one heck of a bad-a$$ Drill Sgt. who takes no crap from anyone. He didn't discriminate anyone, he treated everyone like an equal. However, he tortured Pvt. Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio) so bad, he went over the edge after the training. He marched with his pants down, sucked on his thumb like a little boy, and had to endure a very brutal beating from the other Privates. Socking a drill Sergeant will call for a discharge or time in confinement, shooting him will result in court martial, and a dishonorable discharge. Of course, Pyle discharged himself with the same gun. The other went on and the brutal battle is ensured. The Marines don't play around, and they really show the sign of brotherhood of the Corp. The chants the Gunny made was a classic. ""This is my rifle, this is my gun..."" is the one song I think should be shared to only the military. It's always lock and load.

53,4 November 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6, Pyle. Pyle! PYLE!,"""Full Metal Jacket"" is an American live action film from 1987, so this one has its 30th anniversary this year. It runs for minimally under 2 hours and it is of course one of the most known works by legendary director Stanley Kubrick and the fact that this one is in the IMDb Top250 certainly works in his favor here. It is also the film that brought him his final Oscar nomination as he was part of the team that adapted the novel this is based on. Anyway, there is a pretty clean structure in here. The first 50 minutes or so are about the training for the armed forces and we see a handful of recruits, most of them relatively young still, and how they want to become American soldiers. Problem is they have a really tough gunnery sergeant in charge of them. The latter is played by R. Lee Ermey and this film brought him the biggest success of his career, a Golden Globe nomination and that's quite something, even if he came short at the Oscars. I guess he won't be too mad about it. The second half then is in fact scenes from the battlefield. And as I am not too much of a film of (anti-)war movies in general, these did not do as much for me as the psychological thriller (you probably can call it that) in the hour before that. This does not necessarily have a lot to do with it being bad or anything, on the contrary there are some good scenes there like the one with the prostitute, but with my personal preference because I find stuff like Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan equally underwhelming. I liked this one here probably even more because of the insight into group dynamics and relationships between the characters, even if this area also was one of my biggest problems. Sure it isn't an actors movie and that's fine, but most of the characters and actors seem so interchangeable here sadly.",
54,9 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Full Metal Jacket is not just about war, but rather the psychology behind it.","A smart move from the legend that was Stanley Kubrick. We've all seen many war films, a genre that is well explored from a variety of different conflicts. Full Metal Jacket however chooses to go behind the scenes and focus on the training process that changes well intentioned men into trained lethal killers. You could easily split this in half and have two separate films, the first half being more psychologically charged whereas the latter showcasing the brutality of warfare. A ridiculously serious drill sergeant practically bullying a trainee marine so harshly that it slowly turns him into an unstable psychopath. That right there, was some really good psychology and made the film so much more interesting. Sure the Vietnam War scenes were depicted with a substantial amount of fire, blood and guns but it was the first half that really captivated me. Vincent D'Onofrio was the stand out for me, both convincing and expressive through his face. Matthew Modine was good, probably his best performance. Lee Ermey deserves recognition just for somehow managing to not lose his voice from all the shouting. Characterisation was present, perhaps not fully fleshed out as I would like but was just enough for me to care about them. Yet again though, it's the technical marvel that wins...Stanley Kubrick. His directing style is so damn flawless. The nice clean long takes, actors looking directly into the camera, slow motion deaths (particularly in the sniper shootout)...he is just phenomenal. Script was sharp as well. A great section of dialogue where our lead character wears a peace badge and a helmet that says ""born to kill"" for which he describes represents the duality of man. That really stuck with me. So whilst it might feel like two separate films (due to that ridiculously quick transition), it's hard not to appreciate everything that's shown to us. Another hit from Mr. Kubrick.",

Private Pyle is definitely one of the most disturbing character ever written in the history of cinema. Other characters as disturbing as him are Antonio Ricci of 'Bicycle thief', Devdas Mukerjee etc. Beginning is mindblowing. All the characters are defined in the first scene itself. Joker and Pyle stand out as wrong people in the wrong place. Later Joker gets a promotion for his straightforwardness in the first scene. Its interesting because may be thats how officers are identified amongst 'pukes'. Pyle comes across as regular jovial 'fatbody'. What marines make of him is I think the whole concept of the film.

56,6 August 2021,mcjensen-05924,2, 8.3 Is Simply Nuts,"Kubrik has assembled the worst cast and put to film the most laughable/unrealistic movie about any was in the history of war movies. The boot camp scenes at the beginning, while overdone to the extreme, were riveting and worthwhile watching. Especially for Vincent D.'s performance. He seems to be the only character given any consideration about character development. He was superb, and should have been around for the duration of the movie. At least he finally got that sergeant to stop yelling. But in retrospect I'm sure he's glad he wasn't associated with the ""in country"" part of this disasterpiece. The negative reviews are right on the money, but there's really no way to prepare the viewer for just how simple minded it really is. The sets were quite ridiculous and unconvincing, and the acting is some of the worst you will ever see bar none. I don't like movies where the director is so obviously manipulating the viewer into how to feel, and that's all this was. War bad. Well everyone can agree on that so why not just make a realistic movie? The soldiers were given the most idiotic, cliched heroic lines that fell flat repeatedly. I laughed at the big final battle scene it was so awful. It must be nice to blatantly and repeatedly defy direct orders from a superior officer. Apparently nobody got the memo that Cease Fire means Stop Shooting. I know it's confusing. Scenes were long and drawn out for no purpose excetp to maybe give you time to get to the fridge for a beer or better yet something to perk you up. There's nobody to like, nobody to cheer for, and ultimately no point to this film whatsoever. Terrible portrayal of a horrendous time and it deserved a more dignified treatment than this travesty. No deep underlying message, no morality lesson to speak of. Just a film showcasing the worst Hollywood could offer.

The worst was yet to come with Eyes Wide Shut. ,
69,7 November 2017,avik-basu1889,8, The inhumanity of War !!!,"One of the many characteristic aspects of Kubrick's cinema is the deliberate lack of humanity and intimacy. He made it a point to keep the viewer at a distance from the characters and the circumstances. 'Full Metal Jacket' is divided into two specific parts. The first part involving the basic training in the boot camp, benefits immensely from Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking. This first part is a brilliantly directed, shot and acted satire on the dehumanisation of young boys in the army. We see the innocent and honorable masculinity of these boys who want to do themselves, their families and their country proud, get replaced by toxic masculinity which involves killing your identity and your humanity, equating the lust for sex with the lust for violence, keeping all your emotions suppressed and in the end becoming ultra-aggressive, remorseless, animalistic killers. R. Lee Ermey pretty much single-handedly carries this first part of the film through sheer verbal aggression. The character of Sergeant Hartman played by Ermey is pretty much the devil just like the character of Terence Fletcher played by J. K. Simmons in 'Whiplash'. Just like great satire, there are numerous sequences and moments in this part where the audience will feel like laughing and then within a few seconds feel disturbed and disgusted for laughing at something terrible and reprehensible.",

The logic of Kubrick's filmmaking is not that, for example, The camera is in favor of the soldier at the beginning of the film, or that it condemns such militarism. This type of narration is definitely simplistic. Maybe my idea also agrees with the director's point of view, but because it is not completely realistic in the movie , The movie is unsuccessful.

In the first part we follow green recruits as they go through basic training on Parris Island. It is the first part of the story that introduces us to two truly unforgettable characters: Drill Instructor Hartman is a terrifying figure who uses both verbal and physical abuse to mold his men into Marines. Hartman is superbly played by real-life ex-Marine R. Lee Ermey, and not a single word of his seems fake or contrived. The second unforgettable character is Pvt. Leonard Lawrence, better known as Pyle. From the first time you see him on screen you get the feeling that something isn't right. The overweight recruit takes the worst of Hartman's abuse, is humiliated, betrayed by a friend and finally completely broken down until he becomes the picture of quiet madness. The first part of the story ends with a shocking act of violence that shows what can happen when you ask ordinary men to become killing machines.",

He sees their growth and that's why he was so strict. I've heard that many DI's during Vietnam would check the daily death notices to see if anyone they trained was killed. I can only imagine that Hartman would do this as well and his heart would sink had he recognized any of the names.",

101,12 March 2018,PWNYCNY,8, Military as a sham.,"This is an excellent movie, for a while. R. Lee Ermey gives a riveting performance as the arch typical drill instructor, Sgt. Hartman. Ermey's performance should have earned him an Academy Award. In fact, it can be argued that Ermey's presence makes this movie special. Out side of that, the movie falters. Sgt. Hartman states clearly at the start that his order is weed out those who cannot hack his beloved Marine Corps. That means finding the bad apples. Yet, despite all his threats and abuse and blustering, nobody gets weeded out. The story line contains huge holes. First, regarding Gomer Pyle. Pyle fails at everything, yet Hartman does not flunk him out. Instead, he employs terror to try to get Pyle, a hapless screw up, to comply. Nothing helps, yet Pyle makes it. Boot camp has taught him only one thing: how to kill Hartman. Second, the story abruptly switches to Vietnam. The troops are cynical, demoralized and dysfunctional. They lack unit cohesion and esprit de corps. However, the story fails to explain the cause of their malaise. Joker, another bad apple from boot camp, is still in the Marines. Third, the character Animal Mother. His presence in the story is seems to make no sense, except that he is yet another bad apple that the Marines never weeded out. He's just more overtly anti-social. This entire movie depicts the military as a sham. Tell that to those who actually serve.",

103,1 June 2017,PWNYCNY,8, Institutionalized brutality,"This movie has two parts: Part one is basic training, and part two is war. Although, set in during the Vietnam Era, this movie is not about the Vietnam War. It is about the dehumanizing effect of institutionalized brutality. The instrument through which the brutality is inflicted is Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played by R. Lee Ermey who delivers one of the great performances in cinema history. Sgt. Hartman is the epitome of the sadistic authority figure who represents a culture that repudiates principles of consensus and democracy in favor of instilling the urge to kill on command through the use of terror. In Sgt. Hartman's universe, the purpose of the military is not only to produce killers, but to produce killers who want to kill. The results are poor. Instead of producing well motivated soldiers who can operate effectively as a unit, Hartman's brutal methods produces grotesque caricatures of soldiers who lack any real motivation or purpose to do anything accept act out. That is, instead of being motivated, they are demoralized. Indeed, Hartman himself is killed by one of his own recruits. Ironically, he becomes a victim of his own brutality. There is a general understanding that the Vietnam War was bad for the United States and had a hugely corrupting influence on the military and more broadly on American society in general. This movie further reinforces this understanding. Sergeant Hartman is a truly bizarre character. He is a caricature of a soldier, yet he must be taken seriously. His destructiveness cannot be ignored. He is an agent of destruction. His anger is real. He is the voice of the angry American.",

On one hand the part of Private Pile does not make too much sense, as I very much doubt someone so unsuitable and out of shape would ever be selected for the most torrid and physically demanding training to become a U.S Marine. Though stating this obvious plot ploy, he's also the most important character in the film. Rather than the construction of an elite fighting force, it simultaneously concerns the ultimate, deconstruction of any type of humanity (they once had). Lee Ermey (a real life drill instructor) is a real shock to the system and the rest of the cast is certainly up to the task. Also contains some highly realistic battle action, filmed in the Docklands (East London) and with a mind jolting ending scene, that will have you riveted to your chair!

As a matter of fact, the way that director Stanley Kubrick has constructed his story, it almost seems familiar and routine. It starts us with a collection of mug shots as new Marine recruits are shaved and prepared for basic training, takes us through their grueling preparations for war, and leads us into one of the most harrowing denouements of all time, in which many of those faces we saw at the beginning can no longer be found. But it is not the originality of this story that makes ""Full Metal Jacket"" so great (because it is not original in its plot), it is the sheer harrowing and gut-wrenching plethora of style and nihilism that Kubrick instills into its content.",

113,8 November 2017,aciessi,9, Paint It Black,"Believe it or not, this was considered a flop and a disappointment for Stanley Kubrick back in 1987. Many of his fans were expecting a war epic along the lines of Apocalypse Now. But the thing is, Kubrick already made his war epic, in Paths of Glory. Secondly, it's clear by watching the film that Kubrick's intention was not to talk about the politics of the war, or even stage big budgeted action sequences. His goal was to encapsulate the overall feeling many had about the Vietnam War on and off the battlefield. A pointless exercise of human slaughter. Vietnam, for many, was the definition of man's inhumanity to man. That is what Full Metal Jacket is truly about. The unforgettable first 45 minutes of the picture has us see the ways in which these soldiers are desensitized. The loud-mouthed, profane Sgt. Hartman humiliates the new recruits to their core and as a result, mentally destroys the most vulnerable of the recruits in Leonard ""Private Pyle"" Lawrence. Once we enter Vietnam, Kubrick shows us the casualties of war, and man's inability to show humility towards each other. In the end, Vietnam is a killing field and some of those fighting it ultimately enjoyed the killing. Full Metal Jacket doesn't resolve like a novel, nor do any of the characters receive any kind of redemption. You can say that it's in the tradition of all of Kubrick's films.",

This time, the focus is on the Vietnam war in 1967, centering on a group of marines going through intense bootcamp and traveling overseas to fight. Adapted from Gustav Harsford's book 'The Short Timers', Kubrick has concocted a masterpiece of war with deep themes of humanity and the struggles to be good and evil. The film itself plays out like a two-act play with half of the film taking place inside the first day of bootcamp, going through graduation. The latter half is war itself as we follow one particular marine with the handle of 'Joker' (Matthew Modine).",

Hartman was Iconic and truly phenomenal, outstanding and faultless acting. A wonderful fun fact; Ermey was actually a drill instructor for the marines in real life and initially joined Stanley Kubrick's team as a consultant on the realism of military procedures depicted throughout the film. After being unimpressed with the actors not living up to real life military standards. He asked Kubrick if he could play the part of Hartman himself and was refused. When Kubrick refused, Ermey yelled an order at Kubrick to stand up when he was being spoken to. A shocked Kubrick instinctively jumped to his feet. This earned Ermey the role of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. I find this truly astonishing and adds to the legendary status of this gentleman and the reputation he has is the world of film in this iconic role.",

Although many will go against my decision, I decided to give Full Metal Jacket an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. The film had outstanding visuals and audio design, but Kubrick's odd way of storytelling bogs down the movie and ultimately hurts the film's pacing, character development, and much more. The acting in the film was great, and the tone literally put you back into the Vietnam War in 1968 (when the second and third act take place). This was an extremely hard film to watch, but I felt it was an absolute great representation of what war really is. So in conclusion, although Full Metal Jacket had some great moments, it was ultimately three short films tied together by one thing.. Kubrick. And I'm sorry, but that just isn't good enough.",

I scanned the reviews looking for the comments of vets and found, in the first 14 pages, 6 vets stating that key elements of this film mirrored to some degree their experiences in Vietnam. I found this movie amazing. I agree with many of the more widely-held conclusions about this film. R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman is incredible, as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the tragic Pvt. Pyle. There certainly are two sections to this film, but the inspiration for both parts come from the same book and so, if both parts of the movie can be inspired by the same real lives, then it seems we should accept that both parts reflect different aspects of the military experience. I think that is fair. Capturing the emotional and psychological brutality of bootcamp, along with the horrors and the banality of war seem to be reasonable things to include in the same film.",
123,7 February 2022,TheHonestCritic,10, Does this film get you pumped up and hungry for war? Check out my review below to find out!,"""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), I remember when I first saw this movie. It was sometime during my 12th grade war and conflicts class. That was one of my favorite classes that I've ever taken in school, the teacher for that class, as well as my 9th grade social studies class was my favorite teacher of all-time, he's great! Any way, we did a unit on the Vietnam War in that class. Right as we were about to wrap up that unit, my teacher called for a vote from us. We had a choice of whether to take a test on the Vietnam War, or watch ""Full Metal Jacket"". Obviously, the vote was unanimous for watching the film. I'm ecstatic we did, I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way from beginning to end! As some of you know, I'm not that big a fan of war movies. But, ""Full Metal Jacket"" has found an exclusive spot on my top ten all-time favorite war films! Before I wrote this review, I watched it again in order to refresh my memory. Every time I see this movie, it just gets better and better. ""Full Metal Jacket"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is based on the novel, ""The Short-Timers"" by Gustav Hasford, who wrote the screenplay for this film, alongside of Michael Herr and also writer/director Stanley Kubrick. Now, I haven't read the book before. But, if this movie is any indication, I should check it out! Any way, the story is, a platoon of U. S. Marines go through boot camp training, but two of them have issues with their D. I. After that, the squadron is sent overseas to fight in Vietnam. I won't give any extra details about the storyline. But, let me assure you, when you watch it, you will be invested and intrigued all the way through. It's one of the fastest 116 minutes you'll ever spend watching any film. Props to you, Stanley Kubrick! He is one of my top ten all-time favorite directors, and his work here further solidifies that fact. As for the acting, it is stellar from the whole entire cast. They all do fantastic in this movie! But, the top three standout performances come from: Matthew Modine as Private/Sergeant J. T. ""Joker"" Davis, Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence and R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Those three really make this film! But, my favorite performance comes from R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Fun fact: R. Lee Ermey is a former Marine drill instructor. His original job was to be an advisor on the film set, to see that the boot camp scenes were accurate. However, Stanley Kubrick saw potential in R. Lee Ermey, and had him play Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. What a brilliant decision that was! It just goes to show, that some of the best performances can come from people with no formal acting training! He ad-libbed all of his lines and dialogue, which resulted in such a memorable and iconic character portrayal. This film shaped him into the celebrity we know today. Every movie he gets involved with is usually made a lot better if he's in it. But, in my opinion, this is R. Lee Ermey's best role and performance. He knocked it out of the park, and fired on all cylinders! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. The surprising thing about this movie, is that it was hardly filmed on-location. It was actually shot at various places in England! That was a bit of a stretch, but, they really made it genuinely look like Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and Vietnam. Props to the set designers! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack written by Stanley Kubrick's own daughter, Vivian Kubrick a.k.a. Abigail Mead, is exceptional. Her film score sets the perfect tone for the storyline and helps bring the movie to life. All of the songs are outstanding! But, my personal favorite is, ""Hello Vietnam"" by Johnnie Wright. Whenever I happen to hear that song, it makes me want to watch this film. Plus, it's just a great song in general! The unique thing about the soundtrack in this movie, is that most of it is comprised of music by various bands, rather than being a traditional film score, and it works brilliantly. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is nothing but cinematic gold in the genre of war movies. I could watch it over and over and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it, especially if you're a fan of the war genre. I guarantee that you'll love it! If you love war movies, then this film is essentially gift-wrapped for you. To wrap up my review, let us all have a moment of silence for the late, but great; Stanley Kubrick and R. Lee Ermey. May they both rest in peace. Any way, go and check out ""Full Metal Jacket"" today. Otherwise, you better be on the lookout for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman!",

They are very hard on you. After seeing that blanket beating that stuff really does happen to the weak cadets. Also, the stuff when cadets mess up and the others are punished. That stuff really does happen. When he got caught with that donut. That he took and the others had to do 200 push-ups as he ate it. Oh, trust me that stuff really does happen. That is why all those cadets were so angry with him. Because of the kept messing up. So they beat him to stop messing up. Then he went Crazy and Killed his main Captain.

129,20 November 2006,tsf-1962,10, war is hell,"War is hell, but boot camp is worse. At least that's the impression I got from watching ""Full Metal Jacket,"" Stanley Kubrick's second anti-war classic in thirty years (the first was 1957's ""Paths of Glory."") Since it's based on fact, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is not as mind-bending as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""The Shining,"" but it has all of Kubrick's visual trademarks: harsh, bright lighting; cold, impersonal settings; and lots of whites, reds, and golds. Like the other movies, it deals with ordinary Americans seeking to survive in a hostile environment: first, boot camp, run by a psycho drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey), then urban warfare in Hue City, where they must contend with both the Viet Cong and their own superiors. The boot camp sequence is the best part of the movie: Ermey's sergeant character is clearly out of control, but he's not really a bad guy: he's just doing his job, trying to teach the recruits the skills they will need if they're going to survive in Vietnam. To see Vincent D'Onofrio as the slug-like ""Gomer Pyle,"" then see him in his present role as Detective Robert Goran in ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" is to see just how much this amazing actor has grown. Matthew Modine's Joker is the voice of reason and the story's anchor. The combat scenes are horrifying, but the movie ends on an oddly upbeat note, the troops singing the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" theme song as they pull out of Hue. Add a killer soundtrack of 60s rock and roll and a hilarious cameo by Papillon Soo Soo as a consumptive Vietnamese hooker, and you've got a winner. Maybe not as good as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but still a great war film.",

I tend to feel like Kubrick already knew this, and that's probably why the film's plot is so thin that it's barely there at all. It is famously divided into two parts, boot camp and the famous TET Offensive of 1968. It's also true that, especially in things like the battle scenes, there is not a lot happening that is very far from what have become war film clichÃ©s, like a lot of guys hugging walls, pinned down under sniper fire.

Lee Ermey as the foul-mouthed and strict, but unforgettable Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. I think it is at least a third of the film that is taken by the army training for the troops by Hartman, these are obviously the best scenes of the film. All the characters are forced to work hard, particularly Private Pyle, the most helpless troop who makes the most mistakes and in doing so is picked on and punished, and when he has turned into an instrument of death, he goes mad because of the torment and shoots Hartman, and himself. Then the rest of the film is taken up by the characters now real soldiers in the army being interviewed about their opinions, planning attacks, and fighting the war, including the scenes searching in a deserted village for Vietnamese troops.

142,1 December 2016,cdjh-81125,5, An Amazing First Act Ruined By The Rest of The Film,"Stanley Kubricks, Full Metal Jacket is widely considered to be one of the definitive war films, yet when I heard about it all I ever heard about was about the first act which is a new platoon of soldiers being trained by a cruel drill instructor so I was really wondering if the film was only focused on the training of the troops. It doesn't and that we're this film truly lost it for me. But I do think this film has plenty of positives, as I said the half of this movie is truly amazing it's intense and has an amazing performance for R Lee Emery I thought he was so convincing as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman he was hilarious and imposing and is by far the greatest thing about this movie. An extremely young Vincent D'Nofrio is in this movie and he was also amazing in this film, he was such a sympathetic character and even when he starts improving you still feel for him because you know just how much this training process has taken from him. I'm pretty sure it goes without saying that Stanley Kubrick directed this film to perfection, he always he something visually interesting happening on screen and their was never a dull moment for that first half. My praise pretty much stops there I think the last half of this film was dull, boring and tensionless. A big part of that was due to the completely boring protagonist, he never leaves any impression on the viewer and has absolutely no character development or arc. Honestly other than D'Nofrio nobody has any kind of character development and it really shows in the action sequences were there is absolutely no tension whatsoever because every character is interchangeable. The first half of this movie was incredibly intense because we saw the effects it had in the characters, the last half doesn't take the time to do this they just go on as if nothing's happened. The Vietnam arc of this film is simply just boring because it's pretty much just the same shots repeated for the last hour, Private Joker standing around talking to someone while other soldiers fight in the background.

145,4 April 2020,cashbacher,10, Male bonding in the highest form,"The star of this movie is the drill instructor (D.I.) for the boot camp attended by the group of men that signed up for the United States Marine Corps. He is always verbally and occasionally physically savage to the men as he pulls apart their feelings and turns them into automatons that are at one with their rifles. It is interesting that Lee Erney, the man that played the D.I., was in fact a drill instructor during the Vietnam War and much of his dialog was ad lib. When the men are in boot camp, there are times when you empathize with them.
The war action is just as gritty, the last section of the movie is set in the Vietnamese city of Hue during the Tet Offensive when it was overrun by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. The set is so real that once I was done watching the movie, I went to a search engine to find out where the scenes were shot. I have watched actual footage of the battle for Hue and the reality is uncanny.
The story follows a group of young men that join the Marines and proceed through boot camp before being sent to Vietnam to fill various roles. After some time in country, a few of them are reunited in the battle for Hue. Despite their now brutal personalities, they show tenderness towards each other as only fellow soldiers in battle can.

You'd all ready have a four star movie there but the second part of the movie adds even more. Joker is now in Vietnam as a correspondent reporter.Kubrick doesn't glamorize war nor does he put it down,we see what these men think and do.We have a very impressive sequence with a sniper the troops can't find.Joker has questions himself if he made the right decision Was he really born to kill?

What a horrific and yet at the same time hilarious thing to watch, as Drill Instructor Sgt. Hartman (played by R. Lee Emery, who was in fact a Gunnery Sargeant in the Marines who served in Vietnam and was told by Kubrick to ""make it real"") hurls ongoing and unrelenting abuse at the men as he prepares them to go to Vietnam. This first half of the movie gives us the character of ""Private Pyle"" (perhaps the most memorable character in the entire movie) - a clumsy Marine recruit at best, who becomes the target of special abuse from both Hartman and his fellow Marines.

Ermey really pulls off the drill Sargent role, having been a former drill instructor in real life. Vincent D'Onofrio does an amazing job at being Gomer Pyle. These two actors put in such great performances that they easily outshine the rest of the entire cast, and steal the show. Therefore, after Gomer Pyle puts a bullet in the drill instructor and then his own head, the movie sort of goes downhill. Once in Vietnam, the movie goes somewhat dull.

166,3 April 2004,citizenchris,9, an analysis,"Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of the dregs of warfare ""Full Metal Jacket"" is often thought of as two films. This is easy to understand when one considers the films rather unconventional structure. You see most commercials films (as apposed to say ""art house"" fare) are divided into three acts. In the first act the dramatic conflict is introduced, in act two the challenge of the conflict is met by the protagonist, and finally in act three the conflict is resolved. Not so in FMJ, for you see this film is two act that don't quit ""jell"" in such a nice and neat way. Act one depicts life in marine boot camp. This being the act that the film is most widely know for. The second act is where things stray from the norm. You see act two only contains two characters from act one. One being the narrator/ protagonist  the other a rather small secondary character. The acts don't flow together in the previously mentioned three act manor. In act one we see ""Pile"" mis-treated while ""Joker"" tries to help him conform to the marine ways. ""Pile"" goes on to commit a murder suicide by killing his drill instructor and subsequently himself. Then on to act two we see Joker is now ""in-country"" as a correspondent. The only real tie to the first act is when he runs across a buddy from boot camp.  Each act is treated like its only miniature movie. Act one being the most popular and two like a weird sequel. FMJ not only lacks a third act  but also cohesive dramatic conflict. In act one the conflict might be seen as boot camp life and the protagonist could be ""Pile"". But ""Pile"" is obviously not in act two. One might find traditional conflict in act two but they would be mistaken for there is none. So what is the point of all of this you might ask.. Well you see what most screenwriters and Hollywood filmmakers forget is that there is no cohesive dramatic conflict in life. In life as in FMJ S&^% happens and all we can do is react and observe. And that's exactly what Kubrick wants. He wants to show us something and upon seeing this he wants a reaction. So what is he showing us? In act one he is clearly showing us the dehumanizing nature of creating a ""good marine"". And no this is not just a fictional depiction. Its a lot closer to reality than you might realize. You see the actor portraying the drill segment Lee Ermey served in the Marine Corps for 30 months as a ....you guessed it drill instructor. Much of his now famous dialogue were his own words.  All you have to do is talk to a marine about FMJ and they will tell you that's how  it was. The question is how do you a an audience member react to this display. In act two we are given a more ""traditional"" war film. Though unlike most Vietnam films FMJ second act takes place in decaying urban sectors as apposed to the thick jungles of ""Platoon"" or ""Apocalypse Now"".  It doesn't try to get you into anyone's head. Show you how this experience is changing the character. Kubrick is more interested in the audience. In the ""Vietnam the movie""  sequence soldiers are asked what they think about he war. There is none of your John Wayne hallmark patriotic propaganda.",

168,27 July 2002,lhhung_himself,4, Half a film from half a genius,"Kubrick must rank with Hitchcock as the most overrated director of our time. Full Metal Jacket is one of his pretentious half-failures. The first part of the movie is quite compelling. The real-life drill sargeant is so good that we overlook the fact that the other characters might as well be carrying cardboard sandwiches with what symbol they are supposed to represent. The second part of the film is supposed to, I think, contrast the chaos and reality of the battlefield to the order and artificiality of the parade ground. This was done beautifully in Kurosawa's two masterful scenes in Ran. Needless to say, Kubrick is no Kurosawa, and is not up to the task. The man has no understanding of how to shoot an action sequence, or how real people, not symbols interact. This artificiality, which was tolerable in the first part makes the second part completely laughable. I once saw a very good snippet of Godard (himself vastly overrated..), comparing shot by shot, the sniper scene with real footage from Vietnam and lamenting upon how static, sterile, and lacking in excitement the Kubrick version is. I think all the weaknesses are summarized in the ""surprise"" climax of the film which I found to be completely out of place and as dated as the film and its director. The years have been much kinder to Platoon, or even Apocalypse Now.",
169,6 June 2020,thomasmitilis1995,9," THERE IS NO RACIAL BIGOTRY HERE. HERE, YOU ARE ALL EQUALLY WORTHLESS...","PROS:
~The film depicts the war as a dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. The first part takes place in a boot camp and shows the loss of individuality for each soldier. The opening shaving scene points that this individuality will be soon lost. Full Metal Jacket is a true anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war without preaching even a single time.
~Vincent D'Onofrio portrays Pvt. Pyle and this is definitely the best role of his career. In the beginning he looks naive and clumpsy and doesn't take the military lessons seriously, something that leads him into trouble. However, as you move along with his character, you see his horrific transformation into a killing machine and the beating by the other soldiers is a turning moment for him because the only person that he relies on, takes part in his humiliation. His expressions get wilder and he has completely snapped. As a result, this rapid tranformation leads him to a shocking end where he shoots his instructor but also himself.
~R. Lee Emery is tremendous as sergeant Hartman. He is an intimidating force of nature who will do everything to mold these young men into killing machines. He makes unethical comments about their family, undermines their masculinity, slaps them in their face and abuses them verbally. Through humiliation he wants to destroy their ego because this is what makes each one of them unique. He even gives them nicknames to hide their true identity.
~Matthew Modine as Joker is the real protagonist of the movie and his route throughout the movie is interesting as he is the more human character. Joker is a correspondent who is actually unaware of the reality of war. He wears a helmet with the phrase 'Born to Kill' but at the same time he has a button with the peace symbol. He seeks for action but in the end he looses a bit of his innocence when he has to deal with the assassination of a little girl. However, the movie ends with a more optimistic tone as he learns to appreciate the meaning of life.
~The rest of the cast is incredible as well. Adam Baldwin shines as Animal Mother and he represents what Pyle could have been if he was alive. All the soldiers are an example of human degradation and the interview segment shows that they don't know what war is. Furthermore, the way they behave towards the prostitutes is an indication that their dignity has been completely taken away.
~ The production design is impressive and the ravaged and abandoned buildings in the second half create a chaotic atmosphere. The music choices are very fitting, especially the song 'These boots are made for Walking' which leads to the the second half and the final song which is written for children but is used instead as a military anthem.",

The entire film was shot in England (his new home)and all the sets were built from scratch. Because of the subject matter, he received no military assistance from Uncle Sam.

Unfortunately for me, that was ten years before the Copyright Act of 1976 that gave the copyright of anything written to the author the moment he put it in writing. Otherwise, Kubrik would be paying me, but I would not ask for much. It WAS the feeling. I disliked the Marine Corp. Their attitude in general, the tough guys, heroes, belied their actual performance in Vietnam. US Army units in I Corps and II Corps spent much of their time rescuing Marines pinned down by Charlie. They knew little of the concept, ""recon in FORCE"". The sniper scene depicts the true effects of 7.62 or 7.65 ammo on a body.

Approaching the diaspora from a different angle than Stone, Kubrick hits upon some of the classic themes left (appropriately) untouched by Platoon. Yet, in some cases the ubiquitous slow-motion violence is needlessly gratuitous and the round-the-body one liner reflections and face-the-camera montage interviews are cheesy, if not reminiscent of other great 'camera-focused' escapades like Kevin Pollak's ""Opposite Sex"" and the recent ""that 70s show"".

Most of our instructors weren't much older than the trainees, however, R. Lee Ermey was over 40 when the film was made. We had trainees go crazy and go AWOL. We had an attempted suicide. The brilliance of Full Metal Jacket is how it suddenly leaps from the stark reality of Parris Island to the nebulousness and indecisiveness of American presence in southeast Asia.

As I have never served in any branch of the services, I cannot say from experience whether the picture given of military life in this film is accurate, but as Ermey was himself a sergeant in the Marine Corps and was originally hired as a technical consultant rather than an actor, his portrayal of Hartman is presumably drawn from life.

197,23 September 2000,jhclues,7, Kubrick Addresses The Complexities Of War,"The dual nature of man, wherein he is able to embrace both war and peace simultaneously, is addressed by director Stanley Kubrick in the decidedly anti-war film, `Full Metal Jacket,' starring Matthew Modine.  Divided essentially into two parts, the first half follows raw recruits through basic training at Parris Island, where the effects of what it takes to turn a man into a Marine / killing machine is explored, predominately through the characters of Private `Joker,' played by Matthew Modine, and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), dubbed `Gomer Pyle' by the D.I, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey).  It's a hard, stoic study of techniques and motivation that inherently questions the system itself, and is deftly and succinctly illustrated by the results achieved, which are not entirely those desired. It's hard stuff to swallow at times, but engrossing, and Kubrick manages to gradually build the emotional intensity that gives such impact to the climax of this first part, which is without question the strength of the entire film. 	The second half switches suddenly to Vietnam, where Kubrick takes up his pallet and canvass, and while attempting to paint a realistic portrait of war, instead takes more of a turn away from reality, and the film takes on a sense of the surreal; the result is more reminiscent of the visual artistry of `The Thin Red Line' than of the truly gritty realism of `Saving Private Ryan,' and rather than make his statement  directly through the use of the story, he uses the movie to stage sequences of events to demonstrate the contradictory nature of war and it's consequences, and man's involvement therein.  And while he compares the moral and emotional conflicts with the physical, it is an acknowledgement of an inner struggle devoid of any proffered solution, though delivered quite subjectively.  The pace of the film is very deliberate and much of the dialogue has a `staged' sense about it that, rather than underscore the issues being addressed, has more of an alienating effect which serves to neutralize the emotional aspects of what is being presented. 	The story is told from the point of view of Modine's `Joker' , but though Modine does a passable job, his is a rather unsympathetic character whose purpose it would seem is merely to act as narrator and to serve as the `eyes' of the camera.  And, again, it only manages to distance the audience further, as Joker becomes a kind of buffer between the viewer and any sustained level of emotional involvement with the story or any of the characters.  Instead of a stirring fulmination against the lunacy of war and man's enablement of it, Kubrick's approach creates more of a sense of rather cold ambiguity.  Had Joker (as the lead) been a stronger character, and had the second half of the film been more like the first, instead of nothing more than a series of vignettes, this could have been a dynamic movie; as it is, because of Kubrick's choices, he made a good movie, but not a great one. 	There are two memorable performances here, one by Vincent D'Onofrio, who did an exemplary job of creating the hapless Leonard; the other by Lee Ermey, as the Gunnery Sergeant who could be the poster-boy for an anti-enlistment campaign.  Also worthy of note is the work of Arliss Howard, who brought `Cowboy' so credibly to life.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother); Dorian Harewood (Eightball); Kevyn Major Howard (Rafterman); Ed O'Ross (Lieutenant Tinoshky); and John Terry (Lieutenant Lockhart).  With `Full Metal Jacket,' Stanley Kubrick raises issues that are important, and makes some valid points about the causes and complexities of war, and the moral and ethical challenges of those presented with it.  Obviously, this was a passionate endeavor; if only he would have allowed more of that passion to make it's way onto the screen.  What a movie this could have been.  I rate this one 7/10.",

This gritty, uncompromising drama shocked many for its brutality, most notably Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as an ""oat-fed innocent"" private slowly transformed to a psychotic sniper with a death wish. R. Lee Ermey's unrelenting drill instructor is flawless and chillingly real, Modine is great as the cynical Joker, as is Adam Baldwin's portrayal of ""Animal Mother."" Dour and frightening characters all around.

The first section of the film is a masterpiece standard portrayal of preparing the troops for war, complete with a commanding performance by R. Lee Ermey. The second chapter is still tautly done Â– the intensity of which can be compared to the second space segment of the director's '2001: A Space Odyssey', however it is not as brilliant. Either way, the movie is always intense and very well shot throughout. However, although being high-powered, the film's condemnation of indoctrination is not very potent.

Full Metal Jacket tries to cram in as much as possible to do with the Vietnam War, as it shoots from basic training; to graduation from that; to Vietnam itself; to the battlefield on which the film will conclude whatever documentation, rather than study, it has made.

202,28 June 2017,The_Hateful_Citizen,9, The great art !,"Wow. This movie is fantastic. Stanley Kubrick decided to separate his film in two parts, one part where we see the training of the soldiers and another where these same soldiers are in Vietnam for the war. From the beginning, the Sergeant Hartman announced the color, he managed to make laughter by humiliating and insulting his soldiers, he comes out incredible catchwords and remains funny, even at his death. However, he embodies the harshness of American training, not hesitating to punish all his men for the error of only one of them, but he don't forget to spare the one who had made the mistake, In order to this guy be hate by his mates. The second part of the film shows the horror of the Vietnam war through Joker, a war reporter whose job it is to hide the truth about the war from the Americans The same paradoxical man with a ""Born to Kill"" helmet but also a ""Peace and Love"" pine, showing the absurdity of this war. In the end, at the end of each of the two parts, goes wrong, showing the failure of the US Army. With this film, Stanley Kubrick demonstrates the absurdity of this Vietnam War where the United States destroyed men in a war lost on all fronts. For me, this movie is really not far to get a 10.

Kubrick give us a most crude and depressive side of the war, with no United States propagand. First, Hartman is incredible, his performance is awesome and sometimes funny like in the scene: ""Here is my rifle, here is my gun"".
When I think about Pyle, I feel sadness. He was good and innocent, but that night with the soaps Really broked him. The change is notable, you can see in his eyes that he's not good mentally, and all of this ends with Hartman's death and Pyle's suicide, scene that Really surprised me, in a sad way.
The second half of the movie is pure war, shoots, injuries, explosions, everything is awesome. Personally, one of my favorite shots in movie history is the final shot, with the soldiers walking through the fire.

I do not regret that decision at all. First, I think this movie is the apodeme of built-up anger. Viewing the film from both perspectives of Joker and Pyle made me as the viewer have so many different emotions. I felt bad for Pyle for being known as the 'idiot' and how stupid he was, which ended up in him being beaten up by his fellow marines and just bearded constantly by the segregant. Then the other perspective of Joker and the other marines where they have to get punished whenever Pyle makes a mistake which leads to them beating Pyle up. To start the movie off with that duality just sets it up for a very complex plot. Then you know, Pyles is dead, the sergeant is dead and the movie completely moves past it. I also like how the main characteristic of Joker is the fact that he is against the war and gets threatened, but it doesn't change the fact that the reasons he is against the war are shown throughout the entire movie. The movie also looks so beautiful (as beautiful as the recreation of Vietnam can be), I think Kubrick puts a lot of time and effort into all of his movies and you can definitely see it in this movie.

He has made genuine and breath taking works of art in an each and every last genre, from sci-fi, to horror, drama and so forth. Naturally, when Kubrick took on a war film, it was bound to be stunning. The result is just as expected. It's pretty standard for people to distinguish the film as almost two separate movies. To me, that isn't so. The first 'half' is merely to show that the dehumanization starts in training. The inner demons, the act of killing, is brought out to its fullest by their Gny. Sgt. Hartman, played excellently by the awesome R. Lee Ermey. It is also clearly depicts that some men are not as attuned to this natural instinct as others, as seen in Private Pyle who's struggle to become one of these well groomed and structured killers leads to his untimely insanity. Vincent D'Onofrio was just plain psychotic looking, and was so damn good in his role, it frightened me.

However everything kind of goes downhill after Ermey's murder and Pyle's suicide in the bathroom halfway through. There is no excitement in the combat and nothing memorable in them whatsoever which is a shame. The movie could've been better either doing more for the combat scenes or been set entirely in the boot camp, ending just as they're being shipped off to Vietnam but alas it falls into that category of mine where a movie is so over-hyped that it just collapses upon watching.",

219,11 May 2010,B-Seide24,10, Stanley Kubrick is Pure Genius,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job of creating an aggressive beginning to the movie. The constant abuse of Gomer Pyle by Sergeant Hartman felt real and the versimilitude in the movie was frightening. The film also carried some of the greatest scenes in history. The scene between Pyle and Joker which awoke Sgt. Hartman was intense,raw and the words ""Full metal jacket"" will forever ring in the back of my mind. It also opened the eyes to the world of what an abusive drill instructor could do and what it could lead you to do.The other scene that was horrifying and the realism of the hazing of Pyle was as if you were there witnessing as a bystander. Kubrick did a terrific job of filming that scene and showing you the angst of Joker as he reluctantly gets in on the action. I feel like Stanley Kubrick attempted and completed in showing you what the Vietnam war could do to a average normal person and the aftermath of what a war like that could do.",
220,19 July 2017,yuenw003,10, Stanley Kubrick's genius comes through,"It is said that 90% of directing is casting. That is just part of Kubrick's genius. Another part of his genius is for capturing the right setting and ambiance. This movie has two part: first half is the boot camp drama with R. Lee Ermey (Sgt Hartman), the marine drill instructor, Matthew Modine (Prvt J.T. 'Joker' Davis) as the intelligent, aspiring combat reporter, and Vincent D'Onofrino (Prvt Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Leonard) as the overweight, whipping boy of Sgt Hartman. The drama revolves around Pyle, as Sgt Hartman finds pleasure in belittling his screw ups in front of the others. Joker is paired up with Pyle to be his teacher and mentor. This part of the movie describes the dehumanization process a marine endures in basic training as preparation for them to be fashioned into a weapon of war. The second part is the recruits in the battle field. Joker's assignment as a reporter allows him to view the war experience from an audience's point-of- view. Eventually Pyle tags along with Prvt Cowboy's unit (a fellow recruit) as they patrol the ruins of the city of Hue following an attack known as the Tet Offensive. Towards the climax, 2 of Cowboy's men get picked off by an unknown sniper. This represents the hidden death that lurks at every moment during that war when battling guerrilla fighters. Finally at sundown, Joker leads some men to a building where the sniper is positioned. The palm trees and fire in the ruins of the city makes for an eerie, oriental temple like atmosphere. The music (like elephant cries) in the background also contributes to this effect. Finally the sniper is found and wounded. It turns out to be a girl. Badly wounded, she prays and then asks the men to mercifully killed her. Animal Mother, a heavy machine gunner (like Rambo), wants her to suffer to death as payback. Joker, on the other hand, compassionately chooses to put her out of her misery. The segment of the movie with the sniper is Kubrick's commentary on that war. The Vietnam war was sold to the Americans and those who fought it as the U.S.'s answer to help liberate that country from communism. Ironically, it was reduced to a frustrating effort on the part of young recruits to fight an invisible enemy who very much hated them for their presence in their country.",
221,11 June 2021,RonellSowes,5, Doesn't Compare To His Other Work,"As if he hadn't torched the military infrastructure enough in Paths of Glory and Doctor Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick returned to make another scathing film about war, this time set in the Vietnam War. Actually this film is set in two different places with one half taking place in the Marine Recruit Training. While there isn't as much shooting or killing, Kubrick still uses it as a means to display the dehumanizing nature of the military. It follows two characters primarily, one being the closest thing to a protagonist who the picture later follows through Vietnam and the other is the utterly incapable Pyle. The segment mainly shows how Pyle is grinded down by the demanding Drill Sargeant-played unforgettably by R Lee Emery-until he eventually snaps and kills him and himself. Where the storyline ends and the new one in Vietnam commences, but the same critical themes run unremitting. Though he may not be entirely wrong Kubrick's views are still fairly one sided and fail to see things from more than one angle.",
222,18 April 2023,Holt344,10," Full Metal Jacket can't be compared to Apocalypse Now or Platoon, but you can't deny how it's one of the best-looking war films which offers brilliant acting and writing","Full Metal Jacket is a war drama I watched back in high school just because it was supposed to be this iconic war film, it was and I loved it, but the thing was how I didn't know who Stanley Kubrick was as it was my first film with him. In many years now since my first viewing, almost a decade ago, I have wanted to watch it with fresh eyes and see how a much more mature person would experience it. I see the whole war genre differently now than a decade ago, so what I didn't really know about Full Metal Jacket is how different it is and how it's more a drama than a war film, with emphasis on its many themes than its action sequences. Because this film is more about the characters and the boot camp training they're going through, honestly, Stanley Kubrick was the right person for this project as he was very strict with his direction, making the ruthless senior drill instructor feel natural, Lee Ermey portrays Gunnery Sergeant Hartman and used his actual experience as a U. S. Marine drill instructor to ad lib much of his dialogue. His first scene is the reason I watched the film, his performance is perfect for what the film and story needs. It also stars Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio and Adam Baldwin as the marines who're going through boot camp, with Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio being the best. Full Metal Jacket is directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford. It's a spectacular experience and cinema on the highest level, which offers an accurate view of boot camp training and might be among the best looking war movies. It looks even better with the 4k blu-ray I bought, the picture is clear and perfect, the sound too. About the sound and music, it's perfect, especially the sound design. Everything sounds real and most importantly is how it looks real.",

224,2 November 2007,dromasca,9, one of the best anti-war films ever,"'Full Metal Jacket' is structured like a play in two acts, with little connection between the two parts excepting one of the principal characters. The first part describes the brutal basic training that turns young normal kids, just out of their childhood into killing machines. It's sarcastic, tragical funny, with excellent dialogs, pace and logic. The second part looks more like a war movie, which is kind of a paradox because it's a war movie within an anti-war movie. Arrived in Vietman the young people in the America 60s find themselves immersed within the same world of cruelty and immorality as any of their fellows sent to fight the just or the unjust wars of the past and of the present.",

So much of this masterpiece is so very original, from the quotable lines to the perfect scenes. The film is very well acted and very well cast. Stanley Kubrick famously stated that he preferred adapting novels and improving upon them, and he proves his theory here. The use of music is great as well, particularly in the ending scene as well as in the one with the prostitute, which might be one if the single greatest scenes in any film ever. And while I'm not normally crazy about narration in film, it is very well done here. I've seen it many times and it never gets old. Some people don't enjoy it the first time, possibly due to the unusual structure, but I think if you watch it again you'll really get to see it for what it is: a masterpiece.",

The feature is visually stunning, nice scenery, a few ""gooks"" up-close and lots of weapons and war-torn buildings. There's a wide range of emotions except for romance, hurray for realism ! You can see tree facets of the war going from training and it's hardship to comfy position finished by smelling blood. It's odd that they chose Joker, a war correspondant (journalist), for a main character ; I guess they wanted to show the hardening of a pretty normal guy instead of just jumping in the action with a testosterone/adrenaline junkie lusting for a kill seen in countless movies, it's more human that way.",

Like the crazy helicopter gunman in Full metal Jacket that utters this phrase after explaining his techniques of shooting women and children. But also the other characters we meet, like Private Joker, take a keen pleasure in killing. We follow them trough their Marine boot camp, where they learn to connect their sexuality with their killing instincts, through more or less random events in the Vietnam war, where they have an alternating lifestyle between fighting and having sex either with a prostitute or on their own, into the final showdown where - at the peak of the movies irony - a woman turns out to be the most effective killer.",

229,14 February 2015,aph-ricaud,7, Kubrick's patchwork of war,"Divided in two parts, this movie first looks like a patchwork of two completely different films. The first part shows young men entering a combat training camp. They do not look like the stereotype of soldiers: some are skinny, others are fat, and they do not master guns as if they were born with. The role of the Sergeant is simple: turn them into killing machines, whatever method it requires: humiliation or violence. (But one appreciates him, or maybe appreciates to hate him.) Their only wife? : Their rifles. Their only enemy? Communism. But despite this tough training, they are still humans, and friendships grow on the battlefield. But one of them, weaker than the others, is totally brainwashed by the doctrine he is taught, beyond the expectations of the Sergeant. Then, one understands that killing machines are dangerous for everyone, including those who created them. The second part occurs in Vietnam, following a former soldier -of the first part's training camp- who has become a war journalist. Though it takes place on battlefield, it seemed to me that the second part was way more relaxed than the first, where tension was omnipresent. Here, brotherhood ""hides"" slaughters behind jokes, though those slaughters are shown in an explicit way. The second part expresses the duality of these men, who are ready to give their lives, but less for patriotic reasons, than to save and protect their companions, because they kept their humanity. And that is what, in my opinion, links the two parts: once at war, they apply what they learnt in the training camp: killing, dealing with horror, but keeping in mind they are common humans.",

I provably consider it to be the second greatest war film. No only be it's so powerful and disturbing, but also because it explores things that many war films usually don't. What it takes to be a soldier to fight in war and what does it do to the human brain? The question is ""not good"". It shows the dehumanizing of war in a way nothing could top it.

The Music stands out as a major contributer to the film's mentality. Kubrick likes to use music of the time his films takes place, and it made perfect sense for Full Metal. The film really gets into the minds of the soldiers. What Apocalypse Now was for the Air Cav, this movie is for the Marines in Vietnam. The film's major point is the Duality of Men, and the beauty of Kubrick's shots helps instill a feeling of Victory even though all you see in the film is defeat. This is the most beautifully shot war film I've ever seen, even better than Terry Malick's Thin Red Line. Shots are crisp, perfect, colorful and each scene has its own embrace and feeling, paired wonderfully with the music.

The destructive and creative forces of man pitted against each other is a theme common to many of Kubrick's films particularly ""A Clockwork Orange"". I rank this film above the grossly overrated ""Platoon"" simply because Kubrick says more about war than the trite cliche of 'war is hell'. Many people criticized Kubrick for opting to shoot the film on a sound stage in England. This issue is irrelevant to the message and content of the film. Kubrick dodged the typical depictions of the Vietnam war such as the drug use and the jungle warfare. Kubrick chose to focus on the city patrols. Matthew Modine is brilliant as the confused hero certainly more interesting and convincing than CHARLIE SHEEN in ""Platoon"". Most notable is the brilliant use of music in the film as well as the stellar camera work typical to all Kubrick epics. Lee Ermey is amazingly realistic  as the hard drill sergeant. See this Vietnam film and this one only. Unless of course you want to rent ""Platoon"" and ""The Green Berets"" and cry your eyes out with laughter.",

I was fortunate to never have to do so. In 1998, I was deployed to Japan as an electronics technician with an aviation unit, and prior to deployment, my squadron received several hundred hours on Japanese history, culture and tradition, in addition to the requisite safety, security and terrorism briefs that occur when deploying to a foreign nation. The process was the same when I deployed to Saudi Arabia in 2000. As for the Mickey Mouse at the end, they were not being callous (as a group, individuals are another story), but the battle depicted in the movie was Hue (pronounced WHEY) City, and one of the bloodiest of the war, and were all trying to remember a happier, simpler time in their lives.

250,12 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9," Very close to perfection, but not entirely there","If I were to describe this movie with one word, I would say 'unsettling'. Then again, I suppose this could be said about most of Stanley Kubrick's films. I've seen a few of his films lately, and have become quite a fan of his work... so far I've seen A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey and this one(I've seen The Shining as well, but that was before I knew who Kubrick was and what kind of a director he was, so I didn't fully enjoy it). While I think both aforementioned titles are better than this one(if only slightly), I really did like this film. And while it isn't the best war film ever made, it is definitely one of the better. The film consists of two parts(though they aren't really that separated... and they are both parts of the same story), the first part being about the boot camp which trains the Marines, and the second one being about the Vietnam war. Both parts have essentially the same point and theme... and both deliver it quite well. However, there are a few flaws in the film... it seems uneven, somehow. Some of the scenes, especially in the beginning of the second part, seemed pointless and overlong. Kubrick is famed for his uncanny ability to set a mood and keep it, which makes his films more effective and even harder to watch than they were just with the chilling visuals and excellent use of music. However, here, he seemed almost lost for a few scenes... things didn't seem to go anywhere... maybe he's just not used to doing such a grand project... yes, he was a very ambitious director, with very big films on his resume... but I'm not sure if he had done something on this scale before(or after), so that might be it. Of course, this doesn't mean that the film is bad... not by a long shot. There were just a few scenes that seemed to have little importance... and the voice-over narration seemed tacked on, if you ask me. Like he was trying to implement it, but sufficed to just throwing it in here and there. The plot is great. The pacing is good, but not perfect. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. The music/score is excellent. Kubrick always manages to put in music that sounds really good in scenes that contain disturbing and unpleasant visuals to great effect. The film as a whole is a little flawed but I didn't find anything horribly wrong with the film. Great film with great theme. Any fan of Kubrick should enjoy this. This is possibly the most spoofed/referenced war film of all time... and it's the film that gave R. Lee Ermey the character that he would play for basically the rest of his career. That says something about how crafty and influential this film is, I think. I recommend this film to any fan of Stanley Kubrick and/or war movies. 9/10",

The storyline follows a platoon through basic training all the way to being deployed into Vietnam and into their first combat experiences. This movie is directed by icon Stanley Kubrick (The Shining) and stars Matthew Modine (Cutthroat Island), Adam Baldwin (Independence Day), R. Lee Ermey (Se7en), Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black) and Arliss Howard (Moneyball). This movie has the best depiction of basic training dialogue, settings, circumstances and characters I've ever seen. The set-up in this film was fantastic and the private Pyle character and storyline was perfectly delivered. Ermey is my all time drill sergeant I have ever seen in a military themed movie as well. The script is a gem and this also contains a fantastic soundtrack. The military scenes, especially the intensity of being pinned down by snipers, were intense and entertaining to watch unfold.

258,19 December 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6, A film of two halves.,"It's easy to forget that the boot camp stuff only makes up half of 'Full Metal Jacket (1987)', as it's this segment that has cemented itself in pop culture. There's almost an entire movie set after this, one which sees our heroes shipped off to Vietnam to take part in the grim process of war. It's nearly impossible to critique the film as a cohesive whole because it actually feels like two separate pictures stuck together. Both of these pieces have full narrative arcs, which leads to an odd overall pacing. More specifically, it creates a tremendous slowdown in the affair's mid-section. You have to reorient yourself and get acquainted with this almost complete shift in location, tone and, even, plot. Furthermore, it's only when we get to Vietnam that a proper protagonist starts to emerge. However, it's not like the second half is unsuccessful, although it certainly isn't as successful as the first. It's a bleak and somewhat harrowing exploration of war which presents its morality in shades of grey and expects its audience to make up their own minds about its conflict. There are some stand-out set-pieces and a few surprising moments, too. It just doesn't quite come together as well as it perhaps should have and feels a little at odds with the US-based stuff it follows. The first half is almost entirely situational, unconcerned with its individual characters, and focuses on the brainwashing performed by the American military. It's highly effective and probably gets under your skin more than some of the (arguable) war crimes seen later on. The performance of R. Lee Ermey is as integral to this as its reputation would suggest. It's loud, cruel and abrasive; the filmmaking often puts you in the position of the recruits, making you feel like you're the one being yelled at. Vincent D'Onofrio also gives a stand-out turn as a bullied individual. I won't spoil his arc, all I'll say is that the way he acts in his final scene is straight-up scary. Overall, the movie is a well-made examination of military propaganda and the meat-machine of war.

262,3 February 2014,Red-Barracuda,8, The bravura opening section is enough reason to watch this,"Stanley Kubrick anti-war film Full Metal Jacket was one of a cycle of 80's movies that focused on the war in Vietnam. As is typical of the director it has a meticulous attention to detail. It's a film in two acts, the first is set in a training boot-camp in America and the second part is set in Vietnam proper. In both scenarios we follow a group of young marines. The movie has an unusual dynamic in that the first section is by far the stronger. It's a harrowing account of the way that young recruits are dehumanized as part of a training programme designed to turn them into merciless killers. This section is primarily about two people â€“ Sergeant Hartman the drill instructor and Private Pyle the simple-minded recruit who suffers a nightmare trying to conform. R. Lee Ermey - an actual ex drill instructor â€“ is unforgettable as Hartman. He is equally terrifying and hilarious. Scary because he is so convincing and his heavy tactics are so harsh but funny in that the inventively profane dialogue he constantly barks out is often pretty amusing in a black comedy sense. The way that Kubrick handles this section is perfection and events progress to an unforgettable climax.",

But then you can't find much of that either. This movie is a vehicle for the excellent profanity and vulgarity of R. Lee Ermey in his defining role-well done-in the first half of the film. His abuse results in a predictable outcome, which doesn't have much meaning for the storyline.

You can see Kubrick's work at its best in that first part. Seargeant Instructor Hartman, what a character! He is in your face from the first minute of the film, and those scenes at the camp were wonderfully shot. Close ups to bank on actors' performances and add intensity to the scenes, and intense they were.

First is full of character development, great acting, and there was a better and clear direction on what was the point of that act.
On the second part we get action, shootings, explosions, but no direction on where is it going. The journalist is quite superficial, and everyone talking is quite dumb and unidimensional. I didn't feel like everything was being shown in terms of the horrors of a war like that.
After the strong characters on the first part (not many though, really), the second part feels quite shallow and aimless.
I'm guessing the point was to show how horrible is war even from before getting to the front line, so we've got the two halves to portrait that.
I just think they didn't add up as a great story and couldn't care really about the characters that survive throughout. They're all quite basic and crazy triggering freaks thirsty of blood, I honestly (and hopefully) have to believe that in reality not everyone was enjoying killing people.

Before Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and its vicarious and explosive war during World War II opening, there was Full Metal Jacket that revealed a glaring look into boot camp and the prolonged isolating and deadly experience of patrol in Vietnam. Stanley Kubrick brings his classic stark look to the war film genre not with action but with storyline and the use of real time to expose the audience to a vicarious experience of war through the eyes of Marines. At times documentary in feel and at other times an artistic expose into the harsh realities of basic training and the frailty of life in real field of battle. As opposed to Saving Private Ryan's big canvass, Kubrick focuses on the more narrow but intimate smaller scope of the personal experience of small battles that are likely to have been more prominent in every soldier's experience.",

286,25 January 2021,thejcowboy22,5, Hartman found the Jelly Doughnut missed the Seven Six Two Millimeter Full Metal jacket.,"I feel very fortunate as I reach the Autumn of my years avoiding being drafted into military service. Some of my older neighbors /friends weren't so lucky. I remember in the late summer of 1970 seeing my neighbor Ray for the first time in years getting out of his friends car. Ray reached back for a pair of crutches. Then he opened the door and to my horror watching him rise to his feet without his left leg. All I saw was an exposed flesh and bone stump just below his knee. He was wearing shorts. He looked at me to say hello I don't remember what I said If I said anything. My mouth was wide open. I was stupefied. Ray had just came back from multiple tours in Vietnam and unfortunately stepped on a land mine. Director Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the spoils of war are dramatically shown for the inception to the outcome. Opening scene literally grabs you by the collar as the demonstrative Drill Instructor Hartman. (R. Lee Ermey) verbally and physically emasculates these young men. One by one addressing them as scumbags and homosexuals. From a viewers perspective it's quite hilarious but I wouldn't trade places with these young green recruits for all the money in the world. During Hartman's orientation one of the recruits does a John Wayne impression. Matthew Modine is the Culprit as he gets struck and punched in the abdomen. Because of his actions Hartman labels him as Private Joker. In every squad there's an inept week link. Enter the pudgy Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) who finds the D. I. Hartman amusing with a smirk which infuriates him. Hartman chocks the lad into submission and from that day forward Leonard was named Private Gomer Pyle. The reference is made from a popular TV show about a goofy, gullible Marine Private. After a few days of training Pyle flounders failing at obstacles which makes Hartman even more apoplectic. Hartman asked Pvt Joker if he believes in the virgin Mary. Joker responds , ""No Sir!"" After being beaten, Joker showed backbone and was rewarded the New Squad leader. Jokers reward is to take the inept and floundering Leonard under his wing. This movie is basically broken into two parts. The first being basic training the abuse of marine boot camp and then jumps a few years later to a war torn Vietnam. Private Joker is the main focus to the viewer as he is now a Sargent and a writer for the military tabloid Stars and Stripes. Joker is mocked for his lack of filed experience but in place like Da Nang it won't take long for Joker to get his feet wet.. After watching Full Metal Jacket multiple times you realize how young men from all walks of life are chosen, just by a lottery, for certain or inevitable death. Matthew Modine's character does not exemplifies the tough rugged marine by any stretch. Just on appearance alone, skinny and slight build with glasses for starters. But he managed to make us believe he gets through the riggers of basic with no problem. Ermey, the domineering Sargent, uses his personal past experience as a marine. A commanding performance which makes you want to see more of his talents in other projects. Vincent D'Onofrio does a dramatic change which you see his acting magic at work. He opens the film as a happy go lucky kid into a twisted vengeful killer. Watch his eyes as they speak to the viewer. Another issue is... I truly enjoyed the first half of the film but the second part of the movie as it shifts east went into a different direction as realties of death come closer. I understand the painstaking length's Kubrick gave us, the viewer a feeling of actually being in Vietnam among the rapid fire of machine guns plus chemical warfare, the discolored sky says it all with the dilapidated palm trees. He definitely painted an ugly feeling of the landscape. After watching all this carnage you will know the phrase and it's application ""Thousand Yard Stare"". Innocents turns to brain washing for the solder. Then entering a hot, steamy jungle somewhere around the other side of the world all due to a draft to fight Communism. Meanwhile back in my Neighborhood a few years went by . February 1973 the War was officially over in Vietnam and I was playing basketball with a familiar Veteran The one legged Ray who now wears a prosthetic leg. Ray reenlisted in the Army and was stationed in Montana guarding a nuclear silo. Ray would come home for the holidays now and then but he was one of the lucky one minus his leg. Watching Full Metal Jacket gave me an appreciation for life and that G-d really wants me to enjoy life and not have it snatched out of my control due to a war time government. G-d bless all the armed services for their duty to this country.",
287,11 February 2022,pmtelefon,5, Kubrick gives us a lecture,"I've seen ""Full Metal Jacket"" a bunch of times. I've never been a fan. The boot camp part of the movie doesn't really work. If we are laughing at what the drill sergeant is saying to Private Pyle, then we are laughing at Private Pyle. If we're laughing at Pyle, then we're not going to feel sorry for him. As far as the second part of the movie, it doesn't fair much better. Despite some very effective moments, the non-stop anti-war speechifying takes away much of the dramatic effect. The obvious British locations don't help either. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is not a bad film. It's just not a very satisfying watch.",
288,31 August 2018,ironhorse_iv,9," Oohrah! Full Metal Jacket. This haunted portrayal of war is insanity well told. Me love it, long time.","Being a soldier in the Vietnam War era had to be rough. Not only, was the war in Southeast Asia, a very arduous and evolving moral challenging affair, but going through boot camp for that date with the enemy was not kind. Especially, if you had to go through it, with a rigorous Senior Drill Instructor like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermy). However, somehow, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) was able to get survive this, only to find himself, in a world of hurt, once he finally see combat, and had to make the final choice to kill or not. Could he pull the trigger? Watch the film, to find out. Without spoiling the movie, too much; this film was loosely based on a book by author, Gustav Hasford called 'The Short Timers', which he wrote whilst serving in Vietnam. Both director, Stanley Kubrick, and screenwriter, Michael Herr, adapted this book into the screenplay, changing parts of it. While, the movie faithfully reproduces the first section of the novel, ""The Spirit of the Bayonet"", with only minor differences in events and names. The second part of the movie change a lot of the dialogue, scenarios, and characters; by combining elements from chapters 'Body Count' and 'Grunt' & merging them into one to save the movie from a long runtime. Because of this, several key important sequences were left out or change, including: a character lapse into cannibalism, a tank running over people, and the real person, the protagonist has to force to kill. Because of this, Kubrick and Hasford did not get along, it got worst, when the filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work. In order to further distanced himself from the original author, Kubrick changed the title of the film to what it is today after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. This was finally draw, as Hasford didn't meet Kubrick ever again, nor attend the Oscar ceremonies when the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. Anyways, regardless of the writing dispute, the movie is probably best remember for the scenes at Parris Island, at the Marine Corp Boot Camp, as most critics and audience love Ermy's portrayal as the strict drill instructor. His over the top bellowing acting & the comedic funny insults to Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) were by far, the most entertaining part of the film. However, it wasn't his first acting role like some critics may want to think. In truth, he play a similar character in Sidney J. Furie's 1978's film, 'The Boys in Company C'. Honestly, if you look at both movies as a whole, you would find a lot of similarities between them besides Ermy, to the point, that some critics believe that Kubrick & Hasford might have stolen ideas from Furie's work, or Furie's adapted Hasford's story without giving him, credit. It's hard to tell, who is the right and who is the wrong. All, I know, is both films, showcase the exposition of dehumanization & the loss of individuality and that catapults into men into fighting machines so well, with this movie's boot camp sequences being a little more accurate. Psychological & mentally conditioning techniques like the ones, show in the film, are indeed used to sharpen recruits, in order for them to obey all orders, work together, face mortal danger, and kill their opponents in battle. However, I really doubt, much of physically hitting used by Hartman is allowed, even back then, without embroiled in controversy. As for the film's portrayal of marines in Vietnam. It could easily be mistaken for another film, as the footage looks and feels like other over the top, somewhat cartoony, Vietnam War films from that era, including 1979's film 'Apocalypse Now'. While, it's true, heinous acts were commit by some of them. Nevertheless, most of the vets out there, were highly discipline and acted accorded to qualities of what a good combatant should be. In short, they were more like the realism soldiers in 1986's film 'Platoon', than the shocking extremists of Francis Ford Coppola's movie. Regardless of that, the movie does a strong second half, both in action and moral message. It does not all fall apart or seem disjointed as some people think. The journalism parts are great examples of this. They're very interesting, as the men interviews in a faux like documentary perspective really have no clue, who they, even fighting against and why. Nor if they really winning the world. I like how each of their answers ranges from topics like lack of sex, religionist duty to downright insanity. It mirrors to every coercive persuasion that people like Hartman altered into them, in order to reduce the subject's ability to think critically or independently. I also love, how it foreshadows, future events. As for the ending with the sniper, it's very much of a symbol of loss of innocence. No wonder, the movie ends with a satirizing military infusing singing of a children song. It's haunting. Even the catchy pop songs were very well used. Most of the music compose by Kubrick's daughter, Abigail Mead was also great. The creepy industry background music in the climax is one such example. Compelling as hell. Those scenes in Hae must had been difficult to shot with all those chemicals in the air. No wonder, why the movie took forever to film. Despite that, the movie is very well shot. As for acting, all the performers did their jobs; but D'Onofrio really shines, as he gained 70 pounds to play Pyle. Talk about going to great lengths for a role. Best acting in the film, by far. Overall: Despite some flaws. If you want to get some! Go see this movie! It's a poignant masterpiece. It's a must watch for any Kubrick fan.",

As one among the group of films in the 1970s and '80s about the Vietnam War, it is about the subject matter, yet the subject is not even close to being as deeply felt by the filmmaker. Oliver Stone brought his own front-line experiences to Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and even Heaven and Earth, all of which engage an audience in emotional hurricanes. Francis Ford Coppola achieved the nightmarish effect of war in Apocalypse Now because he subjected himself to such hurricanes in his own nightmarish experience of making the film; he made ruthless, often amoral decisions which largely impacted many of that movie's most affecting images.

305,21 November 2010,mjneu59,8, born again hard,"(Note: the following was written when the film was first released in 1987...) Can anything new be added to the current cycle of Vietnam War films? Stanley Kubrick seems to think so, and he goes about his business after a seven-year absence as if his were the first film to be made on the subject (which it might have been, back when he began it). What's surprising is how well such a fussy and deliberate filmmaker like Kubrick captures the madness of war (much as he did in his earlier Paths of Glory). But the best part of this lopsided scenario (co-written with Michael Herr and author Gustav Hasford) has nothing to do with the conflict in Vietnam, focusing exclusively on the rigors of Marine Corps training and indoctrination (i.e. brainwashing). These early scenes are classic Kubrick, and would have made a near perfect short film if released independently. The subsequent battle scenes (famously, if not always convincingly, recreating Southeast Asia in rural England) are, by comparison, only anticlimactic padding, showing what happens when the hot-blooded fury of combat gives way to the cold-blooded reality of death, represented here by a single, harrowing incident where a squad of soldiers is pinned down by an invisible sniper during the urban fighting of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Never mind that Francis Coppola covered similar ground in one brief scene of 'Apocalypse Now'; for Kubrick, it's a welcome return to form, up to a point: a compact, mini-masterpiece awkwardly matched to a rambling, episodic war story.",

Lee Ermey was fantastic as the drill instructor. I've never seen him in any other dramatic role, so this performance sort of defines him. Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio put in their best career performances by far, as did Adam Baldwin. The rest of the cast is fairly obscure, but there was never a false note throughout.",
307,18 August 2014,dworldeater,10, My favorite war movie of all time and one of the best movies ever made,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a powerful, original, well crafted masterpiece that is in a class of its own and in my opinion, flawless. Don't get me wrong, there are many great war movies that are also classics. Full Metal Jacket is unique from other Vietnam War movies as no one made movies like Stanley Kubrick. Stanley had a unique take on the subject matter, got the finest performances possible from his cast and made a film that still looks and sounds incredible nearly thirty years later. Lee Ermy, a decorated Marine and Vietnam War veteran serves double duty as technical adviser and as Drill Sgt. Hartman. He brings both authenticity and an unforgettable, intense performance as drill instructor. From what friends of mine who served in the Marines tell me, the training sequences are one hundred percent accurate. The other half of the film may be slightly less intense, but director Stanley Kubrick's story told through Joker's perspective flows smooth and is no less interesting when Joker arrives in the 'Nam. Matthew Modine is exceptional here and shows great range in his performance. He has a lot of charisma as well as great screen presence. In my opinion, Stanley Kubrick made an excellent choice casting him as he did a great job carrying the film. Of course Vincent D'Onfrio was exceptional as the ill fated Private Pyle and Adam Baldwin kills it Alpha male bad ass Animal Mother. The rock n' roll soundtrack compliments the film greatly and gives it a feel for the period. The characters in this story are brutalized and their lives are changed forever by what they go through in the course of the film.

But when the movie shifts to Viet Nam, the whole movie falls flat--the whole audience is bored listless wondering what the point is. A few vague references to ""the duality of man"" are made but never explored, the characters are shallow and cardboard. The movie was taken from a short story, ""The Short Timers"", but if that story had a message it's completely lost in the movie. In short, see the first half which will hit you like a ton of bricks, then get ready to read the paper or just skip the whole 2nd half entirely.",

313,21 September 2009,darin-wissbaum,5, Should have ended after the first part...,"This was a film in which greatness was in Stanley Kubricks grasp and he failed to grab it. The first part of this film (the BT part) was so convincing that it really should have been left at that. I did not need to see the second part with the typical Kubrick trademarks and violence of Vietnam to be convinced that war is hell. The part of Sgt Hartman played by R. Lee Ermy made you believe that war is hell, and he is not so much a mean person but mean in a sense to the young new recruits because he knows that the real terror will start once they are on the ground in Viet Nam and he needs to prepare them for that. His toughness to his men take their toll on reject Pvt Pile (Vincent D'Onofrio) in which the stress of BT reaches a point of Sgt Hartman getting killed and D'Onofrio putting a rifle in his mouth. The first part of this film was truly terrifying as you could feel what it must have been like to know you were going to Vietnam after BT and what may await you once you were there. The second part once the troops were on the ground in Nam was not what the first part had prepared me for. In fact it played like a comedy and was a bit silly. The sets and locations were not convincing and it all lead around Matthew Modines character Pvt. Joker who writes for a military newspaper, who has a chance to go with group of grunts into a blown out city and experiences combat for the first time. Basically just running around in and out of buildings and getting shot at with jokes in-between. I felt it contradicted everything the first part was about and what I thought it was preparing me for. Maybe it was Kubricks anal way of directing in which he would do a scene 35+ times that did this one in....who knows but the real title of this story before it was changed to Full Metal Jacket was ""The Short Timers."" They should have left it at that.",

After being off the spotlight for several years, Kubrick sought inspiration from Coppola, Cimino and Stone and give his perspective on the deadliest wars in the 20th century. In reality, 'Full Metal Jacket"" has a more fabricated perspective of the Vietnam War to date. The scriptwriters for this movie were novelists Gustav Hasford and Michael Herr based off of Hasford's novella ""The Short Timers"" while Kubrick had to depend on archives like videos and books in preparation for his project.

The film is very versatile in that there is obvious drama, but there are moments of comic relief mostly to those who were in the military.

The potentially dangerous creed instilled into the minds of the marines do forge them into becoming great weapons themselves, yet to some who can't endure it, it turns them crazy.

Lee Ermey) was a total buzz-kill and far-reaching. For me, this misguided climax threw a poorly conceived curve-ball, slowing the film down dramatically and losing its well-earned momentum. Private Pyle could have simply killed himself and this would have been adequate. Disturbingly, the audience is tortuously subjected to Joker's tiring and annoying dialog for most of the film (do we really care about him?) while the plot seemingly meanders in an unclear direction; that is, until the action involving the sniper begins. Viewers are then suddenly catapulted into the fray (possibly a move by director Kubrick to mimic the shock and violence of Vietnam upon the audience) and the story begins to garner a clearer sense of purpose and focus. The madness and confusion during the combat scenes bring strong realistic performances, but ultimately, the film fades to an end and loses insight along the way. There is no strong sense of closure or solid setup for a conclusion regarding the characters (as we saw in ""Platoon""). Though the combat scenes are well done, most of the characters are not fully developed enough for the audience to identify with or even really care about. The potential was definitely there and the cinematography was excellent, but the script had some problems that could have been rewritten for an easier, more realistic flow. Some key adjustments could have served the film well overall.",

There' isn't anything here we haven't seen before, but Kubrick puts his own unique spin on things. I have always preferred the training portion of the movie to the combat portion, but that's me. I have seen equally good if not better war scenes in a dozen other war movies.

It's true that the second half of the movie isn't as hard and direct as the first half, but that's exactly the thing: it crawls up on you. The first half is great while you're watching it, what follows is at times more brilliant when you give it thought afterwards. Also, that ending is downright beautiful.

Kubrick's focus in this film appears to be the soldiers themselves, as they're transformed from your average all-American youth into cold-blooded killers gunning for the enemy.

335,11 January 2016,Screen_Blitz,8, Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War epic is both gritty and spectacular,"From the early 60s to the late 90s before his death, Stanley Kubrick introduced audiences everywhere with some of the biggest masterpieces in the history of cinema. Touching on various subjects ranging including war, politics, crime, science-fiction, horror, and many others; this highly spoken director is found by many to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever step in foot in Hollywood, there is no doubt why. One of his biggest films I will forget was this Vietnam War epic based on the novel by Gustav Hasford. This gritty adaption tells a dual segmented story of a U.S Marine platoon during their grueling days of boot camp training. The platoon is ran under command by the ill-tempered, loud-mouthed Drill Sergeant Hartman (played by R. Lee Ermey) who pushes the fellow marines to the very limits, and does not hesitate butcher with loud profanity during training sessions. Matthew Iodine plays Private J.T Davis, nicknamed ""The Joker"", who stands as a bright example to his fellow marines. Then there is Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Private Leonard Lawrence, under the name ""Gomer Pyle"", an overweight marine who never seems to stay in line with everyone else, and results in constant scolding from Sergeant Hartman.

337,16 December 2020,gab-14712,10, You'll Never Forget R. Lee Ermey's Performance!,"Movies about Vietnam have been commonplace in the late 70's-1980's. More often that not, masterpieces were created about this topic. Of course, we all know about The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Platoon. Let's add another one to the list: Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. This may actually be my favorite out of all the movies I listed. Kubrick's story is told in two sections; the boot camp sequences at Parris Island and the actual fighting in Vietnam. While the Vietnam scenes are harrowing, nailbiting, and features excellent sound/visual choices, the first half of the film is sheer perfection. R. Lee Ermey as the colorful squad leader and Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle deliver exemplary performances. Watching Ermey turn D'Onofrio into an instrument of death is nothing short of terrifying. Kubrick does not have an extensive filmography so when he directs something, you know its something that needs to be seen. After all, Kubrick created one of the best war movies ever made.
Kubrick's original idea for his movie was to be about the holocaust. After conversing with Vietnam expert Michael Herr, Kubrick scrapped that idea and wanted to tackle Vietnam. Both men read a book called ""The Short Timers"" by Gustav Hasford and both felt it was the ideal book to tackle. Kubrick decided to change the name of the title because he felt the original title was too confusing, and good idea too. Together the three men created the screenplay but of course Kubrick was in control as he always was with his films. The actual screenplay itself is fantastic, but it did come with improvisation. Ermey was an actual drill sergeant for the Marines and he ad-libbed about 50% of his colorful insults. So, maybe Ermey should have also gotten a writing credit. Anyhow, critics seem divided when exploring the film's themes. Personally, it did not feel like an anti-war critique. It is just a straightforward war film that describes training and war itself as is. Isn't training supposed to be the drill sergeant dehumanizing recruits so they can become killing machines?
The film starts off with the recruits entering training camp under the watchful eyes of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). The main focus is on Hartman's relationship with Privates Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Joker (Matthew Modine). Hartman turns Pyle into a killing machine through efficient and terrifying means. Pyle receives grief because he is good at nothing but does discover he has excellent marksman skills which that and Joker's unwillingness to interfere leads to a chilling showdown of Part One. Part Two focuses on Joker's experience in Vietnam. Joker wanted to become a killer, but the Tet offensive he was thrown into will ultimately answer that question as he embraces his role as a combat correspondent.
One of the reasons why I found the first 45 minutes to be perfection is because of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. Ermey, being a lifelong military brat, was born for this role. Kubrick originally thought he was not intimidating enough but was proven wrong. He is a beast at slinging insults, since that is pretty much all he does. D'Onofrio was also not Kubrick's first choice, but he eventually won over the director's heart and was told to gain seventy pounds. Watching him get picked on by Ermey made me feel so helpless but it gave his character many memorable scenes. The second half is not perfect, but still very good thanks to Modine's acting and moral questioning.
Like all of Kubrick's films, the technical aspects are in tip-top form. People may have issues with the second half, but there is no denying the technical skills. The sniper sequences worked for me, but I think the ability of sound mixing and editing comes into play. Kubrick is also known for his visuals and interesting camera angles when it comes to characters lacking a sense of morals. What he did with Jack Nicholson in The Shining and Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, he does with Vincent D'Onofrio. That brow down, eyes up hidden in the shadows that signifies evil. I always think about that climatic scene in the barrack's bathroom where that particular scene took place. Can never forget it! Also, Kubrick's daughter, Vivian did a great job putting together a solid list of songs about Vietnam. No CCR, but hello Nancy Sinatra!
When Full Metal Jacket was first released, it was more of a mixed bag (like most of Kubrick's films). Critics lauded the first half but felt the second half undid the movie. The first half is perfection and probably the best you will ever see in terms of basic training sequences, but the second half is still expertly shot and involves some very harrowing sniper action. The central themes are simple, but Kubrick never wanted to go too deep. He wanted to tell a straightforward war movie and that is what we got. He also gave us R. Lee Ermey, who has the best insults. I am not sure how he came up with this vulgarity, but I loved it. In the pantheon of war movies about Vietnam, Kubrick's masterpiece deserves to be near or at the top.

He certainly covered the ideas and motivations behind war in Paths of Glory as well in parts of Dr. Strangelove and Barry Lyndon. Here, he took his most modern take on perhaps the most complex and enigmatic war the United States ever took part of. We follow closely a group of Marine trainees as they pass through many tests in order to become one of the Corps. For the first 45 minutes or so, the drama is unparalleled. On an island totally dominated by an unflinching and cruel drill instructor, these young boys quickly are forced to grow up and become the mindless and dehumanized killers the Marines require.

This is not really actual engagement but rather Kubrick being witty. Suffice to say that most wars could end up going down the 'war is hell' pathway where there are no clear moral boundaries and fresh-faced young men are thrust into a chaotic, nightmarish world to cope. In Full Metal Jacket Kubrick has done the same as what Stone did in Platoon; obscure the surroundings in smoke, ash and explosions, give no sense of direction or control, and drop the inexperienced squadron right into the middle of it. Here, they have no idea who or what is shooting at them half the time, and it is terrifying and disorientating, and the film begins to close in on them and their paranoia rather than have it be an external battle.

So it wouldn't be a surprise for him to create an epic war film, and Full Metal Jacket was that.

Unlike Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, FMJ takes a look into a soldiers Psyche. It shows us how these guys actually went through hell to become Marines and how they are put under so much stress and pressure. Its more about their journey into the war than the war itself and that's what makes this movie stand out. Just an incredible film that is sure a classic. The totality of war, from the loss of self to ultimately the loss of life, has never been as thoroughly examined as in Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Its not only about of what does a soldier lives on the battle field is also all the process it take to become a man a killing machine, an excellent psychological movie that show you other side of the war stories.",

Vincent Donofrio's portrayal of Private ""Pyle"" is not only the best of his career, but among the best you will see.

He responds that it is a comment on the duality of man, warring and peaceable. The film reflects this two-sided dilemma with a two-part story. The dialogue in both sections is a constant clash between the inflating, propagandistic, and sickly comic language of professional soldiering (aided by the immensely foul-mouthed drill sergeant Hartman, played by former Marine sergeant R. Lee Ermey) and Joker's more self- preserving enterprises, first as the tutor of the inept Pyle and then as the journalist reluctantly covering the military perspective of the war and just as reluctant. He is never truly the vicious fighter the Marines want him to be, but he is every bit as detestable as his more unthinking counterparts. Kubrick's particularly effective stroke was to purposefully ignore the politics of Vietnam and keep both sides of this generalized central conflict right in your face. Kubrick works expressly on this level of the individual and unspecialized grunt to create a film that is less a defense or criticism of war than a strike at the mythologies of war-making. In its constant and irreversible violence, Full Metal Jacket, one of Kubrick's grittiest works, is also one of his most resonant.",

The film gives a clear point of view of the soldier's perspective of the war, how they feel, what they think about it, what they are doing and if they feel like they are doing the right thing. The most powerful part of the film is the training process in the beginning with R. Lee Ermey and his acting skills. Also Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio are good in that part. the filming was perfect and the camera movements were really realistic to a soldier's P.O.V. the shots of zoom out and zoom in were good and the music during the more creepy scenes really gave a perfect tone of darkness and brutality. overall I can't find a moment that I didn't like during the movie or a bad scene that made the movie less good then it is already.",

Wherever you turn to, there's bound to be a different opinion from anybody who sees and tells all there is to FULL METAL JACKET. What begins as a vulgar training exercise becomes a battling bloodbath at the end. It provides a very tight example of being prepared to live or die in wartime. Slowly, the movie builds up to the point of fair interest when the Marines fight at Vietnam, an element of Stanley Kubrick's unique presentation. The story is compelling and provocative from the start, outweighing the further drawbacks. I would almost have to give the entertainment value a strong ""10"", though, if only it weren't for the last few minutes, which was a letdown, although it gave us a clear mystery about what may be predicted to happen next. For this to be the greatest war movie around, it needs PLENTY of hell-raising, heart-gripping war action to create a higher excitement level, and despite some bloody casualties, there should have been more of it badly. It actually will have viewers wondering why our drill sergeant shoved the hell out of young recruits (including ""Pyle"") preparing for the worst time of their lives. That part is really the best thing about the film. Still, it's a fine war story with a style of Kubrick's own. I can't say it's the best one ever made, but it holds its own ground.",

374,13 May 2017,RossRivero99,10, One of Stanley Kubrick's finest films,"During his career Stanley Kubrick had repeatedly denied claims that he was a perfectionist when it came to filmmaking, but with classic movies such as ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), and ""The Shining"" (1980), it is hard for people who have seen Kubrick's films to claim otherwise, but with this movie it isn't only one of Kubrick's best films, it is also one of the best war movies ever made. This movie is also the only war movie besides ""American Sniper"" (2014) to be a character study, the main character being a Marine Corps Private nicknamed ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine) who after his first day of basic training he and his fellow recruits ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard), ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio) and many others are under the command of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). The first half of the movie are the basic training scenes, while the last half are the expertly shot, and extremely realistic war scenes. Though this isn't the best movie that Stanley Kubrick ever directed, it does have the trademarks of a Kubrick movie such as the character focus shots, and everything else. The movie is just perfect, the screenplay co-written by Kubrick and, the author of the book ""The Short Timers"" of which the movie is based, the cinematography is top notch, and the performances are very good. The movie also features an excellent supporting cast including Adam Baldwin as a soldier nicknamed ""Animal Mother"", my personal favorite performance in the movie was from Ermey because he literally embodies his character because of the fact that prior to this movie he was an actual drill sergeant in real life. The movie is a very good mix of totally hilarious and really dramatic, and Ermey gives the best performance of a drill sergeant in motion picture history here. This is one of the best movies of 1987.",

Every time the drill sergeant yelled cuss words and said weird stuff to Gomer Pyle it always made me laugh. In some ways the movie should of been longer. It's only like 2 hours long and I just wanted to see what happened to the platoon after that sniper shootout scene at the end and how Private Joker developed after losing his friend. Stanley Kubrick should of added more scenes into the film but that was OK. The film was still amazing and powerful with lots of spectacular scenes and very memorable parts.",

The ""state of the art"" comprises a longing for the corrupted and coarted youth: life ripped off at its fullest, young lives that have been regretted, the guilty naiveness of patriotism and the mistakes of the Cold war in movies such as The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Forrest Gump. The theme of an indoctrinated youngster converted into an anti-human killing machine man who is blinded (as well as officially justified) by the national discourse has its echoes in the literary pages of novels like Travel to the End of the Night by Louis Ferdiand CÃ©line, The Good Soldier Svejk by Jaroslav Hasek etc . In all these texts there is a profound anti-skepticism. The cinema, along that tone, has been no exception. The wide appeal of war movies comes from Battleshkip Potemkin , The Bridge over the River Kwai , Go and see , The Thin Red Line etc.. All maintain the usual standard style, narrative and characters.

The first half is at a training camp with a foul mouthed drill sergeant terrifying the new recruits and driving one to insanity. Then we get to the war front, and it's almost a relief. From then on the film is an intense, well directed assault on the senses as the film enters the battlefields. Amazingly, Kubrick created a vivid Vietnam set in rural England. Full Metal Jacket is another display of his incredible and singular talents as a director. The first half is soul shattering and utterly harrowing; it has the best improvisation ever from real life drill sergeant R Lee Ermey and the camera work is typically flawless.

Coming from the extraordinarily talented Stanley Kubrick I felt it would be engrossing and captivating as his other masterworks, but I wasn't entirely sure. You see, critics really rammed 'Full Metal Jacket' as being nothing more then mediocre. The critics praised all of Kubrick's other films, even 'Eyes Wide Shut' which I found to be so devastatingly average, uninventive and in poor taste. I felt if film critics dare to put down the man himself, the film has got to be terrible. Well, when those end credits started to energetically roll to The Rolling Stones' 'Painted Black' I realized I had witnessed one of the finest war movies ever created, and definitely the funniest.

Lockhart, is really hard on them and his insults are actually quite funny. The first act was centered around Pvt. Joker and his experiences. As the scene continues on, one of the volunteers named Pvt. Pyle, is shown to be overweight and is often picked on by Lt. Lockhart. You can't help but to feel sorry for Pvt. Pyle and throughout the first act, you're hoping that he'll be able to turn himself around so he can pass. The ending of the scene was highly tragic but fitting. The second act showed that Pvt. Joker finished boot camp and was now in the Vietnam War. It showed him fighting through enemies as they advanced in the war. I don't think the second act was as good as the first act because the second act didn't draw me back in as much. Still I wouldn't describe the second act as bad because it was still entertaining. The scene when they are pinned down by a sniper is very tense. None of the fighting sequences carried on for too long and seemed to be just the right length.

391,29 November 2006,bbraat,5, Two separate movies,"This film was really two separate movies that, like conjoined twins, should never have been joined and should be separated. The first movie was a terrifying expose of American military training and how people are changed by the experience. IT had a beginning, a middle, and an end. It had it's own moral and theme. That movie ended when the gun went off in the bathroom. That's it. End of that story. THEN some other movie started which was a 'slice of life' movie and thus no beginning, no middle, no end. It took place in Vietnam with many of the same characters that appeared in the other movie but was otherwise a meandering mess. An interesting side-note is that Anthony Michael Hall was the first actor hired to play Matt Modine's character Joker but was fired for arguing too much with the director. think about this, while Hall was a very well known comedy actor at the time, his comedy career was already tanking having had several flops and bombing on SNL. This would have been a great chance to segue into more serious acting the way Sean Penn did. At the very least he could have extended his career considerably. Instead, he faded out of the limelight and made the career of a lesser known Matt Modine. Modine came from a similar cinematic history as Hall but lasted much longer. It reminds me of how John Travolta invented Richard Gere's career by turning down the movies that made Gere famous. Or how Montgomery Clift similarly made James Dean's and Marlon Brando's careers.",

In all honesty, it's a shame knowing that this was made by the man who did ""2001"", ""The shining"" or ""Barry Lyndon"" but all by all ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a watchable movie nontheless. The big problem is that there are two parts that aren't equal...the first hour of the movie is the training and it must be one of the most shocking war propaganda (well, depends how you wanna call it) ever, especially because of the superb acting from R Lee Ermey who plays a totally awol sergeant, but once the troops are landing in Vietnam the movie sucks, and the main reason is that there is just no story, just shooting and that's it, unless you call the war seen through a warphotographer a movie.",

This is undoubtedly the 2nd best Vietnam movie ever made, and I know how that sounds. But when you are second to ""Platoon"", then it isn't all that bad.

Lee Emrey's role as the brutal D.I. is perhaps the movie's most memorable performance. The second half is basically on-the-field action of some sorts. Don't expect bodies being hacked and maimed in a non-stop barrage of bullets and shrapnel. What we get instead is the camaraderie that exists between the soldiers, what their views are of this war (which are quite disparate!). It is during this last half that FMJ adopts a ""documentary"" feel. True, the very few combat scenes are done with the grace and excellence that Stanley Kubrik is well known for.

Still like many of Stanley's movies that are initially despised upon release, are years later lauded as masterpieces beyond the scope of a mere camera lens. ""Full Metal Jacket"", I feel represents Stanley working at his most un-prohibited in terms of humanities greatest flaw. After seeing through the bitter eyes of General Kirk Douglas in ""Paths Of Glory"" (1957), and the Superpowers of ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) we finally get to see what really matters.

The public's current determination to support the troops ""downrange"", fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, is a reflection of the shame we feel for the way we treated Vietnam vets back during their war.

Though I wish I did not read the trivia, because reading that the movie was filmed in the UK with the plastic palm trees does not add any respect to the production (I think I should quit the trivia for certain great films â€“ it simply ruins the whole impression sometimes). Still, even without that kind of authenticity the movie walks along quite well. Its ridiculous amount of fowl language is justified (just think how many movies nowadays are crammed with bad language which is there just because the director thinks it's cool no matter if it fits the film itself or not). You don't expect the military guys saying something like ""Would you be so kind to run faster, Private Vincent D'Onofrio"", do you? The performance of Mr R.

From the psychotic redneck gunner who slaughters Vietnamese civilians to the uptight Marine commander who believes the cause of the war is just, the movie is packed with characters that weave and overlap to paint the dark, dryly humorous but ultimately disturbing picture of war, suffering, and most of all, insanity. It shows that the perfect soldier is the perfect killer, and the perfect killer is inevitably a madman. Perhaps the ultimate black comedy.

431,23 April 2020,krational66,8, How are you twisted?,"""Born to kill"" or ""human nature is good"" are not all of a person's instincts. This is the contradiction of people, and also the two sides of everything in the world.
From entering the boot camp to writing the news in the post-war base area, the clown actually reflects the human nature of the environment. At the beginning of his body, he openly contradicted the drillmaster's words, and even got some recognition. When people around him couldn't teach ""fat pie"" well, he took over the task and kept the other side in good order.
But it is here that the virulence of the story suddenly becomes apparent. The joker didn't stop the new recruits from destroying the party. Instead, he joined the group. To the joker himself, this may be interpreted as an outburst of repression. As an ordinary person, it is perfectly normal to consciously or unconsciously suppress their own nature in the environment, in this particular occasion has a proper release. But after, it will become his nightmare.
That's when fat pie changed. Mumbling, horrible eyes, quick action. But no one expected the final outburst. It is said that the suicide scene was supposed to take place in the dormitory, but kubrick changed it to a toilet. This kind of sudden in enclosed and secluded place can show a chilling effect especially, let alone specially chose white. White, which we have always thought of as the color of solemnity, purity and equality, became the spokesman of extreme violence in kubrick. Think of alex's clockwork orange, the milk he was drinking, and his tightly wrapped coat.
To say that perry was a victim of the pre-war system is not entirely true. The relentless routine required no warmth, but a killing machine, an environment in which everyone was at risk and had no time to look around, and in an era when you couldn't expect redemption from anyone else, perry's initial dullness held everyone back. Perry eventually killed hartman, but it wasn't a revolt. Instead, there was deep confusion. Then he turned the abb's cruel, piercing eyes, and turned them hollow, and blew his head open. This section, kubrick's treatment is clean, transparent, with a cold look on. In contrast to the first half of the recruit training in the lively opening and the irony of mockery.
The recruits went to war, and the joker became one of the war correspondents. There is no war here, but there is much reflection on the Vietnam war, which is especially represented by the clown. All he saw was a farce directed and staged by the United States to prove its ability, but it also had its own contradictions: he wanted to go to the front, and he wanted to win, even though he knew it was impossible, and the ""no way to win."" As he put it, every human being is ""born to kill,"" and even a dull man like perry knows how to pull the trigger to subdue his instructor, whom he never dares to disobey. On the other side is the desire of the heart to do good. I'm not an expert on humans, and I don't know what instinct is, but privately I think we should have both sides, depending on which side overpowers which one at the critical moment.
The final ironic moment came when a group of American soldiers broke through to find the sniper who had fired at them, only to discover that it was a young Vietnamese girl. This is a satire on hegemonic policy and power, and a lament for war - no one has a self any more, just a state's war machine. The joker raises his gun and still ends up with a girl who is better than dead. You can understand it as a victory for the human side in his body, but the sneer of a peary in the toilet in his mind will be his lifelong nightmare. Is the war has long been obliterated by the human nature, by the system seriously distorted under the brainwashed people, even if there was a brief recovery, but how?",

However, FMJ's depiction of the de-humanizing affects of boot camp and later the psychological effects of war on soldiers (similar to Apocalypse Now) set it apart from many other war films, such as Private Ryan. Matthew Modine and Adam Baldwin give excellent performances of de-sensitized GIs, but the true standout of the cast is R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor at Paris Island boot camp. Despite the fact that the film was shot entirely in Britain, Kubrick does a very convincing job of recreating Vietnam there, and all aspects of the film are very realistic and authentic. Also unlike other war films, FMJ doesn't focus on the action and violence (which is still very realistic) and instead relies on complex characters to drive the story. Modine's Pvt. Joker is especially interesting, dying to get into action one minute, but once the bullets start whizzing, scared out of his wits.",

All of the actors deliver great performances with Modine, Ermey and D'Onofrio giving the most mezmorizing. The plot revolves around the Vietnam War and follows recruits through basic training and ultimately into war. During basic training we see the most iconic Drill Sergeant ever to appear on film preparing and molding his recruits for war. He is also trying to weed out the weak for their own good. He finds his target and then unleashes the most horrific psychological and physical torment ever portrayed on film. It is very difficult to view without feeling remorse for the target and respect for the Drill Sergeant. After basic training the plot follows the main character nicknamed Joker which is appropriate. Joker understands the duplicity of man and the absurdity of war. He is sent into war as a journalist but in the end becomes a product of the violence and environment he is submerged in. After the Battle of Hue the platoon marches away from the battlefield singing in unison a song which this viewer believes Kubrick shot in order to convey his commentary on war and violence. The plot is dark, gritty, disturbing, violent and horrifying. This film has so many unforgettable scenes to this day. You'll also hear fans quote famous lines such as, "" Let me see your war face"".

447,30 April 2005,mrgray83,10, Stanley Kubrick takes on the Vietnam War and the duality of man.,"This film will endlessly be compared to Oliver Stone's Platton which was released the year before it. I place Full Metal Jacket above Platoon only marginally. There's something about the way Stanley Kubrick shot that makes it stand above other films based during war times. One scene that sticks out in my mind is the one where the platoon is standing around the dead bodies of two of their fallen comrades in a circle. Kubrick places the camera in the middle of them so that it shoots a low angle shot looking into their faces. He then has them to say a single farewell statement to the fallen soldiers. The beauty in this is that the statements express each soldiers personification. I'm reminded of Citizen Kane, where the entire dialog of that film reflects each person's personification. Every time a word is uttered it reflects their personality and yet the dialog is as believable as they come. What Kubrick did in the scene I just mentioned is a simplified version of that method but it works wonderfully. He proves that it it possible to develop characters with few words and with even fewer actions.",

Kind of like the marines (or should I say ""maggots"") ground down by their offices in to becoming autonomous killing machines, audiences seem to lap up conventional opinion likes drones and fail the think for themselves, instead accepting and echoing what everyone has said, or is, saying. The first half of the movie is far better, and feels utterly disjointed and disconnected from the second. By far the most interesting, intense, and grim part of the second half is the section with the hidden sniper, which did draw me out of my state of boredom. The ending was lazy, and the overall the film fall far short of the sum and its parts, failing to develop a coherent narrative, characters, or message. Heck, had it not dragged so badly in parts, and/or seemed so amateurish in its editing, it might not have been so bad. At least 'Full Metal Jacket' is still watchable, but it's not way near as good as the praise that's been lavished upon it. Had this movie been released today, it would have flopped critically and with audiences. But because its an established 'classic', the emperor with no clothes scenario continues ever onwards. Still, it has its merits, unlike that other alleged classic 'The Deer Hunter' (1/10* in my opinion), which is excruciatingly and embarrassingly awful, and similarly lapped up blindly by the masses.

This movie is not for the faint of heart and makes you glad you didn't join the Corps. R. Lee Ermey is perfect as Gunnery Sargent Hartman, a role he used to fill in real life. Although he has proven himself a capable actor in later roles, this is the role that put him on the map and it remains his signature and best character. Matthew Modine plays the protaganist Pvt. Joker with grace, humor and humility. Versatile actor/God Vincent D'Onofrio plays Pvt. Pyle with such skill that his performance is painful to watch at times. The rest of the supporting cast is great as well. Kubrick takes on the war genre with skill and turns out a true masterpiece. He is probably one of the greatest directors ever.

The war film genre has always been one that Kubrick was very interested in as his earlier work proves and even some of his unfinished projects dealt with it. The first quarter of an hour in ""Full Metal Jacket"" consists of the infamous military training camp with the drill instructor, played by Lee Ermey. This first part of the movie is certainly responsible for ""Full Metal Jacket"" being one of the really big entries in the war genre. Rarely (or never?) was dehumanization put to screen so merciless. The second part plays in Vietnam and it shortly falls behind the beginning. Still, this part is showing very effectively the result of the soldiers' training.

463,29 January 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,10, One of the best War films ever,"Full Metal Jacket is the first Stanley Kubrick film I've ever seen, and boy was it good. It managed to withhold realism during the entire film but not the kind of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down realism. This movie was more about the physcological effects on the soldiers  more then the war itself (i.e. Boot Camp sequence). I found it to be greatly entertaining with no flaws at all. Acting wise you get good stuff from Vincent D, Matthew Moddine, and most of all the Drill Instructor. Plot wise it was good, it wasn't some annoying so called tribute to the men that died there (i.e. We Were Soldiers) it was more of the way they had to fight the war and how you never knew what was around the corner. There was always the sense of duty to your fellow men (i.e. Sniper scene). The film got violent and bloody at times but I felt it wasn't too bad, but it still deserved the R rating. There was some sexual situations in this flick (Vietnamese Prostitute) but it never really showed anything which I'm kind of glad for. There was also some humor in this movie, I laughed occasionally at the drill instructor about how so over the top he was to his trainees it was funny. My favorite line is, ""We are here because there is an American in every Vietnamese waiting to come out!"" I also enjoyed it how Private Joker had ""born to kill"" on his helmet and the peace symbol on his shirt. Overall, a good movie in general that I'd say is one of the best war movies or movies in general (Apocalypse Now Redux was a bit better). I give it a 10/10",

As a movie, it's really boring and hard to sympathize or care about the Marines (but maybe Kubrick wanted that). R. Lee Ermey was fantastic and completely in form, while none of the recruits were interesting enough to pay attention to. (Including Pyle, who was not cut out for the Marines anyway.) The movie had two halves which seemed connected like the bread of a PB&J, but without the enjoyability of a sandwich. But I was a huge fan of the opening scene. I feel like I could be a Army ""barber"" if I needed to. The low-budget aspects were refreshing, but I just didn't like it much.",

The scenes of the fighting in the city is unique because most Viet Nam movies only show the fighting in the jungles and the rice patties and villages. Stanley Kubrick outdid himself with this movie and R.

The first segment focuses on the conflict between the troops' drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and the tall and overweight Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), with Private J.T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine, the film's lead) as a bystander to this.

My only discrepancy with the boot camp part of the film is that we didn't see nearly any interaction of the assisstant DIs' to Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann(played by the great Lee Ermey) or to the GIs themselves. We got brief glimpses of the two assisstant DIs' to Hartmann. Once when Hartmann first appears on the screen and introduces himself to the recruits in the barracks. And next during lights-on reveille at the beginning of the ""...do you believe in the Virgin Mary"" sequence. We didn't even see them during the great scenes shot on the Obstacle Course. duh!! Those assisstant DIs are there for a reason. To assist Hartmann in the day-to-day training of the recruits. To take over when Hartmann has to be away on say family business(it's not stated in the film whether Hartmann has wife & family). The primary DI cannot do everything, that's why he has assistant DIs to aid and abet him. And the company commander, what of him? I went through Army boot camp in the mid 1980s. Hartmann in the film calls himself the senior DI. In the Army the senior DI is the top most DI of the Company which usually consists of four platoons. He, along with the Company commander, administers to all the primary & assisstant DIs' and has hands-on or limited interaction with the recruits. I don't know if this is a goof up on Kubricks part or that the Marines order of command is different and was different during the Vietnam era. Aside from the assisstant DI business, the basic training sequences are very authentic as I can say having been in the service and even though I went through in the 1980s and this film takes place at Parris Island in 1968, the general atmosphere depicted in this film would've been similar in both eras.",

That the ""hero"", ""Joker"", drops his gun when shot at, then mercy kills the sniper that someone else protected him from. And that war is a waste for liberal reasons, not realistic ones.

The second half see's the recruits as fully fledged marines fighting a confusing war in Vietnam. There are a couple of horrific scenes in this movie that are not easily forgotten. The movie is almost 2 hours long but it is easy to get through, as there is always something happening. The actors give their characters real personality and depth.

What makes it so great is not just the brilliant, quotable dialogue containing some of the best, most insulting lines in film history or the great characters and acting but the direction and mise-en- scene. Kubrick shows what a perfectionist he is by filling his wide angle-frame with every possible detail.The camera hardly remains still, as we pan and track continuously between incident. The scenes are long and interspersed with cross-cutting and sudden bursts of reaction shots.

In the army, you are taught to lose yourself to orders, to follow primitive survival instincts, and to shut out your conscience.  The soldiers in Full Metal Jacket go through changes like that.  One of them can't handle the changes and commits murder, then suicide after his graduation from the Marine Corps, before he even leaves the U.S.  This film is hard to truly understand, and I doubt that many people who see it do understand it.

Aside from his early movies with Kirk Douglas, Peter Sellars and Sterling Hayden, the actors he uses generally don't have much of a career afterwards. In using Full Metal Jacket as an example, I just wonder what became of the actors after working with the great man? Now there are those of you who would point to Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and even Leelee Whatever as examples of a career ever growing but, in general, the actors he uses tend to disappear from the mainstream. Matthew Modine was brilliant as Joker in FMJ but has never progressed beyond that. The same goes for Vincent D'Offorino (forgive all the spelling errors) who was not only superb in FMJ but was outstanding in the poor Men In Black and as the killer in that J Lo movie which I watch last night. Cowboy's actor appeared in Jurassic Park and a TV movie about a kidnapping of a boy but I am trying to get my head around this conundrum. If Stanley K was a picky director as people say he was (but a lot of actors disagree with this) and if this pickiness included the actors who would actually play the roles in his films then why have they not become superstars? In FMJ there are some great actors but of the unknown quantity. Joker has nicked out a career for himself but not of the superstar quality. Gunnery Sgt. Hartmann has played the same role over and over. Pile has gone to TV as has Eight Ball. Cowboy has disappeared so has most of the rest of the cast in line with other Kubrick projects. So what is it about the Kubrick movies that kills a promising career?",
