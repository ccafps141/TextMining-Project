0,9 July 2016,dfranzen70,8," Tense, fearless","In The Wages of Fear, four men in a remote South American town have the enviable task of transporting a metric buttload (technical term) of nitroglycerin across mountainous roads in poor condition. It's a taut, superbly suspenseful thriller, guided with a steady hand by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to direct the classic Diabolique in 1955.",/
1,19 November 2006,Galina_movie_fan,9, A gripping action film and a powerful study of failure,"""The Wages of Fear"" was awarded by unanimous verdict the Grand Prix at 1953 Cannes Film Festival where it won over 27 films, some of which were made by Jacques Tati, Alfred Hitchcock, and Luis Buñuel. Cluozot's own screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on four down-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town in an unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highly dangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote well fire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is through jungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men are desperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic or generous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by the managers of oil company because ""if something happens to them, no one would care, they have nobody to worry about them"". Henri-Georges Clouzot's view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he finds a way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperate characters. Thanks to Clouzot's ability to create not only a gripping action film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay for long time in our memory.",r
2,26 May 2018,grantss,9," Enthralling, nail-biting drama","In a remote South American town, four men are hired by an American oil company to transport two truckloads of nitroglycerin to an oil field, to put out a fire. It's a very hazardous task - the nitroglycerin can explode for the slightest reason, the road is treacherous and the journey is a long one. However, the money is very good and their current situation in the town is rather dire - they will do anything to improve their situation. ",e
3,16 July 2005,planktonrules,9, it starts off slow and ends with a bang!,"The first quarter of this movie was not particularly exciting but did set the stage for the rest of the movie. So, if you initially feel bored--STICK WITH IT!!! The plot is so incredibly simple that it seems like it must be a pretty boring picture: an oil company in South America needs to transport shipments of nitroglycerin 300 miles to an oil fire ASAP. However, due to the rotten condition of the roads and equipment, the trip seems like certain death, so they get some hungry out of work guys to do this. It doesn't sound very interesting, I'm sure, but it is. The writing, editing, pacing, acting and direction are PERFECT during this LONG trip. So many times, I found myself tensing up or moving in my seat as each near-death event occurred. The only negative? Well, the ending might be a bit of a letdown for some (though, in hindsight, I liked it despite being a bit of an anticlimax).",v
4,22 November 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""Well, now you've been warned. You're taking your lives in your own hands.""","As a kid watching TV shows and movies in The Fifties, I can't tell you how many I ran across that had nitroglycerine as part of the plot. There were at least a couple of Westerns along with straight dramas, but it didn't seem to matter the genre. A souped up hot rod carrying four quarts of nitro that just happened to be hanging around was used by the main character to destroy ""The Giant Gila Monster"" in a campy 1959 monster flick.",i
5,7 May 2002,DennisLittrell,10, Macho naturalism extraordinaire,"This is an extraordinary movie. From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let's allow a little license. And the title doesn't entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter.",e
6,20 June 2017,Vartiainen,7," Intense, hair-raising experience","The setting is a dead end South American village in the middle of nowhere. Its only distinguishing feature being an American oilfield some distance away from the village. But then an accident causes a fire to spread into the oil and the only way to stop it is to literally blow it out. With nitroglycerin. The only problem being that they don't have the safety equipment needed to transport the nitro from the village. But ""luckily"" such villages have no shortage of men at the end of their ropes, willing to do anything for a final paycheck.",w
7,25 June 2018,lasttimeisaw,9," THE WAGES OF FEAR denotes a hefty import of Clouzot's unrivaled cinematic legacy, that reinvented narrative cinema with its high-octane vicariousness","A 4K-restoration screening in the Shanghai International Film Festival, Clouzot's pièce-de-résistance is a vehement testimonial of his aptitude in orchestrating white-knuckle thrills and chills, meanwhile, it is also a scorching dissection of human's abject fear and cruelty.
 
Set up in the boondocks of Las Piedras, allegedly Venezuela, a posse of foreign deadbeats is vegetating under the blistering sun, jobless and hankering for a plane ticket to leave the purgatory, they are churlish opportunists and rowdy bar brawlers, among them stands the French ladies' man Mario (a sexpot Montand), who toys with the affection of the barmy barmaid Linda (Mme Clouzot in her film debut), and has no qualms about jilting his benevolent Italian roommate Luigi (Lulli, truly the salt-of-the-earth type), to hobnob with his blow-in compatriot, the ex-gangster Jo (Vanel), fancying an easy way out, but the truth is, Jo is also at the end of his rope.

8,2 December 2001,Spleen,10, The kind of film that instantly announces that it's the best of its kind,"This is richer, tenser, more atmospheric, and in all ways a better film than Clouzot's next one, ""Les Diabolique"" - which is saying a lot.  I've never understood why Clouzot isn't more highly regarded.  Indeed, for a long time I simply couldn't believe that he wasn't.",r
9,24 April 2005,dtb,9, The Wages of Fear Vs. Sorcerer,"Georges Arnaud's novel LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR has been filmed twice, by Henri-Georges Clouzot as THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and by William Friedkin as SORCERER (1977). While both films are worth seeing, the earlier version is the one regarded as a classic, and rightly so. Although SORCERER goes into more detail about the political climate and the various misdeeds that led the four desperate protagonists to the South American hellhole where they accept high-paying but life-risking jobs driving nitroglycerin through treacherous terrain, WAGES... distinguishes the men's personalities better, giving the audience more rooting interest in them. Both films have excellent casts, with charismatic leads in Yves Montand (WAGES...) and Roy Scheider (SORCERER), plus WAGES... also provides feminine charm in the form of beguiling Vera Clouzot as the café waitress who loves Montand. Both films have tense action sequences as well, but somehow for all the staging and skillful editing, SORCERER's action scenes seem strangely slow, slogging along in the mud just like the protagonists in their less-than-state-of-the-art trucks. Both versions have enough good things in them to be worth a look, but if you only have the time and resources to check out one of them, it's WAGES... that really pays off!",w
10,20 May 2010,evanston_dad,9," To Fear Is to Be Human, But Not for These Guys","Four unsavory down-and-outs whiling away their hours in a poverty-stricken South American village accept the fool's errand of transporting two truckloads of nitroglycerin across terrible roads to an oil company accident site. Once some preliminary character development is disposed of and the men are on their way, the movie settles into one hell of a nail-biter, sort of a French, 1950s inversion of ""Speed"" -- if they go too fast, or make one false move, they go up in flames.",3
11,6 October 2005,barleeku,10, One of the greatest movies ever made,"This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, ""The Duel"", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.",2
12,11 December 2005,Nazi_Fighter_David,8, A great depiction of greed with the corrupting influence of capitalism disguised as an adventure film...,"In Clouzot, relationships are arenas of conflict: violent, callous, and often destined to sink into a whirlpool of deceit and destructive cruelty ",2
13,31 July 2018,Prismark10,8, The road to danger,"In a shanty town somewhere in Latin America, men come from all over the world to run away and hide. Jobs are scarce and hunger is common. They are free to walkabout but soon realise that the town is one big prison as any of the men lack money to get a ticket to fly out of here.",8
14,14 June 2005,The_Void,9, An intense lesson in suspense,"Henri-Georges Clouzot is probably most famous for his atmospheric mystery drama 'Les Diaboliques', but just as good is this film; Wages of Fear. The film gives a commentary on the things that people will do for money, and it follows a treacherous journey across South America for two two-men teams of truckers transporting nitroglycerine across the continent for an American oil company, on the promise of $2000 when they reach their destination. The men taking this task on know very well what the risks are, but they decide to do it anyway just because they need the dough. Rather than just feeding us this premise, however, the great maestro has opted to make sure that we fully understand the situation that our protagonists are in. The first hour of the film just sees the main characters in their native village, scrimping and slowly killing themselves just to make enough money to live on. These guys have to drink lemonade when they go to their local drinking establishment, and this image of themselves is putting them on the back foot further still, as no one in the town will employ the people that they see as tramps. This back building gives the audience something that the main crux of the story wouldn't have otherwise; and that's understanding from the audience.",6
15,14 March 2020,rooprect,8, Watching a truck drive at 6 mph will have your pulse going 120 bpm,"My title is not an exaggeration. If you thought OJ Simpson's slow speed chase was insane, you need to change the batteries in your pacemaker and check out ""Wages of Fear"". This 1953 French classic tells the story of a bunch of guys who are stuck in a squalid South American village--a sort of Casablaca-esque purgatory--and will do anything to get out, even if it means getting themselves blown sky high. Slow and lazy for the first half (deliberately), the plot eventually reveals itself to be about a suicide mission to haul a zillion gallons of nitroglycerine across 300 miles of harsh terrain that would make the Coyote & Roadrunner take an early retirement.",1

17,13 February 2004,dbdumonteil,10, the road of hell,"A director of several terrific detective movies made in the forties such as ""le corbeau"" (1943), you can consider Henri Georges Clouzot as one of the best French film-makers specialized in suspense. Here, he broaches a new topic for him: the adventure movie with ""le salaire de la peur"" (1953) and this is a stunning movie.",/

19,24 December 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, You haven't seen suspense until you've seen this.,"The name of the game in 'The Wages Of Fear (1953)' is suspense: pure adrenaline-pumping, white-knuckled, edge-of-your-seat suspense. Of course, its hugely extended set-pieces aren't the only thing that make the movie great. There's a surprising amount of solid character work, especially when it comes to one particular character who ends up revealing himself to be the total opposite of what he is initially set up to be. It's a remarkable transition and it showcases some really solid acting skills (you've never seen anyone act scared until you've seen this). After a relatively slow opening that makes a point of portraying the lacklustre employment prospects of the town that our unconventional characters are stuck in, the piece kicks into gear and gets a handful of its players started on a journey that turns every bump in the road, every shift in suspension, every pebble in their path into deadly obstacles. This situation is milked for all it's worth; it grips you and never lets you go, forcing your heart into your mouth more times than you can count. It's soaked in dread, too. The film is definitely one of the - if not the - most suspenseful that I've ever seen. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. Though its first half is fairly slow, nowhere near as compelling as its second and showcases a couple of major characters who display some blatant sexism and racism, the affair is ultimately an affecting and memorable thrill ride. It's one of the best of its kind. 8/10",r
20,5 September 2013,Rodrigo_Amaro,9, One of the best thrillers ever made,"""Le Salaire de le Peur"" (""The Wages of Fear"") is a harrowing journey of four men going down in bumpy roads, miserable places, won over by the most difficult obstacles, a long way performing their jobs transporting a great load of dynamite to be used on a burning oil well. It's a job, it pays well, those guys are the best in it but it's a hard, dangerous and exhausting service that can cost their lives. All the way, almost like descending to hell. This is the road to hell. It's a story about the battle between courage and cowardice and how fear can take over even the bravest of souls. This is Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece along with the equally brilliant ""Les Diaboliques"", both featuring a tension that rises into an endless crescent that never leaves you at ease.",e
21,10 September 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Good, But I'll Still Take 'Sorcerer'","This French film was re-made for English-speaking audiences in 1980 with the title, ""Sorcerer,"" and I've watched that film a half-dozen times. It's excellent and, frankly, a far more interesting movie than this one. ",f
22,13 June 2018,daoldiges,9, Be Very Careful,Clouzot tells a tale of suspense and drama that man finds himself captive to. The thing that creates the drama is very straightforward and easy to grasp (a truck full of nitroglycerine). I think it is that simplicity contrasted with the complex and impossible to understand nature of man that makes this story so compelling and successful. Definitely worth checking out.,_
23,8 March 1999,Mick-81,10, Stunning!! Completely Unique!,"A completely novel plot.  Happened upon this on late night TV about 10 years ago.  Thought I had seen all the best of the classics and then this came on.  ""Where have you been all my life?"" was the overwhelming question.  What an incredibly beautiful and stark movie at the same time.  Absolutely unprecedented.  Everything about it--especially the cinematography (check out the scene with the turnabout for the trucks) is superior.  If you care about plot, allegory, intelligent directing and acting, this is one which is second to none.  Nitroglycerine being transported across the Venezuelan countryside. . .who comes up with this stuff?  The remake (Sorcerer) is decent, but doesn't even come close.  Outstanding flick.",=

25,22 March 2021,christopher-underwood,9, stupendous piece of filmmaking,"It is several years since I last saw this film and have since watched the William Friedkin 1977 remake, Socerer which is good but not as good and the much underrated Thieves' Highway (1949) directed by Jules Dassin, which is even better than the Clouzot film. Take nothing away from this though, it is a stupendous piece of filmmaking. The first hour is a wonderful evocation of a Central American town of much poverty and filled not only with the peasant locals but all and sundry from about the world drawn by the nearby oil wells and associated jobs but left stranded when most of those jobs dried up. There is action and movement in every frame and a tremendous tension is built up before the lorries begin to roll with their dangerous cargo. The individuals we have variously been introduced to are now sat beside each other in a race against time and desperate not to jostle their explosives. Tension, suspense and character exposition aplenty as this beautifully photographed and tightly directed film roars to an unexpected (?) conclusion.",t
26,14 February 2008,FilmCriticLalitRao,10, Action filmmakers have a lot to learn ! ! ! !,"Wages of fear is a big lesson for action filmmakers who use a lot of technology but are largely unable to recreate an element of human sentiment in their action films.In all seriousness they can learn a lot from a great man who was more popular with his Gallic Hitchcock acronym :Henri Georges Clozot.In 1953,when he made this film,he did not even have one tenth of the kind of technology which is employed by today's technology savvy filmmakers.Wages of fear is a great film with existentialist undertones whose first half is a bitter depiction of nothingness for its four protagonists who languish in hot South America. It is in second half of the film that we witness a flurry of meaningful action.It is quite odd but due to heavy masculine presence Clouzot decided not to have much room for female characters except for a sensual role played by his wife Vera Clouzot.It is a true fact that before this film human misery,desperation and hopelessness were never shown in such vivid details as shown in this film.The sadness depicted in Wages of fear can still be felt in our contemporary world.",_
27,16 July 2011,KnightsofNi11,9, Masterful suspense,"If you want to talk about a film that is exceptionally dark for its time then look no further than The Wages of Fear. The film follows four men in a desolate South American village who are strapped for cash and will do almost anything. They agree to transport a shipment of nitroglycerin by truck across the rugged terrain of Central America. The catch is that nitroglycerin is an extremely dangerous substance that has to be handled with extreme caution. Thus one bad bump in the road could be the end for these men. Along the way then encounter all sorts of obstacles, including each other. But they have no choice but to press on, desperate for the money that awaits them at the end of their treacherous journey.",u
28,7 March 2011,rmax304823,8, Riveting And Exotic.,"Four men, including Yves Montand and Peter van Eyck, are desperately down and out in an unnamed South American country. They're hired by an oil company to drive two massive trucks through rough and dangerous territory with loads of unstable nitroglycerin. The two trucks depart with sirens screaming, warning away the town's residents just in case the nitro decides it doesn't want to wait to reach its destination.",r
29,28 January 2010,Hitchcoc,10, A Bit Long but Ultimately Riveting!,"After wading through the early exposition, I settled into this film and found it to be about as tense as any I've seen. The people in the small village are literally in prison. We even see a shot of the shadows off a trellis superimposing prisoner's stripes on the people who pretty much wait for something to happen. When a job opportunity arises when an oil company needs men to drive truckloads of nitroglycerin to a fire site, they arise from their sloth and head into an encounter with hell. This is so much more than a simple adventure. We begin to be fascinated by each of the characters as well as the peripheral ones. We root for them and die with them. When one of them turns cowardly, we understand the kinds of forces that are working on him. When one of the trucks eventually blows up, it appears as a flash and little puff. How delicate are our lives. There are different kinds of escape and these people embrace their chance. The wages of fear are 2000 dollars, not much for a man's life, but creates adventure. The performances are outstanding as well as the pacing and first impressions don't mean much when people are all on the same plane.",v
30,27 June 2021,briancham1994,9, Anxiety inducing,"This film is a masterpiece of direction. Starting out in a poverty-stricken South American town, the goings on shows the dereliction of society in a way that avoids sensationalism. The characters are all distinctly set up as they are employed by the oil company for a suicidal and dangerous mission, their desperation exploited. What follows is the most anxiety inducing film I have ever seen. Every detail of the truck drivers' journey, obstacles and dangers are depicted with excruciating vividness, along with their attitudes toward the incredible risk - from terror to determination to bravado. Their ultimate fate shows both the strength of the human spirit in the face of challenge but also the inescapable destiny of those who are treated as expendable.",
31,17 June 2021,eddie_baggins,9, One of the most taut and tension riddled thrillers of all time,"Adapted from Georges Arnaud's famous novel (a novel that was also successfully adapted in the little seen but worth checking out 1977 William Friedkin feature Sorcerer), Henri-Georges Clouzot's esteemed and ageless thriller is a benchmark in cinematic tension building and one of the great films of the era in which it was released.",
32,10 October 2010,PWNYCNY,10, Amazing movie.,"The movie starts off slowly but then rapidly accelerates. Yves Montand is brilliant in the lead role. Given his background as a singer, his performance is almost uncanny. The story is strong, compelling, simple yet profound. Men risk their lives and nobody really cares. Men reduced to scrounging will do just about anything to make a buck. This movie is about every deck hand, lineman, truck driver, construction worker and blue collar worker on this planet who makes a living by doing the hard, dirty, dangerous work that society still demands. Somebody has to do it. Four thousand years ago workers were hauling and lifting huge blocks of stones to build temples; the same work is being done today. These workers are taken for granted, forgotten until they are needed and then they are heroes, for the moment. This movie is a tribute to the courage of those whose work puts them in harms' way. This movie should be recognized for what it is: a director's personal statement about the condition of mankind, divided along class lines, the exploiters and the exploited, the indifference to human life in the quest for profits and how there are always those who come forward and do the heavy lifting, even when they know that they may not survive.",

35,21 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,10, Masterpiece,"Think that space invaders, aliens, dinosaurs, cyborgs, or monsters of one sort or another are needed to make a film a thriller? If so, I recommend you watch Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1953 black and white masterpiece The Wages Of Fear (La Salaire De La Peur), about the evils of runaway greed and capitalism, all in the name of oil. It'll change your mind. Over half a century later, and in light of the current American war folly for oil in the Middle East, the film is remarkably resonant and cogent- even down to the loudest criticism of American profiteering and imperialism coming from.the French. However, when they're right they're right. If one wants to know why 'Ugly Americans' are loathed in the Middle East it's not because of the rhetorical claptrap about a 'clash of cultures', nor Evil vs. Freedom, but because of decades of exploitation where a select group of mainly American corporations, unanswerable to anyone, get rich off of exploiting the masses where they swoop in. It happened in the Middle East, as well as in Latin America- perhaps the only place in the world where anti-Americanism (really anti-American corporate imperialism) rivals or surpasses that in the Middle East. As a minor character in the film rails, 'Wherever there's oil, there's always Americans.' But, if all this film were was an anti-American screed it would still not grip viewers today. What it is, is a great portrait of the extremes that human beings- OK, men, will go to just to have things, and to what lengths their machismo will drive them.",
36,5 April 2005,Bologna King,9, Perfect Ending to Brilliant Film,I intend to deal explicitly with the ending of this film. Be warned.,
37,27 February 2004,writers_reign,10, C.O.D. (Cash On Death),"In the Forum des Images in Paris in addition to the regular screenings and irregular previews, lectures, etc the movie buff can also enter a room containing about two dozen monitors, each supplied with its own keyboard and armchair with built-in speakers. Here the buff can choose to view one of the more than 6,500 titles available. There is, however, one proviso; every title, be it silent or sound, black and white or color, documentary of feature is either set in or has a strong connection with Paris. Selection is up to the individual, theoretically it can be alphabetical if one had the time to scan 6,500 titles. The usual method is to key in the name of an actor, director, writer and/or a genre. When one keys in Yves Montand and qualifies further by adding 'fiction' there is a choice of around ten titles and these include Le Salaire de la puer, which by now everyone knows takes place in South America despite being shot in the South of France. When I brought this to the attention of a staffer it was explained to me that Mario - the character played by Montand - carries around a ticket for the Paris metro. Viewers of this classic tend to carry around for years afterward a mental phial of nitro, such is the impact it has on initial screening. It is impossible to praise too highly the taut script and direction, the just-right acting of slow-starter Montand (after a few brief appearances mostly as himself in pot-boilers he took a beating in his first starring role and concentrated on filling Domestic and International stages with his singing. Even after this triumph it was almost a further decade before he really got into his acting stride via Compartiment tuer. In their wisdom both video and DVD distributors often pair this with the same director's equally definitive 'Les Diaboliques featuring Mrs Montand, Simone Signoret (and again the director's other half, Vera Clouzot). This is an unbeatable parlay and should be snapped up by anyone with even a peripheral interest in what makes good movies. As for this. Magnifique! 10/10",

Henri-Georges Clouzot's stark, pessimistic adventure contains enough pure suspense to pull any viewer to the edge of a seat, but until 1992 the film had never been seen (at least in this country) in its uncut, original form. Before it was first released, scissor-happy censors trimmed nearly 45-minutes of footage (mostly from the early, introductory scenes) to help soften the strong anti-American subtext, but even in the truncated version the bias must have been obvious. American oil (and the need to keep it flowing) is still the monument under which every character is ultimately buried, a point made explicit when one driver is crushed beneath his truck in a pool of crude. The director's restored cut is even is incredibly downbeat (note the vultures hovering over every other scene), but the film still packs a thrilling, unforgettable punch.",
39,27 April 2001,Stu-42,5," Disappointing, might have been great 50 Yrs ago","This movie was billed as being possibly the most intense, suspenseful film of all time. Even though I came open minded ready to enjoy it, I found it tough to sit through with only a few scenes with short moments of suspense. There are a few explanations that could cause this discrepancy: The difference between seeing it 50 years after it was made, the unlikability of any of the characters, the impossibly long first half with not much of interest, the terrible, almost laughable performance of the oil company operator, the implausible happenings along the way to the fire or the ridiculous ending. In any event, one can only guess at what this might have been like when it first came out. Yes, there were some interesting underlying ideas and some scenes that held your attention, but at this point I would go against my usual feeling and say that there needs to be a remake and since there is one, I will now try to find Sorcerer to see what that's like.",
40,4 September 2016,Tweekums,8, The Wages of Fear,Opening in a remote South American town we are introduced to a group of expats who have gone there seeking their fortunes but ended up broke; what little work they find might be enough to feed them but it won't get them out of town let alone back home. The town supplies workers for the American Southern Oil Company (SOC). When there is an explosion at one of SOC's wells it is determined that the only way to put the fire out will be to blow it out using nitro-glycerine the problem is they don't have specialised transporters and the well is a few hundred miles away over rough roads. Four men are required to drive two trucks there; the slightest bump could cause an explosion that would mean instant death but the $2000 per man would pay for them to get home.,

The director uses one standard shot, head-on of each truck crew through their windshields with alternating close ups of faces as they talk and we learn more about them and just when we have had enough 'getting to know you' some crisis erupts: an impassable turn, a boulder blocking the road, and finally the pool of oil.",

47,12 February 2005,loydmooney,7, forget the suspense,"Clouzot was a very strange director. Even he admitted that he used suspense as a device to examine his characters. Only Diabolique seems to have any real suspense. The nitro in this film is used the same as the letters in The Raven and the murder in Quai Des Ouvres: he is up to his old tricks of immersing you in the rot and smell of existence: buzzards, spitting, smoke coming disgustingly out of noses during a kind of Russian Roulette, etc. Only one other film do you feel the sheer heat of a place as much as this: Stray Dog. Nineteen Fifty three was more or less around the apotheosis of Existentialism, And Clouzot hardly needed a bedside copy of Being and Nothingness for his handbook. This film, because of it's length, has the greatest wealth of his bodily references.... Even down to Vera Clouzot's underarm hair: you see a flash of it as she raises her hands in a dance turn with Folco Lulli, and how often do you ever see a woman's underarms not shaved, even in French Films, much less anywhere else. For those who found the film suspenseful, fine. I didn't. Not at its heart, anyway. That would be like saying Polanski's Repulsion was suspenseful. Both are films of immersion, descents into madness and chaos. And now here is a spoiler: if you do not want to know how the movie ends, bye bye. The end is ludicrous. But then so are most in his films. None of them hold up very well, with the possible exception of the the end of Diabolique: its mystical take kind of works. However, the mystical take of Montand's death here is simply stupid. If he has to go off the road and down a cliff, let the truck he is driving simply suffer a sudden blowout, or differential fatigue, some kind of mechanical malfunction...not playing with it on the road like a three year old......and even then, certainly not have Vera Clouzot know telepathically that he has gone over to his death. But there are so many fine touches in this movie, you watch it for them. Too bad it could not have been a much more disciplined effort, but what it there makes most movies today seem tired and trite. Also, for those interested, notice the striking similarity of the opening images of this film, and the first shots of The Wild Bunch. Just too bad he could not have ended the film on such a pure note. But bravo anyway, great treat, wonderful film.",
48,9 July 2001,inframan,10, Truly magnificent!!!,"I too believe that this is one of the greatest films of all time, ranking right up there with Citizen Kane & Les Enfants du Paradis & Grapes of Wrath. It has the majestic sweep & the scope & the deep sense of human tragedy that those films have. I don't feel it's a ""suspense"" film, it's much much more. It's a metaphor of the struggle to survive that is shared by every human being ever born. I have no problems with the symbolic images & acts that open & close the film: the cockroach ""dance"" & Mario's last drive. They too are metaphors which would be digestable if such metaphors weren't so out of favor these days. Particularly, the ending: who doesn't believe deep down that when one struggles to keep death at arm's length, one has a chance to postpone it, but if you forget & celebrate your luck, chances are your time has arrived. If I have any problems at all, it's with the casting of Vera Clouzot. She's too immaculately refined & happy-go-lucky for someone in her situation. She certainly doesn't seem to mind the trip up the stairs with the bozo boss. This was the one thing about Wages of Fear that made me think of Hollywood (particularly John Ford). But everything else about this film is so brilliant that its small flaws are easily forgiven. By the way, in the last 30+ years I have seen versions with both the first 40 minutes & the last 15 excised! Abominable!! God bless those responsible for making this version available.",
49,12 May 2015,Theo Robertson,6, I Felt An Explosion Of Disappointment,Considered to be a classic of French cinema and currently ranked at number 165 on the IMDb Top 250 I went in to THE WAGES OF FEAR with very high expectations especially since the version I was going to watch was the director's cut running at almost two and a half hours . After seeing it I have to admit I felt rather disappointed by it ,
50,7 November 2015,EdgarST,6, Fear,"«Le salaire de la peur» has not aged very well. In spite of the fact that the solid performances by the four leading actors and Armand Thirard's cinematography remain effective (and in spite of the criteria of the Criterion company, which has become some sort of ""film Bible"" for many unbaptized in the immensely wide scope of world cinema), the flaws are more evident now. To start with the 39- minute first act is quite hard to follow, especially for a Spanish- speaking person like me: in the novel the action takes place in Guatemala (Central America) , but where does this movie take place, where is this place called Las Piedras that by 1953 still has creoles talking with Spaniards' accents, where indigenous dress as Andean people or undress like Amazonian tribes? The closest town to Las Piedras seems to be Caracas (capital of Venezuela, South America) as seen in a sign of plane fares, or it could be Tegucigalpa (capital of Honduras, Central America) according to a dialog: you take your pick. All this mishmash is possible, yes, but at least I could not deal with the endless parade of offensive ""Latino"" stereotypes, from the taxi driver who stops his car precisely in the middle of a mud pond, the barefoot venal black immigrant officer or the sweaty and greasy owner of ""El Corsario Negro"". Then take act two, which as Georges Arnaud's novel is also the weakest dramatic section of the movie, since the characters have been well established in the first act. So this is mainly a block of action sequences in which the nitroglycerin-loaded trucks go from one obstacle to the next, to reach their goal, the oil field in flames. Admittedly a couple of the pieces are real gems (the long sequence of the rotten-wood platform or the solution to take a huge boulder out of the road), but it is just that, a chain of obstructions and how to deal with them. The last act centers on the persistence of the two surviving truck drivers, leading to a surprise ending that seems too moralistic after everything we have seen before, when all the characters we have seen since the beginning deserve a similar conclusion. As for the critic of American companies in foreign lands, today that is no news and it can also be said of European and Asian enterprises in those alien territories, as well as the local companies: they all give similar ruthless treatment to workers (and the land itself). This is the kind of commercial ""macho movie"" that asks for a remake among the action film crowd. There have been a couple of those and a few imitations, the more remarkable being William Friedkin's «Sorcerer» (1977), in which he wisely reduced the running time from the original 142 minutes to 121.",

54,13 April 2010,robert-temple-1,6, Intensely gruelling and harrowing film about people one doesn't care about,"This film has a huge reputation, larger than it deserves, in fact. First of all, everyone likes and admires Clouzot as a director. Secondly, there has been a lot of affectionate admiration for Yves Montand over the decades. So the reverence shown to this particular film has been tinted with the rosy view of retrospection and skewed in favour of 'good old Clouzot' and 'good old Yves'. But the performance of the young Yves Montand in this film, while good, is not in any way remarkable, and the part could have been played just as well by any fifty other actors. In other words, the reputation of this film has been artificially inflated. In actuality, it is far inferior to many of Clouzot's other films. It is difficult to know why Clouzot even wanted to make such a strange and stressful film. It is extremely painful to watch, for almost every minute of screen time, and it is never enjoyable. Surely we all have enough problems in our lives without having to worry about people being blown up by nitroglycerine which they are driving in large trucks on pot-holed roads in a desert. Yes, the film has various creative shots and sequences: the shot where Montand jumps down onto some loose soil and it sprays all over the camera, the sequence of the waltz scene in the seedy bar near the end, especially as intercut with Montand's joyous driving antics. Those things are all touches of the master. But  and I repeat, but  but. WHY?? Once again I raise the question which I raise in numerous reviews of films by many directors who make needlessly unpleasant films: why would the director want to make this film? Surely some more worthwhile subject and project could have been chosen for that year of Clouzot's life. Why do directors time and again, apparently for reasons of vanity or perverted notions, make really disgusting films? Everyone in this film except for the pathetic simple-minded maid in the seedy bar is horrible and disgusting, lacking in any positive qualities of any kind. Not one has an iota of compassion or concern for anyone but himself, and most of them are greedy, selfish, violent, criminal, and utterly revolting. A great subject for a movie, then! The film is set in a kind of 'nowhere', which might be Mexico or might be Venezuela, in any case, a country where the rapacious American oil company called 'Southern Oil Company' drills for oil at the cost of the lives of the locals, many of whom are killed in the most horrible accidents, and no one gives a damn. The setting is so grim and forlorn that it is a real wrist-slasher of an experience just to see it on film. Everybody is starving, everybody is penniless, everybody is exploited, everybody is miserable. What a cheerful experience! There is a very touching scene in the film between Montand and a friend who is dying in his arms, when the dying man suddenly reminisces about Paris. For the entire film, Montand has pathetically saved and frequently shown to his friends the Paris Metro ticket from Pigalle station which he used the last time he left Paris. Now, the friend suddenly starts talking about the Rue Galande, a charming little street near the ancient churches of St. Severin and St. Julien le Pauvre. (Rue Galande is also very near the street where Elliott Paul lived, which he described in his famous novel 'The Last Time I Saw Paris', and its sequel.) Montand says he knows the street very well also, so together they discuss the various shops they knew, and they try to remember whether the fence is still there which had obstructed the view of what was inside. The friend says he never could see what was behind the fence. Montand says there was nothing behind it. The friend is distraught, and, looking into Eternity, says: 'So there is just nothing?' and dies. Certainly the director's attention to detail of the transportation of a volatile explosive in impossible conditions by men desperate for money creates fantastic tension, and is gruelling in the extreme. But I don't see why we should give a damn whether those men are blown up or not, frankly, as none of them is sympathetic, and it is difficult to see what difference it makes to the Greater Scheme of Things whether Peter van Eyck and Yves Montand make it or not in their life of hell in that place of hell. To call this film 'a bit of a downer' is a mammoth understatement. There are better ways to spend a couple of hours than watching this.",

Help yourself by watching it, a white and black fantasy over a stunning mountain.

61,22 September 1998,stavneg,10, Suspense with subtly powerful social comment. A masterpiece of cinematic craft.,"This film runs along the traditional template of any story - a beginning, which unhurriedly and deliberately sets the scene, a middle section that carries the plotline, and a brief ending that resolves everything to no one's satisfaction. The beginning paints a picture of a world unimaginable to anyone from a developed country, of corruption, poverty, and oppression. It simultaneously describes the main characters - a bunch of immigrants who have strayed to this miserable little town, and for whom there is little chance of escape from the baking heat and unemployment. There is Mario, the happy-go-lucky scrounger, Luigi, his hard-working Italian pal, the comically tyranical tavern owner, his much abused maid, and Jo, the suave and dangerous French gangster. Homosexuality, racism, and the oppression of women figure prominently, but are never commented upon directly, as various prison motifs are evident in the lighting and set construction. Suddnly there is a change - a way out for a 'lucky' four of the deadbeats. There has been an explosion at an oil well on the other side of the mountain. The oil company needs to put out the fire with explosives, which are stored in the town. But its nitro-glycerine, and there is no time to get specially-fitted trucks to carry it over the rough mountains roads. Rather than risk their own employees, the oil company offers a large reward to four volunteers. Cue the action as first the men compete for the places on the two trucks, then as the winners embark on their terrifying journey, where every bump could spell instant death. On the journey their true characters emerge. One, Jo, is broken by the ordeal, but is eventually redeemed. 'How exciting could a simple road trip be?' you might ask, but the one and a half hour screen journey is petrifyingly spellbinding. Fate seems to be stacked against these bedraggled heroes, but it is their ingenuity, effort and bravery which captures our hearts. I won't reveal the details or the ending, which is tragic and some say its only flaw. It's in black and white, and mostly in French, but it will never be old-fashioned. The best film I have ever seen - and I've seen a few.",

The other reason I stuck it out to the end was I was curious how this could get a four star review from Turner Classic Movies. The story line itself makes little sense, and the adventures these men have a ridiculous contrivances. The first forty five minutes of the movie are just there to establish that these are bunch of down and out men who would do anything for money; a lot of the interactions between the characters are silly, and add little or nothing to this story. After that they have a series of adventures that make little or no sense. Things that no one would do, things that are not possible, and things that would be just plain stupid to do.

65,5 February 2015,jboothmillard,8, The Wages of Fear,"The book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die has been a great source for finding films I otherwise would never have heard of, and possibly would not consider seeing, and this was a French/Italian foreign language film rated well by critics I hoped would be a worthy entry. Basically in a desolate South American village several men are trying to find a way out, their main problem is that they are essentially marooned there, there is only one road out of town, it goes as far as the oil drilling rigs, but they are nowhere near having the money needed for a flight, and there are no jobs to be had, so each day just blends into the next. But then change comes when a major fire breaks out at the oil drilling site, the oil company needs to find and hire men who are willing to take a risky journey to transport highly volatile nitroglycerine across rough terrain and virtually abandoned bumpy roads, four men are hired to drive two trucks: sarcastic Corsican playboy Mario (Yves Montand) and French aging ex-gangster Jo (Charles Vanel), and Mario's Dutch roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and quiet but intense salt mine worker Bimba (Peter van Eyck). On the journey the trucks encounter many perils, not just the bumpy road and having to drive at a steady pace to not explode, but tight roads to turn, unstable bridges and structures to cross and reverse on, large rocks in the middle of the road that they need to blow up to remove, and when one of the trucks explodes it leaves behind a deep puddle of oil to trawl through. The four men accepted the job because of the money being offered was more than enough to allow them to leave once the job is done, but with the job being so dangerous few people expected them to return alive, in the end Luigi and Bimba were killed with their truck exploding, Jo dies from severe injuries, and Mario is the only driver to make it safely to the oil drilling site to assist the fire, he is ecstatic to drive away in the empty truck and return to devoted lover Linda (Véra Clouzot), but careless driving means it is a shocking and fateful end for Mario. Also starring William Tubbs as Bill O'Brien and Darío Moreno as Hernandez. The film starts very slow as you are introduced to the characters and seeing the terrible lives the live in the village, but once they accept the dangerous job and get driving you are gripped, you are compelled knowing that any minute something could go wrong on the three hundred mile journey and their cargo could blow up, they sweat and shudder all the way, and obstacles put in their way keeps the tension going, it is a fantastically suspenseful and nil-biting adventure thriller film.

There's a scene where the characters have to get a rock out of the road in front of them that is so tense I was literally white-knuckled. This film will inevitably be compared to the remake by William Friedkin, Sorceror. That is an inferior film, if only because it has a very clunky sets of character introductions and relies too much on the physical mechanics of the journey and not the characters. The Wages of Fear is all about the characters and the situations that arise due to their greed and hubris. Perhaps the most chilling scene of all is a decision Yves Montand's character has to make while driving across an oily pond. It's scene like that one that make the film great.

Perhaps I don't like to stretch myself as much as I should. I approached this film with trepidation. From the first second of this film I was absolutely absorbed into the world it created - a world dominated by desperate men from disparate cultures trapped in a sordid backwater. Without money, passports and marketable skills, they spend their time indulging in drunkenness, indifferent sex and mindless violence until they are offered an escape through a trial by fire, survivor takes all and the chances of survival are slim indeed. Wages of Fear provides the ultimate in suspense, character development, physical and psychological action. It is a visual masterpiece, not because of the beauty it displays but because of the complexity, depth and darkness of the world it portrays. It reminds me so much of Treasure of the Sierra Madres, an examination of courage and character under the most dire circumstances. A wonderful feature of this film -- there is absolutely no background music which increases the reality and suspense because the viewer cannot anticipate the action. You get to sweat and tremble along with the characters as they drive over washboard roads and crumbling mountain paths. The acting is superb, and this from a person who has in the past dismissed Yves Montand as a frivolous song and dance man. Highly recommended.",

Oh yes, it wasn't the Ray Harryhausen sea monsters of stop motion, nor was it aliens from outer space or Nosferatu or more sinister, the blonde Hitchcock Femme Fatale. No, it was much more real than that. Even a valuable lesson perhaps. Don't, and I repeat, don't carry Nitroglycerine around. You might get hurt. No film portrays being careful with dangerous substances quite so well as this film, because it give you the feeling that YOU are handling it. And that's the unsettling thing about it. Like James Coburn said in Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful Of Dynamite"", ""if this falls, you'd have to alter the maps"". Precisely so with the substance in question. Nitroglycerine. Who would be crazy enough to handle that. That's precisely what our film's protagonists may have thought had the pay not have been so big as to persuade them. On top of the unbearable, nail-biting, teddy bear clenching suspense, this film is one fantastic character study. Character revelations, weaknesses and heroics all come into play as the Nitro changes all their lives.",
79,4 October 1999,Flinx-2,10, A gripping classic. Worth searching for.,"This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It draws you in with compelling, three-dimensional characters, then places them in a situation that imperils both their lives and sanity. And it takes the audience along for the ride.  Clouzet's direction is masterful and all of the performances are right on. The setup is fairly simple: four men with nothing to lose but their lives agree to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerine through some of the most desolate and dying backroads that the unnamed third world setting has to offer.  Their obstacles each provide a tense scene that has you on the edge of your seat, giving seven or eight scenes more intense than any in your average thriller. From what I've read, this film was butchered upon initial US release due to its harsh portrayal of third world interests, so beware the chopped up version. A 10 out of 10 (Which I don't give out very often)",

81,4 April 2015,RossRivero99,10, One of the best foreign language movies I have ever seen,"Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear (1953) is one of the most suspenseful and nail biting thrillers I have ever seen. The film tells the story of 4 men who go on a suicidal mission have to make nitroglycerin shipments within 300 miles on a hazardous and dangerous road (and as you would expect there were some deaths but I won't give it away for people who didn't see the film yet) which the movie is so suspenseful I think this is also another movie on the suspenseful films that Hitchcock wouldn't have the guts to make list along with Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal (1957), Clouzot's direction of this movie completely changed my perception of cinema forever which for me the most important thing for a movie is not only the story but also the emotions of the characters in a certain genre of film. Yves Montand gave a breakout performance in his first dramatic role in this movie as the lead character Mario who has no job but is just a hobo until he gets hired on the life or death mission along with Jo (played by Charles Vanel), Bimba (played by Peter Van Eyck), and Luigi (played by Folco Lulli) who have no jobs in a poor South American village and unfortunately this movie was snubbed in a lot of categories for which it could have been nominated for an Oscar (and if the film were made today it would have been nominated for some Oscars and possibly win a few).

He seems ridiculous from the first second he enters the scene . After a while he turns out to be whiny and full of fear , but because the whole build up of the character was so not believable , i did not care at all about his fate or supposed transformation. Of course you can say he should be presented as ridiculous but if that is the case why bother making him such a big character?

88,10 March 2014,dwpollar,7, Tense French film about an American Oil company's hiring...,"1st watched 3/9/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir:Henri-Georges Clouzot): Tense French film about an American Oil company's hiring of four gentlemen from a poor village in what I think was Central America to complete a monumental task of hauling explosives 100 miles on dirt roads to help the SOC(Southern Oil Company). The movie starts with the arrival of one mafia-like gentlemen named Jo into the small village looking for an opportunity to make money. After seeing another Frenchman named Maury, looking like he was doing pretty well for himself, he sticks around. The other two future drivers are locals who have learned that you have to work for the American company to survive , but one named Luigi decides to take this new job after contracting concrete in his lungs from his current position. The director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, sets the stage by introducing the characters and the area for at least 30 minutes before introducing the main plot line. The explosives that they are carrying in the trucks are very brittle and this is shown to the interviewees so that they understand the danger involved. These folks though, have nothing to lose --- and so they pursue the possibility of $2000 per person without a whole lot of reservation. The hazards that await are mostly natural ones like a giant boulder blocking the road, and the sickness of one of the drivers but definitely hard to deal with. The movie is not really about the trek, but rather how the characters handle their quest. Character's true identities are revealed as they battle the road and themselves. Because this is a foreign production there is an air on un-certainty about what is going to happen and for me creates some extra suspense. The performances are worthwhile and the direction is almost flawless with my only real issues being the quick ending and quick demise of one of the trucks. This is kind of an anti-Speed movie that is almost as thrilling as the before-mentioned American movie. At 2 and 1/2 hours long it never gets boring...an excellent movie overall and a brilliant piece of filmmaking by the French director.",

""Salaire de la Peur"" is one of his 3 famous masterpieces (other two are ""Quai des Orfèvres"" and ""Les Diaboliques"") all of which had an enormous influence on world cinematography. One of Empire's editors Ian Nathan had put ""Salair de la Peur"" among top 10 greatest actions/adventures of all time. His top 100 list might be controversial, but this is something where I totally agree with him. Clouzot's film became a milestone in many genres, among which are thrillers, actions, adventures and dramas. But even these 4 genres are not enough to describe the depressing and thrilling atmosphere of ""Salair de la Peur"". If your synonym for adventure is Indiana Jones, then you'll be surprised by the dark philosophy of this film (even though I love Indy myself). Indeed, the best word to describe this movie is noir.

99,1 January 2009,ackstasis,8," ""To get that bonus, they'll carry the entire charge on their backs""","For a brief period during the 1950s, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot captured the mantle of ""The Master of Suspense"" from Alfred Hitchcock, owing mostly to his two most recognised thrillers, 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' It's a difficult title to live up to, but Clouzot knows precisely what he's doing, even if he seems to lack Hitchcock's distinctive sense of showmanship. What I've always loved about cinema is its ability to manipulate reality, to elicit genuine emotions from situations that, in real life, would seem mundane, or even ridiculous. An example I've used before, I believe, is Tarkovsky's 'Stalker (1979),' in which a peaceful and benign forest is inexplicably transformed into an environment of intense mystery and foreboding. Now consider 'The Wages of Fear,' when actor Peter van Eyck funnels what is probably water into a drilled hole in the rock. There's zero suspense in this simple act of pouring. However, taken within the context of the story, this water suddenly becomes nitroglycerine, and I got sore fingers from gripping the chair so tightly.",

I love the shot near the beginning of the film where Linda is crawling across the floor to Mario, soft light from outside playing across her body, breasts partially exposed; he fondles her hair sorta petting her like a dog or cat. A perfectly crafted short little sequence that explains their relationship and perhaps Mario's attitude toward women in general better than pages of prose ever could. But the movie is really about the struggle for existence in an unforgiving world where any display of cowardice costs your claim to manhood, and as such, the action and suspense scenes are among the most finely crafted in cinema history.

The first hour does a splendid job of establishing characters, their personalities, and the dynamics between them. With roughly ninety minutes left thereafter it may not seem like a lot, from the outside looking in, to tell the remainder of the story, but as it turns out those ninety minutes are nearly overwhelming. 'Le salaire de la peur,' or 'The wages of fear,' so ably builds tension and suspense with each passing moment that it's impossible not to be on edge. It's hard not to cringe with every slight divot in the road and bounce of the wheel, and when more substantial obstacles and problem-solving enters the equation, the picture becomes a masterwork of thrills that puts Alfred Hitchcock to shame. Factor in how the extreme danger and pervasive terror of the journey reveals more about the characters, and the result is simply a must-see classic, bar none.",

When I saw Wages of Fear years ago it made me realize that there were French directors who actually were capable of making good dramas.  A straightforward drama, the movie is engrossing throughout and the second half is absolutely gripping. This is a French movie without people sitting around talking about the meaning of it all like college sophomores, and it combines a grittiness with a sense of humanity that makes it a remarkably intelligent film.  I don't consider it a great movie - I gave it a 7 - but it's a very good movie, well worth watching.

120,19 July 2017,thejcowboy22,5, Kill the Messenger is putting it mildly.,"When I think of an Yves Montand Movie it usually takes place in a cosmopolitan city surrounded by handsomely dressed people and exquisite sets. I picture the dashing Frenchman Yves with a cigarette, fancy suit, neat, polished surrounded by lovely starlets singing a song or two Yves mostly plays roles that fit a man of importance, a man of distinction, for example Yves would depict a Doctor, executive, movie mogul, college professor, newscaster, Military Captain or a Baron. Yves represents elegance in Foreign and American films. Wages of Fear is down right tense, disturbing, dirty and gritty from start to finish. Our story starts in a rural village somewhere in a remote section of South America. It's not quite clear where this place is which has me intrigued from the start.The towns people spoke French which I felt a gaze of wonderment. In addition to the remoteness of this town the only way back to France is the airport because the roads are dangerous. Passing deserted jungles and deserts along the way. Narrow roads protruding over cliffs make any journey heart wrenching to say the least.Our picture starts with four men. Frenchman Mario (Yves Montand) and his friend Jo (Charles Vanel). A German fellow named Bimba (Peter Van Eyck) and Italian Luigi (Folco Lulli). Work is hard to come by because this remote town is run by a corrupt American corporation SOC Southern Oil Corporation.This company is suspected of unethical practices, mainly exploiting worker and taking the law into it's own hands. The townspeople except the hardships anyway. Montand plays a gruff Corsican playboy who abuses his girlfriend Linda (Vera Clouzot) with contempt. His buddy Jo was an ex-con who feels stranded in this out of the way town. Bimba is an intense quiet man who worked in salt mine for six long years. Mario's close friend is Jo who talks about the old days when they both lived in Paris. Luigi has developed serious health issues due to collecting cement dust in his lungs. Meanwhile Jo feeling stranded is quick tempered with the other cantina regulars. Meanwhile a massive fire breaks out at an SOC Oil field some 500 kilometers from their town. Non unionized SOC truck drivers are needed to deliver nitroglycerin in two large barrels over rough terrain to quash the out of control flames. A perfect example of the company exploiting the locals into a dangerous situation for employment. The company institutes a lottery for applicants and The four men I mentioned previously where picked. A fellow by the name of Smerloff was originally picked but doesn't show so Jo takes that spot. A few years earlier Jo did some curry-favor with the American SOC foreman Bill O'Brien (William Tubbs) when they delivered illegal booze on the side. Jo shows signs of getting weak possibly local malaria and O'Brien partners him with Mario on this hazardous journey into the wilderness. The other two will drive the second truck 30 minutes behind Mario. Luigi and Bimba suspect that Jo murdered Smerloff to take that spot. So far this flick was only in French with English sub-titled and then the movie inverts to a brief English portion of the film as the SOC foreman Bill O'Brien lays down the plan and explains the nature of this dangerous mission to Non union four carrying liquid explosive. Paying each driver $2000.00 if they survive the journey to the oil fields. Driving ever so slowly through desolate areas over every obstacle imaginable. Director Henri Clouzot takes you along for one of the most suspenseful rides of your life. You feel the thirst and fever of our characters as at any moment their dreams would end in one huge explosion. Being stuck in an L.A. freeway traffic snarl or a flat tire on a rainy night would be an improvement as to what our men are faced with. The physical and mental anguish of the South American Back country. The cinematography places you riding shotgun, as every bump, precipice, pot hole ridden narrow road for at any moment one mistake and obliteration. I also viewed this movie as an Anti-American film. Big corporation taken advantage of the little town. I just felt for Mario and his chance to possibly start over again. A round about way of playing Russian roulette with Barrels of Nitro in the back just waiting to explode. I was mentally exhausted by films end. As was said by one of the Company men sending our poor souls off to the flamed oil fields,""I used to see men go off on these kinds of jobs... and not come back. When they did their hair turned white and their hands were shaky like palsy. You don't know what fear is but it's catching. Catching like small pox! Once you get it it's for life.

We need a ""hunk"" for the lead and a ""waif"" for the love interest. If this sounds like a typical RKO ""B"" flick, you'd be wrong – it is WAGES OF FEAR. Yves Montand will always be a pleasure to watch. The director's wife, Véra Clouzot, is gorgeous to look at but an actress of very limited range. Charles Vanel's attempt at being a hard-as-nails villain makes George Raft look like Paul Muni. Close-ups and slow pacing were failed attempts at building tension. Enough said?",
123,23 May 2011,princebansal1982,5, Highly Original and Riveting,"I really loved this movie. It is one of the most riveting thrillers I have seen and at least for me was an unexpected surprise as I normally don't enjoy thrillers this old. And even though I do enjoy some I normally don't think that they can hold a candle to the modern thrillers. Mostly because they are clichéd, have loud music and even if they had something new when they were released, I have seen some other movie in which they have done much better.",
124,5 May 2000,Neal,9, A workout for the nerves.,"Don't be put off by the long, leisurely first act.  Once the trucks roll out your heart will be in your mouth, and even the most jaded action-adventure fanatic is likely to go rigid with anxiety and stay that way right through the horrifying coda.  Among the uniformly excellent principals, Vanel is superb and Montand sublime -- a fully human action hero who, without bulging biceps or snide catchphrases, could eat Schwarzenegger's lunch and make him say ""thank you"" for the pleasure.  Clouzot's other great thriller, LES DIABOLIQUES, is an MGM musical compared to this.  Not to be viewed by anyone about to take a driver's test or renting a U-Haul for the first time.",

A B&W camera, respondent actors and a tight script. A great fiber treatment for film lovers. The fat was cut at every turn. The actors are slobs that you've never seen before and have never seen again yet they capture you. Exotic people in an exotic place yet you can relate. 1953 is a year before all of the actors transmuted into 22 year old yuppies with great hair. Suspense hooks dropped with and without you knowing and then recalled with great deftness. If you insist of foisting foreign art films on your friends, be confident that that this film will win them over.",
129,4 July 2017,avik-basu1889,8, An intense thrill ride !!!,"The film starts off with a setting which is very reminiscent of the opening to Huston's 'Treasure of Sierra Madre' in the way that we meet a number of Europeans stuck in a South American town where literally nothing happens. They have no job prospects and they don't have the financial means required to leave the deadbeat town. Although the opening act of the film is a bit uneven,it still works to make the viewer well acquainted with the characters. Henri- Georges Clouzot manages to convey the utter disenchantment and poverty of the characters, which helps to underline why these men would feel desperate to find a way out of this town and will probably go to any lengths to materialise that. There is also a very clear anti-American capitalism statement being made in the opening act. The Southern Oil Company(SOC) who end up employing the men for the central mission is portrayed as this monstrously exploitative entity that doesn't care about people's lives as long as their materialistic oil needs are met. It is also interesting to note that the characters themselves remain pretty unlikable in the first part of the film. But when the come together in their mission and as we spend time with them on the road and fear for their lives, they become more and more engaging.",

135,18 September 2000,lupu-2,9," First-rate suspense, great acting, social realism","This outstanding film about a highly dangerous transport job establishes character in depth before the real suspense begins.  Anti-American sentiment runs strong in the depiction of oil-company managers in a Venezuelan shanty town. They are thick-skinned vulgarians who, in the process of ""just doing their job,"" have desensitized themselves completely to the poverty and hunger around them. One foreman hires an old friend, who is French, along with another Frenchman, an Italian and a Dutch man to transport nitroglycerin in two trucks to a distant site.  The slightest jolt will blow the trucks and their drivers to smithereens.  The men selected for the job are desperate for work, being foreigners stranded in an economically depressed country and desperate to get out of the abyss of poverty they have fallen into.",

138,5 December 2022,VikingBurialService,9, Clouzot's Second Masterpiece Thriller,"One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time; this is my second Clouzot movie, and so far he's nailed it. Basically, a group of expats(?) stuck in a south american village find an opportunity to escape, if they're willing to drive two trucks of volatile nitroglycerine to a burning oil derrick. The acting is great, the music is great, the cinematography is pretty dated/low budget, but it can be looked past. The real strength of the movie is the plot; not only is the concept brilliant for a thriller (having the characters vulnerable to dying at literally every second is a fantastic way to add tension), but the pacing is brilliant. Just when there's a quiet moment, and the volunteers seem to be getting the hang of the trucks, some new problem or dilemma presents itself. The movie almost lost me at the end; it faked me out by pretending to move towards an undeserved happy ending. Then it turned it completely around; the fast cuts between the dancing and the truck were amazing. A great movie from start to finish; it's cemented my love for Clouzot as a director.",

141,22 March 2015,sandnair87,9, The Wages of Fear is Explosive Cinema!,"One of the most deeply and disturbingly nihilistic films ever made, as well as one of the most heart-pounding thrillers on record, Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is as much about the origin of manufactured fear as it is about the folly of courage that feeds on it. But as lofty and abstract as Clouzot's allegory may be, his execution is vibrantly physical and immediate. Turning the screws with a relentlessness that impresses even in this age of the ruthless, high-tech thriller, Clouzot strings together situations of vividly, almost sadistically imagined danger. ",

The biggest problem is that it kept telling us about more interesting events happening off screen that would have been great scenes. Told about an explosion, told about one of the characters narrowly escaping a country, told about locals dying, told about some dude dying. I kept waiting for the action and tension described in the movie summary, but it never happened. It's been 5 minutes since I stopped at the 50 minute mark, and I'm already forgetting the characters and the movie. Not a classic by any mark. Doesn't even stand up to classic movies of the era.",

Sufficient be it to say that for me this is the film that will always stand out amongst the thousands of others I have seen. I had consigned it to memory, albeit lasting, until it was featured on a late night TV showing in, I think, the late eighties.  I defer to all the erudite comments others have made about it, and concur with their  generally laudatory tone.",

149,10 January 2008,ramsri81,9, South American Adventure with European Taskforce,"This movie has supposedly won the 1953 Grand Prize at Cannes. The plot is revolving around a group of men who are penniless at a place (supposedly some South American Country) and accept a dangerous job of transporting some explosive chemicals through the rugged country. I was not quite sure of the setting of the movie, whether they were trying to name the title on poverty under which the men were or the adventure comparing with the risk of losing their life. Either ways the movie is full of nice scenes of camaraderie. The outdoor sets for this movie is extensive, and the depiction of the 1950's South America isn't that easy. All the places give us a very nice and nostalgic view on how beautiful the place was. The European task force consisting Messrs Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel act important roles in the movie. The movie is about the conflicts of the actors needing money for different reason as for the emotions they go though in course of their journey to the land of no return. Really a master piece and even though many claim Sorcerer is a better movie than this (it is the 1971 remake of this movie) I personally feel this is a better movie. I rate this one 9/10",

The first half of the film was very important to show how the characters survived in a dry, empty wasteland. There are no jobs, they are low on food, low on money, and the prices for everything are up the sky. That is why they are desperate to get out, risking their very lives is better than rotting away from hunger and boredom in a dirty corner.

Mario is a Eurotrash clown, but muy macho, while Linda (Vera Clouzot), the ""half-savage"" adoring victim of Mario's apache, is impossible to portray in post-feminist film. Imagine a brunette Paris Hilton sans skank. If you've seen Sorcerer, Wages of Fear looks profoundly silly in places, especially the unsophisticated ending and brotherhood of laboring men ritual. Like Sorceror, the film features nude Yanamamo Indian ridicule of stupid white guys. One of my favorite movies, anthropologically speaking.",
