0,19 July 2005,Boba_Fett1138,10, One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.,"I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.",/

2,7 January 2012,classicsoncall,9," ""Has anything you've done made your life better?""","I've seen a lot of movies and have seen a lot of violence in them - war films, Westerns, horror and even some of those slasher/gore flicks that go so way over the top. For the most part, the violence depicted is far removed from any sense of reality, because after all, it's a movie and the director can be as unrealistic as he wants to get with flying bodies, severed limbs and the like. However the curb stomp by Edward Norton's character on the black hood in the street was probably as visceral an experience that one can get from simply watching the event on screen. I think that comes from internalizing the impact such a trauma can have if it was personally done to you. It's a little hard to put into words, but I hope you can catch my meaning.",e
3,1 February 2009,alexkolokotronis,10, The Most Dangerous Person To Us Is Ourselves,"American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.",v
4,7 August 2005,seventhsamurai1954,10, Changed My Life.,"American History X really opened my eyes to the world of racism and how cruel human beings can be sometimes. This story follows a violent extreme skin-head (Norton) that spends three years in jail for killing two black people and how he changed through jail. He then tries to help his younger brother, who idolizes him, not to go down the same path he did. You really can't find a more powerful movie than this. This movie forces you to open your eyes through harsh realism and although some things are disturbing, it makes you take notice. Everything about this movie is so incredible I can't even find words for it. All I can say is that if you have not seen this movie, it really is a must to see because it teaches you something and is really powerful.",i
5,27 January 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Why can't we just stop hating each other?,"This movie, got to me! I mean got under my skin got to me. It is so effective, the performances were just perfect. We have Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, two fine actors, they play two skin head Nazi racist brothers who are very violent. We start off at a very disturbing scene where we see how Edward Norton's character is put in jail for killing an African American very violently. When he comes back, he has just learned so much that no school, no white man could ever teach him: self respect, respect for others, respect for life, for his family, and knowing that ""We can't live our lives p*ssed off"". He is touched when he learns that his brother's teacher is asking him to write a paper about racism and how it effects today's society called ""American History X"". But when Eddie just gives a wrong look to the black kid in school, some things go terribly wrong.",e
6,28 August 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Edward Norton delivers a staggering performance as an extremely intelligent white supremacist who realizes the wrongness of his views and must then try to prevent his younger brother form going down the same,"American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly. ",w
7,31 January 2013,Leofwine_draca,8, Gutsy and compelling,"American History X is a real surprise, a searing look at racism in America today, told from the point of view of members of a skinhead gang. It's a lengthy film that's punctuated with moments of unflinching brutality, and yet it keeps you hooked to the screen throughout. And the reason for that? Edward Norton. Norton burns up the screen in this film; he's even better than he was in FIGHT CLUB, his big break-out picture. He somehow makes his Neo-Nazi character frightening, compelling and sympathetic in equal measure, a fully realised human being rather than a caricature. Furlong isn't bad, and supporting players like Gould and Keach are great, but let's not kid ourselves here. This is Norton's movie, and he owns it.",/
8,26 January 2006,exa56,10, A masterpiece! Truly one of the best film I have ever seen,"I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my English teacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!",r
9,26 January 2021,mark.waltz,10, I don't feel angry. I just feel disgust.,"Is this what has happened to society? I can watch something like this, even being a 20+ year old film, and feel nothing? No fear, no hatred, no sympathy, no caring, just nothing, as if novocaine has been shot into my heart. That's the power of cinema that I don't really want to see but when I do, I am amazed how well done it is. It's not the film I despise. It's that feeling I get of emotions I list above that I just don't feel when I read this in the papers, see on the evening news or on the street, or in this case, see on my TV as a movie.",w
10,2 September 2015,SnoopyStyle,9, great American cinema,"Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) grew angry after his firefighter father was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a drug den. He becomes a white supremacist under the tutelage of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). Along with girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk) and idiot Seth Ryan (Ethan Suplee), he aims to take back the neighborhood from the minorities. He kills 3 black guys who are breaking into his truck and gets sent to prison for 3 years. His brother Danny (Edward Furlong) idolizes him. However, Derek leaves prison a changed man as he tries to get his family away from his past.",2
11,18 February 2019,Hitchcoc,10, So Mind Bending,"Sometimes it's hard, as a viewer, to even watch something like this. It is inundated with scenes of horror and violence. If one simply passes off the idea of doing a movie about the ugliest side of humanity and then put it in our laps. The performances are outstanding and a moral commitment is made. Some would say to the worst of the worst, there is a glorification of the events through flashback that may be seen as sort of cool. This is a small price for me to pay, but I have to admit, I would not do well with a continuous diet of such darkness.",6
12,19 August 2014,rajatdahiyax,9, Norton's astounding performance!!!!!!,"American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. It stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, and co-stars Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D'Angelo.",6
13,2 September 2005,MovieAddict2016,8," Not a perfect film, but very good - Norton's performance is the highlight","""American History X"" is a bold and disturbing movie about family, racism and our own self-perceptions. Its main character is Derek (Edward Norton), a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother (Edward Furlong) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked.",5
14,16 July 2007,Movie_Buff_Brad,10, One of the best films about racism,"One of the reasons I like the film is that the racism isn't shoved down your throat. It's subtle and believable. There's no characters standing around screaming about ""Those goddamn Mexicans, I don't want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!"", right in front of them. ",7
15,1 September 2020,damianphelps,8, Thought provoking,"A really great movie that deals with a heavy topic, that is as relevant now as it was back then.",6
16,27 May 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9, See reality in your eyes when hate makes you blind...,"''American History X''is one of the most amazing movies I watched in my life! My dad gave me the tape to watch, and after almost 2 weeks of laziness to watch this movie, I finally watched it 2 times! First, I need to say that both Edwards( Norton and Furlong)are great! Edward Norton specially REALLY looks a skinhead, showing all his anger and awesome body in this movie.",5
17,28 August 2019,lisa-13121,10, All Time Favorite,I have LOVED this movie since the day I saw it! I own it & will never sell or give it away! It's topic will ALWAYS be relevant & controversial. I can watch it every few years or so & still love it as much as the first time!,/
18,22 October 2019,DanielStephens1988,9, Beautiful film about how hatred will never resolve the problem,"The tragedy of evil is that in trying to stop it, you create it. So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil.",?
19,7 January 2006,jmchnwth,10, This is a fantastic movie....,"This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on in life, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way"" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full.",r
20,15 February 2006,planktonrules,9, exceptionally powerful drama--but not for the kids,"I really appreciated how those associated with this excellent film refused to pull any punches in showing the life of a young skin-head so ably portrayed by Edward Norton. Instead of creating a caricature of a racist, all the vile language and violence is shown. This DEFINITELY makes this a movie NOT for KIDS, but for adults it makes a strong impact--like a right cross into the jaw! Now I know some adults will also be completely turned off by this as well, but considering how slimy and awful racism is, how can you talk about it other than by exposing it as it really is?! I applaud the efforts, though I must also admit it can VERY hard to watch--particularly the shooting scene and the intensely graphic language.",e
21,9 December 1998,Ari-21,10, This was probably the best movie I've ever seen,"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart.",f

23,1 March 1999,KoRnNut-2,10, Best movie of 1998,Powerful portrayal of Neo-Nazi movement in America. Told in series of flashbacks. Flawless acting by Edward Norton. Does its best to make the point that no one is ever right aand no one is ever wrong. I have a friend who was a Nazi and a racist. But upon walking out of the theater after this movie he hung his head in shame. This is why the film industry began.,=
24,13 March 2006,kylopod,7," Highly compelling, but not entirely convincing","The concept of a reformed neo-Nazi is so intriguing that it's a wonder there haven't been more movies on this topic. Once you see ""American History X,"" however, you will understand why. The movie's racial themes are provocative and unsettling, far outside the comfort zone of the average viewer, and the movie additionally has the challenging task of explaining how a violent criminal changed his ways. Does the movie convincingly explain that transition? Not entirely.",t
25,7 November 2022,fciocca,10, How an ideology can wash out people. A deep and tragic story about racism.,"""American History X"" is not an easy watch, there are many uncomfortable scenes and the plot is very tragic. The director Tony Kaye and the screenwriter David McKenna built a believable story and developed one of the best and most complex characters that I have ever seen in my personal experience as a cinema lover. They completely explored Derek's story, explaining the origin of his hate, why he embraced a certain ideology and showing his redemption path. We get to see what he went through in its rawest and truest possible way. This made me empathize with the protagonist and his brother. Edward Norton is convincing in this role, his dialogues are difficult to be listened to because they go against an evolved society that is still fighting to get equality. Unfortunately what we see here is not too distant from reality as there are still extremist groups that have a dangerous mentality. All things considered, I guess that this was a real challenge for the actor, but he definitely nailed it. I really enjoyed the non-linear storyline, which made the film more intense. I loved the use of black and white during flashbacks, it adds uniqueness to the whole narration. The photography is fantastic and the director managed to capture the characters' emotions perfectly. There were certain face close-ups that surprised me.",t
26,16 January 2019,tgs-69358,10, Incredible,Best Movie Ever Made. Incredible acting and writing and heartbreaking and powerful. Will never forget this film and the way it made me feel.,_
27,26 November 2019,JS-War17,8, A Brutally Raw Take on a Sensitive Topic,"What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.",u
28,28 June 2022,bhester0806,10, When Norton ruled the world,"Anyone who missed the 90's and early 00's never will know how big Edward Norton was, he ruled the world. But two movies were a step above all else and this is the second one. He owns this movie role and character in a spectacular fashion. After you watch this go watch the rest of the gold he was apart of in the 90's-00's. Fight club, Primal Fear, Rounders, The Score, Red Dragon, Italian Job, the illusionist, the Incredible Hulk, Pride and Glory, Stone. Watch them all.",r
29,6 February 2004,Manthorpe,7, Not all that it's cracked up to be...disappointing.,"Derrick Vinyard (Norton) is thrown in jail because he brutally murdered two black men one fateful evening when they tried to steal his car. He is a monster of a Nazi and is quite well known around the community as such. While in prison, Derek has had time to think and he realizes that his reasons for believing in what he does are complete and total frauds. His younger brother Danny (Furlong) seems to be heading down the same path. Can Derek convince his brother to change his ways before it's too late?",v
30,6 February 2021,allanljong,8, The Sad History of the Ostracised White Man in White Society,"The powder keg in Western White Society is the Ostracised White man - Ostracised from the progress, wealth and prosperity the social and political elites have been amassing for themselves at the expense of their fellow countrymen... Corporate profits and those wealthy enough have a stake in the growth from exporting jobs overseas and denying their poorer countrymen the opportunity to partake in the growth. And to add insult to injury, importing cheap foreign labour to squeeze the lower strata of the socioeconomic order to compete with ever reducing wages, and at the professionals, importing ready qualified immigrants instead of investing in their own people to fill those higher qualified jobs...
That's the bane of the Western Immigration and economic policies of the last 50 years! Is there any wonder that no non-Western country will be drawn into the immigration and economic policies of the West?
Just a sad tragic reality...",
31,14 October 2003,Theo Robertson,7, A Confused Film,"A Finnish commentator compared this film to American prison drama OZ . I love OZ , it`s my all time favourite American show , it`s compelling and brilliantly acted , adjectives you could use to describe AMERICAN HISTORY X. However while the HBO show suffers from lapses in logic there`s enough going on in different sub plots for you not to notice these flaws but seeing similar flaws in this film you can`t help but notice them",
32,13 February 2000,snapdggler,10, Norton takes throne as best Actor of his generation,"In just a short career, Edward Norton has emerged as the best actor of his generation. 5 films, 2 oscar nominations, and the best performance I have ever seen turned in by a modern actor. In this film, Norton plays a skin head who goes to Prison for brutally murdering two black men who are attempting to steal his car and comes out reformed only to find that his brother (Edward Furlong, turning in a fine performance) is headed right down that same route.",
33,28 September 2004,gingerkris,9, Intelligent Drama,"Strong performances by Edward Norton & Edward Furlong really make this 
 film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & 
 white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and 
 shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic, 
 ironically by a British director.
 
 The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the 
 younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after 
 killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature & 
 brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day. 
 
 AHX tracks Derek's history through the first formation of racist 
 sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are 
 embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek 
 becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by 
 youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo 
 Nazi propaganda. 
 
 The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a 
 steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually 
 embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very 
 apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends.
 
 Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the 
 prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own 
 demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by 
 his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be 
 that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the 
 Anti-Jewish sepal he's been living with so long. The problem lies with 
 his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being 
 influenced like he was. Derek's cross to bear is that he can't change 
 his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right 
 side of humanity.
 
 I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to 
 change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want 
 is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants 
 the same for his brother. 
 
 Kaye's use of black & white creates an atmospheric drama that builds 
 tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by 
 mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and 
 intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by 
 the same man (Derek / Norton).
 
 Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong. 
 
 To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which 
 provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on 
 every high school curriculum",

36,12 April 2006,lee_eisenberg,9, Why didn't anyone challenge Derek when he became a racist?,"My 9/10 rating is because ""American History X"" is very well done in every way, except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) started spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe, they should have asked him what became of his humanity.

There isn't much more I can say about this movie or it's cast other than bravo and thank you for having the guts to do this film.

This movie is absolutely brilliant, if you think about it...it's the type of movie we are never going to see again. It had really strong and powerful life lessons that will stay with you forever, the characters are amazing and very inspirational as well.

It's one of the rare movies that truly displays the extreme realism of violence, evil and cruelty of some humans in this world, and whilst it's not for kids, it's highly necessary.

51,13 January 2008,moonspinner55,6," ""Now we can ignore each other in peace...""","Past and present collage of a youthful neo-Nazi skinhead in Venice Beach, California, his life going into a tailspin after the gang-related murder of his father. After killing some neighborhood thugs, the skinhead serves jail time and is eventually paroled (and reformed), yet he can't seem to straighten out his erratic family, particularly his younger brother who seems intent on following down the same ugly path. Director Tony Kaye puts the squeeze on us right from the start, staging a blacks vs. whites basketball game as if it were Epic Human Drama (photographed in black-and-white, with slow-motion effects and a heavenly choir). The superlative performances nearly carry the picture, yet screenwriter David McKenna lays on the be-true-to-yourself rhetoric with a trowel (and yet lets the opposite side get their licks in too, whittling the film down to a battle of speeches ladled with words like 'empowerment'). The jailhouse scenes are the strongest, but the family drama and the sidebars with the police (who also get to make speeches) are uncomfortably contrived. ** from ****",

55,1 March 2007,Falconeer,4," 2nd rate melodrama, unbelievably overrated..","According to the IMDb list of the top 250 films of all time, THIS comes in at a staggering #44. If we are to go by this incoherent list, we are to believe that ""American History X"" is a better film than Kubrik's ""Clockwork Orange."" It is superior to the ""Deer Hunter,"" and the classic ""Third Man."" It even outshines Germany's epic masterpiece ""Der Untergang/Downfall."" After you are finished laughing, consider the film ""American History X,"" a hack job so embarrassing that it's director, Tony Kaye wisely attempted to have his name removed from the final product. Why would a director want to deny responsibility for a film that is considered by countless idiots who consider this better than ""Metropolis??"" Because 'A.H.X' is a mediocre film at best. From it's infantile, laughable, simplistic, and thoroughly inaccurate views on racism, to it's soap opera like melodrama, down to it's gross, comical overblown stereotypes, such as the ex-gang member 'uncle tom' preachings of Avery Brooks, as the black school principal, to the ultra stereotyped Jewish ideal, played by none other than Elliott Gould! Why weren't more people offended by this obnoxious representation of minorities? And of course, the skinheads were portrayed as ugly, stupid, and faceless monsters, with the exception of Hollywood movie star Ed Norton, who is a fine actor, but who was just too pretty to be believable here. A word of advice to future filmmakers: If you want to make a powerful statement about serious political issues, avoid using the latest Hollywood pin-up hunk to get the point across, as it just does not work. Remember Alan Pakula's ""Devil's Own"" with Brad Pitt as the hunky IRA hero/terrorist? Enough said. Ed Norton plays Derek, a young man who turns into a hate preaching neo nazi skinhead after his fireman dad is shot while putting out a fire in the ghetto project. Norton does not look like he ever stepped foot inside a housing project, but that does not stop him from becoming the spokesperson/leader to a generation of mean, angry skinheads, all of which tower above Norton. And as good an actor as Norton is, I did not believe him in the role of a lower middle class skinhead; He sounded more like a sheltered private school boy trying to act tough. It seems that the filmmakers have never even met a real skinhead, as this portrayal was so unbelievably inaccurate. AHX makes the mistake that so many Hollywood films make; It attempts to manipulate our emotions with sad, wistful, dramatic music. This method was grossly overused here, and some of the dialog could barely be made out over the overpowering ""backround"" music. More evidence of this films failings; if the script, and performances are good, we will feel the emotions on our own. Intelligent moviegoers do not need our emotions to be ""cued"" by the appropriate music. This is a sure sign of a poor film. Derek's transformation from normal boy, to racist skinhead, to finally a strong, enlightened protector of his family and responsible brother/son, after an ""Oz"" like stint in jail, would work fine, for a film made for television. But the fact that this thoroughly underwhelming movie scored so high on this website is proof enough that these ratings cannot be taken seriously. It saddens me that so many people cannot see the difference between truly good cinema, and mediocrity. It is more tragic that so many people can be this easily manipulated by this kind of Hollywood dreck. Having had the opportunity to view hundreds of films from around the world, I am not impressed by Hollywood's repeated attempts at making serious, intelligent films that deal with issues such as racism and poverty. Hollywood needs to stick with the flashy entertainment, the explosions, the comedies, the Sci-fi, as for this type of film-making, Hollywood can't be beat. And for those who want to see a truly good film dealing with the same subject matter as A.H.X, take a look at ""Mississippi Burning"". Here is a rare example of when Hollywood got it right; a well made, beautifully realized piece of cinema, that deals with the racism issue without being corny or ridiculous. As far as ""American History X"" goes, do not believe the hype.",

This has to be one of the most powerful films ever made on racism. The story, performances, camera, music all feel so real and thought provocative. It tells the story of Derek, a white supremacist nazi skinhead and how he transforms and now just wants his little brother Danny to not go down the same path. The narrative is non linear where the past is periodically shown in B/W while the present is in color. One of the most haunting aspects of the film is it's background score which is among the best I have heard. The writing is balanced and nuanced and it shows. Because honestly the plot is slim but the screenplay they made out of it is bloody brilliant. The film explores hate and the effect it has on people. The constant struggle is there to see, some scenes are very hard to watch and are extremely violent on the eyes and mind. We have all seen films portraying racism in one form or the another. But there is something in this film which stands out among them. And that is Edward Norton's jaw dropping performance as Derek Vinyard. He lights the screen on fire in the scenes he is delivering dialogues which reek of hate. It was a laudable performance. But I was left wanting for more. I do feel a bit more of Derek's back story on his journey into becoming a white supremacist could have been explored to add another layer. The film has a brutal climax which I didn't expect at all. It kind of comes a full circle in the end. The final moments of the film ends with an Abraham Lincoln's quote written for a paper by Danny he submitted for his AMERICAN HISTORY X class. This is a film you cannot afford to miss. ABSOLUTE MUST WATCH!",

Its this very fact that gives it its power because it ultimately allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions, trusting them to understand the separation between the film itself and the contemptible characters contained within. Ultimately, it represents a vehement cry against the racism and bigotry rampant within its first two acts and also holds the belief that someone can unlearn these bizarre beliefs which are usually bored into them by an outside source. If it didn't go the distance it wouldn't have been half as successful, perhaps instead feeling like a weak-chinned exploitation piece, and its tragic conclusion may have lost its impact. 7/10",

In the Cilton years prison racialitst reform was filling prisons with minor offenders of wrong colour, while affirmative action was turning hard working Amuricans into hatte filled monstuers . A growing, ambitious guy of high IQ and later questionable tattoos has an inspiring black teacher that sells his woke agenda, while his policemen racialist father is against it. Black violentia kills the dad and a foster father figure is found in local corrupt republican-leaning manipulator. This causes guy to shave his head and when a gang of melanin rich drifters try to rob his car after losing control of the basketball court due to movie hero being an awesome, if melanin challenged, athlete, he stands his ground and uses some excess force to whack a couple of them here and there. For that he gets some prison sentence but whilst in jail he befriends a dark skinned comedian and rejects his ideology of republican nativism, all while getting some stitches for snitches and books from his ideologically possessed O-bama wannabe former teacher. After being brain-washed he gets out of prison to try to imprint some liberal woke bs into his impressionable younger brother. But, alas, as left wing indoctrination portrayed as sincere repentance for white privilege of being an orphan whose daddy policemen (also white privilege) had a privilege of being shot on duty by some gang members with excess access to drugs and melanin after protesting incompetence of his co-workers that got jobs via affirmative action, was beginning to work, there is a new problem. The violentia wins again as a bullet is shot again from a minority member into his brother, killing him on spot. So, violentia wins the day, and the circle continues, since no matter how many republicans repent for their white privilege, problem is not solved, since the root of the problem is was on the other side all along.

I do think its quite good and of course its controversial, but i can't help thinking that its getting as much credit as it has for being just that. It has some good moments and the fact that the neo nazi's opinions are put a cross in a well constructed manner, rather than the usual thick headed thug type fashion does make it more uncomfortable and asked more questions of us (perhaps) and of course it has other current flowing under the obvious ones, like the element of prison and what that brings etc etc, but overall this film lacked any subtle moments. Everything is thrown infront of you in an aggressive manner, which i know people will say is the point perhaps, but in my opinion it isn't. We all know racism is a bad thing so to have it spelt out and then have the rather obvious idea of redemption but paying for your sins or for your actions (being accoutable) for your eventual loss is a little obvious",

Racism and important topic which was talked, discussed and rectified (up to a mark) all-time ago but it has its significance in these times also. We are unable to eradicate it. And that core element swings through each and everyone which indirectly points to secularism and the shut down of secularist vision. Racism has strong roots nowadays also. When it comes to the film, mainly it revolves around the character of Norton, his subjective consequences, and his mind stage from wrong to right and his relieving part.

You don't hate like he does. Well you may not but you can't help but be moved by his saga.

The film stars Edward Norton as a former white supremacist reformed after a jail sentence who now wants to help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, avoid traveling the same path. What the film lacks in character depth it makes up for in its overarching moral message.

137,3 February 2015,brianberta,8, One of the most powerful films ever,This is probably one of the deepest films made in years. Edward Norton made an incredible lead performance that drives the movie well. This film can be hard to watch at times and it may not be for everyone with its intense action and violence but the overall message of the movie is well thought out and is quite moving. Even the most violent of people can change as seen by Derek when he becomes friends with a black man when he was in prison. Behind all the violence lies a great message that is pretty motivational. Its plot details how black and white people despise each other and often get in fights and even kill each other. The movie details how brothers Derek and Danny both try to turn themselves around from their harsh life. All of their friends are racist and both of them fear their friends turning on them if they try to leave their gang. The ending is tragic and it's hard to watch. It gets me every time but it's fitting. This is a really amazing film. It has a great story and a great message. All of this combines to make one of the best movies in the 90's. As long as you can get by the gore and action then this will likely be a film for you. This is a must see film for all fans of drama movies.,

139,13 December 2007,robert-temple-1,1," Terrifying film about American Neo-Nazis, full of violence, followed by redemption, but nauseating","It is doubtful whether this disturbing and horrifying film should ever have been made. It is nauseatingly violent, but then so are the kind of people it is based upon. No sensitive person should try to see this, as it is far, far too horrible. The violence is so sickening that it is intolerable. The entire project is of questionable integrity, even though in the latter half, some justification is offered when there is a major change of heart and mind by the lead character. Edward Norton, one of the world's most versatile film actors, gives another staggering performance, as does Edward Furlong as his younger brother. It is all very well done, but should it have been done, that is the question. This film portrays in a way no mainstream film has ever done the extremes and depths of racist hate cults, and we are left with nothing to speculate about as far as American Neo-Nazis are concerned. By the time you have sat through this, you have seen more swastikas than you could find in 'Triumph of the Will', but these are up close and personal, like Norton's tattooed on his chest. The scenes in prison are so far beyond appalling that we run out of shocked adjectives. If you ever wanted to know how Neo-Nazis think, because you just couldn't wait, here it all is. But have plenty of vomit bags handy. I am inclined to think that this is a piece of exploitation masquerading as a serious social and psychological study. Why not make a film about suicide bombers and decapitating people next? But why stop there? There is always bayoneting babies to move onto after that. Can this sort of thing be justified? The fact that it is a well-made film makes it worse. I think our 'need to know' is spurious, and that the people who made this film are all deeply, deeply sick, and should be ashamed of themselves. This film will only stimulate crazies to emulate the insane racists, and I bet tattoo artists get a lot more business after this. Also, the racist attitudes portrayed and statements made in the film are so disgustingly offensive that no one has ever plumbed such depths in a film, and I believe that such unspeakable evil should not be given publicity, and that such maggot-ridden and rotten things should not be brought out into the light. It is a fallacy to think that by showing them anything constructive can be achieved. Elliott Gould in the film looked shell-shocked at the horror of it all. I know how he feels. He should have walked out of the film, not just out of the house. What was he doing, lending his name to this?",

The slow motion is dreadful, the flashback scenes are almost always terrible and the message is ridiculous. A few specific awful pieces of the film include the fact that Danny has a single night to write this paper and does so with the eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the entire basketball game scene and how much blood Danny has in his body. But the worst part of the movie is definitely the idea that Derek needed to meet a nice black person in order for him to change his views. I get it has to do with him being sheltered and closed-minded but it doesn't make sense and gives the viewer a horrible idea of how racial differences can be solved. The film tries to push an agenda on the audience so hard and, at least in my eyes, falls flat on its face with its most important message. It's a major problem when a character's white supremacy rhetoric makes more sense than his reason for being reformed. There are countless cliches and more moments of bad acting.

He was a hardcore racist and was recruiting more to join in his hate. He murdered a man in cold blood. He was so angry because of how his father died but his own father was already planting the seeds of hate in his mind before he ever died. Derek was young and didn't fully buy into it at that time and you could see how uncomfortable he was during that conversation and he knew his father was wrong but he didn't want to say the wrong thing. Then his father died and in his rage and grief he decided that his father was right and he was set on his path of hate and suffering. He went in with nothing but hate in his heart and he spewed it for anyone that would listen. Then he used people who were young and not as intelligent as he was to destroy anything that he hated. He let himself be used by Cam so he could feed his thirst for revenge against people of color because he blamed them for his pain and he wanted them to feel his pain.,

Edward Norton produces an outstanding performance as Derek, and Edward Furlong creates a believable and likeable-in-spite-of-his-mixed-up-politics little brother.  I rated this film 9/10, and the only thing keeping it from 10/10 was the script, which occasionally gets a little preachy, and at times I was aware that the characters were functioning as a mechanism to try and educate me, the viewer, not talking to each other.  Norton was up last year for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Derek here...why wasn't this film up for a Best Picture award?  It's a stunner.",

I was 13 when I first saw the film in 1998, and now I'm 32 with more life experience and many, many more movies under my belt, the cracks and problems with Tony Kaye's tale of brotherly love and neo-Nazism also became apparent. It was something I could never quite put my finger on as a youngster, but the film's main issue is with trying to resolve a lifetime of hate and dysfunction in a single night, and by setting itself such time constraints, over-simplifies an incredibly complex and sensitive subject, although its heart is certainly in the right place.",

Undoubtedly the star and shining light of this film was Edward Norton, who finally broke through into the elite of Hollywood, where he fully deserves to be. His portrayal of Derek Vineyard was flawless, hardened bigot one moment, reformed and remorseful killer the next. No doubt that in any other year he would have walked off with Best Actor, his performance was breathtaking. Ed Furlong also delivered a really top performance, as the younger impressionable Danny, delivering his best performance since Terminator 2.

It was also very scary because Edward Nortons performance as a skinhead, was so utterly convincing. He's definately one of the best actors around.      A few negative things stuck out in the movie though. For example when Derek is telling Danny about his turnaround in prison, Danny accepts he's right straight away, and if Derek was so intelligent and smart, how come he was so easily turned towards hating blacks? I know his father put a few thoughts in his head, and he was killed by a black gang, but please!! I also thought the slow motion scenes were a bit too ""Hollywood"".

You want faux-home movies of kids at the shore to symbolize lost innocence? You got it. Slow-motion violence? Check. Black-and-white flashbacks to contrast against the blood-spattered color of the present-day sequences? Why not. Pseudo-religious, semi-liturgical musical scoring to mythologize and elegize the predictable dramatics? It's dripping with it. The kind of rote plotting that demands one character will have to be sacrificed for the sins of another? That's here, too. The storytelling is resolutely episodic, a series of (predictable) set pieces: the basketball court confrontation, the convenience-store riot (which is admittedly frightening stuff), the prison gang-rape, the neo-Nazi rally. It's all prosaically told, but Norton does create a complex portrait out of little, carefully conveying Derek's anger, conflicting familial feelings, fierce protectiveness, and growing consciousness. Some very good veteran actors help out -- Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach -- and Avery Brooks somehow manages to turn his angelic-teacher turn into more than a device. God knows a subject this timely and vital deserves more nuance and analysis, but the brute force of Norton's acting and the excellent support from little-brother Furlong (though Kaye, predictably again, lingers too long and in too-relentless closeup on all that anguished doe-eyed adolescence) ultimately win out over ham-fisted direction and unimaginative screen writing.",

When dealing with something controversial and brutal, you can water it down and appease censors, or you can match it in how relentless it is. In the case of a flawed ideology, the battle can be fought mainly by letting the followers and their actions speak for themselves(this is not propaganda; what we see in this could have happened). That is what we have here. I've read that this was based on a true story; while I don't know for sure, I can imagine that it is. The editing is sharp and vicious, not playing down what we're seeing in the least. Cinematography is dynamic and it keeps the pace(and intensity) high throughout, without reaching the point where we are overwhelmed or something didn't properly register with us. It is a 110-minute dirty, bumpy ride down a bad road, with the result that we can only seek to avoid the path, and deter others from following it, as well. The acting is spellbinding, every single performance. I found myself realizing that I knew these people from other stuff(then again, why haven't I seen Guy Torry in anything else good(steer clear of The Animal)? He's great!); however, they are so convincing here that they disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. Furlong is amazing. Norton ignites the screen as the furious and charismatic Derek. Apparently, he recut this to get himself more time... I don't know, maybe he did; I have to admit, I am rather happy with the released version. The ending is perfectly underplayed, a brilliant pay-off to a subtle setup and an undeniable fact of the problem of racism and hatred(as a sort of spot-on period to a film about those subjects). All of the script is impeccable. The dialog is natural, and the unrestrained feel of it helps paint a clearer image of the types we're following. This is funny at times, and it isn't without uplifting moments(not to be confused with sap or sentimentality); there is light at the end of the tunnel, it's merely dim. The author of this does not have anything other than this to his credit(well, S.W.A.T. was decent)... don't let that fool you. There is a ton of strong language, graphic, bloody and terrifying violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality(and a rape) and male nudity, including full frontal in this, and none of it is gratuitous. The DVD comes with three deleted scenes coming to a total of six and a half minutes and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone mature enough for it, and who has the stomach for it(yes, regardless of any other parameters). 10/10",
204,14 November 2018,Svenstadt,5," Well done, but too preachy.","Call me a cynic, but this is just more of the same from Hollywood. Stylistically, the film is impressive. But the conclusions drawn are all wrong!
PS- I could have done without the prison rape scene, and could have seen some more of Fairuka Balk sex scenes would have been nice!
Leftists always give you the same ad-hominem attacks... ""These are people who think that time has passed them by..."", or, ""Racists do what they do because they are insecure""... bla bla bla!
I love the scene at the dinner table, where the guy who's the Jew dating the lead's mother says, ""these are people that feel alienated by the system""....
Oh please, spare me!! The only thing that matters in this world, that matters to God, is the actions that you take!! Your own internal dialogue, as this character seems to be suggesting, is something that dominates our personality in the end, and there is no free will. But since not everyone acts on those impulses, the results of our actions are the only tangible things others can see!!
That being said, this movie is entirely believable, and the main character completely justified. This film seems to take the left-wing, communist path of ""destroy the individual, by attacking his motivations and not his actions.""
Communist liberals don't really care that there are dead bodies in the streets... they care about tearing down the concept of right and wrong... Case in point? Derek, the main character, becoming overly violent on the night in question that landed him in jail on murder charges. Ask yourself: would Derek have been a hero if he had simply shot the guy who broke into his truck, to leftists? No, he would not have been!! He would have been a hero if he had left the guy go and steal his truck. Why? Because, leftist communists are hypocrites, and believe in ""one standard for those who help bring about the divide, and another for those who call for the same standards of behavior for all."" Communists can only come to power when society is divided. Then, they sneak in and steal the country while people are looking to fight each other, and not them!! Hence, the real racists are on the left!!! What does all this mean? It means, you cannot put a guy like Derek through the loss of his father, constant harassment in life, and expect him to react as a pacifist. As it is, the film only serves, in my humble opinion, to further the divide. The real statement of this movie is: There is one standard of behavior for blacks and other minorities, and an entirely other standard for whites (which is to say: bend over and take it because we have had it too good for too long!)>>.....",

And so any average kid might be prone to become the nazi monster, the terrorist or the outlaw just since his supposed to be ""authorities"" told him to be so.

What makes his performance special is his laser-like intensity brought to all things skinhead, at least for the pre-prison part of the movie. The movie starts to unravel during Norton's transitional phase to someone more sensitive and socialized. That transition isn't given enough context and his prison ""friendship"" isn't sufficient to believe he's a changed man. It's all too convenient a plot crutch. Norton's asked to make this shape-shifting believable, but the screenplay lets him down. Nevertheless, Norton's excellent performance deserves to be watched regardless of plot quibbles. N.B.

It was stunningly acted, beautifully shot, and, for the subject matter, very restrained, objective, and nonexploitive (the score was a little overbearing, though).  All these aspects remain in my second viewing, but the ending seems to negate everything that precedes it.  Throughout the film the story is Derek's hatred and his subsequent enlightenment and how Daniel is headed down the same destructive path.

214,4 January 2023,IrateTyrant,7, Dumb voyeurism meets idiot racism,"This movie surrounds itself with racism and expects everyone to look at it as edgy. Although some scenes are interesting, other ones are boring and dull and just drowning with racism and the problems of modern America. Edward Norton who is often very dull as an actor plays the lead character who is abusive and angry, as well as violent and an overall bad person. The writers were pumped to get him to kill black actors during the script, but the story is bland because it's about ignorant white Americans who fill up the movie with their dumb subplots and side stories. Rather than juxtapose it with anything of value, it allows itself to rest on the idiocy of the masses to find it to be an audacious source of film-watching.",

The same nearly goes for Edward Furlong, but I'm still contemplating on that one. Nonetheless, both will never be forgotten as roles of nightmarish realism. A reality that some believe to have died off with the rallies and marches in the 60s. But it is alive and well, even in the hearts of some of today's unfortunately misguided youth. The story, as it progresses, expresses one fundamental idea. Ones does not simply wake up and accept the fact that there a fired up racist. It is a seed that starts out small, and is nurtured by those who do not know how to lead, or have their lost their own way. And then, at a certain point, it is fed like a fire needing fuel. But just like a flame, it can always be extinguished. Lots of symbolic stuff, huh? Well, one picks up these things after watching the film several times. Racism is not an inherited fundamental theory. It is a learned trait. The film's director Tony Kane and writer David McKenna worked hard to deliver this theme. As far as I've read at first there was a much more edited and toned down version to be originally released. But thank God that didn't happen.

Edward Furlong seems to spend the entire movie looking meaningfully at what's going on around him. I found parts of the plot a bit unbelievable.  Specifically, Edward Norton was redeemed by a friendly black laundry worker who was able to amuse with comic routines.  This black laundry worker appeared to have no knowledge of Edward Norton's vicious crimes, yet was able to hold back an entire prison group from murdering Edward. I usually like Stacy Keach but found his role depicted him as a buffoon. His character was highly intelligent with great organizational skills -- why was it hidden? Beverly D'Angelo gave a wonderful performance as the mother.  She is an actress with a wide range and q;uite believably pulls off her role as the mother (and widow) of a family who racially hates.",

221,18 May 2006,valadas,6, Too superficial,"Nazism, fascism or neo-Nazism and neo-fascism got multiple causes. Besides the individual personal psychological ones that turn a human being into a Nazi or a Fascist there are the collective social, economic and political ones which give birth to the movements where the individuals integrate themselves. Without the latter causes the former will be socially ineffective. Therefore the racial problem in USA cannot be treated with this simplicity because it's much more complex than what is shown in this movie. This movie is more about personal motives that make one to become a neo-Nazi even if they assume a form of a certain interpretation of social and economic realities usually a wrong one. It doesn't say practically anything about what is most important i. e. the roots of racism as a global social phenomenon. Without it you cannot understand this question. Of course you can tell me now that the movie doesn't intend to be a sociological treatise and just only to tell us a certain story. Well that may be true but then the movie is worth what it's worth regarding the theme of racism that is subjacent to it. This is undoubtedly an honest movie that tells us the credible story of a young neo-Nazi who repents himself of that, after having been in jail convicted for racial homicide and then tries to prevent his younger brother to follow the same path. But the story is told in a too superficial and not very deep way. It doesn't touch the core of the racial question. In respect to that we have only the discussion at the family table in the first part of the movie among the family members including the Jewish boyfriend of the young man's mother, which discussion ends in a bad way. The rest of the movie loses itself, besides the inevitable violent scenes, in some somewhat ingenuous sentimental ones, lacking intensity. In sum this is a sincere and just movie but not particularly remarkable.",
222,30 October 2019,Svenstadt,5, Tries to find a causal string that doesn't exist!,"The one problem I have with this movie is that the theme gets pounded into your head in every single sentence of dialogue, as if race issues are all these people talk about at home. Every scene never deviates from this formulaic bummer.
Another problem I have with it is that it blames the Vinyard family (ie Ed Norton, Ed Furlong, and company) for all the problems in the movie, as if some invisible ether on their souls is invisibly causing all these social problems that they face!
Not one single white person in the movie committed a major crime- that would be all the black characters in the movie! And yet, being a mildly bad Nazi in a gang formed out of necessity, oh! Why that is bordering on unforgiveable!
How about some logic applied to these academic eggheads?? Maybe next time, make a movie about white people who live on their own, where they don't have to face the challenges of a multi-racial hell hole like Los Angeles!!

Basically Derek went to prison for racism and hatred, and Danny is soon following. When Derek's father is killed on duty, Derek's view on mankind is changed, and he finds out in prison there is good and bad in every person, whatever race. Danny now has to be convinced of this newfound enlightened. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo as Doris Vinyard, Avery Brooks as Dr. Bob Sweeney, Jennifer Lien as Davina Vinyard, My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Seth Ryan, Stacy Keach as Cameron Alexander, Fairuza Balk as Stacey, Elliott Gould as Murray and Guy Torry as Lamont.

The Ed Norton character is an intelligent and articulate individual who convincingly preaches the twisted logic of racism. The film manages to convey most psychological explanations of racism - the authoritarian personality,the scapegoat hypothesis, in-group out-group bias, transference, etc, without feeling preachy. I can't think of a more socially important or responsible film than this. Derek's emotional oddessy is both moving and disturbing, with all points of view given equal airing, no matter how extreme. Personally I found the question asked of Derek 'Has anything you have done made your life better?' a stark and penetrating wake up call for anyone who is unhappy. The ending has been criticised for being overly emotional but I thought it was appropriate, Derek gets hurt by former chosen enemies who have not yet learnt the lesson he has. This makes us question whether Derek was wrong in the first place. This is a complicated film about a difficult subject which should be required viewing in all schools. The ultimate message is to do your best and try to get along with other people. Its not just about racism, its about personal choice, do we live to hate or do we try to make life better for ourselves and others. The director walked away from the film, my question is if he was unhappy with this cut, what would his version be like? This version is a technical, artistic and emotional triumph.",

(Gods of videotape and DVD, please spare us his cut, which he never completed, by the way.) From the very first frames, it's clear that Kaye has no rapport with his actors, and has zero idea how to get decent, let alone consistent, performances out of them. As the buffed-up skinhead leader, Norton tries hard, but he has three different personalities in the film, with the transitions between them either patently phony or (mostly) non-existent. A worthy subject, but this ""X""ecrable effort proves why some people are cut out to do 30-second commercials and not grandiose ""masterpieces"".

Much to my surprise, it was quite fast-paced and never seemed to lose itself in moralizing or philosophizing, although the temptation was there. The story revolves around an assignment given to a local white teenager by his black principal. The teen (Edward Furlong), whose brother was the former skinhead trying to go straight after doing time in prison, had written a book review expressing admiration for Mein Kampf. His principal (Avery Brooks) assigned him to write the story of his brother, focusing on its social significance. That angle could, as I said, have led to a lot of moralizing. Instead, it served as a springboard to a very powerful series of flashbacks detailing the brother's growing involvement in the movement and his experiences in prison that led to him turning around, as well as a bit of the story of him going straight upon his release. The brother was brilliantly played by Edward Norton. The movie is very brutal and violent at times and is frankly not for the faint of heart.

On the surface, there's tension and drama but the whole subplot is kept so long with a stale and contrived dialogue that the tension can't be sustained and the audience is tired. Derek's transform from an effervescent skinhead to a contrite preacher also looks very cliche and cheesy. A laundry boy's unilateral clownish acts towards an obnoxious working partner eventually warms up Neo-Nazi's heart and he repents of his past. Besides that some things don't add up at all. While Derek disapproves of his neo-nazi prison gang's dealings with hispanics, he is punished by the gang because he plays basketball with black inmates. Later, when he refuses to join the gang and chooses solitude in prison, the gang which were initially brutal towards him simply let him go. The female characters of the family are poorly developed and shown weak and subdued. The mother is totally indifferent to her sons' street activities. Their room is decorated with swastika flags and all sorts of white supremacist trash, which screams trouble but all she does is to smoke and cough in her bedroom. When the younger one follows the footsteps of the older sibling in prison, she then remembers to ask for help. Why doesn't she act before? Towards the end of the movie, it turns out the racism runs deep in the family starting with the slain dad. But that thread is not followed further. Ed Norton's acting is in general good but far from Oscar worthy. All in all, this is an ordinary crime story and family drama with gazillions of clones produced as tv series or dvd bin movies.",

But the last part, after the nocturnal confrontation of the two brothers around what happened to Derek in prison goes its own way and leads to a message that is absolute despair. ""What have I done?"" says Derek on the dead body of his brother. He has in fact done nothing at all but exploited a manipulative situation that was rotten from the start and made him the victim of bigotry. But Derek was redeemed in prison. His brother was redeemed by Derek's tale of what happened to him in prison and by the black principal of the school. The two white boys were redeemed. But the black boy was not, could not be and he killed and was unerasably and permanently sprayed with the blood of his prey and the final vision of a completely red Pacific Ocean of forever waxing and waning blood leads to a meaning of fatality that will never end. Racism is forever because the black victims of white racism will never be redeemed and will never forgive. And why should they?

We dislike the opening of the film, we dislike the opening of Kaye's film on the basis that it is ugly and frank; we dislike the fact that we are challenged to process not only the apparent ugliness of the sexual content but the Nazi infused props littering the screen, and are forced into calculating which of those leaves the nastier taste. We dislike the fact that, next door in a room of his own, is situated a young boy seemingly forced into possessing a building with such a person complete with such activity going on in such close proximity. We side with the boy, and are somewhat forced against our wishes into sympathising with all of those whom inhabit the house when a group of blank, faceless African-Americans plot outside to sabotage the car on the driveway – and all of this before the really nasty bit happens.",

291,8 February 2008,dee.reid,10, America...,"Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar 10 years ago in 1998 for his performance in 1998 in ""American History X."" His role as Derek Vinyard, a once-bright kid-turned-charismatic-neo-Nazi skinhead leader is one of the most brilliantly brutal and uncompromising screen performances I've ever seen. After being released from prison, he emerges reformed, determined to leave his old life behind and start fresh, and try to make amends to his broken family. As a 22-year-old black male, I was not the slightest bit offended by ""American History X"" and the violent racist rhetoric on display here. A lot of what is said and done in this film can be heard from any right-wing conservative loudmouth (i.e., Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage, among many others), so many of the discussions here won't be lost on some viewers. The meat of the story gets underway when Derek's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) writes a history paper on ""Mein Kampf"" and is on the verge of expulsion by the school's principal (Avery Brooks) as a result. The principal decides to take Danny under his wing in a remedial history course called, among other things, ""American History X."" Through Danny's work under the principal, in equal parts back-story and present-story, he explores Derek's transformation into a skinhead, after coming under the influence of a local white supremacist, Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), following the murder of their father (though the seeds were planted much earlier, as detailed fairly late in the film), and Derek becomes his protégé, recruiting many lost and impressionable young kids for him. Britisher Tony Kaye directed David McKenna's occasionally flawed script, which guides Norton's Derek Vinyard through a devastating and vicious cycle that is as brilliant as it is chilling and realistic. The transformation he goes through in this film, and his attempts to keep Danny from following in his footsteps is indeed one of the greatest screen performances of all time, even if some issues get left out in the cold, and the script seems deficient in the storytelling at times. But regardless, ""American History X,"" is just one damn-brilliant piece of film-making. The intensity of the performances, especially Edward Norton's, and the material show us that this is film-making at its best. One of the all-time greatest films.",

294,21 January 2000,bnm81510,6," weak directorially, strong performances nevertheless","The scandal of Tony Kaye disowning his work and condemning New Line who took it away before he could realize his 90-minute cut is well publicized by now. And it's no surprise why the director became so enraged: American History X is definitely in need of major editing. In it's two hour theatrical version, this study of California skinheads seems haphazard and even amateurish at times. The studio's attempt to improve the film actually made it much worse:the picture looks like an effort by an ambitious, self-indulgent high school student assisted by his far less inspired teacher. Most of the black-and-white sequences (flashbacks of Norton's and Furlong's life as skinhead brothers) are much more powerful and beautifully shot than the trite and cheaply melodramatic color scenes set in the present day. One cannot help but contemplate this film's potential on all levels of production: for one, it should have used a more urgent and appropriate soundtrack of modern hip-hop and hardcore instead of the typical Hollywood solution to all dramas which we've all heard literally hundreds of times; and also cut down on the slow motion, arguably the most gratuitous since The Postman. Still, Norton's extraordinary performance and several thought-provoking scenes make one wonder what the movie could have been if Kaye was allowed to perfect his material without intervention.",

300,18 August 2014,Movie-ManDan,10, The Best Acting Ever Filmed. Coming from an actor and hardcore movie buff.,"I am an actor, as well as a film fanatic. I have seen them all from De Niro in Taxi Driver to Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. None, and I mean none of these performances are quite as good as Edward Norton in this. This movie is about Norton who is a reformed skinhead who tries to prevent his little brother (Furlong) from following in his footsteps. One thing great is how big of a shock Norton was. Norton is a geek: his name, face and voice are all proof. But he is far from a geek in this. There are 3 Nortons: a nice high school kid, a monstrous neo-Nazi and reformed gentleman, all of which he does so convincingly with such passion that connects deep within the viewer's soul. The kid he plays is so nice and innocent. The monster he plays is so angry, frustrated and full of boiling hatred. This stage is the most intense acting I have ever seen too. The anger, intensity and apathy can make the viewers very uncomfortable. Yet, he is so well developed that you have no choice but to sympathize him. An actor has done a job well done if he can push the buttons of a viewer. The reformed man he plays is heroic and so philosophical that the viewer will love him. What really sets this performance apart are the transitions from his character's stages. It is during the transition that where the themes of the story are shown. Sure he is only briefly a regular high school kid, but going from a racist monster to someone reformed was so perfect. It is done in such a smooth and gradual flow that is unlike any other chemistry for a single character. Other great pieces of chemistry for a single character don't flow at a gradual pace like this.",

The whole concept is very interesting, a neo-nazi skinhead realizes all the prejudices he believed in are completely junk. I thought Derek (Edward Norton) would become good friends with some black guys and understand they're all the same, but he just shares a laugh or two with one black guy and that's it, no big thing.

307,7 January 2009,Sergeant_Tibbs,5, Powerful and raw film despite its flaws.,"This is a film that once had a massive impact on me, a film I used to consider perfect. It achieves many tones with a very well developed protagonist, giving us many situations in when we hate him and what he's done and then sympathize with him. Edward Norton deals with this transition with perfection and makes it 100% believable (even if it takes a rape to do it). The use of flashbacks is effective, and it helps that they are clearly separate (though a cause of the consequence because the actual retelling of the film is set within around 24 hours - this stretch gives us a value of time and helps us re-evaluate the characters). Furlong is equally as powerful giving his only notable performance besides Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Despite the strength of the film within itself in the narrative, the actual message is thin. Not weak, but thin. It seems to blurt out the message at every opportunity, giving almost a before and after of his thoughts in his behaviour. However, the protagonist preaches about racism, it's effected his whole life, but when he encounters a black person face to face on his own his reaction is calmed down and he seems to want to just leave and not take action; which contradicts his feelings. I must admit, there is not a moment in this film that I would give the label ""entertaining"", despite how often engaging it is. Which also makes it boring every time it stops being engaging. The end is the source of the emotional punch which almost alters the films' (or the characters') point and feels rather forced.

Set in Venice Beach, California, this film stars Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard, a once-happy young man with a healthy family who lost his father after he was shot by an African-American for simply doing his job. Angered by the circumstances of his death, Derek turns from an innocent young man into a cold, hate-filled skinhead, and becomes the leader of a white supremacist gang who exercises hatred against every racial group outside the white protestant. After getting arrested for brutally killing a black man who tries to rob his car, Derek spends three years in prison where he unexpectedly develops a bond with black man Lamont (played by Guy Torry) who teaches them that not all black men are evil.

This is a heavy film with some great suspense moments, however nothing really jumps out at you despite the film being just around two hours long. The whole time I was amazed and transfixed by the acting and writing, but it never really shocked me in the way I expected to be. In my opinion, this is the only factor in keeping it from being a perfect film and one of the best of the 1990s. As mentioned before, Edward Norton proves he is arguably the best actor of this generation with a phenomenal performance that makes him so evil in black and white, as well as being able to sympathize for him in color. The supporting actors are good as well, and the directing and writing are equally strong. Certainly a film to see, American History X is stunningly powerful.",

American history x is a brilliantly acted masterpiece of a film about a white supremisist nazi who goes to prison for the shooting of two black thieves and the story of how he comes around to believing that the whole racist scene is fundimentaly wrong and his struggle to make his brother believe the same.

Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, the head of a Neo-Nazi gang. In the film, Derek has just been let out of prison after serving a three year term for murder. When he gets released he comes to realize the error of his ways in the past, and now he is determined to prevent his little brother Danny from making the same mistakes he did.

Are they Americans or not? If not, U. S constitution and laws do not apply to them or are not responsible to protect their freedom? How about looking at this issue with humanity? Is it right to use violence or discriminate because they are not U. S citizens? What if immigrants from Europe? Do people treat them the same way as they treat the ones who are looted by Cameron's gang? In 'American History X', who is right, and who is wrong? Can one pick just one side completely? Do you think Derek will go back to being so hateful and enraged after Denny's death just like after the death of his father, thinking 'I was so right about these people. Blacks are parasite to the society'? What will happen to the student who shot Denny? Will he have the moment of awareness or epiphany as Derek did? Can one even classify or define a person based on ethnicity? Does certain race of people behave in certain way? Or is it because people with the same race share similar backgrounds such as neighborhood, economic status, and education? Is affirmative action actually fair when a better candidate for the job has to sacrifice because of a quota left for certain ethnicity? So many questions pop up endlessly for an hour even after finishing the movie. It means 'American History X' is effective and powerful. Rather than telling a story black and white or crystal clear who are good guys or bad guys, the film shows what's happening out there sharply and honestly but with delicately controlled story development. It is audience's job to watch, feel, observe, analyze, and solve. Gosh, it becomes more attractive because it does not just hand out answers, one has to look for it.",

But it really makes me upset and angry at the end of the story. Isn't the last part when Danny is killed utterly redundant? I know it means to bring up the complicated feelings of the audience toward the problem the movie is dealing with. But hell no, it only makes me realize how serious and impotent America's gun control policy is. Are you going to blame racism when a freaking high school student is able to get hold of a gun so easily? When weapons that are so powerful such as guns are so handy and prevalent, killing is just a matter that could be done so easily. When something could be done very easily, would its happening be a surprise? It just happens, like all other easy matters like dropping a glass on the floor. You're not gonna blame on anything for such things. It just happens. Love and peace propaganda will only appear feeble and useless, and the safety of your life can't rely on human's subjectivity. I don't know America's gun policy well, but if in fact it's strictly conducted all the time, then my anger over this film is justified for it exaggerates the reality just for its dramatic effects. But if the reality is just as dramatic as what the film has shown, then I'd really feel sad and sorry for people living in this country.",

Voting to decide who will become the next Prime Minister of the country, one of the key topics seems to be immigration. Pioneered by a Conservative leader who is seemingly obsessed, the issue has brought up the old trend of racial tension. What happens though when you stop perceiving an awkward subject as a problem, and begin to passionately hate all those who are different from you. In ""American History X"", Ed Norton provides perhaps his finest ever performance as a reformed Neo-Nazi with a mission. Powerful from start to finish, the film is not afraid to show the views of the extremist, whilst simultaneously proving the flaws in their arguments.",

It happened in Germany where nazis wanted to justify their problems with the increased richness of Jewish population,  and this film touches the problem in the context of US, when young and nearly ignorant young people start admiring Hitler's  ideology. A young very racist guy is taken to the prison after he killed two black men, who wanted to steal his car. One of the black was killed in a most violent manner. He is put in jail and there learned that he was completely wrong. The film has a lot of charge until its end, but I may ask, why such an end? There is no need for a happy end, but perhaps for something more coherent with the ideas the director seems to defend. Sorry, but the epilogue to me is bias.",

The summary of the film in my opinion is that parents they have to upbringing their children to a open-minded and friendly family environment. Parents' hazardous believes propagandize children minds and transform them from good little people to an ""atomical future youthful bomb"". Mainly parents are responsible for theirs children delinquent behaviors and actions and first of all we have to blame them for the tragic incidence and not the children. Luckily there are several teachers nowadays who still believe that is their duty to rehabilitate delinquent teens and the most important part is that there are people that still believe in human kindness.",

Edward Norton's character has plenty of time to think in prison, and this takes three years - that is not quick at all. Prison gives you nothing but time to think. Of course we are not going to see every nuance of his change of mind over those three years, just the key moments. If you want to talk about a movie where a character makes a total chance towards race in a very short amount of time see Monster's Ball. Other review say Edward Norton's character transforms to a lover of all races. I do not see this at all. He becomes tolerant, at least to the point of being quiet. I believe silent hatred is the first step towards racial unity. This is flat out an excellent movie.",
345,21 April 1999,emm,7, Painstakingly important film provides a shattering look at violence and hatred.,"It was very easy to realize in the beginning that I, too, would've found AMERICAN HISTORY X a minor coincidence in the making. Well, I was wrong. Again! Even with the influential direction of Tony Kaye and solid acting of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, the movie still could have squeezed more juice. It could have been simply more or less. More on its details and less of the slow pace, to be exact. You won't keep anybody down for not liking this picture because of its explicit nature. This one took the more provocative route, and it suddenly runs as smooth as premium unleaded gasoline. The disturbing racial hatred that has changed America's societal infrastructure forever is how this picture is portrayed. With its correct state of mind, the movie is nonetheless disturbing as well as horrifyingly true, and shows itself on a very high pinpoint of accuracy. It walks a large step further in giving out a dramatic study of what can actually be a truthful account of the life of a racial hate crime syndicate, and how the lives of two adjusting individuals are shared. The violence is what makes this movie fully express the way society is being mistreated. Certainly speaking, it does go off the deep end and is not for the faint of heart, so that's all there is to know. One nice touch is the use of photography and its expression of colors, which is a good move for having the story tell itself with proper understanding. I really wanted more out of AMERICAN HISTORY X, but it's got rock-solid potential to keep its open-mindedness with a variety of moments.",

It is thought provoking, superbly written, superbly directed, and not to mention the brilliant acting by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Some scenes are very shocking, but they need to be there. Having seen this movie another neo-Nazi movie immediately springs to mind: the Australian 'Romper Stomper' (1992). I think that 'American History X' is the best of the two since it is more analyzing and less violent, and the acting is much better (not to say that the cast of 'Romper Stomper' is bad though). Norton is without a doubt the best actor right now, and Furlong is certainly almost as good.",

355,30 January 2000,bat-5,8, Edward Norton is amazing,"As you watch Ed Norton in the role that garnered him a nomination for best actor, you realize that you are watching acting of a caliber that hasn't been seen since the glory days of Marlon Brando and the early works of Robert DeNiro.  Norton virtually vanishes into this role.  He is scary.  With the shaved head, bulked up physique and tattoos dotted across his torso, he comes across as truly menacing.  The real strength in this role comes from Norton's convictions.  When he rallies his fellow white supremacists into a raid on a grocery store, you believe him.  Then when he returns from prison, you see a totally different person.  You see the pain and sorrow that has cost him three years of his life.   When Norton looks into the mirror and sees the giant swastika emblazened on his chest, you see in his eyes a look of regret.   Edward Furlong is also good in the role of the younger brother who is headed on the same path of destruction that his older brother was on.   All the performances in this film are top notch. The film is hard to watch at times.  The violence and the hate mongering that Norton perpetrates is tough to stomach, but in the end, Norton's character is redeemed.  He has seen the error of his ways and he hopes to keep his brother out of the life that took so much from him and his family.",

A dinner table rant was more powerful in defending our reformed skin heads' view of the results of liberal government than was the quiet shaking of the head by the true adults. You also can't write below your audiences' level and cover it up with a diatribe just because it is raw and brutal. This contrived plot uses an artificial good guy (black teacher) and an impossible good guy (older brother who, three years prior, curb stomped a black car thief he had already shot numerous times) to oppose the beach side community of hate. When tackling the Grand Canyon of social issues in Racism, you better understand your audience who knows that it takes an army of time and thoughtfulness to change mob mentality.

His character is not presented as a monster, but as an intelligent kid that is smart enough to know that what he preaches is wrong, but circumstances in his life fill him with anger and hate.The movie does want to hammer home its anti racism message, to some it may seem as manipulative, but the images are so well done that it is hard not to feel a reaction. The movie would have been well served if the other characters were as fleshed out as Norton's character Derek. Norton's brother is played by Edward Furlong, his performance is good, but he is really more important as the film's narrator. The skinheads in the film are by and large shown as mindless racist drones.

Norton and Furlong are utterly believable as is the whole cast.  Instead of being parodied or mocked, the white supremacist are made believable and the legitimate social, economic, and cultural issues that underlie their despicable beliefs are made real and believable.

377,17 June 2008,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,9, Just great,"Perhaps the highest compliment you can pay to Edward Norton is that his Oscar-nominated performance in American History X nearly convinces you that there is a shred of logic in the tenets of white supremacy. If that statement doesn't horrify you, it should; Norton is so fully immersed in his role as a new-Nazi skinhead that his character's eloquent defense of racism is disturbingly persuasive--at least on the surface. Looking lean and mean with a swastika tattoo and a mind full of hate, Derek Vinyard (Norton) has inherited racism from his father, and that learning has been intensified through his service to Cameron (Stacy Keach), a grown-up thug playing tyrant and teacher to a growing band of disenfranchised teens from Venice Beach, California, all hungry for an ideology that fuels their brooding alienation. The film's basic message--that hate is learned and can be unlearned--is expressed through Derek's kid brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), whose sibling hero-worship increases after Derek is imprisoned (or, in Danny's mind, martyred) for the killing of two black men. Lacking Derek's gift of rebel rhetoric, Danny is easily swayed into the violent, hateful lifestyle that Derek disowns during his thoughtful time in prison. Once released, Derek struggles to save his brother from a violent fate, and American History X partially suffers from a mix of intense emotions, awkward sentiment, and predictably inevitable plotting. And yet British director Tony Kaye (who would later protest against Norton's creative intervention during post-production) manages to juggle these qualities--and a compelling clash of visual styles--to considerable effect. No matter how strained their collaboration may have been, both Kaye and Norton can be proud to have created a film that addresses the issue of racism with dramatically forceful impact.",

It's always rather painful to see a movie that ""wants to take off and soar"" end up sitting on the ground (albeit sitting very well).

Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead who, after a life changing stint in jail, tries to prevent his brother (Edward Furlong) from taking the same path. The film is brilliantly directed by Tony Kaye, as he catches every emotion that Ed Norton conveys in his performance. Kaye captures the mood and emotion very well here. He makes a lot out of this film, and it remains one of my favorites. Ed Norton's performance is simply brilliant in every sense of the word. He captures the essence of evil, while at the same time providing a likable character. He plays the strong Vinyard to perfection. Ed Furlong's performance is excellent for what he's given. He's given the brooding and potentially one dimensional character, and turns it into a deep, confused, and potentially volatile young man that is easily influenced. American History X remains one of my favorite movies because it displays how racism can effect an entire family. I cannot stress how good and moving this film is, and this is possible because of Norton, Furlong, and Kaye. Beware this film if you're younger, though, because there is strong, strong racism, racial stimulated gore and violence, nudity and sex, and the worst of it all, a rape scene. Not for anyone under 17. If you see one film from 1998, see American History X.",

Norton immerses him-self so well within the role that you forget the past measly characters he has done and focus on this muscle bound skin-head before you! The film is shot beautifully and told through black and white flashbacks which let us into the world on Derek and Danny as we see the traumatic events that shape and change their lives forever and not to mention the beyond repair damage that they go through. Although the film might be basic, it has a very hard hitting message about hate , no matter what colour or background it comes from but still leaves us with no easy answers or comfortable conclusions. This movie truly must be a top one to watch for people who don't normally watch movies anyhow let alone be on the top 100 films to watch before I die list. All performance from Norton to Furlong even to Suplee were nothing short of excellent not to mention the score which is superb from Anne Dudley.

Edward Norton blows me away with the rage and passion he brings to parts.  I work with lots of teens and I have seen some of this rage- and the movie is right on target for what happens when rage is not dissipated. AHX is an important film showing how teachers can affect the lives of their pupils as well as parents-- like the song from South Pacific ""you've got to be taught to hate"" and that is what Derek's dad did- but others taught him to be tolerant.  Norton should have gotten the academy award- but in the days of feel good movies this one is too real to win the acclaim it should have.",

But upon arrival back home he sees that his little brother, played by Edward Furlong is going down that very same path and must save him before it is to late. Norton ignites the screen in his best performance to date. He gives ever line with power and emotion and Furlong is not far behind him. This film also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen. It left me totally speechless.

Remove all the Nazi subtext and the relationship between Derek and Danny is exactly like the one I had with my older brother. I've never seen another film capture the essence of an older brother's influence over his younger brother. This film not only does that but makes it a major element to the story. I, myself also have an older brother. The difference in age is the same as it appears to be in American History X. Let me tell you, if my older brother HAD been a destructive neo nazi like Derek, I probably would have been too, just like Danny. I played the same sports my brother did. I watched the same movies. I listened to the same music. I tried to emulate him in every way possible. Even recently I started a job with a local utility company. The same job he started in when he was my age. American History X does an excellent job of showing the remarkable influence of an older brother, and how he accepts the responsibility that comes with it. When Sweeney visits Derek in jail, he tells him that his younger brother is headed down the same path as he is. Derek immediately shoots back that Danny is not his responsibility. Whether Derek wants the responsibility or not, he has great influence over Danny and must use it responsibly. Unfortunately, Derek realizes this too late. That's the essence of this story to me. The struggle of an older brother to save himself in order to save his younger brother. Ed Norton plays both the responsible and the irresponsible Derek magically. This film goes from being a good film to a great film because of his performance. The most realistic portrayal I've ever seen of someone dealing with family problems. 8 Stars out of 10.",

Except if you watch the movie you can actually see it coming but you still hate it. This is the story about two brother. Derek and Danny. The story is being told in large part through flashback as Danny is telling the story about Derek and how he landed in prison for killing to black gang members who were trying to steal his car. The beginning of the movie starts with Danny breaking up a fight with another young gang member who was bullying a white kid. Who happens to shoot him in the last few minutes of the movie. That's the part of the movie that annoys. The circle of violence. It wouldn't be so bad but by this point Derek and Danny have both decided to give up the gang life and hate in general so it makes no sense to kill of Danny. It is cruel and senseless act.,

Not moving as in pro Nazi-ism, but on how hatred can ruin America's culture and modern society. I love this film, although it is very abrupt and forward. it does a wonderful job of accomplishing the goals that the filmmakers (i believe) were hoping to accomplish. My favorite shot of the whole film was when Derrick finished unloading his clip at the car driving away, and they go to a shot of Derrick walking back to the wounded gang member. They put it in slow mo to emphasize the anger and hatred on his face. This shot goes far deeper than any other shot of the same length would.

Seriously, did we go to the fridge for refreshments during all the parts containing the black guy Norton does laundry with in prison?

It's like that in schools, countries and even prisons where you are told what to believe, what to think and what to feel (Famous words of Tony Montana) and it makes you realize that you have to be a free spirit to get along in this world.

Only almost embarrassed, because the right wing antics of Ed Norton's main protagonist would probably have made Hitler blush. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a Neo-Nazi of the Uber variety. This guy really hates black people. The very presence of a black person makes his skin crawl. He rants and raves, sounding wonderfully maniacal, about the blight that is black America, angering and upsetting his family - even though it was his own father that instilled these ideas initially. All, that is, except his younger brother, who looks up to him, admires him, and devours every word of vile rhetoric. One night, Derek carries out an act of ghastly violence against a black criminal - this scene has to be seen to be believed - and winds up in jail. There, his life, his attitudes and his thoughts about the path his younger brother are on are brought into sharp focus. Disturbing, unrelenting, unflinching and as harrowing a movie as you are ever likely to see. Black, white, yellow or an odd shade of mauve, everyone MUST watch this movie.

Eventually when they try and shift through the gears although the messages stick and generalisation the film unfortunately doesn't. The film is now outdated and has this have been made now would have been immediately pulled off yet that's what I liked it was brave and real. The best statement was actually from Monica Gellar's Dad when he said you don't even know the world your children are living in. Now the message here wasn't just for Edward Norton but to all parents as a wake up call. The problem is parents fail or failed and this is passed on to generations. At the same time the system fails its people, now society is over run with different groups, not in terms of nationalities but everything. People have too much to say, things have become silly and so riots protests etc. At the end of the day people don't hate skin or people, they hate behaviours. It's these behaviours that forces these messages to go round in circles. Hard to know what's good and what's not. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground, people don't want to bite their tongues anymore. Now, that doesn't mean that is right or wrong. But look at the film from the school assignment and the music to the shaved heads, what's been shown in the language and languages used. Hommie, init, eff this and that, tripping.

409,10 May 2019,PCT1970,9," ""People Look At Me And See My Brother"", A History Lesson","Kaye helms one of the best films exploring racism in recent memory. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, cinematography, score and acting. The entire cast delivers exceptional performances. In particular Norton, Furlong, Brooks, Falk and Keach are superb. Norton commands the silver screen and his performance is absolutely mesmerizing. The plot revolves around a neo-Nazi, Derek and his younger brother, Danny. Danny is assigned the task of writing a paper on his beliefs by his school's guidance counselor, Dr. Sweeney after submitting a book report on, ""Mein Kampf"". Dr. Sweeney is the former teacher of Danny's brother Derek. As Danny sits at his computer to start the paper the story of his family's history begins. We find his brother Derek is a very intelligent neo-Nazi who spreads his hatred, propaganda and recruits for the local chapter leader Cameron. Derek is doing time for committing a heinous act of vengeance after his dead father's truck is stolen. During his time in jail Derek is subjected to a brutal assault and is visited by his former teacher. This experience opens his eyes as to why he embraced the neo-Nazis after a life growing up in an environment of violence, hate and racism. Upon his release Derek's mission is to save his family and change his brother's path while struggling with old associates and his own past. This leads to a confrontation with Cameron and a equally eye opening story he tells Danny. The plot is intense, violent, thought provoking, insightful, heartwrenching, disturbing and has a poetic ending. There are many memorable scenes and not just quotes, but speeches in this film. After his reunion with his brother, Danny's report starts off as, ""People look at me and see my brother"". If only that was not the case, but sometimes it takes tragic events to see things differently, change one's beliefs, end the violence and alter one's future. This remains one of the very best modern day films probing racism and violence. It is a sublime and brilliant work of art in it's genre.",

You can see the white supremacist in him, and you can see the reformed man in him afterwards; you can see it all in his eyes. Everything about the movie feels great: the cinematography, the black and white shots, the soundtracks, and the acting-omg, that portrayal by Edward Norton!

Focus on one town and more specifically one family...really good (I'd like to refer you to the TNT movie ""Freedom Song"" as a film that more successfully deals with racism by looking at one town deeply rather than the whole country shallowly).

I will not give spoilers, but there were a few times you can tell the plot was a bit contrived to fit the authors narrative. It was as if they were willing to sacrifice a bit of realism for a neater story. I also object to the ending, again I will not reveal what happens, but it felt unnecessary. Kind of like overkill. With some slight reshuffling there could have been a more rewarding ending. What they decided on is shocking, but it doesn't really add. With that out of the way I can talk about the good. Taking a serious look at Neo Nazis is a very bold move. The overall message is still that racism is bad, which is hardly original in itself, but I still like how they did it. Instead of making the Nazis ridiculous cartoon villains, they actually gave them a credible perspective. Not that you have to agree with their views, but you can at least see why the characters think the way they do. Actually, if anything some of the liberal characters are at times more cartoonish. Then again that might just be because it is so much more common for liberal political opinions to be in Hollywood movies, so they inevitably seem more cliche. The cast all do a great job, Edward Norton deserves recognition for this, he was able to bring a very complex character to life, and explore some very dark themes. I know this movie was made well before Breaking Bad, but it does remind me of Walter White, in the sense that you may not agree with everything he does, but you cannot stop watching to see what happens next. Overall, this is a very heavy film, you need to be in the right mood for it, but if you are, it is very rewarding. This is a great movie.",

What is ""great,"" then?

416,1 September 1999,allyjack,7," Wildly variable quality, but fascinating and gripping","Suggests the devil has the best tunes: the portrayal of Norton's immersion in the movement is scintillating, conveying both the visceral excitement and his fearsome articulacy and the sexy physicality it gives him - the scene where the dinner-table discussion of Rodney King grows into a brutal attack on Gould is painful to watch. At such times the sleek, visually punchy style draws you right in and is all the more mesmerizing for the repulsive nature of the identification.  But the movie has way more problems with the other side of the argument. The prison scenes are reasonable enough, if too reliant on a single amiable black guy as a positive influence on Norton, but Furlong's personal journey makes far less sense - the performance is blank and he doesn't have half the space to explain or demonstrate himself. The closing stretches are messy and disappointing. The social fabric of racism is barely touched on (easily the worst scene is the clunky flashback to the racist dad) and the movie's ""anti"" argument consists mainly of assertions about  racists being sad, time-wasting assholes. Despite this wildly variable quality, it was one of the more fascinating and gripping movies of its year.",

430,1 June 2004,TheEtherWalk,10," One of my top 10, stunning and tragic.","American History X is the story of a man who succumbed to hatred and his journey to redemption. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek Vinyard, a skinhead jailed for murdering two black men. When he is released from jail he tries to get away from his old life and help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, to understand what happened to him. The film covers racism from nearly every angle and really makes you think. The narrative structure is a bit twisted though, and a lot of it is just flashbacks explaining how Derek came to be a skinhead, what happened to him in jail, etc. It's interesting to see how his hatred tears apart his family and hurts those around him. The ending is like a punch to the gut, but it really sums up what the characters have learned and the consequences of their actions. Totally brilliant, required viewing. 10/10",

433,13 October 2001,jazzadelic,6, good film that could have been great,"Racists in movies usually don't get treated like real characters in films. Usually they're seen as the guys in white masks that nobody ever who never even get to utter more then a few cliche lines. My guess as to why is that in an age of political correctness most filmmakers are afraid to dig deep into the psyche of the average racist. In Happiness, film makers showed a pedophile without judgement. In Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins portrayed a serial killer who is not only treated like a real character but is actually likeable! If they can do that in a film then surely should be able to make a film that portrays racism in a realistic and thought provoking manner. American History X is a good movie for that reason. It is the first film since Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" that deals with racism in a frank and open way and is unafraid of offending it's audience. What keeps ""American History X"" from being a great film (like ""Do the Right Thing"")is that some of the characters' actions seem contrived to fit the plot. Edward Norton's character is awfully wishy washy for a guy with deeply felt convictions. In one scene, he's talking about how much he hates blacks, then joking around with a black is enough to make him the picture of love and acceptance. Also, the film has a shock ending that does not make sense and confuses the message of the movie.",

435,9 April 1999,Willie-12,9, Powerful,"American History X is certainly one of the most powerful movies I have seen in a long time. I just watched it last night on video, and let me tell you it is still with me, and will be for some time to come. Hatred is senseless. This is what I have come away with after seeing this one. What is so sad about American History X, is even though it is a fictional story, it portrays a very realistic problem in our world. It is amazing how one can become so engulfed in hate, that they fail to see how the hatred is destroying them and the people around them. We think that the consequence of Derek's actions is a prison sentence, and the result is a wonderful rehabilitation that is going to change not only his life, but his brother's too, who is headed down the same hate-filled road that Derek was headed down. However, we come to find that life doesn't work that way. Indeed, the hate filled seeds that Derek sowed before prison have blossomed, and the consequences are more then he could have ever imagined. American History X is a great movie because of how painfully real it is, and it doesn't pull any punches. It lets us know just how senseless hatred is...any kind of hate. You see, just because this movie happened to be about white supremacism, doesn't mean that it doesn't apply to everyone. I think the bottom line is this: Any hatred toward anyone can bring you down. It leads to emptiness, and destruction, and can bring about events that will ultimately kill you emotionally, and maybe even literally.",

Perhaps the most powerful image is of Edward Norton walking towards the camera, hair buzz cut and swastika tattoo popping against his skin. There was good stuff like that in the movie. Bad stuff was that this movie should've been about the younger brother. I mean, it starts with him narrating, it opens with him. Is he not the main character? Why is Ed Norton here stealing every scene like it's his movie? Get the eff out of here Norton. Uninstall yourself from this film. It becomes glaringly clear that this just another dramatic vehicle for Norton's career, and any statement it was trying to make was lost in that horrendous ending. I have never been so disconnected to an ending of a film, but this movie tries *so hard* to have this bull dramatic ending where the little brother gets shot, and I couldn't care less.

Since always heard good things about it. So finally. Had an opportunity to see this movie unedited un censored 14 years later. So was the movie filmed nicely. Sure. In sure most of it was filmed slightly backwards since. They go form long hair to medium to short hair. So a lot of thought was put into the scenes film order etc. All the characters did a great job acting. I will give them that. For sure. So filmed great. Acting great. What was weak is the story line. So what the dad the firefighter complains he has less then perfect coworkers due to race. So he then what hate them tells his son. And then after he dies I guess he meets that other guy and he starts to hate immigrants. But to attack the grocery story like that so extreme. But. Not as extreme as the black guys attacking his home since they can't play on the basket ball court. Then he curb stomping him since his dad gave him the truck. Then for him to only get three years in jail. Wth. Then they never explained the deal that was being made in the prison. But I guess since he played basket ball with them gives them a reason to rape him. Since he blew them off. And the black guy to help him not be murderer not sure if that's enough to make him a pacifist. Same with the brother yeah he was disrespectful and blew smoke in his face so you shoot him. Did he even get caught what happened with the group like there were lose ends that weren't tied up. Really Think it could of been great but there was a lot more improvements.

Mr Norton is truly electrifying as both the nazi-thug and the reformed ex-prisoner, trying to prevent his younger brother to follow in his footsteps (an equally excellent Edward Furlong). True, the violence in this movie is very disturbing, containing a murder scene that is the strongest and nastiest I think I have ever seen. It really made me cringe. But it never becomes gratuitous or just something to titillate the viewer with, but an integral part of the story. And all the time you feel that this story could very well be a true one. Nothing is too blown up, or exaggerated out of proportions. The nazi's party looks just like documentaries I've seen on tv. Heck, I even know some people who underneath their open minded exterior have some views regarding immigrants that are not too far removed from some of the characters in ""American history X"". The visuals are also powerful. Backflashes are black and white, but it doesn't feel superficial. All performances are great with some really outstanding ones: apart from the above mentioned there is Guy Torry as Nortons black buddy in prison and D'Angelo who is convincingly confused about everything happening in her family. If the movie has any faults, it's that the time Norton spends in prison is too sketchy. He is violently raped by some fellow inmates and suddenly (well, almost) he sees the error of his ways?!?! Not very convincing. But all in all a very powerful and disturbing (in a good sense) experience!",

454,8 May 2013,eric20other2002,10, Top Rate Acting in this Incredible and Necessary look at life in America,"It took me a long time to watch this film, the nature of racism and bigotry is nothing new to anyone, its all around us and sadly will always be there, whether its against Black people, white people or any other ace, its unavoidable. What this film does is amazing, it takes you through one man's journey from a young man, whose outlook on life is like any other at a young age, to someone whose hate is fueled by the unfortunate death of a loved onto him trying to save another loved one to a similar fate. Each and every performance is significant, from the small, but effective roles portrayed by Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee, as members of the DOS that Norton's character at the start of the film has brought together, as kind of a new age Nazi regime. The two performances in the film to really look at here goes to Norton and Furlong themselves, the characters are both shown to be bright individuals despite their obvious ignorance and as we get to know them, we begin to really want them to succeed in a turn around. Of course, with Norton's character we see him already changed, trying to put the pieces of his family back together, due to his actions in the past and its through flashbacks we get to see his turnaround. Another performance that should thrown out there is by Guy Torry, who plays Norton's cell mate of sorts(they don't share a cell, but they have the same work duty), his character is likable and he manages to make you feel like your there in the film helping him to turn Norton around. The main focus of the movie starts out with Furlong's character on the verge of becoming the hateful clone that his brother was locked up for going too far with, while we see him as a caring member of the family, its hard to see his ignorance come out, simply due to skin color and feeling that society is now so focused on being equal they are screwing over the white race, which as a white person living in the projects, I can relate(although, I don't grow any hate over it). Edward Furlong does a phenomenal job in this film, although, they look nothing alike, you really feel they were brothers with a tight bond. Another aspect of the film that really sends a great message is how the story the told in present time, with the flashbacks being told in black & white, it keeps the film feeling surreal, while still giving you the message the scene is trying to get out, with the most effective scene coming in the form of what ultimately got Norton landed in jail and what Furlong is thinking of when he finally has his turnaround. Although, I put in that there are spoilers in this review, I think its best you watch this film to see how the ending plays out, its an unexpected and very non-cliché. One that will have you watching through the credits as you wrap your mind around what you just watched. 5 out of 5 stars I will also have to note that this film has never gotten a decent DVD release, no commentary, no featurettes, nothing.

461,19 June 2006,walken_on_sunshine,10, American History X:The Doc's Review,"Much like the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan American History X will be a movie you will never forget.Probably the most realistic portrayal of racism other than Crash.This film is full of so much passion everyone is always angry and intense.The best thing is that each point the movie makes is valid and understandable whether it be coming from the ""gangsta's"" or the ""neo Nazis's"" the message is loud and clear.The characters are all again realistic to an extent.The films best quality is how it shows that one decision leads to consequence after consequence until it's too late to do anything to fix it.A very realistic portrayal of prison is only one of the disturbing sequences this film contains.Every death is brutal and difficult to watch as is the anal rape scene and the grocery store robbery.They all however are needed to be shown because without the unbearably brutal violence the message wouldn't hit as hard.The film is not slow paced as many may assume and that is why i prefer it to Crash.While Crash was brilliant American History X is more extreme and more true to real life and in my view more likely to hit home.Overall American History X is a timeless classic with a moving story about a character who you cannot stand becoming the character you root for after he realizes his mistakes.An enjoyable film that is definitely not for kids.",
462,5 November 1999,WilsonLau,10, Breath Taking,"Wow! This movie was incredible. I still get chills down my spine from it. I've never seen a movie like this before, I mean it made my hairs on my neck stand on end. Edward Norton gives the most outstanding performance that I've seen in years from any actor. This film takes a straight up look at Neo Nazisim with very little held back. Shows how racism is everywhere in this society and is a wake up call to suburban North America. Any racists whom have seen this will have to do a little soul searching after this one. Very well layed out, very powerful. Quite possible one of the greatest films ever made.Edward Norton deserves a Golden Globe, and Oscar and whatever else they can reward him with. Consider this amount of talent. Norton will be in many more films to come and should be one of the top leading men for movies in the years to come.",

464,14 August 2020,derangedxzombie,10, A realistic and gritty film that hits hard,"This film really showcases both Edward Norton's and Edward Furlong's acting talent, all acting in it is great. Also the musical score, script and use of black and white to show past events. The movie is one of those that feels realistic, there's narration throughout by Edward Furlong (that plays the younger brother of neo nazi lead player, Derrick Vineyard). It makes the film quite absorbing and they subtle moments can pack a punch, but the film has a few shocking moments. It's essentially about the events and revelation Derrick goes through, and the vicious cycle of racism from all sides. And how racism does nothing but continually stoke the flames of hatred and pain.",

It exams the hate that is bread in America's middle class, white community. Not only does it show why American youth become so angry, but it also looks into the people that exploit it. Its a story about change, about changing ones mind and most importantly about family. It pears into the power of peer pressure and how the force to conform can conquer relationships. The movie exams the fact that although one can change for the better, at some point your past mistakes will catch up with you. Karma 101.

468,7 September 2000,fleagles,8, An amazing film in its story and acting,"Edward Norton gives an incredible performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo-Nazi who goes to prison for murder, and his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who worships Derek, and who is heading along the same disturbing path.  This is a beautifully photographed and wonderfully written movie that takes a very strong subject, and forms it all into a truly unique film. Norton is amazing - He has such as tremendous range as an actor that it so difficult that he also played a neurotic New Yorker in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You.  His buffed-up physique, shaved head, and goatee all make him look incredibly realistic as a Los Angeles skinhead (and worried some that skinheads would become chic).  His performance is incredible, as are the standout supporting performances from Avery Brooks as the black teacher who believes in both Derek and Danny, and Stacy Keach (who seems determined to break his image as Mike Hammer) as the head white supremacist in town.  First-time feature director Tony Kaye (who also served as cinematographer) directs and photographs this film beautifully, and Anne Dudley's score is one to remember. This film will make you think about racism, Neo-Nazism, politics & race, and where hate really comes from - it is passed along from parent to child.",

You will not find one film with Norton that is just a walk-through picture.  American History X is most certainly one of the most thought-provoking movies he has ever done.  The story of a neo-nazi who goes through an ideological change in prison when he is befriended by a black man is very good.  But, Norton makes the story even better by giving his character a lot of intelligence.  I have to admit that although I disagree with EVERYTHING that the Norton character said before his conversion, he is the ONLY character of this kind who actually has intelligent, well thought out reasons for what he believes.",

He plays a highly intelligent Neo-Nazi which is something I have NEVER seen.  This is a very thought provoking movie.",

475,21 October 2000,Tom Murray,9, A study of the causes of racism.,"Man is a territorial animal. He will defend his property, often to the death. People put up fences; countries put up borders; wars are fought over control of territory. Man can, for a variety of reasons, also be nomadic. When one group of people moves into the territory of another, there will be animosity: Scottish Protestants emigrated to Catholic Ulster; Jews emigrated to Palestine and turned part of it into Israel; Europeans emigrated to America and displaced the natives. Attempts are being made to achieve some sort of reconciliation in these cases but the bitterness and hatred, caused by past revenge, make success difficult. When animosity exists between different races, it is called racism but it is no different than when the two contending groups are of the same ethnic background, as with the Scots and the Irish: both Celtic. It only matters that the two groups perceive of themselves as different in some way, even in ways that others would consider insignificant. American History X is about the racism created when blacks moved into the white Venice Beach section of Los Angeles. Derek's father was murdered by blacks and he desires revenge. He joins a Neo-Nazi group and becomes a highly respected leader. His opportunity for revenge comes when three blacks attempt to steal his car; he viciously murders two of them. Lack of witnesses allows him to escape a murder conviction and he spends only a few years in jail. During that time, he becomes disillusioned with other Neo-Nazis in the prison and he leaves them, and their protection. Miraculously, the blacks leave him alone, because he has befriended one of them, partly because of the influence of a black teacher, whom Derek respects, and who is always working for reconciliation and partly because his black friend accepted him, right from the start. This friendship causes him to abandon his hatred of blacks and feel remorse for his acts. When released from prison, Derek finds that his younger brother, Danny, has become a member of the same Neo-Nazi group and Derek attempts to free him from their influence. However, past actions have already made tragic events inevitable. The film is very intense. It left me feeling emotionally exhausted but very glad to have seen it and wanting to see it again. The acting is superb; the writing is very powerful; the characters are well developed and we care deeply about what happens to these two brothers. The central premise of the film is that reconciliation, however difficult, might be possible, if we strive for it diligently and with understanding.",
476,4 November 2009,Sanou_san,10, Unbelievable,"I'm always impressed how cool Edward Norton carry his character in every film his in. This one has to be one of his most deserving performance to receive an award. Certainly one of the few comments I've read, you got hauled into his character. And indeed it proved true. Edward Norton's character has a very captivating aura. In the first place we see him a complete racist freak, who's blinded so much with hatred and rage. Then we see him gradually cools down (when he got in jail). And we finally see a complete shift of his character from a cruel racist to a peaceful friendly man who doesn't care what's your color. Edward Norton had performed this character really well, and I mean truly well. You can feel the imbibed hatred and rage in his heart when he condemns and spit off the existence of blacks in their country. He even had gone to his limits (even hurting his family, blinded by rage), and this gave me the chills! Made me even squirm in my seat! Especially when I saw him so mad in a meal discussion throwing off their viewpoints concerning blacks and other foreign immigrants of their country of who's got the right and who's out. His younger brother in the film, like anyone else idolizes his brother and we see throughout as well how he transformed. I love the structure of the story. The film doesn't only give me the reason to like it because of the actors' ability to portray their role. The story has something in reality, very genuine and sublime. The actions and sequence where also convincing. The drama had all to get you hanging in and staying at your seats.

You might say this is Edward Norton's tour de force and I was so mesmerized by his performance, almost hypnotic. Don't be frightened away by Edward Norton.  This character is nothing like the actor, down-to-earth Edward Norton.  See him in other films, ""Primal Fear"" and ""Keeping The Faith"".  You will become a fan of his too.                          This film is about a Skinhead who gets revenge of the bad black men for vandalizing his car.  His little brother idolizes him.  I will not say anymore about the plot, but every person who is fed up with the neighborhood they live in and every parent who would like their teenager to be on the right path should watch this film.

But slowly as the film proceeds you scene after scene you feel that the main character played wonderfully by Edward Norton is another person then the terrifying psychopath you see from the first insane violent scene that is just good damn pointless. And when Nortons character changes for the better, is it his little brother played by Edward Furlong that is the new racist black sheep in the family that the big brother have to set on the path of good before its to late. This is the best film about racism ever made. It just sucks you in to this unfair world where nothing makes sense at all. I just love that a bad guy becomes good and finds his humanity its makes you feel good cause there is always a light in the end of the tunnel when evil appears. As I said before, the acting by the two Edwards is amazing and the movie just show how bad racism really is and why you should defently avoid at all cost.",

Who would have dreamed the baby faced kid in 'Primal Fear' could have pulled off a performance such as the one he gave as Derek?  I'll bet there were alot of auditions for this role.  I'll also bet that, once Norton did his thing, it was a slam-dunk.  Simply incredible and, disturbingly, incredibly believable.  Then again, he was aided by a fantastic script.  Playing the role as a very intelligent, though misguided young man, I found it hard to argue with his logic, twisted as it was (think about the scene at the dinner table).  That bothered me.  This guy is going to go a long, long, way.  Maybe another Robert DeNiro.  Just hope he doesn't O.D. on gangster roles.  Too much of a good thing, ya know?",

Ranging from pre- Nazi school nerd to post- prison adult, with a fabulously scary Neo - Nazi in between, he was well deserving of his Academy Award nomination. Not since early Robert De Niro films have I seen a young actor with such range, potential, and talent. I remember being impressed with his brilliant ""rookie"" year, 1996, when he appeared in Everyone Says I Love You, The People vs. Larry Flynt and Primal Fear. Now it seems he has taken the next step towards being one of the great actors. His portrayal of Worm in Rounders was solid, and Derek in AmerHistX is nothing short of brilliant.

Certain scenes, notably the two discussions at the dinner table ('Rodney King' and 'Native Son'), Derek's confrontation with Cameron at the party, and, for me, Derek's memories of himself and Danny at the seashore, are classic examples of what intelligent movie-making can be. The violence in this film is totally in the context of the story, and therefore all the more shocking for it. These are characters we grow to know and like, and their motivations are those of real people. This kind of film, which tackles tough, meaningful issues in the lives of everyday people, is all too rare these days.

'American History X' creates its characters through a series of black and white flashbacks that are narrated by Derek's impressionable younger brother Daniel, played by Edward Furlong. Daniel, who has witnessed his brothers violent threshold reach its fiery peak, has also decided to brand African Americans as enemy no.1. but hasn't suffered the consequences of his sibling idol as Derek's reign as racist leader lands him in jail for murder. Unlike Derek, Daniel has the opportunity to exit the world of white supremacy before it's too late as he sees Derek surprisingly turn his back on the nazi cult he helped create and ride a road to reform and regret. Director Tony Kaye has made a movie of relentless force and brutal vulnerability, a bold, aggressive and confronting vision that few young film makers fail to achieve.

When Norton grimaces after slo-mo action sequence (action b pic 101), his eyes seem to say 'look into my face and see the horror!' I looked hard and found nothing. This film is playschool meets Nazis and it just does not gel. Interested in movies about skinheads, without conventional plot lines supported by cookie cutter players and timeworn twists? See Tim Roth in 'Made in Britain' and Russell Crowe in 'Romper Stomper.' No bs films that tell it like it is. Violent they may be, but violence can't be gratuitous when it is central to the plot. I wish I could say the same for American History x - i.e Norton giving his foe a pavement sandwich. This is Kaye, and/or New Line's way of saying 'we're not afraid to shock!

I am afraid that contrary to the seemingly endless praise given to this film and its director, Tony Kaye, and indeed recommendations from my friend that I should see this film, when I did I felt cheated and annoyed. There's no denying that what the film portrays is shocking and powerful, and that Edward Norton's performance is equally powerful, almost coming close in intensity to De Niro's Bickle, and the set-pieces are well made, but the inability for the filmmakers' to create a convincing story spoilt the whole film for me - the way we see in endless flashbacks (often the sign of a weak storyteller), Norton's firstly ordinary, sane, likable character's seemingly easy conversion to a Nazi maniac just by his dad uttering a few racist sentences at the dinner table is frankly ridiculous. Plus his seemingly easy conversion back from a Nazi maniac while in prison, just through speaking to a nice black guy. I'm sorry, but it just negates the whole film's power. Not to mention the endless flashy camera techniques used by former ad director Kaye, NOTE: slow motion close ups of a running shower tap does not a good film make. The film opens on a black and white shot of the ocean, for no apparent reason, leading to the conclusion that Kaye thought he could appear as a 'clever' and 'sophisticated' filmmaker by showing us an 'arty' opening sequence. This kind of pretencion is as irritating as the lack of convincing back story. Nope, sorry Mr Kaye, wasn't for me.",

512,27 November 1998,T-10,10," graphic, powerful, compelling, and thought provoking","In the age of three hour movies I wish this had been.  In the just two hours the film did not develop some of its most im- portant story lines.  I wanted to see more development of Derek's move away from Neo- Nazi ideals and Danny's move towards. This may have served to give more meaning to the final scenes and made them seem less contrived and routine.  It may seem I did not like this film, but, in fact, I wanted to see more--more character develop ment, more dialogue between the main char- acters, more transitional scenes--just more!  On the positive side this is probably the most important movie of the year and is a ""must see"".  I particularly liked the cinematography.  The black and white flashbacks and the great number of close-up face shots were great.  They set the mood for the film as both dark and intense. The honest presentation of political and social problems that face the country in the late 20th Century is laudable.  Mr. Norton portrays a convincing, sometimes loathsome but sometimes very human even likable skinhead.  His journey to and from these ideals and the relationship with his younger brother, Mr. Furlong, make this a most compelling story.  Mr. Norton's performance is worthy of best actor consideration in his successful portrayal of this complex character.  I would emphasize that this film is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it is brutally (in all senses of the word) honest, and if you don't leave the theater thinking and/or talking then I suggest a brain scan.  Once again thanks to Mr. Norton for an outstanding performance.  Four stars for his performance and the topic even though it could have used a more (see above)",

In jail he is forced to meet and be acquainted with minorities he hated too much to know. when he's released, he comes home to find that his younger brother his headed to the same fate as his and tries to stop him. now, this basic subject has been executed to motion pictures in all kinds of versions such as Rob Reiner's ghosts from the past but unlike that movie (which is pathetic, if i may say so) this movie tries to deal with the basic cause of racism instead of merely explaining it by the nature of southern yahoos that usually have the I.Q. of algea (according to reiner et al) finally, I would like to salute Edward norton who, if not tempted to play in mediocre hollywood films, is bound to be the next Al Pacino (i didn't say De-niro because he deteriorated so badly that i can't even talk about it). summing up: rent the movie justify your movie freakiness or at least remind yourself why you became one in the first place.",
516,2 May 1999,Brad K.,9, Edward Norton and American History X will leave you breathless.,"American History X is one of those rare films that once it's over will make you sit silently for a few minutes not moving.  American History X is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.  Edward Norton (Primal Fear, Rounders) stars as a recently released prisoner (for the brutal murder of 2 black men) who has recently given up being a Neo-Nazi.  When he comes back from prison he finds that his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong (Terminator 2, Little Oddessa) has followed him down the same path as a Neo-Nazi.  Norton with the help of Furlong's teacher, well-played by Avery Brooks (TV's Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, The Big Hit), tries to get Furlong out of that lifestyle.  The film deals with many flashbacks showing how Norton got where he is now in the film.  The film is disturbing at times, but always compelling and very powerful.  Norton is incredible in the lead role, deserving the Oscar nomination he received.  Furlong is great also, in a difficult role.  Fine support work is turned in by Guy Torry (Life, Ride) as a black man in prison who helps turn Norton around, and Beverly D'Angelo (Vegas Vacation, Lightning Jack) as Norton and Furlong's caring mother. Highly recommended.",
517,20 September 2021,Wwmbrd,8, Powerful,"A powerful message that neither glorifies racism, it's effects, or countereffects of the disease it symtomizes. I was most impressed by director Kaye's ability to entice the audience to sympathize with a violent, hateful protagonist in some tender moments of familial love, and yet revile his deeds by portraying them in their most brutal, realistic light. Derek Vinyard is not a good man, but under the intolerance and hate is a wound that is not dissimilar to the persons of color he victimized. I was also appreciative of how Kaye also doesn't portray any one group as purely a victim, in what could have easily been a (more) racially charged and motivated film than it was. It doesn't glorify gang activity, white supremacy, prison life, or racial struggles in any way, but instead paints a visceral picture of the multifaceted reality that it represents; a microcosm of real life... That nothing is fair, and it's how we choose to address the challenges we're presented. Hate never made anyone's life better.",

I also have to say that Edward Furlong also did an excellent job portraying the younger brother.  I found myself thinking about this movie the next day.  The black&white/color aspect was interesting.  It both served as a divider between the past and the present, but I believe it also served as a metaphor for the closed mind Derek had in the black and white footage and the enlightened mind he had in the color footage.  Pretty deep, huh? Definitely left an impact.",

520,8 July 2020,Rebul21,10, A gripping performance from Norton leads American History X to glory.,"American History X tells the story of a neo-Nazi and his overcoming of hate, and his attempts to prevent his brother from following in his footsteps. The film shows how blame only leads to hate, and hate creates nothing positive, only suffering and regret.
Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard, the former neo-Nazi, is enthralling and showcases his exceptional ability. Norton bosses every scene he is in, whether he is portraying a neo-Nazi or one that has overcome that path; it almost seems as if he is portraying two different characters. Some extremely powerful speeches - whether for good or bad causes - are excellently written, showcasing the ability of screenwriter, David McKenna, and Norton delivers them exceptionally.
Supporting performances from many of the cast, including Edward Furlong, who plays younger brother Danny, are well done. Danny in many ways portrays the shadow of his older brother; he is on a very similar path, and this is clearly shown when comparing the Derek seen as a neo-Nazi in clever flashbacks to Danny now, and the gap in mentality and attitude there is between the brothers after Derek is released from prison. We get a more precise view of Danny's thoughts in small sections we see in his essay, American History X; he writes the words 'It doesn't bother me anymore' on his computer screen, and this in some ways explains his demise and how he has been desensitised to violence and hate.
The use of different characters to represent levels of extremes and how people influence one another is profound. The headteacher of Danny's school, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), is the first person in the film we see try to discourage Danny from falling into a hateful path, he represents a sort of hope that one can be better than full of views of hatred and division. The new partner of the brother's mother, Doris (Beverly D'Angelo), represents how people with decent views can be pushed aside by hatred. And characters on the other end of the spectrum, such as the brother's friend, Seth (Ethan Suplee), who embodies blind thuggery. How these characters influence both Derek and Danny show how important it is to listen to the right people and is also a showcase of the intelligent writing on show.
Director Tony Kaye utilises every minute of this film to full effect; no scene is wasted. The film has a good pacing and is done very well with flashbacks and current events. The cinematography is quite brilliant, the use of the noir effect on all flashback scenes is crucial. The black/white contrast is a theme ever-present in this film and the noir effect captures this perfectly. The fact that present scenes are in colour also shows a contrast and change in attitude of Derek; as in the flashback scenes he is a neo-Nazi skinhead, full of hate, and in present scenes he is a changed man, a neo-Nazi no more, and a man who has lost his hate.
The film shares some similarities with Shawshank Redemption: they both involve crime and prisons, but more importantly can give the viewer a slightly different outlook on life. Shawshank has been known to give many viewers a different outlook on life in general - how to view life and how to be more positive. American History X can give a viewer a slightly more nuanced look on life; it shows how hate gets you nowhere, it only causes evil, and that losing that hate can make your outlook on life much more positive.
American History X has a cleverly intertwined story that is still relevant today. Edward Norton's performance is outstanding along with the screenplay, and although the main character may not be relatable on face-value, the way his mind works, is manipulated, and the mental experiences he goes through can be compared with those of an everyday person. This makes for a captivating experience and is well worth the watch.",
521,26 December 2020,sudhirkumarpal8,8," It's one of the most evergreen subjects, it tells about and so is the movie.","At first I couldn't make sense of the title itself ""American History X"" and nothing about the civil wars, American revolution, Independence etc. but look in deep and in America unlike India it had always been about the racism. The whole history of America rests on that. So basically the movie covers it all and so justifies the title.
And if you look at the world and and that's the only problem we have, if we could just short out our religious, racial, fascist beliefs, it will be all. Be it any country, its always about the differences. I India-religious , in America-racial.
It can't always be t** for tat. You can't be selectively good or bad, you are what you are for everybody.
The movie drives one point really well, that hate begets hate and nothing else, no victory no prosperity only the doom, death and destruction. The earlier we get the point the earlier we can save ourselves from the doom.
The performance by the ""Fight club' guy was amazing, totally the opposite character of the one played in that. I was shocked to see the transformation, I mean how that skinny guy who was not up to stand up for himself, turned into a well chiseled one fighting for some people.",

If you can think of a way to make a movie about racism without the characters being racist let us know ok???

526,16 February 2021,judemcrobbie,10, How politics in a movie should be done-A must watch!,"This movie is heavily centred on race. The conflict between black and white mainly, hence the B&W. This creative choice not only compounds the narrative of the flashbacks, how the protagonist sees the clear divide between black and white, but also the idea to see the difference between the new ideas of the new moments.
There are some truly mortifying scenes that if I were to say could ruin the movie. I really do not recommend watching this unless you are at least a mature 15.
For a movie so centred on race, it's so well done. It is more of a teaching experience, letting the idea grow in your mind. This is better done than most movies on touchy films as they do not really give you the ability to think, shoving it all into your face not letting you think about right and wrong for yourself. This movie so powerful for this exact reason. Especially how main protagonist is someone, as a society, we are meant to hate. Despite this, the movie is through the eyes of the adoring younger brother, so he is presented as a good character for the majority of the time.
The humour in this movie is so well placed but also incredibly funny. It's usually used to make us enjoy, or like a Lamont (Guy Torry) is made to see the changes in ideals through the movie, especially for the protagonist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton). Lamont's personality represents that of the good of humanity, juxtaposed to him in jail. This shows no one is truly good of heart.
Edward Norton is astonishingly brilliant in this role. Yes the acting in the flashback is unbelievably good, but he time after he's out of jail is for me what makes it the best. The little details are what makes this role some of the best ever. For example, when he hears racist words (A word he has previously uttered personally) he grimaces and turns away.
The speeches are beautifully written with some of the most powerful dialogue ever written, but it truly comes from Norton's delivery.
This movie is just incredible. It will stick with me forever. It has truly enlightened me to bigger issues in this world and the other side of the argument. It has helped me to not understand nor empathise with the other side, but see the opposite side.
This is not a movie for the week of mid nor of heart, but it is truly one anyone should watch in such political times.",

Not only was this movie not great, it wasn't even good. It was pretentious and heavy-handed, with a nonsensical story line trying so hard to mass itself off as gritty and profound. The swelling, dramatic orchestral music is horribly overused, along with such other tired cinematic cliches as unnecessary slow-motion to show the audience that they are seeing a pivotal moment, and black-and-white as a pseudo-artistic sign that we are seeing a flashback.

Tony Kaye's direction leaves much to be desired, and the musical decisions within the film make you feel like you're watching The Last of the Mohicans, and not a contemporary film about race.  Derek Vinyard's transformation from skinhead to savior is admirable, but even this main character's development is done poorly, as are the other roles.  The plot (though somewhat lacking in sophistication) is engaging enough, yet Edward Norton's superb acting alone saves this piece from being completely unwatchable -- further convincing this viewer how much better this movie would have been under different direction.  I'm sad to conclude that this is yet another movie highly undeserving of its lofty ranking. 6/10.",

Mother's character and the scene where the argument turns into a fight was just too powerful. When mother is shown battling poverty as  well by sacrificing comfort for her kids, it moved me to tears. Also it shows that sometimes one good person, like the black guy in prison who becomes a friend to the main character, his niceness and attitude changed that man's life and saved him.

The story is about ideology, how ideology works and spreads, hate, the root of hate and change. All of this is brought to the screen in an absolutely stunning way. Not only great black & white footage, but also breathtaking closeups and slow- motion make for a beautiful movie. The music is just beautiful as well. This movie stuck with me for quite a while (maybe it had a little more impact for me than others because I'm German, who knows), and I still think about it a lot. I definitely recommend this movie.

But what really shocks you is the idea that it is an entirely feasible situation; that the ideas the characters express in the movies is also expressed by real people in real life situations. Although this movie revolves around Neo-Nazis, it does reflect upon tensions within society as a whole. It's not only about skinheads and their crazy WW2 ideologies, it's in general about the misconception of delimiting ""us"" and ""them"", about failing to see how human all of us are, and instead turning to the humanness of ""my"" group, and the lack of humanity of everyone else. It is about the very human attitude of putting the blame into other people, and it is also about that other very human attitude of guiding our behaviors according to our feelings as opposed to common sense.

Ignore the hype though: this is a stand-out film. Beautifully lit and shot in black and white it is a tale of hatred and redemption, exploring far-right racist hatred and the violence that underscores many male relationships. The cinematography and lighting are astounding: this is Kaye's debut film (preceded by an illustrious career as a commercials director) and he triumphs. The performances he draws from his lead actors (Edwards Norton and Furlong)are remarkable, career bests from both and it is depressing, though perhaps not surprising, that neither were recognised with either BAFTA or Oscar wins.

I enjoyed every aspect of the movie and would watch it again. The ending takes a stab into the viewers emotions, showing us the untimely death of our would-be protagonist. The scene only worsens when Derek rushes to the school and finds his younger brother lying dead in the urinal. The screams, shrieks, and cries from Derek nearly brought me to tears. The journey he had undergone, though revolutionary, was not enough to save his younger brother from the fate that was already sealed from following in his path of being a Neo-Nazi.",

I went into this movie like so many other people (probably because the thought of Nazis is enough to get me me to go get a gun and be rid of these people), and, of course, I came out better for the wear. The film and the way it portrayed (kind of cut-and-paste editing) is very effective for something this real and brutal. SPOILERS, it's not going to be pretty...... It states that Derek tries to prevent his brother from becoming a skinhead soldier like he was, if anything, he's preventing him from being affiliated w/ the neo-Nazis since he doesn't want him to be marked like he was (which we see power by affiliation and it's causes), also, I'm sure Danny watching his brother curb-check a Crip (who,if you ask me, probably wouldn't have kissed the curb anyway)and then look at his expression of anger and pride when he's arrested, it tends to keep one from ever wanting to become anything that barbaric. I couldn't swallow the fact that someone like Derek would reform their beliefs after prison, but being raped by your own kind and realizing that you should look to better your life rather than your pride (also finding out that your leader is a squealer helps), would make someone wake up and change things anew (good thing I realized this in my life as well, this validates this film portraying how hatred turn one's ability to love into destruction.) My qualm w/ this film, and this does tend to happen in real life, is the fact that Sweeney asks Derek to talk skinheads out of being skinheads, especially since Sweeney understands that Derek needs breathing room for being back into the outside world, that was just plain wrong, but it also makes the ending more hard-hitting than it would've been. I say no matter who you are, check this out, but if your looking for a political agenda, I have to say I deeply symphatize w/ your ignorance. A 10!!!",

The most powerful, iconic, and infamous scene in American History X, as you may have guessed, is the curb stomp scene. When I first saw Edward Norton's character kick that robber's head on the curb, I actually felt my head split open in unison with the guy and my heart plummet into my stomach. The shot that followed also really got me, in which Norton, as he is being arrested, puts his hands on his head and turns around. His eyes are wide open and staring at his dumb-struck younger brother, his eyebrows raised, and his smile stretching ear to ear. Across his face are etched the words, ""I have no regrets. Absolutely no regrets."" The film is a shocking and tremendously powerful one that has a strong message about the immorality of Nazism and racism. It's a visit to a world that most of us hope to never encounter, let alone join. Surprisingly, the graphic content in this film doesn't compel me to give it a lower rating. There's a equilibrium in the violent and nonviolent scenes, which is why I'm giving this film a 10/10",

The story is about a former skinhead (played superbly by Edward Norton, who is going to hit it big) who is sent to jail for an intolerable crime. He then ""changes"" (I don't know how, but I can tell you that the film didn't show that, and if it did, then not enough) and comes out of jail, only to come home to his younger brother who seems to have been influenced by him and the story moves on about how the character tries to change his brother's views. As realistic and frightening as the film is, it goes overboard with torture and suffering. There are many scenes which could have been trimmed, including the brutal food market invasion of the skinheads, and an unwatchable prison rape scene. The camera angles are poor, with too many closeups at times. It is a beginning achievment, but I felt discouraged because the topic and story should have been given to a masterful director, like Scorsese, and all the brutality would have been shown in a more absorbing and watchable way.

In comparison, the present time sequences are poor but still well done.     Even though the acting in the film was excellent, a lot of things could have been done to make this film better.  I think the prison sequence could have been even longer, and I would have preferred if we saw just how changed Derek really was.  I also felt like I didn't really know Faruiza Balk's character very well, but this could be a good thing showing she was a one-dimensional idiot.        I was really impressed with the way they made Edward Norton look in his skinhead prime, he actually looked menacing and scary.  I also liked the directing style for some strange reason.  Someone pointed out before it seemed amateurish, but I disagree. This was a good, thought-provoking film.  It showed where racists get their beliefs and just how crazy something out of control can become.  It showed the horrors of hate crimes in a way other movies have failed to do in fear of being too frightening.

Ed Furlong also gives a good show as Mr. Norton's little brother. The most disturbing thing about this movie, I think, is the fact that I found myself seeing points in what Derek Vinyard (Norton) was saying. What if Rodney King had hit a kid, then attacked the police? Would we be thinking the opposite? And what his father was saying about two white men who scored higher on the fireman's test than two black men, but didn't get the jobs because of affirmative action. Honestly, I don't support that kind of thing. If there are seven white men and three black men who have the credentials for ten top jobs, then those are the men who should get the jobs, not five men, five women, or five white men, five black women.

In this movie we are shown the most terrifying murder that I have seen on film. It really felt like someone put a knife in my guts, and turned it around. This is the only reason, why this movie should not be one of the best. On the other hand, it could also be another reason for it to be even better, because it dares to show the main actor doing such a terrible thing. And even though you know he did this, you learn so much about him, that you later in the movie forgive him, because he changes, and at the end, he is almost a hero in your mind. When I read the comment of Ari NY on the main page, two days before I saw the film, I thought that he most certainly overrated this movie. But now I have to admit that he was right. I wouldn't say this is the best movie I ever saw, but it's up there with the greatest.

609,19 June 2012,g_ryder,10, Rewrite your history for your own sake.,"The interesting title of this movie supposedly comes from the teacher in the school (Dr Sweeney) who tells his student (Danny) to write an account of his life especially in regard to his relationship with his brother who is a Neo-Nazi Skinhead whom he idolizes and wants to follow in his footsteps. The teacher is telling Danny not to be stuck in the past of others who have made the same disastrous choices but to find for himself whether he is capable of thinking on his own rather than follow the logic and rhetoric of a gang of bigoted Nazis. By writing out his own story, Danny first revisits his past, and finally discovers through the experiences of his brother in prison that indeed he has only been following the prejudiced logic of others, a logic that is fortified into an emotional frenzy of hatred by the archaic rhetoric of people like Hitler, and in this process they have become mere pawns in a game of domination that seems to go on eternally. The whole point of the movie is that this game of domination is a lose-lose game of false or illusory honor or pride in which even the 'king' is eventually forced to commit 'hara-kiri', whereas the pawns, whether on the side of the oppressor or the side of the oppressed who react violently, are either slaughtered or lead a foolish, meaningless life of subservience or futile violent reprisals in which they keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again, learning nothing from their past. So American History with the suffix X (symbolizing the unknown – that is, capable of being reinterpreted without racial prejudice) is the attempt to breakout of this vicious power game, so that something valuable can be learned from History, rather than be trapped in it. The X is also a sort of tribute to Malcolm X who renounced his racism against whites and said that the problem of race was not merely an American problem but a world problem – a problem of humanity (Dr Sweeney's story about dealing with the problem is quite similar to that of Malcolm X's transformation of attitude). This movie is an attempt to deal with this problem by pointing out that this must be dealt with fore-mostly in the educational institutions and that the teachers have a crucial role in this. If this issue is not dealt with at the school level, then it becomes extremely difficult to correct at the later stage of an individual's life as there are no existing institutions that deal with this issue of reforming racial prejudices and attitudes. The turning point in the movie comes when Dr Sweeney posits the key question regarding the problem: ""I didn't get no answers because I was asking the wrong questions. You have to ask the right questions – has anything you have done made your life better?"" Yes, everything depends upon the questions that you put to yourself and then honestly try to answer those for your own sake. A near perfect acting by all the leading cast, excellent editing and well researched script that presents all the main arguments on this issue concisely makes this must-watch movie, especially for young people in schools.",

Whether Norton deserved it over Benigni (I hope that is the right spelling) is a question worth debating, both were career-making performances. I think that Norton probably deserved it a little more for 2 reasons: 1. He plays COMPLETELY against type. You can not believe that this is the same relatively tame Edward Norton who won so many people over in such movies as Rounders and the People Vs. Larry Flynt. Rarely are there such acting transformations. 2. Norton carried the movie. The direction was somewhat sloppy, the script had a couple holes here and there, and besides Furlong's convincing peformance as an impressionable youth, the acting is only so-so. But Norton was solid, convincingly ranting and raving and recruiting. The slow transformation of Furlong's character into a neo-nazi under Norton's influence and then the transformation back to tolerance truly exemplifies how the Nazi movement could have spread through Germany over 60 years ago. The movie is definitely worth a watch. Some heads may be turned by it, even.",

This film deals with the naivety of racism in America, and how young kids, like Edward Furlong's character Danny Vinyard, can be drawn into a life of hate without even realising what they're hating in the first place. Contrasting two periods of Derek Vinyard's (Norton) life, American History X shows the despair and anger that are bred from ignorant hate but also the enlightenment that is found when the hate is lost and the anger drains away. The pulsating rage of Vinyard's character as he lashes out at his mother's partner is painstakingly juxtaposed against his feelings of sorrowful regret, as he attempts to save his brother from making the same mistakes he did.

If, however, you already know most or all of the above, you might get bored, or marvel at what a remarkably ""clean"" movie was made out of such an inherently ugly subject. Sure, the two strayed heroes have their dark sides but both of them, when they're not doing their white-supremacist gang thing, are mostly mild-mannered, well-behaved, polite kids you'd love to have baby-sit your daughter. It's no wonder then, that this dark side is so easily dropped by both at once - it didn't stick in the first place.

A highly respected Neo-Nazi named Darek gets out of prison and attempts to mend the damages done to his family by his hate-filled life.

He tells him that he is ""poisoning his families dinner with his jewish ni**** loving hippy bullsh**"" then he tells him to get the fu** out of his house. That part is hysterical.

642,2 February 2005,curtman2,10," A Searing Blow to the Face, A Cultural Cornerstone","""American History X"" is one of the most graphic, brutally honest, harrowing, and challenging films you'll ever get to experience. Period. Featuring Edward Norton as a reformed Neo-Nazi, immersed into an endless cycle of hate and just released from prison with a dire awakening for tolerance, this is a study that doesn't question its subjects' animosities and hostilities as much as it delves into their world, consumed by social depravity and intolerance towards all, endeavoring wherever and whenever they might simply to promote white supremacy across America. The narrative is Derek Vinyard (Norton)'s younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), who is assigned, nay, obligated, to write a paper detailing his influence Derek's path to social degradation so that he might better understand how to grip with his embedded anger and perhaps relinquish it. There's nothing pretty about this harrowing and powerful story, yet it demands to be hearkened: it's brutal and incendiary, taking us deep inside a culture of hate, and having us understand the roots of the subjects' animosities. It's timeless and timely, unequivocal and unflinching, and it is about as uncompromising as a series of dour blows to the face, and then some. Watching this incredibly potent and brutally honest study of the roots, repercussions, and reformations of a culture of hate is a transformation of reckoning: its tone is dark (manifested in black and white cinematography), and whatever message that is trying to be conveyed, it is sincere, yet not entirely hopeful. Edward Norton is astoundingly human, in encompassing the chastity, and evoking the chilling menace of deep-seated abomination. This is one of the most powerful human studies I have ever endured: it is intent on tackling the most consuming quality of man in examining its sources and its brutal extent of barbarity and inhumanity, even showing us that hate and prejudice is so powerful it can collapse even the dearest relations. The plot is structured scatalogically rather than chronologically, so that multiple themes can be examined at once, never settling for the here and now, but rather than the then and now to advance its themes and an understanding of its subjects' plighted deviances. In conclusion, one can hardly excoriate ""Histoy"" for exonerating Derek, Danny, and their Neo-Nazi cults, but rather, the film barrages the culture of hate, wherever and however it exists, because in the end, it squanders even the brightest potentials (e.g. Derek) and makes enemies of us all. The ending is exceedingly disturbing for me, as it virtually contradicts some critical and seemingly discernible themes developed throughout the film, of acceptance and tolerance through brutal reformation. Perhaps the message that Kaye is trying to elicit is that the cycle of hate perpetuates throughout cultures, and consumes and ultimately destroys its subjects. ""American History X"" is a contemporary cornerstone for cultures everywhere, that will only re assuredly resonate through time. **** out of ****",

The ending was sad, the acting was more-than-phenomenal, the direction was excellent, all of the scenes were gripping (especially when Derek was being arrested after killing a black man.  I still get chills down my spine when I think of that scene, with him smiling and then noticing his younger brother, and suddenly his whole facial expression changes in an instant).  I own this movie on DVD, and I've seen it three times.  Even my mom, who doesn't like any movies, watched this and was stunned.  She's seen it twice.  This is a great example of cinematic masterpiece that everyone should watch at least once.  My grade: A+",

Racism is also one of the film main theme thinking that white people have supremacy over people of colors.

The problem is that the overall message of the film - racism is malignant and doesn't provide the solace it promises - is completely undermined by Norton's presentation.  He gives a truly stunning performance, but his character (Danny) is so much more appealing when he's the mesmerizing racist poster boy.  When he returns from prison, after having sorted out all of his prior racist ideology, he's much less interesting to watch.  It was actually disturbing to me how sexy he was, shirtless in the street, after having just killed someone in one of the most violent ways I've ever encountered.

Rightists are violent, crazy racists! Oops--a few problems. ""Nazi"" means ""National Socialist."" They were leftists, not rightists. If the film had been honest it would have blamed the neo-Nazi movement as a response to the liberal/socialist programs in this country that fragment people into primitive, racial, ethnic tribes.

This movie totally disillusioned me and showed just how incomprehensible a true racist's mind is. I still can't shake the last, dramatic and shocking scene from my mind. It was one of the few times I've wept openly during a movie, and it shows the absolute futility of unconditional hate. This movie isn't for the emotionally immature.

Edward Norton is a powerhouse in this movie, nobody could have close to pulling this off as well as he did.  Un forunately, he was up against Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful, for the best actor award at the Oscars.  Edward Furlong comes out of nowhere and gives a brilliant performance playing his Norton's confused brother who is caught up in the whole Nazi mess that his brother used to be part of.

709,21 January 2012,singerbird,10, A Beautiful and Important film,"I watched 'American History X' at a time in my life when I was thinking deeply about all the facets of racism and how it arises from the environments we are born into. I'm happy to say his film not only confirmed my own thoughts on these subjects but gave me even more insight into this worldwide problem. Being a white female who is probably still quite naive about racism because none of it ever comes my way, I am glad about the things I learned from this film. I find it interesting (and depressing) how so many movies and TV shows out there seem to glorify this idea of 'retribution' or vigilantism; the idea that one is not only righteous in murdering someone who has wronged them/harmed their family, but they gain respect from their peers (or those viewing the film)for doing so. Until I watched American History X I was yet to find a film that glorified forgiveness and change. For most of my life, I myself did not understand the concept of forgiveness, and unquestioningly believed in things like capital punishment, like many others around me (thankfully, I don't anymore!) What I love and relate to in this film is that it illustrates that every person, even those furtherest into their own beliefs, can change, and should be given the chance to do so. Some may say that the ending is cliché, but honestly I think when it comes to films with a message like this one, such observations are irrelevant and mundane. The ending was vital to the overall point of the film because it serves as a warning. At the risk of sounding cliché myself, the end of this film warns us not to carry on the cycle of violence, but to forgive, and let people change. It's called evolution :)",
710,28 February 2014,ChrisBlackbird,9, Stunning movie,"The beginning was intriguing, middle kinda drowned it with Edward's temperament arguing with the family. The biggest thing about the movie is the sad end. Anyhow loved how the actors played. White ""bigotry,"" either in a current or historical context, is a favourite Hollywood theme. The films they churn out frequently portray society as ""dominated"" by a cruel caste of Whites who are grotesquely unfair towards minorities. These ""victimized"" minorities are presented as tolerant, open, understanding, calm, gentle and virtuous. In contrast, Whites are portrayed as brutally insensitive, oppressive, intolerant, hateful, violent, greedy, narrow-minded and destructive. These films show how the mean spiritedness of White Gentiles deeply hurts angelic minorities, who are at a loss to understand such raw hatred. Frequently, they feature a benevolent minority with tremendous patience and moral conviction who seeks to exorcise the poisonous racism demonstrated by the White characters (the very preachy Guess Who's Coming to Dinner starring Sydney Poitier is a shining example). The hypocrisy of reinforcing such crude racial stereotypes, when the prime message of these preachy films is that stereotypes should be eliminated, is seemingly lost on those who make them. The twisting of reality in the service of a ""progressive"" cause. a controversial essay near the beginning. The portrayal of White people as gullible and easily manipulated by ""misinformation"" promulgated by charismatic ""bigots."" A main character who, through deception, is rapidly transformed from being naive and innocent into a prominent neo-nazi/skinhead activist. A reversal and atonement for this neo-nazi/skinhead association. A link, or continuum, established between well-articulated and justifiable White racial frustration and neo-Nazism/skinhead-ism. Crude attempts to shock the audience with exaggerated scenes involving violent Whites who batter, kill and/or severely abuse minorities.

No one has ever to my knowledge made a film about Nazism.  It's all ways been considered such a sacred thing that no director, producer, or movie goer would ever want to touch.  The amount of symbolism and irony in this film is unbelievable.   Edward Norton as usual delivers a brilliant preformance as a White supremicist who is jailed for murdering two gang members for attempting to break into his car.  While he is in prison his younger brother (Edward Furlong) begins to show signs that he is following in his brothers foot steps.  While in prison nortons character meets a group of fellow skin heads who end up turning on him.  It is then that he relizes that you can't hold a certain group of people responible for the actions of just a few, and that hate is just a waste of time.  The entire cast delivers an excellent preformance.  I strongly recomend this film to those with a strong stomach and a desire to see a film that wasn't made for profits, but made to teach something.

It's amazing to see a single film take a character and develop him in such a way that it seems like two opposite and distinct personalities.  Ed Norton gave the performance of his life in this movie, and it's too bad that the Academy Award for best actor can't go to two people in a single year.  The thing that impresses me the most is the way that they didn't stereotype the characters like they did in ""Higher Learning"" or make them completely wooden like in ""Juice"" or ""Menace.""  Norton's shining and most convincing moment didn't even come with dialogue in this film.  The flashback scene where Derek just stares at Danny while he gets arrested, with that God-awful grin on his face will probably haunt me for days.  I guarantee this movie will be shown in high schools and anger management classes for years to come.",

On the plus side:  some really solid acting, including Edward Furlong, Bevery D'Angelo, Stacy Keach, Guy Cory, Ethan Suplee, and most striking because it is so understated, Elliot Gould as the mother's Jewish boyfriend.  Other pluses:  a different look at another kind of bigotry; the relationship between the brothers; the interplay between Norton & Cory; the powerful prison scenes.   On the downside: the heavy handed music, the preachiness, Sweeney's cardboard character, the pretentiousness of some of the arty photography, etc.  One does wonder what a better director (Spielberg, Scorcese)  might have done with the film!

It almost has a documentary feel to it, the way we observe Derek's development is so well portrayed - it's an odyssey of a journey. It reminds me, in some ways, of Oliver Stone's Talk Radio (another great film). Here is a guy with some real pain inside and is looking for an outlet. Well, he finds it with the help of Stacy Keach's character and it would have been interesting to see their initial encounter. This movie succeeds where lesser attempts (like Higher Learning) fail, probably because the film treats all of its characters, racists and non-racists alike as people (not an easy thing to do) and not just cardboard racial or social stereotypes. The dialogue is tremendous. I don't know why people here seem to have trouble with Derek's laundry co-worker, his dialogue is really so much more than simple jokes.

The magnifying lens into people's souls is thought - provoking unlike anything else I've ever seen, most notably when the most ironic of climaxes occurs. Because of their lack of true racism, Derek denounces the Aryan Brotherhood and is raped, beaten and left for dead, only for him to be saved by Lamont, a black - man. To see the anguish Derek endures to try to repair his misdeeds, first through his friendship with Lamont, and later through his little brother is heart - wrenching and for Danny (Edward Furlong) to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of racism provided a visceral reaction few movies have gotten from me.

Soon, it became one of my favorite films, and besides for Saving Pvt. Ryan, I thought it was the best film of the year.  It depicts drama, violence, and other elements so excellently, so brutal, it can get a little scary at times. The film is about a teenager named Derek Vinyard (oscar nom. and shoud've been winner Edward Norton).  Right when he and his family were doing well near Venice Beach.  But, after his father, a fireman, gets murdered by a black man, Derek feels enraged, and with a felo neo-nazi, forms the DOC (I don't know what this means, but the org is only for Venice beach Nazis).  He and his group vandalize stores with Extreme prejudice.  But after he catches 2 black men try to jack his car, he goes to jail for murder.  Jail dissolved his ways of thinking (partly thanks to his teacher played by Avery Brooks). When he returns, he wants out (and also for his follower brother played by Edward Furlong).  The rest you'll have to see for yourself. This film explores many psychological transformations and torment.  And thanks to great performances (by all characters especially Norton) this makes the film great and provocative",

One thing that really stuck deep within my soul is the realism that the people that are behind all these terrorist acts have in their minds reasons for their behavior.  I felt sorrow for the incredibly true to life racist inequality that is prevalent everywhere.  Edward Norton was absolutely brilliant in this film!

758,12 December 2002,BlueHeMan,9, A Powerful must see Drama,"Few films have had an effect on viewers (at least for me) like 'American History X.' The movie gives us excellent characters and a meaningful plot and send a timeless message...""hate is baggage."" The story involves Danny (Ed Furlong) and his brother Derek(Ed Norton). Danny is a punk and his teacher makes him write an essay after Danny does a book report on Mein Kampf. Danny eventually decides to just start writing about his older brother and skin-head leader, Derek. He tells about the family's past, how the father was killed by some black men and how Derek began to gain prestige as a Nazi Skinhead gang leader... Then Derek gets out of prison for murdering 2 black men.  Now a changed man, he tries to steer his younger brother away from the Nazi Skinhead movement by giving him his story of being in prison and how horrible it was. This creates conflict in Danny who tried so hard to be like is older brother and is already deep into the local skinhead group. The film does an excellent job of striking emotions in the viewer. As a white man, I cringed when Derek stomps on the black man's head while making him bite the curb, but I could sort of sympathize with Derek as he goes off on a rant at the dinner table about how minorities bring down the system. The film does this constantly to us: IT uses triumphant music, humor, and character strengths to make us believe in Derek. We cheer when the skinheads beat the black guys in basketball for possession of the courts, but then we want to strangle Derek and his buddies when they terrorize the local convenience store which employs minorty workers. This is the other way the film gets us, by making us angry at the skinhead group and ultimately sympathetic again for Derek and his family at the film's end. The acting is incredible throughout the film. Norton was horribly snubbed as best actor in '98 for this movie. The characters are believable and we learn to care about them. Even if you are sensitive to racial issues or squeamish about profanity or nudity, you should not avoid 'American History X'. It is very powerful and may change the way you feel about certain people. You don't want movies to tell you WHAT to do, but this one, like 'Boyz n the hood' gives you an idea of what might happen if you don't have an open mind.

Although enhances an excellent story, plus to add to it, a film in which has only very occasionally been done before, director Tony Kaye has created a master piece, which sets an extremely good example of what may happen to racist people. Having said that, the black and white scenes are unnecessary. Spielberg created 'Schindler's list' in black and white in 1993, and this worked beautifully, setting the field of a dark chapter in human history.

Myself being a black woman, this is quite a concept for me to admit. Seeing it again helped me formulate the opinion that all though it is flawed in some ways -  it seems that it is missing some scenes, like what else happened to Derek in prison his last few months and just who in the heck is this Cameron?

The movie is brilliantly made, but even so, Norton adds something to it, which I now know he adds to all his films, which makes it stick in your memory. And I am so glad that he did not sell himself out, by doing worthless movies- he is now about thirty and done only a handful of films. I am very much anticipating the film he is set to do with Brando in the future, THE SCORE, and if Norton, Brando and Spacey ever appear in a film together I guarantee it will be a masterpiece.

I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart.",

I understand that it's an acquired taste but everything about it just seems so real. It helps to know a little bit about the world history and not be close minded to things that actually happened. The characters are just so rightfully played and the voice of derek when he tells how things are and gives you a glimpse of things that are going on, wow! it just puts the whole situation into perspective, he is seems so calm and collected and such a little guy but really he has a huge heart and a point to make. I have cried, laughed and been a little dismayed with parts of this movie, but never would i ever not watch it.

Ed was absolutely blinding. And so was everyone else. Its not easy playing a racist when you don't agree nor condone such behaviour.

I am just so excited about how good this movie, the way it shows both sides, for Neo-Nazi and opposed Neo-Nazi, and the way he got from one opinion to the other (prison). Not only this, but when it shows him with the Neo-Nazi's it makes it look like Nazi's are good and it sticks you in his shoes, it evenly plays victorious music during the racial basketball that kicked the blacks off his court and showed it like it was a good thing he did and he was hero, then it goes from B & W to color and shows he sees more clearly at what he did.

HATE ...mine was nationalism type and for one time my whole childhood was under nationalism.I didn't learn from parents or anyone, we kids learn it on streets. It's ridiculous how you can HATE someone that you don't even know and we as kids didn't even know why. But human needs HATE, he needs a group of people with same ideas who would make him part of something, part of something bigger, so he can be someone. 
One period in my sixteen years long life, I was under influence of Adolf Hitler and that whole concept of national socialism and I need to confess that I was attracted to it.I had anger, fury spreading through my veins and it wasn't race anger or nationalism anger, but it needed a way to express himself and it found nazism, idea that is made of anger and fury. Scary thing is that, even yesterday when I watched this movie, I can see some truth in the philosophy of Derek Vinyard, main character of this masterpiece.My anger was HATE - HATE against system, capitalism, Church, manipulation, television and to everything that controls human and slows him down.
By the way, main actor in this movie is Edward Norton.This is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.He got so deeply in his character, that scene on beginning where cops arrest him, there is something that makes me sick.It shows the man who is lost in HATE, who is so certain in his procedures that he doesn't realise that he is just a pawn to someone bigger, more powerful.He was so proud of himself that he didn't see his little brother who was watching him doing that crime.So bizarre.
End of the movie is great.It doesn't matter how hard you try, you can't fight the HATE.And it doesn't matter if one side is trying to fight it because HATE always needs two sides. 
I'm imagining the end where Norton is shaving his head where we can see the full circle of HATE.",

And I can get disturbed by strange and obsessive people, not by a single swastika now and then. In this movie everything was so obvious, clear cut and outspoken: the dialogs seemed to be taken from high school plays: our thesis on racism'. The filming was smooth, there even were some background violins if I'm not mistaken. But there was nothing raw, nothing hidden, nothing seductive, nothing strangely energetic in this piece. The whole story got told'. And I really disliked the black&white of the flashbacks, that did not add anything worthwhile. Conclusion: Of coarse' I can agree with the message  but the filming was a little cheap. I'm curious about the movie Tony Kaye wanted to make.",

In prison he slowly befriends a black guy. This black guy, Lamont, tells Derek that he went for prison for 6 years because he stole a television and accidentally dropped it on the foot of a police officer. Derek realizes that black people and all the foreigners are not treated fairly. He also realizes that what he has been doing is completely wrong.

801,20 January 2012,ryanbye7,10, The flagship of movies about racism!,"American History X is a film that reminds me that movies can be about something important. Whether its a lesson that we as humankind come away from by the end about treating everyone equally and with respect. In my estimation this film should have won multiple Oscars. I understand why it didn't though. This is a film that shocks you with brutal, and I mean brutal truth. Edward Norton did score an Oscar nomination(HE SHOULD HAVE WON) for playing a vicious Venice Beach skinhead through certain actions ends up in prison and then becomes reformed for his bad deeds. It is so rare that you see an actor completely disappear into a character. For a while you forget that you are watching a movie and just experiencing life on screen. Every nuance that Norton brings to the table is like watching a cascade of fireworks ripping across the sky. Its up there with DeNiro's performance in Raging Bull. (Yes folks he is that good). There are scenes of such intensity with violent words or physical beatings that many people will be unable to look at the screen. Obviously the curbing scene. American History X is a story about family, redemption and of course the legacy of hate. Hate blinds us from its ripple effects and the damage that it causes to so many people. The only other film that comes close to these social issues is Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. But I think American History X is a better film because there is an ending in this film that just shatters your heart. I first saw this film at 19 and I am 32 now. I keep having different experiences because of my own experiences with racism and hatred. This is a film that sets the bar so high I don't think a film like this from a major studio comes around this often.

Its disturbing to realise that there is such hatred in the world. Norton delivers a career defining performance as does Furlong. The rest of the cast are all solid and altogether deliver a powerful piece of cinema. At times throughout the film I had to say to myself did that really happen, is such brutality real? But beyond the violence lies a problem that has been looked at one thousand different times and we still haven't found an answer. Perhaps there never will be an answer, but what we are shown in this film doesn't need an answer, it just needs to be witnessed to be believed. A masterpiece.",

805,22 July 2008,shortyrags,7, Haunting albeit Unrealistic,"Tony Kaye offers a dramatic film in the form of American History X, on the topic of racism, presented through the marginalized perspectives of Neo-Nazi nationalists. The story centers upon a bright, intelligent man Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, who unyieldingly displays his hate and disgust for other races. He and his group of friends repeatedly make life difficult for other races living in the area. Their actions finally climax when Derek goes too far and has to serve time in prison, leaving his younger brother, Danny Vinyard, played by Edward Furlong, to the will of the Neo-Nazi group. The story is powerful and features ups and downs in the characters that add an air of humanity to these otherwise inhumane Neo-Nazi racists. The characters, for the most part, are grotesque and in certain cases, utmost embodiments of our own insecurities towards different cultures and lifestyles, initiating inner turmoil sometimes. The film sometimes plays off these fears a little too much and does not offer them in a more objective and subtle way.",

Ridley Scott broke that mould, with the help of Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker and his brother Tony. More recently, they have been joined by video directors like David Fincher.

The complexity of this family, how their bonds to one another, and their painful experience of the world tugged them in various directions, was very moving. The cast was INCREDIBLE!!!

He is coward, cunning, eloquent and always very careful, keeping himself in the background. Seth, played by Ethan Suplee, is this person. We see how he manipulate young and easy impressionable boys and girls and builds up a hate within them. Derek Vinyard, a intelligent young man, became  a neo- Nazi because of something happening to him in the past.

Nobody can sit and watch while their brothers, sisters, sons or daughters get wasted in the street. I think that every man would react violently to that. It's just that it doesn't happen to everyone.",

830,2 December 1998,Juby,10, Critics go home,"I too am annoyed by all the critcis. They do not know a good movie when they see one. I went into this movie with no prior knowledge about the little rift between the director, the lead or the production company. And I really do not care too much about what the problem was. This movie was brilliant, beautifully directed, and casted. Ed Norton soared as the lead, his contrasting attitudes were played well (and he looked incredible). Ed Furlong was excellent as a teen with some issues. He was mature and realistic. Avery was great as the saivor. The rest of the characters were just as good. The plot was excellent, and the ending was so powerful that I actually shed tears. (This from the girl who did not cry during Titanic). I've recommended this movie to many, and when they come back they call me to say thanks for such a great movie. People should see this movie, and the bitter fight going on behind the scenes should stay there. The highlight of this movie is the direction, , which leaves me wondering why it was such a big deal. Bottom Line: See it, it has all the elements of a great film. Ed Norton and the director should be nominated for something!!!",

This film was far greater than Saving Private Ryan as far as script goes and surpasses Shakespeare In Love in every category.  The cinematography was excellent and the acting superb.  The screenplay should have at least been nominated at the Oscars, but not even that was carried out by the academy.  I can't understand how a film like this would be so carelessly overlooked as the best movie of 1998.  I actually gave this film a ten, and I have only given three films a ten in my entire IMDB career (American History X, Godfather, and Star Wars Episode 1).  I have to say that this film was eye opening in more ways than two.  It taught me not to discriminate, not to hate, and most importantly not to trust the academy awards when I want to see a good film.  There must have been politics involved in that one.",
832,2 March 1999,bobafett-16,9, A great film,American History X is a story about the effect of white supremacy. It stars the great actor Edward Norton as the Neo-Nazi who gets out of jail and finds his brother in the same group he was in.

It was overall a great film with great and mesmerizing performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.,
833,21 May 1999,PinnHed,9, A well-portrayed expose of hate. And remorse.,"This is one of those movies that begs your average moviegoer to hate it. Hate it for violence, for racism, for brutality.  The truth is, this movie would do more to abrogate racism, brutality, and (maybe) violence if it were shown more widely.  Edward Norton proves he is not interested in being a pretty boy, but an actor.  Edward Furlong continues to remind us all he's more than that effeminate kid from T2.  For those of us old enough to remember the birth of skinheads, this movie portrayed their hateful, baseless stance head-on.  If you were ever thrown in a moshpit at a Suicidal Tendencies show, you know how you were kicked.  By the biggest group of losers in town.  Until they found Derek Vinyard and felt vindicated. However, this movie turns around and displays the other side.  The mindless quest to be a gangsta.  Without concern.  The only downside of this movie is the preachiness which was understandable but overblown.  The generational influences in this movie are brilliant.  From Dad, to brother, to little brother, hate begets hate.  An excellent movie, with balls that movies like ""Colors"" would have benefited from.",
834,15 June 1999,LBCstreetZ,10, The best movie I have EVER seen in my entire life.!,American History X is more then a movie it is a way of life. It tells you what is going on the other side of the wall. The acting by the actors and actress were perfect. After watching that movie I gurantee you will be left stunned with your mouth open. The acting by Edward Norton should have won that oscar. His facial expressions were astounding and his looks left you breathless. I strongly erge you to go rent this movie and not watch it once but twice. A 5 star movie. You will not be disappointed.,
835,9 April 2000,bertie3,9, Better than I thought it would be,I found this movie rather interesting and thrilling. It shows a different perspective on race relations than the usual movies do. I am sure some would find it kind of pedantic-but that is the point of the movie. You have to learn from your mistakes and one can be redeemed from racist acts. What better reason to be engaged in a movie rather than preached to?,

I think that the message behind it is such a positive one too.  With the beginning black and white, and the end in color, Showing change.  You don't find many movies like this one these days.  To be about such a hard topic as racism and hate. One must see this movie to see meaning about what I am saying, and to understand the power.  From beginning to end, you won't mutter a word.

Will recommend for a one time watch only for the story. But the acting from Edward Norton played a another game. Nailed it. If you appreciate a good performance of acting then this is gonna amaze you. A hell of a actor, his transformation throughout the movie will take you to a roller coaster ride.",
841,20 December 2006,saoconrado40,9, powerful,"I don't want to give too much away to reader's who may not have seen the film, so I won't say much...but if I had to use one word to sum up American History X, it would be ""powerful"". This is the kind of film that is missing in the current film environment that is usually based more around flash than substance, ie special effects and a physically attractive cast are commonly used to win over audiences as opposed to a solid plot containing powerful messages that actually might make you think. I saw this movie last night and it is a fascinating insight into the insecurity of young people and their desire to belong to something, to feel accepted. I believe this theme is equally as prevalent as the denunciation of racism throughout the film. Another thing I liked is that the cast is portrayed as being incredibly human... nobody in this film is ""perfect"", as we frequently see in other films. From the protagonist to his young brother to the wise English teacher, they have all had their share of problems in the past, as well as in the present. I think it is a testament to the director and cast that we actually end the film sympathising with a convicted murderer. The moral of the film is that hate is baggage, and we reap what we sew in life. We need to ask ourselves that one question when our lives are veering off course ""Has anything I've done made my life better?"". For the protagonist in American History X, this simple advice is enough to turn around his life from that point on... but it is too late to undo the consequences of his wide-reaching influences, hurting him in the most painful place he ever could have imagined. So once again, this film is sheer power. Certainly it is disturbing in parts, and probably not for young children or the overly sensitive. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic film, truly one of the best of all time. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.",
842,3 February 2007,PeggyGoodwin,10," Compelling, Honest Film","I am always surprised when such a compelling film stays under the radar screen, as American History X did.

843,2 October 2014,panicgeo,9, The prodigal brother returns from prison to find out that his brother is following on his footsteps,Edward Norton is a Hollywood gem. I've always admire him as an actor and this movie is no exception. He plays the brother who returning from prison he finds that his little brother is following on his footsteps by joining a Neo-Nazi organization. The movie goes back and forth between the older brother's life before going to prison and his life after he gets out. The acting is impeccable and the story very good and the message timeless(especially with the current situation all over Europe). No doubt one of the highlights of the 90s' movie era and one of the best movies of Edward Norton (along with Fight Club and Primal Fear).,

After he is released from prison, he finds out that his brother, Danny Vineyard, is going down his same path.  Derek realizes that if wants to be at peace with himself, he must stop his brother from going down the road he went down.  The beauty of the film is captured in the last scene, when Danny shows that he has finally figured out what is important in life.

Finally a movie with an ending that isn't silly and predictable. Norton almost breaks through in this movie giving an all-star performance, we a great support cast including Edward Furlong. This movie will send you away thinking. The only lacking parts are some of the other cast members delivering stale obviously over-rehearsed lines at times like the first dinner table scene. Overall it gives presence to both sides of Racism and leaves you the feeling that neither side is justified. Norton learns not to hate, and that rage is bad. Then his brother is murdered by a black kid. It makes you wonder what exactly the director was trying to tell us. In the end, a 10/10 movie, all time favorite. Don't miss this one.",

848,6 July 2010,Dorrito79,10, One of my favourite movies EVER,"I saw this movie about 10 years ago when it came out in the cinema. None of my friends wanted to see it so I went on my own and I remember sitting there when it ended, and thinking about what just happened. And it lasted for days. This movie is one of the very few that changed the way I think of cinema, cinematography and the role of music. Ed Norton plays Derek, the right hand of a nazi leader and Ed Furlong is his little brother, who follows him whatever he does. When Derek kills a black guy trying to steal his car, he goes to prison for 3 years and there he faces the fact that everything he believed in was built on lies and deception, and belief can be twisted for the sake of convenience. He comes out as a changed man and the movie is the story of the next 24 hours, what Derek does next, as well as flashbacks to the reasons why he became a racist. Edward Norton is as brilliant as it gets. This is one of his major roles in his career. He leaves a deep impression and his change for the role, putting on 30 pounds of muscle and shaving his head, is jaw-droppingly convincing, considering his slim build and intellectual aura. Furlong is as memorable as in Terminator 2 - even though he is a sidekick, he plays the disturbed and dependent little bro perfectly well. Thinking he is a rebel, he is eating every misplaced ideology that he is given, without ever freely making choices for himself. Some of the shots stay with the viewer a long time after standing up from the chair, and the music is dripping with emotion. This is a gorgeous movie, a must see for anyone who appreciates quality cinema. Only criticism is about the ending of the movie that did not convince me, however, I do not feel strongly enough about it to take points off the perfect 10.",
849,4 July 2021,margaret_thanos,7, The Ending is Confusing,"This film was most certainly ahead of the curb in 1998, but tbh I have huge problems with the way the film ended, almost as if it was justifying this cycle of violence and what happens to Danny's character at the end. I think it needed a lot more explanation, because any white supremacist watching the film would just think 'exactly, Danny gets killed so we should remain as we are' which is a dangerous thing for a film to do. However, Edward Norton was fantastic in this role and the film was very confronting. It's a solid 7 for me.",

But I can honestly say that I am so glad that I did cause it's one of my favorite movies now. I love everything about it. I guess I'm different but the part were Derek makes the guy bite the curb is a part I like....not because of anyone's color just because he is protecting what is his. But I also love the fact that it shows that anyone can change themselves into being a better person, with a more open and loving heart. I hate the fact that the family is almost torn apart and that the little brother dies. For me the ending could or would have been better if both brothers had been able to change and lived a happy, loving life. But all in all I love it.",

852,9 October 2013,winstonwardell,10, this film is all Reich with me.,"without a doubt this film is the most emotionally moving film I've ever seen. The fact that Edward Norton did not win the Oscar for best actor only validates the bias nature of the Oscars and it loses credibility.Edward Norton shows a man with very strong opinions and how they are manipulated and form into this dark evil monster that he has to battle alone. Derek is character who does something very difficult even a morally sane person would struggle with, not just doubt his beliefs but confront them face on. we see this pure evil manifest into something even worse and yet he is able to gain perspective in jail. now this film hardly paints jail as a nice, lovely place were people go to find there moral compass but rather tries to show it as I suspect it really is; a crossroads for people to either gain perspective or continue to be blinded by there own ignorance. The black and white flashbacks symbolic of a world were Derek separated blacks and whites, beautifully depicts the internal conflicts he faced on a day to day basis only to show once he sees the light (represented by the return of colour) he is a different person still facing the same problems but his approach is different this is paramount and the anchor of the storyline. every character faces a crossroad but its only till perspective is gained will they emerge from this haze of ignorance and stupidity. this film is so down to earth it plummets to the core of the world it is illustrating and faces the monster that has left a trail of destruction, negatively influenced loved ones and physically harmed others, it does not wrap a pretty ribbon around it just makes you feel something and much like the characters in the film, leaves the audience with perspective and how racism manifests and who it affects.",

The message here is an obvious one, but it is played out so well.  Some movies just entertain you, and others make you think as well.  American History X is certainly the ladder of the two.  The brutality of the film might be a little tough for some viewers to handle but, if you can get past it, it is well worth it.  Some of these scenes are the most powerful ones I have ever seen.

867,2 October 1999,Gordovox,7, Disappointed,"I have to say that for all the hype I heard before seeing this movie, I was greatly disappointed in it. Although Edward Furlong, and Edward Norton play strong roles in this film, there was just something missing in the story to explain the sudden life affirming changes in Norton's character. I don't buy that his little bit of jail time could change his apparently strong hatred and negative emotions to his rival race. There just wasn't enough character involvement, or educational development in his character to believe that he could make such a wise decision. We are led to believe that he is a very smart, and charismatic leader, in forming and running his own ""white supremecy"" group, yet it all comes to a grinding realization when he spends some time in jail with a few black people, and sees how his own ""supremist"" group deals on an even keel with all of the other races in prison. I think this movie had so much more to offer, and started off on the right track, but just went flying along on that track too fast, and missed out on some issues that should have been dealt with on the characters level. I give it a 5 out of 10...but could have been easily an 8 or 9 if only character development wasn't rushed along so fast.",

This film is one that I think makes and impact whether you love it or hate it. I thought it was terrific and Norton's oscar nomination for his role as modern day Nazi Derek Vinyard was truly deserved. This film tells the story of how Derek came to reform while spending time in prison for the murders of two black men who were trying to steal his car. Derek, just released, realises that his younger brother Danny is headed down the same path and tries to stop him before he gets into trouble.

As a general rule stories, no matter books or movies or whatever, must be included that changing of its character for instance in changing in personality, change the way the character behave, changing in thoughts and many other things. The important thing is this change must be logical and fortunately in this film Derek change to another person logically. And after that Derek was worried about his brother when he realized that his brother has this tendency to follow his footsteps but they change their problems with talking. In addition shots in black and white and colorful pictures was a wisely action. In the end, what a great and shocking ending!

877,9 December 2007,SuperBadgerr,10, An amazing film.,"Having always been a little scared of American History X, what with the shower parts and all, I finally decided to rent it and watch it. Now I realize what an amazing film this really is. The Script- First off, the script is just amazing, it'll choke you up or make you laugh a bit (see Edward Furlong's take on getting expelled). The language is a bit rough but it adds to what we have to imagine is their regular way of life. The Actors- Best acting I've seen in awhile, I had my doubts about Edward Furlong but he pulled it off perfectly and Edward Norton pleases as usual. Direction/Camera work- The direction is great but with camera I have one complaint at some spots it was too close but other than that brilliant. Also, the end will reduce many people to tears. All in all, great film, highly recommended, 10/10",
878,21 August 2002,SCSTony613,10, A Powerful Movie,This movie was brillant.Edward Norton the best actor of his generation does his best performance in American History X. He was nominated for best actor in this movie and he didnt win which is garbage.This movie sends a very powerful message about racism.This movie is really realistic and probably one of the best movies made.The ending is really shocking but i'll let u find out what happens.I would advise u right now to go rent this movie or buy because if u dont see this movie your missing out.,
879,16 September 2007,risingrevolution,10, This is one i couldn't see the end to,"American History X is about pretty much it, I really cant find a movie as good as American History unless i look at movies like Letters to Iwojima, Crash, and Munich. American History really does deserve the awards that titles like those won. The ending of the movie really caught me by surprise, one of the few movies i ever watched that made me gasp when it ended. Liked how the movie went into detail of Dereks hatred in flashbacks, really gave me a feel for the character as the story progressed. I also got to add that while watching this movie i was acully convinced at first that Edward Nortan really was racist. This is a movie worthy of several Oscars.",
880,8 July 2009,hrstar24,10, Brilliant.,"There is definitely a bunch of controversy surrounding American History X, and not just because of the racial theme. Director Tony Kaye tried and failed to get his name pulled from the movie, because Edward Norton supposedly changed a lot of scenes in the movie and had final cut. The truth about how much Norton changed will probably never be revealed, but it doesn't matter. Whoever wants credit, Kaye or Norton, made an incredibly layered and brilliant film.",

882,5 March 2006,DFG1916,6, Overrated,"I'm truly stunned at the rave reviews this one has received. It's well acted, and contains some powerful scenes, but there is a huge, central flaw in it: Derek's conversions are simply not believable. One dinnertime conversation with his father sets him down the road from intelligent, easygoing bookworm to belligerent tattooed Nazi skinhead? This just wasn't credible. His conversion FROM fascism, while much more thoroughly explored, is also unconvincing - he just seems to have abandoned his (ostensibly deeply held) convictions all too easily and completely. And frankly I saw the ending coming a mile away! The film seems to have been made with the idea of shell-shocking viewers by its scenes of extreme hatred, and judging by the other user comments here it clearly succeeded in that. But strip that away and there just isn't much to it.",
883,1 May 2005,kimjoh,10, amazingly good,"What more can i say about this film that already isn't said?... nothing. I just have to join in on the praise of this film. The story is so well told and bang up to date concerning racism and fascism. The acting is generally very good, but Ed Norton steal the show with he's amazingly believable performance. The story is told through the eyes of Dereks(Norton)little brother Danny(Furlong)It deals with racism in todays America and the frightening consequence's and historical misconceptions young men and women gets exposed to in a neo fascist environment. The hate and the belief that the white race is Superior overshadows all reason and logic. Without giving away too much of the plot i can only say that the consequences of Dereks way of life will have a deep impact for he's future and the future of he's family. An amazing film. If you still haven't seen it, get a copy today.",
884,6 December 2018,mathewazaria,10, Shockingly powerful.,I cried throughout this film and as I have felt the pain the characters go through in the movie I was amazed at how they captured that sting. It's really one of the best films ever made.,
885,9 October 2005,Connor3820,10, great movie,"One of my top 3 movies if not my favorite. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong give flawless performances and are very believable. I like how they portrayed Norton as a white supremacist. Not as a redneck but as a normal guy whose life is changed by a dramatic event, which leads him to join a skinhead group and later challenges his beliefs. Although the movie is brutal and very graphic, It goes along with the plot unlike some slasher movie just about gore. There is a reason to the violence and it shows during the course of the movie. This movie is not for the easily offended but I would recommend it to anyone that appreciates good cinema and enjoys films that make you think.",

The cinematography was stunning, as well as most of the acting.  In particular Edward Furlong was very good in his role as the younger brother who just wants to please his brother.  You cannot watch this movie without being deeply disturbed at the very least. There was one scene in particular that I do not think that I will ever forget.  An instant classic.",
888,13 November 1998,Mr. Devo,10, best film of 1998,"An amazing depiction of a racist skinhead's transformation to a non-racist after a jail sentence. Edward Norton is brilliant, the direction is strong, and for once, it's a fairly accurate portrayal of skins (the racist ones, anyway). Thankfully, it avoids the silly stereotypes that previous skinhead films like Romper Stomper and Skinheads: The second coming of Hate resorted to and I'd say this is unquestionably the best film of 1998. Everything about this film was right on. My brother and I left the theater speechless and in awe.",
889,25 May 1999,Nigel-16,10, The most powerful movie I've seen in a while,"Ed Norton is an incredible actor.  I've seen five movies with him, and he's played a dramatically different role in each of them.  And EVERY one of them has blown me away. This time he plays a convincing skin-head neo-nazi, as well as a convincing ex-neo-nazi, trying to prevent his younger brother from following in his footsteps. Every minute of this movie kept my complete attention (and believe me, I have a short span of it).",

891,10 June 1999,Dusty-28,10, Impressive,"American History X slaps you in the face, as you see that Derek Vinyard, the guy that you saw horribly killing a black man, makes a pretty good point at the dining table, discussing immigration politics with his mum's Jewish friend. Unlike the characters, things aren't black or white in this movie. Which is good. It made an enormous impression on me, and Edward Norton is really unbelievable (especially when you remember him playing Aaron Stampler in Primal Fear!).",
892,10 May 1999,manwich,9, one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen,"American History X is not a movie for the weak.  If you can't stand racism, hate, or anal rape, then maybe you have no business watching it.  However, everyone in America SHOULD watch it. It's the story of Derek, a young man who just happens to be the leader of a local neo nazi group.  After killing two black men who were breaking into his truck, he is sent to jail for three years.  During his stay behind bars, a series of events forces him to change his view of life. Upon getting out of jail, he finds that his younger brother is following in his hateful footsteps.  Derek must then attemp to convince his sibling the error of his ways before it's too late. This movie gives the viewer a chillingly realistic look at how bitter and ultimately sad life can be when hate consumes the soul.  One of the best movies of 1998, second only to The Thin Red Line.  Definately check it out.",
893,19 June 2001,Spuds007,10, Even a black girl can like it!,"Never before have I felt so moved by a movie before.  People thought I was crazy to want to see a movie about a white supremacist because I'm black, but by the end of the movie, I was in a daze.  The opening and ending segments were enough to make me run to Circuit City tomorrow to buy this movie.  Edward Norton's diesel build naked didn't hurt too much either. This movie and Requiem for a Dream are two movies that will leave you thinking ""what did I just witness"" and you'll be thinking about it for days",
894,10 October 1999,msobhan,9, riveting,"The very good film about prejudice and its effects on people. It has a rather scary portrayal of the Neo-Nazi culture. Although Derek's transition from a hard core Nazi to a tolerance preaching older brother is shown  too quickly (almost as if a violent rape was enough to create disillusionment), the transition from the son of a working class father to a brutal Neo-Nazi killer is given more attention. Some of the premise is a bit unbelievable. Overall it is an excellent drama.",
895,29 November 2006,lowanii,10, One Word 'Superb',"There are few movies that can bring tears to a man's heart and this is one of them. He doesn't cry because it's a love story, or because it's an utter tragedy, he cries because he sees the world for a moment and perhaps for the rest of his life through different eyes after watching this movie. I didn't even want to watch this movie because of the title. At first I thought a movie with an 'X', hhmm it might be about some twisted tale about Malcom X or people like him (ie. Nation of Islam before he left them). Then I read its about Neo-Nazis, and I felt like its now a racist movie on the other side of the spectrum. Either way I decided, watch it, learn what is really out there, no matter how much you may disagree with it. That was one of the best decisions I ever made.",

Anyone interested in the problems of violence or race should view the film.",
897,10 December 2000,Will-164,9, Ed Norton is PERFECT,"Edward Norton makes this film. He will be staring in great films for the next 50 years. He plays such a different character here than he does in Fight Club, his other most notable performance, but he is still completely believable throughout. Indeed, here he plays 3 different characters - the confused kid, the racist hooligan and the redeemed hero. The film shows how racism can split a family apart and the devastating affects of enstilling racism into young people. A fine film. A fine Edward Norton. - Furlong isn't bad either!",

I truly don't know what exactly would be the right solution to overcome, this hatred, that is deep within. The dinner scene and the scenes portraying life in prison are two of the most brutal and moving parts of the film I guess. Regarding the ending, I had a thought, that it could've been much more powerful than it already is.

I first saw this in my senior year of high school, and I literally sat in stunned silence well into the end credits. By the time this film is finished, you've been taken on an emotional roller-coaster and you feel like you've been punched in the gut. I know I did. Edward Norton turns in another amazing performance as the reformed skin-head who tries to prevent his younger brother from following in his footsteps. It's the story of how Derek (Norton) goes to prison for killing 2 black guys who he catches trying to break into his car. His younger brother, Danny (Furlong) witnesses the whole thing. Prison changes Derek's perspective on life dramatically, and upon his release from jail, finds out that Danny is coming dangerously close to mimicking Derek's dangerous neo-nazi ways. In order to explain to a confused Danny why he is so different now, he tells him about his horrible and traumatizing experience in jail, which we are shown through flashbacks. Some people argue that the ending was predictable... call me naive, but I did NOT see it coming, and I was left, literally, with my jaw on the floor. This movie will stay with you, and it may even change you. Ed Norton was robbed of the Best Actor Oscar. This movie belongs in everyone's collection. It's something you won't soon forget.",

It was an accurate depiction of racist behaviors and a lot of thought went into it. It was well made, especially the black and white scenes where the climax was. It was rather harsh though. I could see many people getting offended, and I really woulden't blame them. Edward norton and Eddie furlong give great preformances as do the other actors and actresses.

I remember watching it for the first time, disgusted when derek uses his powerful dialogue to provoke the other neo-nazis, and getting that feeling of helplessness after the ending scene. No other movie has left emotions scarred into me like this one. I know it is only a movie, but it really makes one think of what kind of society we are living in today, and the prejudice some people are forced to face.  While Primal Fear is the movie that exhibited Edward Norton's potential, this is the movie that proved that Edward Norton is the best actor today.  Very powerful. 10/10.",
910,30 March 2016,goyamjain-212-381704,9, Masterclass Melodrama,"American History X is a mad frenzy wrapped in beautiful apparatus of direction, cinematography and screenplay. Although it showcases plethora of emotions, it does so in an unapologetic manner. Movie delivers a powerful and concise message and it all hits you well. Movie scores much less on symbolism and subtlety. But, it scores an 'A' in delivering what it wanted to, in a very direct fashion. It deals with morals, conditions, reasons and consequences of an ideology and gives precise conclusion. It scratches layers subject like racism and makes you dwell deep into all related aspects. Now to story telling and drama, movie does go overboard but keeping in mind the delivery of message, it was highly essential. Journey does get wonderfully erratic. A work on understanding psyche of community and its strong ties are well highlighted but scratch underneath, and you find dark hollowness. Protagonist found just that, as we take a journey with him and his family. Movie is well shot. Close angles captured emotions perfectly, to the point it makes us feel as if we ourselves are encountering situations and questions on subject. All actors do a fantastic job, nothing much on it. It could have been better written or perhaps meanings could have been hidden. Like portraying a step away from such ideology was shown in fully melodramatic manner of removing all posters from room. Overall, its a movie that engrosses you, takes you to uncomfortable zones, puts you into situation many a times, and delivers a particular message that hatred induces such actions and thoughts, and anything based on hatred at its core can bring no good to you.",

While in jail for 3 years, his younger brother is confronted about writing a book report on Mein Kampf, saying that Hitler was a great civil rights leader. The principal of the school, Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) confronts Danny about his report telling him it was completely unacceptable. Dr. Bob Sweeney decides to school Danny in his own way, taking him out of his regular class and into a one-on-one environment. The class is called American History X. Danny is instructed to write a story about his older brother, being the god of a white power gang.

I thought the skin heads were very well portrayed to the point that their line of thinking could be agreed with by young people who are looking for an answer to there problems.

It deals intelligently with a wide range of issues affecting society and the individual.  Racism being the most obvious, but also the need to take responsibility for our actions and do whatever is in our power to improve the world.  If this sounds trite, don't worry, the film avoids sentimentality well (mainly due to the fine performances) and shows that the weapons that change the world are suffering and love.  It is not afraid to raise questions that it leaves the viewer to answer, which can be frustrating, but ultimately more worthwhile.  Somehow it also manages to be highly entertaining, with a rich vein of humour running through it. Director Tony Kaye shows his advertising roots too much but that can be forgiven.  Not a perfect film, but certainly one that shows that cinema can deal with far more than car chases, bad sex and fart jokes.",

He's truly one of the greatest actors working today, and this is one of his top performances. The film itself also does an excellent job of showing Norton's character, Vinyard, as much more than one-dimensional.

930,15 January 2021,andreadave-81699,10, Powerful and thought provoking,"A movie that drives home the fact that anger , hatred and tunnel vision can destroy not just one but several lives. In this movie Derek was so full of hatred and rage that he acted onthese feelings , destroying not just his but his mothers sisters and brothers lives, and also the lives of his victims families and loved ones luckily there was a chance at redemption, although a life was lost it changed the path in time for Derek to save his younger brother from heading down the same path ! The fact that Derek was incarcerated and had his life saved in jail by someone of the race that he was so full of hatred against made him open his eyes and reasses his views, it made him a much better person and he learnt a few very valuable lessons which I think quite alot of people could learn from, anger and hatred are NOT the way to solve problems, our world would be a much better place if people actually stopped to think about how damaging acting on these feelings could be. Not everybody has to have the same views, but learning to just agree to disagree could be a huge step in maybe helping to stop a majority of the hatred in people, YES, we'll still have people walking around that are committing crimes ....and yes, people will probably feel like vigilantism is warranted....but at what cost ?

The message is legitimized by Derek's story, and the insight the movie provides into the maturity of his psyche. It's simply amazing how the movie show's how easy it is to let little thoughts of hatred you're your brain, and how those thoughts can grow into actions with the help of influential people. ",

At first, I wasn't very sure of it, because the plot didn't really seem to interest me.  Luckily, I sat down one night and started to watch it.  It was one of the most powerful movies I had ever seen in my life.  Edward Norton's performance of Derek Vinyard was one of the best I have ever seen, and Edward Furlong, not to be overlooked, gave an extremely touching performance as Danny, the younger brother desperately trying to fill his brothers footsteps, no matter what the consequences.  The movie left me speechless, from the attention grabbing beginning to the emotional end.  If you are a fan of good movies, you must check this movie out.",

935,12 April 2023,akafilmandmedia-05787,8, Still relevant today!,Damn. This movie was riveting,
936,15 March 2002,admiralpiett,10, The most powerful movie you will ever see,"A while back, my roommate and myself decided to see a movie with a mutual friend of ours; as we couldn't come up with an idea by ourselves that sounded interesting (Clerks and L.A. Confidential came up, but we had both seen those), we asked our friend if she could bring a movie that none of us had seen but that was supposed to be well-made.  Though a tall order to fill, I have to say she more than delivered when she brought American History X over.  It was powerful, brutal, beautiful, and compelling; the last type of movie most of us college freshman typically see with friends on a friday night. American History X follows the story of a young, brilliant, and very charismatic leader (stunningly played by Edward Norton) of a gang of Neo-Nazis in California, as well as his younger brother's (played by Edward Furlong) involvement in the same group.  I'm not going to tell you any more than that; one of the things I enjoyed most about it was that I knew nothing more than that, so the plot was truly captivating.  Not that it cannot stand on it's own; far from it!  To tell the truth, I had absolutely no interest in what I thought would be yet another p.c. movie hollywood decides to throw at its consumers of ""Racism is the ultimate evil""; it's one of those subjects that has been beat to death, which makes Tony Kaye's (the director) job that much more difficult. However, Mr. Kaye does so in breathtaking fashion.  Much like Memento (which, of course, came after X), a great deal of the film is told via flashback in black and white.  Many of the movie's most violent and compelling scenes are set to a powerfully dramatic, classical score that would simply come off as cheesy in any other film I can think of.  What all this does is sober you up, grab your attention by the throat and make you seriously consider what this movie has to say. And what it has to say is both easily comprehensible, and brilliantly correct.  Instead of portraying all Neo-Nazis as stupid rednecks, demonic villains or unknowing pawns, Kaye creates characters with real dimensions to them.  Most people would find it hard to believe, but it isn't long after the movie starts that you actually care about two young racists, and even understand where these young men come from.  Another brilliant move by Kaye and X's writer, David McKenna, was to present the logical, intelligent arguments that Neo-Nazis use, and precisely show where exactly those arguments are flawed.  Unlike most movies, Kaye actually has the balls to show Ed Norton arguing with a teacher from school against integration, and shows him winning the argument! Another important element of this film is the reason it is rated R: horrific violence.  What is so unfortunate is that many, many people will not see this film simply because of its graphic content, yet that is what makes it so horrifying, so gripping, and so mentally lasting.  It, along with Schindler's List, is a movie that everyone should see at some point in their life; after that, you probably won't ever want to see it again.",

The film was at times disturbing due to its graphic nature and in-your-face politics. The film focuses on overcoming racism/anti-semitism rather than the cause of it.

Conceptual direction, writing, and directing are all superb, with effective and original use of black-and-white filming to rival that of Raging Bull. Cinematography was excellent, along with sound. Emotional build up ingeniously misdirected, to add for a real shocker. This is what a real depiction of deep familial turmoil and affection looks like, along with blind racism and prison life. Emotional themes are blind hatred, family love (especially brotherly), rebellion, with underlying tones of atonement, and a hint of depression. Acting is good overall with very good depictions from both Norton and previously unknown Brooks. Overall one of my favorite films of all time, and a must see.",

942,9 July 2010,naufilisaninja,10, A powerful film exploring white nationalist culture,"Watching this film was really quite an experience. I found the film to be intelligent and culturally informed. It bought up a lot of issues and explored them in depth. There were references to the Rodney King incident, various historical studies and more involved. Another thing about this film was the sheer intensity and violence. That image of Edward Norton's character pavement-stomping the African-American man who was breaking into his house and then him lifting his arms before the police revealing the swastika tattoo on his chest, that remains etched into many people's memories as a rather classical film moment. The whole make-up of white nationalist culture is probed here as Derek Vinyard (excellently portrayed by Edward Norton) attempts to escape from the neo-nazi gang he was once the second-in-command of and prevent his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) going down the same path. There is one other performance that stands out and that is Stacy Keach's menacing portrayal of white nationalist mentor, Cameron Alexander. Overall this is an excellent film, a classic that should be remembered. I've said enough.",
943,8 June 2005,somniphob,9, it gives neo-nazi white supremacy a different perspective,"""Has anything you've done made your life better?"" Keep that one little question in your mind because it's the basis of this entire film. Look, everyone looks at skinheads, kkk members, and other miscellaneous hate organizations as mindless hateful machines. We give them no credit, we say there is no basis for their beliefs. Which isn't necessarily true, a lot of it has to do with how these people chose to act upon these feelings. That's what this film focuses upon it gives you more. More to work with, more to work off of, and that's what makes this film more than ""good"". This guy, hateful as he is, is human, with family with heart, and beliefs, and inner demons and choice and we see that. All of it. We start to understand him, we start to see little bits of ourselves in him (we may not want to admit it but we do) we start to watch him and analyze him. This ""guy"" is Derek, yeah, he has a name and this movie it chronicles his past and present. It goes from, intelligent to brainwashed to hateful to prison to changed (mind you, he never loses the intelligence, it just becomes masked by hate). Amazingly dynamic transformations. Yet, he has to watch his brother, Danny, go down the same dingy self-corruptive path. This is what the movie focuses on, and as you watch you grit your teeth and you soak it all up. Because you know in reality, everyone's a little bit racist. Everyone is ""capeable"" of attaining such a status. David McKenna wrote this magnificently, and Tony Kaye captured his writings with great artistic vision and skill. He didn't overplay it, he didn't water it down... much ;) He captured this film and delivered it with such amazing power and grace. Along with an absolutely brilliant cast Edward Norton as Derek and Edward Furlong as Danny, not to mention the small but powerful roles played by Beverly D'Angelo (their mother-Doris) and Avery Brooks playing the ""I won't give up on you"" history teacher Dr. Sweeny. This film is powerful, by all means. It does more than any over the top Oliver Stone flick, because it truly captures the essence and the moment. Because that's what it's all about. Right? Before we judge them we need to understand them, and change accordingly, and fight like mad to hold on to the things we treasure and consider dear. Remember that. If i told you more than the basics (which i kinda did) the movie, in my opinion, wouldn't be as much. All I can say is; I'd definitely recommend it, artistically, as well as content wise. Because it teaches you something, and leaves hope in the minds of the frightened, but most of all because at the end of the day its more than ""good"".",
944,16 February 2012,Bigdaddy2014,9, Hate is baggage,"Edward Norton commands his role with truly impressive acting. I've been a big Edward Norton fan since his debut in primal fear but this topped it all. What I loved most about this film is that no matter what your beliefs are when it comes to race and politics, it makes you think deeply about the beliefs opposing yours. I'm not saying that it made me consider neo nazism, but Derek's speech before the attack on the grocery store has valid points on the subject of Americans on welfare. But enough of the politics. This movie makes me wish that Edward Furlong would've continued to do great movies like this instead of playing cameos in less than impressive Seth Rogen/super hero movies. The character of Derek is actually based on a real person and his evolution out of the white supremacist idealism and the film truly sheds light on (sadly) a case in America these days. An exceptional film that I believe should've taken the Oscar for best actor in a leading role.",

I saw the movie yesterday and I knew I'm going to watch a virulent, brutal movie ,but I did not expect to see one of the greatest film I have ever saw. First of all, Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Maybe the best acting I saw, they truly made me think they are neo-Nazi. Norton is playing Derek Vinyard, neo-Nazi who lead a gang of white people, who believe that the white men belong to the 'Aryan' trunk and the others belong to the 'Semitic' trunk, lower trunk. After Derek left the prison, he understood that his life attitude was wrong, and trying to change his brother's attitude before it is too late. As a Jew, I know that there is still Nazism out there, and this movie is a proof that I right. Do not waste your time about other movies, just go and see this one. I'm sure you will be glad . 10/10",

From the beginning of the movie to the end you are always at the end of your seat changing your opinion of what is right and it shows both views and the danger that both can have on a society and the repercussions their are to hate. Unfortunately I can't think of a movie that relates to this one of the top of my head but even if I could none could stand up to this movie, it shows the brutality of what can happen when you let hate get a hold of your life and because I don't want to ruin the movie for you I won't tell you the end but I can tell you that if you let hate get a hold of you the angrier you get the worse your life will become if I may quote Edward Furlong, ""Hate is package and life is to short to be p***ed off all the time."" Also it shows you that there will always be people out there that will not listen to you no matter what you say or do. I personally think that this movie tells you that you should try to reach as many people as you can and to not compromise your views to try and reach someone that won't listen to you, that's there choice and there the ones that are going to have to deal with it not you. And if you know someone like that there is always time for them to redeem themselves, its never too late.",

949,31 January 2005,timmyfish,9, An unsettling in-depth look at the struggle between reason and frustration,"Racial issues are not black and white- but enough with the cheap shots. What I think separates this movie from others of its kind is(apart from its awesome style and the performance of the cast) its tone towards racism. Instead of portraying the skinheads as idiots or demons, people that are beyond reason and understanding, it shows why anyone would become a skinhead. The answer is: for roughly the same reasons one would join a gang. Namely, affirming your dignity and identity by hating everybody else. When people start to hate entire races, they aren't thinking about a causal relation between criminal tendencies and skin pigmentation. Or about the metaphysically controversial notion that entire groups may somehow be responsible for the actions of individual members. They're not asking themselves whether ""groups"" as such actually even exist. In short, they aren't thinking logically: they're using perverted inductive logic to project their frustrations onto people they don't identify with. They treat these people as scapegoats. A coping strategy, as frightening as it is obscure. A phenomenon that seems to recur throughout human history, each time adapting itself to the spirit of the times. In this movie, Edward Norton en Edward Furlong both convincingly play bright but frustrated skinheads. They allow the viewer to understand the horrifying appeal that the racist rhetoric might have. And I found myself provoked to re-evaluate my own opinion on the matter. Affirmative action, racial profiling: what am I to make of these things? What would I do if I would encounter racial violence? Violence in general? How do we stop it? For once, this question, as well as the movie, is an honest one. I don't even know if it's possible. But it's going to take guts. that's for sure.

964,26 July 1999,AJ-33,10, UNDERRATED,"I think this film has been severely underrated by critics who say that the film's only merit is Edward Norton's masterful performance.  American History X is so much more than that.  I would venture to call this film a masterpiece, certainly one of my favorites and the best movie of 1998, along with Saving Private Ryan.  The film is very well-crafted and the flashbacks are poignant as well as powerful in showing how the events surrounding one person can affect so many people around him.  I tended to forget that the flashbacks were in black-and-white since the images stayed with me long after watching the film.  Also, this is one of those films where repeated viewings enhances the pleasure.  At first viewing, it is hard to understand the importance or effect of the flashbacks, but after the second viewing the story fits in perfectly.  Director Tony Kaye was so displeased with the finished project (his first film, have you) that he attempted to give the director's credit in an alias, (which I think was Humpty Dumpty). Anyway, if this is what he considers an embarrassment then I am very interested in seeing some of his future works.  And by the way, Stanley Kubrick, whom Kaye reportedly compared himself to, also disowned his first feature film.  And as for the cynics who say that the ending is a misfire, I think it is brilliant.  It leaves so many questions opened; Will Derek return to hate? Will his family ever recover? Who is to blame for the problems in society? These questions really remind me of Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.  I am eagerly awaiting Tony Kaye's future projects, but I guess he won't make another film for about 5 or six years.",

Still a great film, it could and should have been so much more with better care. Kaye's shot the film himself and his visuals are unbelievably good. However, the films driving force is Norton, who should have won the Oscar. We completely understand his character, and he makes a villainous, despicable young man's arc to reformed ex-con seemless.

As a matter of fact, he is a good actor and he deserves to get the nomination of Oscar Actor. In this film, the director described the thoughts of a racist in very detail, why he thought like that and the impact of the environment and the peer group on his own. Especially in a dinner scene, what Derek says which really shocked me. But i do not prefer using the black and white screen to represent the past. Here, I highly recommend this movie to the people, to see that how stubborn people will be when they choose to have a belief without any doubts even killing people. The most hardest part in human to be changed would be the stereotype, bias and discrimination, the most horrible is that these thoughts can be past over and over the generation like Derek and his father.",

With Ed Norton playing the powerful lead role as the confused Nazi, I found myself holding my breath or feeling physically sick throughout every scene.  Near the end I was disappointed to see the beginnings of a typical 'Hollywood' happy ending,  but my feelings soon changed when the conclusion shifted to an incredibly powerful and emotional end.

Tony Kaye and David McKenna have done something extroardinary in seeing hate and racism from the POV of the American neo-Nazi, and helped us see more than we could have hoped for. The film's underlying theme was simple: life is too short to be p****d off all the time. Edward Norton's dynamic performance was his best to date, showing a grand transformation of the intelligent yet simple-minded young man who, while in an emotionally hateful and racist frame of mind, speaks certain truths that most of us wish were not the facts. However, it is only after befriending a black inmate in prison that he learns see things from a wider perspective, through all the b******t and propaganda that he has learned and taught others. He realizes that yes, maybe it is true that one in every three black males is in some form of a correctional facility. Maybe most black Americans have been using their past history of slavery to promote white guilt and frighten white Americans into recession. But the even harder truth to face is that Norton's hate had so consumed him that he failed to see any options other than blaming blacks and minorities for all of the country's problems. Hate consumed his mind and disabled it. This is one of the best movies ever made and one of my favorites. I have been watching Norton since Primal Fear and I know that he will go far as an actor.

When I heard of this movie, I expected the mindless bashing of Nazis. While I personally consider it plain wrong, I feared this movie just would not go deep enough, and I would forget the next day. But I was wrong, I think I will always remember this movie when I discuss the topic, and believe me, when you are german like me, you discuss it a lot. The story itself is very simple; An american neo nazi rises to the top of the local gang. His brother admires him and follows his footsteps, but when the older brother goes too jail for killing two black men, he sees and experiences things that change his mind, and when he comes out he tries to save his brother. The story is fairly standard...just the way the story is presented makes the movie exceptional. Furlong and especially Norton give outstanding performances, and all the other characters are very well portrayed. And I do not agree with some reviewers who say the 180 deegree change of Derek is unreallistic...I hope and I actually BELIEVE that a person can change, see their own mistakes, through open minded thinking. There is now wrong philosophy, but following without thinking is wrong (my opinion, but I feel this is what the movie is trying to say too). I say you have too see the movie. Chances are you will not like it. You might hate it. But the chance that it gives you inspiration to think about a very grim and never to be forgotten part of human (not german, american, HUMAN) history are enough to justify spending two hours of your life on it.",

Controversial, yes. Disturbing, yes. Eye-opener as well, yes. This movie was the perfect example of how much a person's feelings of prejudice can hurt people, whether it be to themselves, or to those around them. Although this movie was very brutal in it's violence and language, those elements were not just thrown in randomly. They were what really made the movie, while controversial, also extremely well done. It was a harsh look at how much racism can damage a family and the people they love. The Cinematography was beautiful, with flashbacks shot in black and white. Tony Kaye did a superb job directing and he really showed his talent for making a touching film. The script was very well-written; harsh and stinging at times but very clever and profound. Edward Norton gave the performance of his career in my opinion, besides Primal Fear (both of which got him nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Actor). Also Edward Furlong shines as Edward Norton's younger brother, Danny. Stacy Keach, Elliot Gould, Avery Brooks, and Beverly D'Angelo also give very good performances.

It had barely any action, but the action it had was brutal enough to make up for the rest of the action that isn't there. But trust me, this movie is not boring by any stretch of the imagination. If you own any movies at all, then you have to own this one. If you own fight club, then you need to own this. Because this is better. But if you are expecting a happy ending, don't watch it.

Than when his father gets killed in an African American neighbourhood he's becoming a Nazi, and later because of the influences in prison he has to review his opinion. The younger brother also becomes a nazi, but it seems to me that he has and always had serious doubts about the things nazi's believes in. I think he just became a nazi to support his brother.

The essentials are met - i.e. great cast, great acting, great directing etc. but more importantly, is the way the film dealt with the issue it explores and its opinions of it. At first it disects all the dynamic and sensitive emotions and reactions of a typical western/white race who's population is becoming increasingly racially integrated. This in itself is something people have wanted to put into film without it becoming more of a documentary. This film does that brilliantly. By the end, we have a very clever appreciation of why this happens and why racism is a failure of society. It is something that we deal with every day and that we all have an opinion on. This compromises most of those and seems to conclude with something every one can sympathize with - that it is a virtually uncontrollable situation, and that fear and confusion is the driving force behind it from all corners of the globe.",

The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can easily tear apart a family.",

It shows why so many Americans just stay the way that they are, they know how hard it is to change. I think that Edward Norton does an excellent job of being the jerk that tries and better himself while still living in the same world that he is trying to get out of. The only part about this movie that bothered me was why was his little brother killed? Why wasn't he killed for his crimes and then change of heart that did not sit well with his friends. His poor little brother was trying to make sense of everything that was going on in his world, and just when he was starting to understand it and learn how to change it, he was killed. If you do not like gruesome acts of violence, then this movie is not for you because there is one part, the part that shows you why the lead character goes to jail, that is unbelievably gruesome, you will think about it before you sleep, and probably during. If you are not faint of heart and would like to learn a little bit about neo-nazism, this is a great movie. I definitely give this movie a ten.",

The two brothers having to fight the background that they come from and for Derek to realize,during his jail time that a human being is not judged by his color but by his soul which is colorless.

Instead, it just creates more problems. Edward Norton has given one of the best performances of his career. He plays a Neo Nazi Skinnhead who is sentenced to seven years in prison for a horrific act of manslaughter. During his time in the joint, he befriends an inmate who happens to be black. His friendship with the inmate changes his perspective on racism and how wrong it really is. Norton's character Derek, has a little brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who has always looked up to Derek, starts to head down the same path his older brother once did. Having the scenes of Derek being a Skinnhead, shot in black and white was an absolutely brilliant idea. Because if there is one thing black and white cinematography does now a days is present a dark and depressing tone, which is exactly what you feel when you experience these scenes. Beverly Diangelo delivers a captivating and heartbreaking performance as a widow. It had been awhile since we've seen a performance like this. Diangelo said in an interview ""this was her first take on a dramatic role."" Well let me tell you, not bad for her first take on Drama, not bad at all.

That's what I loved about the movie: it provided us with an accurate insight on racism and its effects. Unfortunately it didn't focus enough on the reasons for the changes in Derek's attitude and didn't help me reach the other side, leaving me in the racists's side. They should have worked more on the script, shown more of Derek's life in prison.I was kinda disappointed... but, overall, a great movie",

1036,7 May 1999,Cézé,8, Processes or equalization?,"Although I think that American History X was one of the best films in year 1998 I had to observe several points. The most important was that I could not feel -because of the flashbacks- the deepness of the film's message as the storyline was broken. This made also impossible to illustrate the process of Derek's arriving to the final point. This part was rather told superficially and in the end we only got a spoon-fed but still neutral conclusion. (The father's conservatism could led to the children's tendency - but quite interesting that the daughter, Davina does not becomes affected..) In spite of this - unfortunately determinated - problem of flash-backing the film represented the most natural and most beautiful flash-backing technique I've ever seen. Splendid idea the way as the final point - killing the black man on the pavement - wasn't presented for the first time (Introduction), this brutal and in a way symbolic action could be saved for the deeper part of the film, making it really catarctic without becoming disturbingly effectual-seeking. The other advantage of the technique that Derek could be presented two ways at the same time to avoid presenting him neither as a rat nor as a hero, always equalizing the bad and the good points of his attitude.",

But American History X blew me away. Powerful scenes are abundant in this movie. There is one scene that I will remember forever (if you've seen it, you'll know which one it was). The scenes could have still been fairly powerful with average actors, but the entire cast was exemplary. Edward Norton's acting was perfect, as was Ed Furlong's. Beverly DeAngelo was surprisingly good; a quantum leap from her other movies. American History X is a very strong movie. It rams home its point much like Saving Private Ryan did. In SPR, you understood fully why war was stupid. In AHX, you understood exactly why racism and nazism are stupid. Definitely one of my all-time favourites.",
1039,10 April 1999,wildiris,8," Flaws and merits, but more merits","In the eventual final cut that emerged from the celebrated editorial disputes, flaws and merits struggle for supremacy but the merits, I think, win over. On the down side, the treatment of Derek's ideological metamorphosis is a tad superficial (though understandably presented), and Tony Kaye's arty camerawork is sometimes used to overblown effect, as is the otherwise beautiful score. On the up side, there are fine individual scenes and excellent performances, and when the visuals do work they can be stunning - there can't be many films in which the opening credits themselves are a work of art. AHX is not perfect but it is affecting and more special than the typical multiplex movie-by-numbers. In a way, its flaws themselves could be seen to reflect its attempt to do something darker and original and not stick to safe guidelines.",

As a former Neo-Nazi, I can vouch for the gratuitous sex and violence...we were not the type to sit around in coffee shops and rationally discuss our 'problems' with non-caucasian people. Non-whites, to the Neo-Nazi, aren't deserving of time and patience (or politeness).",

I would not recommend this to the dispassionate movie goer who would rather experience robots, spaceships, and the obligatory hero-villain/beautiful woman/ little kid scenario where the roller coaster eventually stops in ""and they lived happily after"" land! This may be too graphic for the weak at heart, and the all consuming hate current that runs through the soul of this saga may even be totally unbelievable to the naive among us, but what this powerhouse exposes is the true nature of the beast that runs rampant while most of us choose to turn deaf ears and blind eyes! Pretty loud alarms sound about every 5 or 10 minutes in this movie, and Ed Norton should be heralded as the most capable actor of the 90's. I really didn't see any ""slouch"" in this movie, and it had a deep seated uneasy effect on me for days, which to me made it an even more powerful viewing experience than the immediate aftershock.

1045,29 September 1999,Crit eye,8, There is only one thing that irked me in the film.,"I have watched American History X and I loved every second of it. It vividly portrays how blindly cruel humanity can become. The important thing one must keep in mind  is that both Derek and Danny had the right to feel bitter the way they felt. Derek learnt his lesson thanks to his mentor ( who is ironically coloured ) in prison. Derek, being the eldest in the family has a deep impact on his younger brother Danny, who is in turn ignorant of his brother's change in opinion. I find that Derek's role in the film is to patch up the aftermath of his initial neo-nazis way of life  ... retribution and the killing of the inferior race. The scene where he looks at himself in the mirror seeing the swastica and feeling incapable of erasing it besides being most impressive, hints at his futile fight to erase the effects he had on Danny.  One could say,  Danny changed in the end. In the film, it is the mentor phrase that predominates ... stop the vengeance and the killing to have them stopped being done to you.",
1046,7 January 2000,JackSlims,8," With a closed mind, there is no other perspective than one's own.","Narisicism is ingrained in human nature.  People's love for themselves often leads them to bond with others who are most similar with them.  This lack of diversity of thought lends members of such a group to believe that their paradigm is the true or correct way to view the world.  American History X portrays these feelings excellently.  The neo-Nazis began simply as angry young men who were scared in the world which they lived.  They found solace, and soon ignorance, in the company of fellow men who, in one way or another, held similar feelings. This comfort which grew from the mass quickly bottlenecked its members' ability to empathize.  People with different perspectives were not only ignored but seen as the enemy. narrower and narrower mindset soon set in, eliminating the ""big picture' completely. AMX's use of this theme was magnificent.  I hope that those who see this film enter with an open mind and leave with a heightened sense of the world around them.  Even for those where racial inequality is not a factor in their life, this movie still offers insight.  Ignorance to the feelings of fellow human beings can be found in the smallest of daily activities.  Open your eyes, take a step back, and look at the world from the shoes of another. You'll be surprised at what you see.",

I was amazed: it was certainly one of the best films I saw that year. The plot is a gripping tale about redemption and brotherhood. The director Tony Kaye does an excellent job for his first film. But the best thing about this film is the breathtaking performance by Edward Norton, as an ex-neonazi who gets out of jail and tries to stop his younger brother (very well portrayed by Edward Furlong) from imitating him. Norton totally deserved his Oscar nomination and would probably have won if he had been a bigger star at the time.

The acting is mind blowing and the cinematography is outstanding. It teaches us all a lesson about life. Thats its not always good and OK. Some people rather live in pride and blind. Its a story telling us the past ways are not always good. For most people they have to learn the hard way to figure out that you must learn from peoples mistakes and not always fallow other people in their foot steps but your own. For example like Derek, by his ways he was taught to be a nazi. So he killed a African American and went to prison. He learned later on that being white doesn't make you have power in a place like prison. He got taught a lesson and changed his ways. When he got out he had a different mind set and tried to get his brother Danny out of the bad road that he was once down.",

If your not careful watching you may start to find yourself siding with the skinheads, but as the movie goes on you'll be struck by the powerful message it gives.  I highly reccomend it.",

Story was simple, however the evoked emotions was powerful. Though well-intentioned, turns out to be a simplistic and unconvincing look at a serious problem. This is, perhaps, one of the most difficult films there is there is to watch. Nobody gets out completely unscathed in this film. Not the white people, not the black people, not the correctional system (Norton's character kills two people and he gets out in three years), and certainly not the viewer. If there's the smallest seed of intolerance in the bowels of your soul, it will be shown to you, and it will not be pleasant. I'm a very tolerant person, and American History X shook me to my core.

I had forgotten how many emotions it wrangles out of you that you may not even ever suspect. It was an eye opening movie for me as a younger person and when I found out my 19 year old boy hadn't seen it, I pulled out my DVD of it and said, ""That's what we're doing tonight."" He at first had no interest in it after checking out the synopsis on the case and I almost had to force him to watch it with me. However, as I began to get immersed in this movie that I had forgotten its powers, it got quiet and I never heard another word from him. At the end of the movie, I was sniffling and I look over and he is sitting on the edge of the couch with tears, unspilled, but sitting in his eyes, mouth open, slack-jawed, and still staring at the blank screen. It was definitely a defining period in his young adulthood and a moment for me that helped define our relationship and that I'll always cherish. It's a classic that even now sometimes I talk to people who haven't seen it, and I recommend it. I'm glad I bought the DVD so long ago. It had the same reaction for me as it did the first time years ago.",

Aside from his brilliant performance as the lead character, there is a very important message to be learned from this film.  I try not to use the term ""powerful"" to describe movies, but there is no other way to express how I felt about this one. The only reason that I didn't rate this movie a ""10"" is because I didn't really like Edward Furlong as Danny.

This film kept me interested the whole time that i couldn't even leave for th bathroom (exept for commercials). Edward Norton did a great job playing Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead preventing his brother going down the wrong path he did. The acting is just perfect when characters express their emotions through rage, humor and depression. Many people say the message of this film is that racism is bad, but there is more to it. The message being (from my point of view) is that many of us are role models for other people or some us have role models and it's the role models' responsibility to be a good one. In this case, Derek was a bad one and Danny followed down in his footsteps. So if you are interested in good acting, powerful messages getting across to you, i recommend this movie.",

You learn that being mad at things you can't control doesn't solve any problems. Hate is something that is taught to and engraved into the minds of kids that will believe that racism is the answer to the problems of the world.

Derek is a strong willed, intelligent and very pro-active character with a mixed up view on the realities of racism (Neo-nazi), primarily due to the deficiencies in the American system. As a result of brutally killing two afro-american youths who attempted to steal his car, Derek faces imprisonment. While in prison he experiences a different perspective which serves as a rude awakening to his wrongful hatred. This is a very strong and meaningful movie as it deals directly with the issues of hatred which are so very real in our society today. The director deals with the issue without judging between black and white, which makes this film a MUST SEE FOR ALL.

However,the film's greatest draw must be the astonishing Edward Norton,disgracefully passed over at the Oscars, who turns in a remarkable performance as Neo-Nazi hate-monger Derek Vinyard.Norton transforms the film from a good rent to an essential view,seamlessly portraying his almost duel-performance of Vinyard before and after his reform from racial hated,entirely convincingly.The film is far more than a stream of shocking (and they are shocking) set-pieces, and the violence, brutal as it may be,is never glamourised.The film's harrowing conclusion is the icing on the cake, ensuring that this is a tale that will stay with you long after the video is back in the box.All in all, a very good movie, if not one for the faint of heart!",

Every time you watch the movie you take the same taste as the first time maybe even better. The first scene starts with a man making love with his girlfriend that makes you shocked at the first minutes but then the story takes you to a terrible prison, neo-nazi people defending the racialism so hardly, a family so close to fall into pieces and so on. The players are chosen very carefully and I think Norton fits to his character very very much. The friendship between Derek and the laundry man Lamont is so similar to the one between Andy Dufresne and Ellis ""Red"" Redding in Shawshank Redemption movie.

An impressive movie, from all the things Derek has to face in prison, to the way he tries to change Danny, his younger brother, showing him that the path he has chosen is not right.

This film was able to make me feel disgusted with society and be completely disappointed in humanity, yet it gave me hope all in one fell swoop.

1079,24 March 2007,bhat-romil,8, live and let others live..,"This movie is being very meticulously made, and it is about the little vendetta of American white people vis a vis American black people. Movie tells that whites are really concerned about the violence, and bad things in every sector by the blacks. They sincerely think that it is the American black people which are deteriorating the American exchequer. Govt. is doing every single thing for them. And thus in the rebuke they carry on the skin head tradition. And thus equally participating with the blacks to make America.... not a good place to live. This movie rotates about one family and tells their story when protagonist moves to jail(before and after), the changes that term brought into the protagonist. This picture is a sort of preaching for the American audience and class for the non American ones. All the sequences in this movie are very realistic(although there aren't many). The story as I felt was not completed, as the protagonist had made a lot of enemies and deal with those enemies wasn't completed. so i give it 8/10. you can watch this movie, its good...",

Edwards Norton and Furlong were exceptional in their characters..and so was the rest of the actors. As a Libertarian I agree with much of what Derrik was saying about the state of the country. This movies certainly did not do such a good job of making many of the black characters sympathetic, except Lamont. I mean come on, 3 guys with guns, one standing on your front porch and one in your yard and one breaking into your car...are we supposed to feel sympathy for them? I did not like the girl who played Derriks girlfriend...it would have been better in a miniseries perhaps if they had showed him longing for her but at the same time, wanting to leave the gang..instead the breakup was so abrupt. I would have liked to see more of the family flashbacks. This movie, besides Lamont, actually made me feel more sympathetic to the skinheads than the minorities (except that horrible grocery store scene) I would buy this movie because I really enjoyed the Edwards performances, and Norton was extraordinarily sexy in those white boxers.",

It is the best movie I have ever seen and remains my favorite to this day. You won't even know it's Edward Norton you are watching, he does such a fine job, his acting is so beyond words. All I can say is that's it's a good thing the skinheads don't really have him on their side, because he is so smart and so convincing in this film, you actually might find yourself believing in his characters rhetoric for a moment.",

Well it wasn't good because it's a death scene. It was just shot really good and you either just sit there in shock or break out crying. The only issue I had with this movie was that every other word was the f bomb. It got annoying after a while. But its no big deal. Everything about this movie was great. The acting, the soundtrack, the plot, just perfect. Since this movie was rated R I think we should forget the stupid rating and pretend its pg-13.

And the story goes by. Personally, I admired the movie very much and I guess it is one of the best movies of all times. Our story-line here is the present and we move forward to see in the process flashbacks to previous events in the past and here was a thoughtful great touch to represent these events in black and white. Our Actors here were the best with flawless and unforgettable performance. The plot however is the one element you can doubt as I thought that it wasn't enough to build the twist on it and it needed a little convincing time and reason but I guess the movie here wasn't trying to lecturer those who are in the same path that Derek took So in a complete evaluation I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I encourage you to watch it.",

The composition of the film was amazing, put together through real time and flashbacks in a seemingly perfect way. The great composition and amazing acting and meaning to this movie set it apart from so many others. Edward Norton showed in this movie as he had before and has after and still is today that he is an amazing and diverse actor, and has a moving performance, which i was not surprised at, at all. Edward Furlong on the other hand, i could not have imagined would have played his very important part as well as he did. I don't think any person of the stature and age for that role at the time could have done better than he did. This movie showed so well the real life issue of hate towards each other. Blacks hate for whites. Whites hate for blacks through very really movements like the Neo-Nazi movement. It also though is teaching a lesson that having hate in your life in general will only drag you down. This film is meaningful, well written, and well executed.

Probably my favourite movie with Edward Norton in it of all time and I would like to see him play some similar roles like this again because he is so good at it! Very capable of playing many different roles but this is definitely some of his best work apart from fight club! watch this movie now, and if you already have, watch it again, classic!

1098,15 February 2011,abfacebookab,7, Very good movie? yes. Instant classic? no.,"This is a response to some negative reviews. Some people were wondering how Derek, a supposedly smart kid was influenced only by his dad's one remark. Though the movie did not explicitly say this, I believe it is after his father died that he met Cameron, who became a father figure to Derek, and with his constant propaganda began to change Derek's mind and overwhelm the opinions of his family. Another question is why the African-American kid kills Danny at the end for seemingly nothing but blowing smoke in his face. Again it is implied that this is not their first interaction, and with Danny's opinions probably made very public, there was probably growing tensions between them, that with the smoke just put him over the edge, not to mention the African-American kid was also in a gang that was probably fighting with the white supremacist group Danny and Derek were a part of. This gang was also probably responsible for trying to kill Cameron and Seth at the end. Also, the ""change of heart"" that Derek had did not take place in 2 days like some reviewers are saying. Remember that Derek saw dealings he didn't like between his group and the minority groups in prison, this lead to tensions between him and the group which lead to him being raped in the shower. This combined with the growing relationship between him and the African-American he was working with and Sweeney's guidance were all factors in changing his attitude. Remember this was based on a true story so these events are not all bullshit. I do agree that some of the editing and stylistic choices weren't the best (ie the slow motion and could have explained things more clearly with more scenes). However it was still a very powerful movie.",

Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) used to be the kind of man that could be described in no other words than ""racist"" and the shadow of Hitler. And only after he lived his days in prison, did he realize how wrong he was about everything. When he was freed, he left that life...but that life continued around him. His little brother, Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong), was taught the same things he was taught, but Derek didn't want it that way.

1107,24 May 2006,AlexCartney14,10, A true film making masterpiece.,"A truly brilliant piece of film making, it is seen through the eyes of Danny who's brother, Derek got 3 years in prison for the murder of three black car jackers, Derek was a neo-Nazi skinhead, you see his time in prison in a series of flashback style shots, when Derek gets out of jail he is a changed man, he has left behind his racist past, but when he gets out of jail he finds that Danny has gone down the same evil, racist road that he had. It all happens over a 24 hour period as Derek tries desperately to save his brother from the same hate fuelled bigotry that consumed his life and got him jailed, you find that it was the friendship of a black inmate that made Derek change his views. He manages to change his brothers views but is it too late to protect Danny from his earlier mistakes? There are fantastic performances from both Norton and Furlong and I would find it almost impossible to not give this film 10 out of 10. The film is a compelling tribute to the unrelenting human spirit and its ability to overcome the intolerable. Like Danny did in the film i will end this review with a couple of quotes that i think fit well with this film: 'those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities', 'The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil but because of those who look on and do nothing.'

1109,14 August 2005,KSqueaker,10, The best movie I've seen in a while,"American History X is a very important movie. It delivers its point (the effects and seeds of racism in middle-class America) unabashedly. At points the film is grotesque (I won't say what, but I was trying to tell a friend about one scene and I couldn't even say it, it was so disturbing!!!) and sickening. Even just the mindset of Derek (played MASTERFULLY by Edward Norton) at certain points in the movie was horrifying. However, racism itself is a horrifying, electric issue that should not be handled lightly. A movie to compare American History X with is Crash, which tackles the issue of racism, but with a lot less subtlety and sincerity. And though it bears an R rating, the film feels so restrained, like the actors made it just to have something activist-ish on their resumes. American History X, however, shies away from no subject, and in its honesty delivers an uplifting message and a dire warning. The script and cinematography are excellent, but what stands out most is Edward Norton's performance. He is my favorite actor (and I don't take that title lightly), and gives a good reason why in American History X. Such complex, wildly different emotions (his apparent satisfaction killing some black men who were attempting to steal his car, his turnaround, guilt, and utterly moving explosion of grief at the end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For the next few months, and even today, I am constantly thinking about that movie and the intensity of it.

I recommend this film to everyone who is interested on knowing that the new Nazi movements are not something to take as a joke, that reality is in the streets and this history shows the horrors that this people commit. In my opinion the only failure that it has is that the personality of the small brother is not too much worked.

1116,27 May 2015,rahim-27597,8, this movie is good but not the best,"Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America. In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Main leader, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are undergraduate with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past",

Before seeing this movie a couple of years ago, I wasn't aware that there were skinheads in modern day. Even though the movie is quite controversial, it brings out a moral which everyone should respect. I love how the movie defined society and the influence of a person's environment, family, and upbringing. American History X was an excellent movie and it is also a great movie to tell others about. There are plenty of uneducated people out there that need to understand how their actions may be wrong. I think that this movie should be taught in school, or at least segments of it. It is a great movie and it will definitely pertain to modern society in 5, 10, 20 years because these issues still haven't stopped.

First off, Ed Norton - already one of my favourite actors - is absolutely flawless in his portrayal of a Neo-Nazi (Derek) who gets locked up for murdering two black thieves. When he comes out he realises what he has done to himself and his family, which includes a superb Edward Furlong of Terminater 2 fame. Told through his eyes the story flashes back to the incidents that lead Dereks incarceration and the impact it has on him. Also featuring excellent performances from Ethan Suplee and Fairuza Balk this film is the cream of the crop. If you haven't seen i suggest you do - quick.

Coming out of this movie I felt more emotionally drained than any other movie I can remember(Even more than after seeing Saving Private Ryan). One thing is for sure in my eyes, Tom Hanks will not be winning his third Oscar this year due to the exquisite performance by Edward Norton. If anyone enjoyed Norton in Primal Fear then watch out, because his performance in American History X is even better. All in all, this movie is the leading candidate in my eyes for best picture and actor.  Do yourself a favor and see it.",
1136,4 January 1999,Joy_Rika,10, This kind of a movie makes me want to go out and see movies.,"I've seen a lot of movies, this one has to top the cake for everything. From the realistic portrayal of Derek Vineyard by Edward Norton to the ""out of the news clips"" violence.  Not much is made up unfortunately... .the scenes from the Market, and even when Derek smashes the neck as ""the nigger"" has his teeth on the curb.  Both were very real accounts of White Supremist racists.  I just thought it was an excellent movie all together.",
1137,27 October 1999,MissLilyRowan,9," Powerful, Painful, Captivating","Possibly the most powerful, painful, fascinating film I've seen.  I consider myself a fairly liberal person, and accept the rights of every person to hold his or her own views.  But, for the first time in my life I couldn't watch the film all the way through on the first try.  I stopped the tape and cried.  Incredible film-making, realistic portrayals.  Norton is phenomenal. But I'm not sure I could watch it again.",
1138,20 December 1998,maria13,10, a script that burns away hypocrisy and cant,"I'm 60, and I agree with aweiss13. Stunning movie, and Edward Norton gives the hottest performance since Brando as Stanley Kowalski.",
1139,2 November 1998,Kestrl,10, One of the best movies in recent memory.,"This is a brutal film. Brutally graphic, brutally honest. Some of the scenes were nearly impossible to watch. But it's a full 24 hours later, and I can't get this film out of my head.  Edward Norton is phenomenal in his portrayal of Derek Vinyard.  My fear is that the press from the director will scare people away. The irony is that scaring people away from ""American History X"" would be as much a crime as scaring people away from ""Saving Private Ryan"". AHX isn't a perfect movie; there are a couple minor disconnects in the plot. Given these small flaws, what we are left with is a brilliant film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, not even after you walk out of the theater. One of the best movies in recent memory.",
1140,8 November 1998,maddy,10, A great film that gets the point across.,"This film, about a former neo-nazi who tries to prevent his brother from becoming like himself, was a ten. It got it's point across without being preachy like films with serious subject matter often are.  The excellent cinematography and imagery consistently support emotions conveyed by the wonderful acting of the cast.  The film also successfully displays the hypocracy of the neo-nazi regime, the horror of ignorance mixed with violence and the peace that comes with understanding.",
1141,22 November 1998,dewwy,10, Most powerful movie of all time,This movie was the most powerful movie of all time.  It deserves 4 stars definitely.  It moves you in ways nothing else can.

1142,22 November 1998,Podunk,10, My comments on American History X,"This was one of the best movies I have seen. I think the movie had a great message, and Edward Norton did a great job acting in the movie. I think he should be nominated for an academy award for best actor. However, from the low turnout I saw at the movie (I saw it twice, and the theater was less than half full both times) I think he will be passed over for actors in the movies that had a higher pay-off.",
1143,13 December 1998,Kraelyst,10, One you cannot miss,"American History X, despite the negative press given to it by its director, Tony Kaye, shows itself to be the best film of 1998. Edward Norton, as is the case in all of his movies, gives a splendid performance as a skinhead and ex-skinhead. This is a very powerful movie, with a very powerful message. Edward Furlong does a good job as well, as the misguided younger brother of Edward Norton. For the film's sake, and for the message it tells, do not miss this movie.",
1144,11 February 1999,Shazaam,9, Ed Norton,"Despite the Controversy of this film, the end product sent a meaningful message and a film worthy of $8.  Ed Norton who is nominated for the Academy Award, certainly gave the best and most unique performance of his career. If he doesn't win, the Academy will lose a notch of credibility because the other nominees aren't as strong (Please not Tom Hanks again playing Tom Hanks) Gump Yes, Philadelphia Maybe....Ryan no way! Ed Norton just gets better every project he does!",

The time just pass away swiftly when you are sitting front of the movie screen and let your breath be taken away by the story.

If you haven't seen it yet then you better, you will not regret it for a minute.",
1150,25 February 1999,atg,10, Brilliant portrayal of 'real' America - with its blemishes and hope,"When Americans as a whole are willing to see and make films about the flaws in their society and face up to them, then there is hope for the 'hungry, tired and poor' which the country is supposed to embrace.  The film is stunning in its presentation of the polarisation of society at many levels and in many ways.  I believe it should be promoted in American and perhaps foreign schools to make people question and, hopefully, learn and grow.  It will also help to show socities elsewhere in the world that America is not the fairy tale land of Disney, Armageddon and 90210.  The film is accurately dark, but shines a beacon of light that through understanding, and not through confrontation, is the key to individual and social happiness.  10 out of 10 for willingness to 'look in the mirror'.  It says something about America that the director is not American.  Are American entertainers quite ready to see themselves as they are, and not as the myth tells them they are?  More movies like this will say ""yes, finally"".",
1151,7 April 1999,Zigster-2,10, Gripping and Well Done.,I have to say that this movie was one of the best this year for me.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie.  I really liked Norton's character and Balk's portrayal.  Any one that sees this movie will see that only agony is the byproduct of hate.,
1152,27 March 1999,Henche,10, Great Movie,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It´s extremely good, But I have one question! Edward Furlong must be at least 23 by now....when is his voice going to develop? He sounds lika 14 year old kid",
1153,27 March 1999,Catspaws,10, The most powerful message ever delivered by a film.,"For those of you who have ever felt hatred or anger towards your fellow man, I grieve. Watch this film, and be sorry. Tony Kaye showcases the futility of race-hatred in a fantastic, harrowing film that touches you to your core. Top notch performances all round, but most especially from Edward Norton, make this film a must see for any cinema goer. I doubt any film will ever be able to hit me in such a dramatic, traumatic way again. Don't miss this.",
1154,10 April 1999,Zero-25,10, Good For A Pick Me Up!,I got a wonderful feeling after viewing this film.  It was great!  It could possibly become my favourite of all times.  Both Norton and Furlong were excellent for their roles.  It created the true image of racism to the most extreme and made me realize that things could get a whole lot worse.  Great to see if you are feeling sorry for yourself!,
1155,4 May 2013,bcostner21,9, American History X,"In the film American History X, Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, who after some influence by his father's words, and later anger from his father's murder by a black man, becomes a neo-Nazi and joins a local Nazi gang. Derek, who heavily influences his younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong, is informed one night by Danny that two black men are breaking into his truck outside. Derek then grabs his gun, runs outside, and proceeds to gun down the men. He then finishes off one of the would-be robbers by smashing his head on the curb. Soon after, he is arrested and convicted of manslaughter, and avoiding a murder charge because his younger brother refuses to testify against him.",
1156,6 May 2013,caliorange33,10, Excellent Movie,"American History X is one of the best films that I have seen in my lifetime. If I could, I would make it a mandatory viewing for every single individual. The moral lesson alone makes it a must see for everyone, especially those who are conflicted and caving to peer pressure; regardless of age. Throughout each of our lives we come to a cross roads at least once or twice where we have the opportunity to make a choice to let hatred consume us or to fight the urge for hatred to enter our hearts and our souls. This movie shows us how misdirected hatred can ruin lives, directly and indirectly. The film crew did a fantastic job collaborating to create a film that not only entertains, but one that makes the viewer think twice about the life they have lived and the impact they have had on the ones they love. I feel that all of the actors played their parts perfectly, but extra kudos goes to the core actors/characters: Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard and Edward Furlong as Danny Vinyard. These characters are played so well that you almost don't have a choice but to be pulled into the intensity of their lives. My favorite effects used in the movie, to my surprise, are the transitions from color images to black and white images. These transitions, in addition to the random and perfectly placed slow motion effects, enhance the emotional aspect of the film. As the story bounces around from present day/post incarceration and past/pre incarceration, it is easy to keep up with the storyline with the transition from color to black and white. I was surprised that I would like this aspect of the film, since I am not normally a big fan of black and white footage. The black and white images help the viewer to focus more on the emotions that need to be felt by the characters and the setting. On the surface, the film is about a reformed neo-nazi skinhead who, after being released from prison, tries to reverse the destruction he has created within his family – only to realize he is too late. Below the surface; however, is a much needed lesson that hatred of any kind will only destroy you and the people close to you. Regardless of what you believe when you allow anger to consume you, there is no good found in hatred. If you are looking for a fluffy film, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are looking to learn a much needed lesson about our culture and the world we live in, this is a must see.",
1157,14 April 1999,Gian-4,10, History as it is...,"This movie is very sad but true.  It shows the hate that has grown within us as part of the human race and how we deal with it.  The problem is not the color of your skin, it's how good you are at what you do.  If you don't work and you just hang out, you are a burden to society. That is why the skin-heads exist.  They aren't right or wrong, just a bit extremist.  When all is said and done, in the end we all suffer.",
1158,10 May 1999,djdeath,10," Powerful, provocative, and brilliantly made.","Powerful, provocative, and brilliantly made, American History X is definitely one of the most thought provoking films of the 90's.  The film's release was great as it was released in the end of the 90's and perfectly reflects how people in this decade react towards race. The film discusses issues such as the Rodney King riots, illegal immigration and black history in schools, which are all relevant to people in the 90's and are often hotly debated.  This film shows the most violent, extreme and shocking side of these debates, but manages to keep the visual violence to a minimum, unlike the violent Australian neo-nazi film ""Romper Stomper"".",
1159,20 April 1999,The Dude-20,10, The most powerful movie this year,"The most powerful movie of the year.  This movie was well written, well casted, and well directed.

This was the bottom line question that came out of this movie, and an excellent movie at that. Story/Music/Camera work great and very moving. The b&w footage for the past and the color for the present made the movie a bit easier to follow with all its jumping back and forth.  But the jumping back and forth helps make its point, to keep things fresh on your mind throughout the movie.",

1162,8 June 1999,Olbaid-2,8, Edward Norton displays phenomenal acting in this great film,This was a great film.  The acting is superb (especially Norton's) the script is for the most part very solid and there is some excellent cinematic techniques.  The one problem is that it is fairly clear that the film you are watching is not the director's vision.  There are many scenes that leave you confused since the dialogue refers to previous scenes that were cut by the studio.  All in all this is a very daring film and was a big risk but is incredibly successful in portraying the racial problems in North American society.,
1163,7 June 1999,Benny013,10, Powerful,"This film is the essence of power. Powerful theme, powerful message, and unbelievably powerful performance by Norton. Definitely overlooked as one of the best performances in the last few years. Unfortunate that a film such as this is needed in society, but it succeeds better than any other with the same theme. I haven't read all the comments about this film so I hope this isn't repeated but clearly the most important scene is the conversation at the dinner table with Derek and his father discussing his new teacher (Avery Brooks-also stellar in the film). This is the genesis for the rest of the movie-although Derek's development from the good student prior to this conversation to the extremist he becomes is lost to the natural lack of development that must occur in film, but clearly this type of ""harmless"" dinner chatter (and obviously the circumstances of his father's death) must be emphasized in film and life as powerful.",
1164,21 April 2000,ames-5,10, Provocative,"This movie dares to say a lot of things, good and bad, and forces us to think.  Rarely does a movie give us that opportunity to actually think about its message.  The racism and how the most unlikely of characters overcomes his feeling of racism (Edward Norton should have won an Oscar for this one)touches every single member of American society, racist or not, because we all have seen acts of racism.  I think this is a must-see for everyone.",

1166,22 July 1999,Zombied,9," Very powerful movie,and must see as well","Although American History X does somewhat lag in the early beginning,and on top of it may slightly come across with a TV movie feel to it,the film does quickly pick up and is quite powerful in it's depiction of a disgruntled young mans coming to terms with the death of his father who was killed by minorities during the LA riots,Director Tony Kaye has a very riveting formula to make the viewer almost somewhat understand and relate as to why young Derek would associate himself with his neo nazi counterparts.This in turn is the sole reason why the movie really is so hard hitting and all the more gutsy. As for the dialogue,i must admit there were some scenes which were next to brilliant,kudos to writer David Mckenna.As for Edward Nortons acting i can truly say it was a very well acted and well a delivered portrayal,i can see hands down why he won such critical acclaim and was also awarded the nomination for best supporting actor.All in all i think American History X is well worth a rental,movies like this do not come around everyday.",
1167,7 July 1999,Cherub-6,10, Edward Norton was great,"This movie is one of the best movies ever made. Edward Norton gave a great performance.  He worked out hard to get into shape for this movie.  Derek Vynyard(Edward Norton) might have had a stupid cause with the skinhead thing, but he was a leader.  He picked a cause that he liked and he was not a hypocrite.  He had a cause and he would have died for it. Even though racism is wrong, I like how he was such a leader.  Hate is wrong.",
1168,20 July 1999,Noodles-22,10, Extremely powerful and moving. Definitely an Oscar-calibre performance.,"When I think of the movie American History X, I see an image.  An image of Edward Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, eyes ablaze and standing in the street wearing only a pair of white boxer shorts.

1170,27 September 1999,Shareef-5,10, Edward Norton's acting is force to be reckoned with!!!,"They took a story of redemption and made it an epic portrayal of one man's struggle to rise above the hate they he has created. It's about hate, but more than that it's about American society as a whole and how the system works or doesn't. I was not completely in love with Edward Norton until seeing this film, he's one of the best in the business. This film was directed by Tony Kaye, who also did the cinematography of the film, this man has vision. There many new techniques and visual angles that make this film the fine film that it is. Hollywood should pay homage and take notes to this milestone. See it again for the very first time!!!",

1181,17 July 2000,Animal Mother,10, One of the best of all time!,The reason why I found this movie so appealing was that it is the only movie concerning racism (that I have seen) that examines the problem from both sides. Although the ideas of Nazism and racism are certainly not encouraged you can see how impressionable and frustrated young kids could resort to this.,
1182,14 October 2001,hbinc,10, A very polemical film that has some great acting in it as well!,"American History X is a film that looks at racism in the today's society and how it is simply a form of ignorance that has existed in this country for many years. As a minority college student I found this film to be intriguing as well as polemical because it looked at a man by the name of Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) and how his views of other ethnicities simply changed because of an event that happened earlier in his life. Because of that as well as other family influences he went on to believe that all minorities were simply in the United States because they ""slipped through the cracks"" because some immigrants were over here in the US illegal and he also believed that they were trying to take what the ""white man"" has owned for years and that simply is not the case. Norton's character eventually becomes incarcerated and this eventually leads to his complete reformation which I found to be amazing but in the same sense it let me know that anyone can change their belief of something such as racism, they just have to want to do so first. American History X is an excellent movie with some great acting and a good movie for anyone who has views on racism or hating someone else because of their race.",

If Michael Bay had directed it then this would be 10 out of 10 material, but that isn't the case. The only appealing part to this movie was the ending credits because that's when I could tell my friend to leave and take his garbage movie with him.

I will only comment on one scene in the movie. Two little boys playing on the beach. Innocent. Like they ought to be. The rest of the world isn't. Their innocense is losing ground. Every day. Fear takes over. And innocense becomes ignorance. I think that with this scene or picture, the director tries to tell you, that it can happen to you too. Some things in life just happen.

1197,5 May 2006,alex_rosenfield,10, An excellent & moving film,"Of all the thought provoking and absorbing movies I've seen, American History X is placed right at the top. A superb plot combined with magnificent acting makes this one of the all time greats. From the films opening scenes to its gripping, knife-edge conclusion, the film powefully portrays one man's struggle to assimilate back into society after serving a prison sentence for race related crimes. The film weaves ingeniously between the flashbacks and the present state of Edward Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, a one time neo-Nazi, who's violent hatred of America's multi-cultural society culminates in the brutal murder of two men. Derek's imprisonment proves to be a life-changing experience, as upon his release he appears to his adoring family and friends as a reformed man, who's appearance, beliefs & ideology have drastically changed. With a clean slate, Derek now faces the gruelling challenge of rescuing his brother from following the same doomed path which resulted in his own incarceration. I was genuinely absorbed with this film from start to finish and although fictional, I felt it fully demonstrated the dangers and damaging consequences of racism. Norton's tremendous acting complements a clever storyline, which still leaves me in suspense every time.",
1198,20 November 2006,pandkkelly,10," excellent acting, mature script, wonderful direction","I consider American History X to be an extraordinarily good film. It is a social education in itself and an object lesson in human relations gone wrong. The script is so real that you are actually there. All of the acting is so good that one tends to believe the actors' value system are reflected in their lines, although this could not be so because if they believed what they are saying they could not cooperate with each other. All of this is paced and timed by marvelously direction.",
1199,7 February 2001,trollins,10, Masterful Performance,"The intensity of Edward Norton brings an incredible reality to the film. Even though the film is sprinkled with veteran character actors,  EN sets the standard and everyone rises to the occasion.  The gradual and casual progression towards intense violence carries a powerful message of how easily today's youth can be influenced.  One draw back I have found is the uncanny similarity to ""Menace 2 Society""",

Derek's face alternates between pride and joy, all the way down to horror and shock in only a few moments time. This is the scene that basically identifies what the film truly is, a movie about a lot of prideful people about something truly horrifying and frightening.",
1202,22 April 2006,reynoso_juan,10, This movie rocks!!!! (and is true in most ways!),"When i started to watch this movie I thought is was just be another crappy documentary about the Neo-Nazis and their uprising. I have seen a lot of them on the History Channel and they all suck! But as I watched the movie further and further I realized it was more emotional than I first perceived. The movie gave you true to life scenes of what it is to be a modern white Skinhead. All the parts were played perfectly, Edward Nortons' acting is superb. He plays the role so strongly that sometimes you believe that he REALLY is a Nazi (althought he is not). The drama in this movie is so realistic and very violent too. For example there is a scene is this movie where Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is in prison and gets raped by his fellow Skinheads because Derek believed they did not convey the views of the Aryan (Neo-Nazi) brotherhood like they were supposed to. Furthermore, after he is raped, one of his old history teacher in high school talks to him about his brother Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong: T2 actor). Daniel is Derek's older brother and he is killed at the end of the movie because he was a skinhead. Overall this movie is so true to life that it seems like a documentary but it is a movie. A must watch. ( NOT FOR THE KIDS THOUGH!!!)",
1203,25 April 2006,thedietcokeofevil,10, Superb!,"Not a film that I really rushed to see but one that I've now seen again and again. Without wanting to give any spoilers, if you thought Edward Norton's performance in Fight Club was half decent... see this film. In my opinion career best performances from both Ed Norton and Ed Furlong, with great performances from the rest of the cast. A story of hate, hypocrisy and manipulation. A superb script and excellent direction make a film that is emotionally gripping, politically powerful and entertaining. Anyone who is not moved by this film is not human ;o) I really can't say anymore aside from this... Stop whatever you're doing and go watch it NOW!!!",

The acting is incredible, also. But the storyline is what really gets you; this stuff really happens. All of it, it's all so realistic. I borrowed a copy of this movie to watch and I've watched it every day since I borrowed it. I don't plan on giving it back until I've purchased my own copy. Both Edwards (Norton and Furlong) give incredible performances in this movie. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, can learn at least one thing from American History X. I highly recommend it.",

Every time I sit in my living room and watch this again, and again. I get something new out of it every time. But it also displays that the hate the world has for each other, why do we as mankind always turn to violence, and hurt, and hate rid when we get mad. A quote that Edward Furlong says when he is shot has been making me think for a very long time. That quote is "" Well this is where I tell you what I have learned, my conclusion right. Well my conclusion is hate is baggage and life is to short to be pissed off all the time it's just not worth it"" That is true he is trying to tell us that we should stay happy not mad.

It is also the most heavy film I can recall seeing that actually had a message-- the message to the viewer is extremely strong by the end. This film deals heavily with the aspects of racial bigotry in Venice Beach, CA showing us the power of what is wrong and the extent to which is effects everyone. Edward Norton is a fantastic actor in all of his films and certainly does not sell himself short in this film as well. Last, but certainly not least, the cinematic style of this film is truely unique and notably one of the best I have ever seen. The portrayal of black and white scenes and motifs of slow-motion in times of heavy narrative is extremely effective.

We watched it in my Movies and Literature class, but my teacher had edited it for time, and violence. When I finally got a chance to go rent it, I saw it for what it really is; A great movie. I must say after reading a lot of you guys post, racism will always be alive and well in America. We can try all we can to change it, but it will never change. Me personally I see people not color, some of my best friends are caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, whatever nationalities racist people see. I believe this movie sheds light on the few people that do make a change and stand for what is right. After this movie Ed Norton became one of my favorite actors. If you have the time, try picking this one up, it is definitely a classic in the eyes of many, and a one of a kind in my eyes.",

1221,7 August 2006,robgarza3,8, Crime movie about racial prejudice in cities.,"American History X is not for the faint of heart. The film has questionable scenes and dialog however, a very mentionable theme that leaves the viewer with many personal questions, ideas and thoughts of racial inequality and prejudice. The movie leaves the viewer with an astounding ending and truly touches each viewer so as to keep them thinking; thinking of racial conflicts in the movie and in their own lives. The movie is directed wonderfully so as not to confuse the viewer when the main character's little brother, Danny, recollects past events in his family's life. The scenes that are of the past are depicted in black and white, unlike the colored scenes of the present. The acting performed by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong is exceptional; very dramatic and emotional. The movie contains the wonderful element of irony more than once. The overall theme stays with the viewer and is just inspiring; inspiring to do for all races because we are all people. The movie's music, dialog and ""eventful"" scenes all contribute to the mood of the movie very well. You, as the viewer, can truly feel the hatred the actors feel towards other races; you might even feel disgust on the basis of their thoughts and preemptive actions. The movie questions your own thoughts and actions towards others. The film is about how we, as individuals, choose to live. I recommend this film to young teens and adults all around. It is a very dramatic and inspiring film full of amazing tone, mood and irony. The movie will touch all in some way and stick with you while you keep thinking of racial issues discussed in the movie.",

Second the story is also amazing just to see how much Edward Norton's character went through in his life up to the point where his brother gets killed, it leaves you with a feeling that he himself wishes he would die because it is his fault.

Ed Norton SHOULD have won for this role but I guess a nomination will have to suffice.  I have never seen an actor portray such anger and hatred WITHOUT the use of words, everyone who has seen the movie knows the scene I am referring to...... and to those that haven't seen it yet..... you'll know it when it happens.  Ed Furlong does an excellent job in a supporting role which shows he has grown up since his Terminator 2 days, and seeing Bev D'angelo so gritty threw me for a loop.  We ain't watching a Vacation movie anymore.....",

If not for anything else, this film has some of the best acting in any movie, especially that of Edward Norton, who plays a perfect character. Edward Furlong plays the part of Norton's brother, and with a strong supporting cast, this film will, WILL make an impression on you. Make your own decision on this film. Others have expressed that this movie is too cliché, too predictable, etc. Others say it is one of the most influential films of the 90's. Once seen, you will lean one way or the other, but my guess is that you'll lean towards influence. In my opinion, this film discusses race issues we still deal with today from a fresh perspective of a higher class of white supremacy, and does a spectacular job of offering life lessons without preaching about normal diversity and race related issues we often hear today in our schools, businesses, and media. Regardless of what people say, especially on this website, this film is a must see.",

Everyone I Know Who Has Watched This Film Hasn't Just Watched It Once They Have Watched It 5 or 6 Times! I Love It...And The Actors Are Great!

""American History X"" touches a subject, which I can no longer say isn`t used enough, because every movie maker not only think that their views on the subject of racism are brilliant, but also original, and usually the product ends up being incredibly pompous and pretty boring. However, I can say that director Tony Kaye and writer David Mckenna do not fall under that category.

American History X is one of the most powerful and in your face movies I have ever seen.  The movie will lead you through a maze of emotions as you watch.  You will cry, you will become angry, and you will laugh (not much, though).  I enjoyed this movie very much, mainly because it shows the struggle of a reformed racist fighting to save his brother from the ignorance of nazism and racism.  The way the movie is filmed and written, mostly in a flashback (all of which is filmed in black and white) makes it easy to follow the story.  It is well written and the movie flows exceptionally well.  The movie is as brutally honest as it is brutally violent.  The violence shown is enough to startle and shock almost anyone, but all of the violence is done in good taste.  If you are interested in reality-based movies that aren't afraid to show you what is going on in society, then this is the movie for you.  Also recommended is Romper Stomper with Russell Crowe.",

Enough of the preaching, the film truly is one of my personal favourites, Norton to date has never been better or bulkier, your with Nortons character Derek all the way, from skull smashing racist to reform seeking liberal, the guys just so cool that you follow him all the way.

Its scary when you really think about it. this movies shows how you can transition from being a racist to being someone who doesn't see people for what color they are but for who they are. and when you try to change it may be to late. you may have ticked someone off to the point where there is no hope for you. Some people have to understand that we are not different from any one else. that we have the same blood and we are part of the same world. no one is any different than the other. its very hard to make people believe that.,

1243,19 January 2022,berejokgolap,10, nothing goes unnoticed,"The film shows that nothing goes unnoticed. Even a seemingly ordinary conversation at the dinner table can grow into a violent garden of hatred and malice, destruction and murder. Action generates opposition, those who really deserve it do not always suffer, and often innocent people have to pay for the mistakes of others. And help can come from the one from whom you least expect it. But I want to elaborate not on this, but on Derek's words before the attack on the supermarket. After all, if you think about his words, then he said everything correctly. His fiery speech absolutely correctly formulates the problem of emigrants and forces us to fully agree with it. Emigrants are needed to dilute a highly developed cultural society, to maintain the population. Recent events in England have clearly shown the problem of the non-indigenous population. Yes, they were born and live in the country, more than one generation has changed, but the genetic memory of Africans, Indians, Asians and others has not gone anywhere. Whole generations of families of African descent live on benefits and do not even seek to get an education, find a decent job. What for? After all, you can live by theft, distribution of drugs, weapons, etc. And this genetic memory, like an infection, penetrates the unformed minds of young Englishmen, forcing them to maraud too.

1245,25 February 2022,randypanlife,10, My eyes have seen the glory,Powerful masterpiece of the 90s. Clear message that doesn't hide behind any sugar coated moments. Each actor plays their role masterful. Beautifully shot movie.,
1246,29 December 2001,kay-man,9, Highly Recommended,A brilliant and disturbing movie about racial conflict and its after effects in modern day America. Beautifully shot (cleverly using B&W film). American History X is frighteningly real and to the point. Highly recommended.,
1247,16 January 2002,Elissa19,10, Edward Norton is awesome,"Although parts of this movie were hard watch, I thought it was great overall! Edward Norton is a great actor and he is wonderful in all of his movies. I was forced to watch this movie for a class and wasn't looking forward to it, but I was pleasantly surprised!",
1248,13 June 2007,mainmanmitch,10, A brilliant film,"This film is brilliant, pure class. It shows directly the consequences of being a white supremacist. It managed to get a true portrayal of Skinheads in America, people say that the shower scene wasn't needed, it is one of the most effective scenes in there and it's the major turning point of the film. The last scene of the film though is one of the single most effective pieces of cinema in recent years, it doesn't pussy out and let him live because he's changed his ways, it kills him for his past convictions. Now i rate this film highly up there with my favourite (taxi Driver, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, The Departed and Trainspotting). I'm not trying to say go out and see it but if you get a chance watch it. Not for the squeamish or the immature. If you like it i suggest you watch This Is England and Qudrophenia two films about English gang culture (Skinheads came from Mods)",
1249,13 June 2007,cursedperfection,8, Worth watching,"Reading the comments, this movies seems to be like marmite. A love or hate affair. Which probably has something to do with their tastes or lifetime experiences - you name it.",
1250,28 June 2007,gemini-81,7, Gives a fair perspective on things.,"Gives a fair perspective on things. Contains a moral without shoving it down the spectator's throat. At times oversimplified and a little too symbolic, which is why I wouldn't give it a perfect 10, but these directing flaws can easily be forgiven for the merits of good acting. Most characters have enough depth not to be sorted into just ""good"" or ""bad"" categories, which is quite rare for a film with such a charged subject as racial hate, or, for that matter, any subject for which the officially ""right"" point of view has been formed. In times when political correctness goes above truth, and people are presented preformed sterile opinions without knowing why, this film should be seen by every young generation.",
1251,11 July 2007,sumrah-cristalino,10, A must see.,"Great Movie. I admit i only start to watch it because of E. Norton (another great performance), but now i'm glad i had the chance to watch this fabulous movie, almost 10 years after it was made.. 10/10, great story, cast, picture. ",
1252,13 July 2007,mariok-4,7," An examination of racism, in both directions, that is brutal, but brutally honest","I'm not quite sure which planet the last reviewer lives on, but to suggest that racism doesn't exist purely because of the colour of a person's skin is being either naive or in denial. This film portrays just how one-dimensional racists and white supremacists really are. The main character's views, played by Edward Norton, on white supremacy are second hand, as are his young brother's (played by Edward Furlong). Their conversion to racism is dramatic, almost akin to the conversion on the way to Damascus, and yet highly plausible. Their deliverance is again dramatic, and this can possibly be because their racist convictions were not necessarily genuine, or deeply held. I'm not quite sure why the last reviewer thought that class and other weightier topics were ignored, I believe they're present, but not rammed down your throat, after all, this is a movie about the dark side of humanity that comes clothed in racism,and racism in both directions. It isn't attempting to explore issues of poverty, mental illness etc. as I said, other issues do feature, you only have to be observant. ",
1253,9 May 2002,shan_14_,10, This is the best movie!,The first time I saw this movie I was blown away.  I couldn't believe people could actually be that ignorant.  This is a great movie.  I don't know how many times I've watched it.  It teaches a very good lesson.  I think if people would watch this movie and wake up it would solve a lot of our hate crimes out there...there's no reason for them.  I advise you to see this movie.  If you haven't seen it yet you need to.,
1254,6 June 2008,im_farabi_99,10, Simply Stunning.,This movie is without a doubt just incredible.,
1255,5 October 2007,Dannystokes,8, exhilarating!,"Thats the only word that I could think of to describe this picture. During the course of the film you will experience many of the emotions known to man; Joy, sorrow, anguish, ecstasy, but to name just a few. with Tony Kaye directing a stellar cast, perhaps the only emotion that you won't feel during the course of the film is boredom. The script is magnificent, and with Edward Norton and Edward Furlong perhaps putting in the performances of their life in the leading roles this film is not to be missed.",
1256,16 May 2002,DimitrisM21,10, Just look in his eyes...,"Watch this film, just look in Edward Norton's eyes and you 'll see why so many people hung on his talent... About the film: It's really hard for everyone to come against himself and his ideas, seeing that every person he used to believe to abandoned him. And that his choices and ideas had as  a cost his brother's life.",
1257,17 December 2007,iwillhelp88,10, it was an amazing movie,"This movie is one of my favorite of all time. One of the things that made the movie what it was to me was the unique differences and what most people would consider a ""mistake."" I think that the ending was kind of well...really sad, but I didn't like it because it left everything unresolved. The characters were all pretty well-rounded and all made the story a mind altering experience. The story line was also slightly kind of hard to follow; there was a lot of people that had problems interacting with each other throughout the whole movie. It was dramatic and full of thrill, in the end, its an amazing story with good lessons and messages. The move makes you second guess a lot of the decisions that you have made in your life about people of the opposite race, which tells me that the move shows you a better way to look at things.",
1258,15 August 2008,acdc_ataka,9, My look,Well I've watched this movie on my SE while traveling in a bus and although the 176X220 screen I was amazed by the power of the movie - Edward Norton plays his role brilliantly (as usual) and Edward Furlong shows he can play serious roles too.,
1259,21 July 2008,JrPlested,9," Quite simply, a masterpiece!","Before watching this I was thinking of how I thought the movie would be, my imagination didn't even give me a hint of the power this movie has. ",
1260,28 August 2012,spunjab_ca,10, My Experience,"I watched this movie trying to discard it as a ""hollywoodized"" version of Romper Stomper. I had seen bits and pieces of this movie on TV many years ago and thought it was interesting but didn't understand it as a whole. Having watched Romper Stomper a few days back and reading its reviews, I was reminded of American History X's predictable plot. So I decided to watch it yesterday and prove myself right.. I was in error! This movie blew me away! I was watching it for all the wrong reasons, trying to compare it to a movie (Romper Stomper) that was very different from this one and in a league of its own. I was very moved by the whole thing, especially Edward Norton's performance. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, any race, any gender.. it may just change your life.",
