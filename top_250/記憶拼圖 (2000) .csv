0,28 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, Genius thriller,"This unique and well-crafted tale is a top-notch thriller packed with suspense, excellent characterisation, and a style of story-telling which means the viewer has to use his or her brain for a change. Unsurprisingly it seems to have been ignored by the mainstream crowd, but in any case it's one of the best (if not THE best) films of 2000. Guy Pearce is outstanding in the leading role of Leonard, a man who has developed a short-term memory loss syndrome since a horrific accident which means he cannot remember anything for longer than twenty minute intervals. Thus he is forced to tattoo clues on his body and take Polaroids to remind himself of his quest, which is to hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife and kill him.",/
1,7 November 2001,Hitchcoc,9, Mind Blowing,"I spent considerable time doing research on the brain for a class I was teaching.  One of the most intriguing things I dealt with was the idea of short term memory.  There are cases of people who carry around a suitcase with them, containing all the things they need to continually review to stay in the present with any sort of functionality.  I had heard about this film and read a very sketchy review.  I rented it because I knew my family wouldn't be interested in the violence.  So late at night, I sat and took this film in with total concentration.  I need to watch it again, but right now it may have cracked my top ten list.  The last time I was so enthralled by a film was Coppola's ""The Conversation.""  Both of these films are fairly bleak and occasionally confusing and absolutely captivating. How anyone can be bored by this with all the junk that is being produced these days, I will never understand.  I know it's a gimmick film.  I know it's manipulative. So what?  Don't all films manipulate us, especially those steeped in mystery and suspense.  I knew exactly what was going on and I couldn't wait to see how it ended (began).  ",r
2,13 August 2020,nateahoey,10, I guessed and guessed... I never got close.,"I know that it's a little late by now for this review considering this movie is twenty years old by now. However, it's still amazing. The way that Christopher Nolan puts this movie in a jumbled order that you don't quite realize until halfway through is genius. What's very interesting is how you have to think for a while then you get it. Spoilers ahead stop reading if you haven't seen it yet!
You have the movie starting with him shooting Teddy, and then how he got there in the next scene, but what's funny is you think it's leading up to (or I guess leading down to) how he's going to reveal that Teddy is the bad guy. He is not! He's a cop, a not crooked one but a cop all the same, that's using a guy with no short-term memory to kill off drug dealers. Then you have Natalie, who seems nice but is ripping him off just the same and is using him to kill drug dealers that are competition and to get the cop off of the streets. You have him being used by everyone around to fit their purpose, turning him from a man on a revenged quest to basically a serial killer. They make him kill who they want as long as they justify it will help him. It's very well told and really makes you mad that the guy you're rotting for is a killer that's been duped. Nobody is a good guy. There is no hero. And why is it good then? It plays with your mind so well, you walk away and contemplate on it forever. Great movie, one of Nolan's best ever.",e
3,6 February 2003,Old Joe,10, Some memories are best forgotten. You have to appreciate how original a movie Memento' really is!,"Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world. ",v
4,4 April 2009,ruffinelli_ro,9, A trip into the mind,"If the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really confused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn't work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors' performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.",i

You will be talking about Memento at work, at the grocery store (to total strangers!), and you will find yourself joining conversations when you hear the word ""Memento.""

8,22 January 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10, A very strong contender for Christopher Nolan's best film,"Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.",r

Before I saw this film, I took movies only as a piece of entertainment but after seeing Memento I realised movies are ART. It took me time to release this fact but Memento opened the doors for me to watch more original & indie movies.",w
10,16 September 2010,kosmasp,10, Have I seen you before?,"If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before.

12,2 October 2001,EThompsonUMD,9, Original and intriguing film noir revision.,"Revising such film noir conventions as a story told through the unreliable point of view and voice-over narration of a morally flawed investigator-protagonist, the pervasive infusion of a dark past into the narrative present, and the use of a femme fatale as an embodiment of evil allure, Memento is perhaps the most original and intriguing revision of the genre since Welles' Touch of Evil.",6
13,25 June 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, like nothing that you've ever seen before,"""Memento"" is one of those movies that I fear discussing because I don't know how much I can tell without giving the whole thing away. You might have heard that the story gets told in reverse and that Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, who has a memory problem. People are able to abuse him and all sorts of other horrible things. Then, he has to use the little bit of memory that he has left to...no, I can't tell you; it would give the whole movie away. My point is that ""Memento"" is a most incredible movie. You quite literally have to see it to believe it. You might even want to watch it more than once, possibly backwards. Or something similar.",5
14,7 February 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10, Just saw- One of my favorite movies of all time,"This is based on a novel by Jonathon Nolan (Chris Nolan's brother) and starring Australian actor Guy Pearce.

15,24 May 2001,lasher42,10, can't believe how much I'm still thinking the day after,"So the ""innovative"" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here's a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.",4
16,2 September 2021,inkblot11,10, Finally saw this gem of an enigmatic film!,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a terrible problem. After his wife was murdered and presumably he was beaten, he has no short term memory. His last recollection is the moments before his wife's demise. Now, he is determined to track down the killer the police couldn't find. Yet, everyday he must read his notes and gaze at the many tattooed phrases on his body so that he can continue. Two people appear to be helping him in his quest. One is a man named Teddy, who pops around all the time but seems rather shady. Equally so is a Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss) who is sleeping with Leonard but may have ulterior motives. Meanwhile, Leonard stays at a cheap Los Angeles Hotel where the manager introduces himself every day and, underhandedly, adds to Leonard's bill. As he crisscrosses the city looking for the murderer, the film also flashes back to his time as an insurance investigator to give us more clues. For you see, this film is designed to force the viewer to piece together the plot, bit by bit! Are you game? I finally saw this fantastic Nolan film that everyone raves about incessantly. Its worthy of the highest praise as the plot travels backwards, forwards, and sideways. Pearce is wonderful as the main character, but, one quibble, I'm not fond of him as a blonde. The supporting cast is also superb with few big names except Moss. The setting in Los Angeles has its splendors and its dives. Memento is a huge cut above most other film experiences. While you are guaranteed to be confused at times, the whole experience is very, very rewarding.",6

18,9 May 2001,jbparker,9," Its not a gimmick, its something new","Yes, it's true.  The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, I honestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit. I loved every scene; discovering information as our lead character discovered it. It demands a second and third viewing, as there are many subtleties and quick flashes that may not be picked up on the first time around.  Its one of the most original films ever made, and for people who scoff at the concept of not having a short-term memory, it actually is a real condition. Watch this movie. And, please pay attention. The performances are wonderful, and its structured magnificently.",?
19,25 August 2015,SnoopyStyle,10, unique viewing experience,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss. His last permanent memory is an attack by two men. He killed the one who killed his wife. The other one escaped after clubbing him in the head. The police dismisses the idea of a second man. He keeps a record of his experiences using tattoos, Polaroids and hidden notes. He has to figure out whether he can trust Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) or Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) as he searches for the second man to avenge his wife.",r
20,14 October 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility"".","I just watched this picture three times in five days, and before you get around to asking - no, I'm not a glutton for punishment. It's just that I was totally fascinated with the way the story was presented, as if it was rigged with a perpetual rewind button that brings the viewer back a couple days prior to the last rewind. These kinds of stories have a way of making my head hurt, but there was something about this one that was different. Maybe it's the way the story had you empathizing with Guy Pearce's character Lenny. The man was relentless in his quest to find his wife's murderer, but at the same time, that murder might not have ever really happened. There are literally as many interpretations of this picture as there are people who have seen it, and reading some of the other viewer posts and discussion threads are bound to move even the firmest of opinions to yet another different conclusion. So in that respect, the film invites criticism for being nothing more than a gimmick, even if a thought provoking and mind bending gimmick. I have to say, I usually like my movies wrapped up in forthright fashion, even if I don't like the resolution. But here it's virtually impossible to know anything for sure because it's all based on Lenny's reconstruction of events, relying on facts and not memories, as he explains in one of the sequences to Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But what happens when the facts can metamorphose as they did here? I just know I can't watch this again for awhile because I've come to enough different conclusions already.",e

He explains that he still recall events that took place before the night that he came home and discovered his wife being raped and murdered. He is hunting for the killer; to make this possible he must keep notes and take photographs to remind him who the people in his life are now, the most important facts he has tattooed onto his body.

23,1 November 2010,kylemyle728,10, Overview and analysis behind the shocking plot.,"During the movie ""Memento,"" the audience is left guessing throughout the whole movie until the very end. It has a unique style of presenting the plot in which the movie begins with a scene and then it plays backwards from there. While the movie jumps backwards scene by scene, there is also a transition played in black and white that is continuously playing forwards until a certain point. It is not until the very end of the movie where the scenes played in color meet with the ones played in black and white. This is where the climax of the movie occurs and all the revelations of each characters role are revealed. It is a must see and you will not regret it.",=

25,12 September 2000,TOXIC-7,10, You have NEVER seen a movie like this before!,"This is by far the most original movie and engaging mystery since the Third Man. Christopher Nolan's storytelling brilliance will captivate audiences with his time twist and flipping of the story's narrative. The structure has been turned upside down and backwards giving us an incredible perspective. The film is one of a kind and it will leave people dumbfounded because of Nolan's craftiness and imagination. Absolutely the best film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2000. Nolan, has thrusted himself into the category of vanguard filmmakers, along with David Fincher, PT Anderson, Guy Ritchie & Darren Aronofsky.",t

But for me, Nolan has convinced me he is one of the most important directors out there. I was even thinking, ""It must be easy to edit a movie so that it's all backwards."" But it's not, it's not any easier - and he leaves you straining and watching from scene to scene, searching for the truth.

30,17 February 2023,RobTheWatcher,7, Memento,"Memento is a one of a kind film that to me felt like it didn't quite live up to the hype and reviews. The cinematography itself was superior and the way it filmed was extremely unique and had never been done before which I appreciate. But for how unique and different it was, it was equally confusing and just all over the place. I felt the movie lost your attention and just lacked an overall synergy. The story line was cool and there was a lot of mind bending moments that made you think but I just think this movie could've been redone and been better than it ended up being. Worth the watch regardless still.",

32,17 January 2021,Morejambo54,7, Smart but nothing else,"I like to start my review by saying that I don't think this is an enjoyable movie which doesn't mean it is at all bad, I thought it was very good actually. The story is what stands out, it's very unique and the way it is presented is great although it is rather slow throughout. For me it was a bit boring as it was straight dialogue for two hours, but it did all lead to a dramatic ending which was quite satisfying yet a bit confusing. Most Christopher Nolan movies are quite confusing though so I did expect this when coming into it and I did understand what happened I don't feel like I was truly able to take in so much knowledge in at once and it left me a bit baffled. The acting was pretty good, nothing stood out to me neither did the music used and it wasn't that tense but the idea as a whole was great and that is pretty much the only reason I give this higher than a five, the story. I wish it were showed in a different way or just readjusted to better suit the high percentage of slightly idiotic people watching the movie, which I feel like I fall under that category after watching this. I give this seven for it's cleverness alone.",

Unlike Pulp Fiction, the backwards element got annoying and tiresome fast in this film.  It certainly was a creepy film, maybe even affecting (time will tell, since I just watched it), but I didn't find it all that enjoyable.  The ending was unsatisfying for me, after sitting through the previous hour and fifty minutes (yes, I found myself watching the clock to count down when it would wrap up).  I suppose I could get a bit more out of it with repeated watchings, but I don't really care enough to bother with that.  I would give this one a 5/10, although few of you will probably agree with me so let the flames begin!",
34,15 November 2000,the red duchess,9, Brilliant culmination of a series of anti-detective thrillers.(possible spoilers),"It is refreshing to see a (relatively) mainstream thriller that does not follow the tired old rules, that uses Resnais, rather than Mel Gibson, as a starting point, that substitutes for an inevitable linear plot a temporal time bomb, where the straight line of events is smashed to pieces and put together with seeming haphazardness.  Further, this plot is told completely from one character's point-of-view, a character as we by now know, with short-term memory.

One of the best thing's he does is create such a mysterious story, that it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate the movie that much more.

Not only the writing was perfect, but also the direction part. Nolan did an amazing job in introducing us to this fictional world, that everything felt almost real. The way he combined the black&white scenes with the ""colored"" ones was simply unique. There is nothing like it. Then, the acting was impeccable as well. Although this film might be a bit too difficult to understand for some viewers, there are still a lot of things to enjoy from this experience even if you don't understand the movie completely! As a conclusion, I simply adore and recommend this film with all my heart, because it is without a question one of the greatest and most unique films of all time and this is all thanks to the great Chris Nolan!",

People rating this a 10 or a 4 star movie have been fooled to believe the movie is somehow deeper then it actually is. It's actually a very simple movie. When you first watch the movie you aren't sure what's going on (confusion is the intent to kind of give the viewer Leonard's perspective), you believe it's a mystery and are trying to piece things together, but in all actuality, it's not a mystery and there is nothing to really piece together, which is fine, just don't kid yourself that it's some type of mind bender that you as a viewer must figure out. Spoilers At the end of the day, Leonard is constructing these endeavors to give his life meaning...that's the big ahhah moment! So the whole time you're trying to figure out what's going on, the answer is; Leonard is just giving himself something to do. Not that big of a deal. Not a biggie, but the scene where Leonard found out that the Motel Clerk was ripping him off was kind of lame. Wouldn't that be something worth writing down, rather then chuckling about? It's kind of a big deal.",

66,16 June 2020,richardtownsley-19550,10, A very entertaining - and confusing - ride,"Memento is probably one of the most unique - and confusing - movies I have ever watched.
Memento does something that few other movies have done before: it is shown backward. There are scenes shown backward, along with scenes shown forward, and the two eventually converge during the climax. And while showing a movie backward may seem like a horrible way to craft a movie, it is everything but. It shows us something that will happen, and shows us how we got there. Whether we like it or not, the ending is inevitable. The movie opens with a murder, and at first, it seems justified; the man raped and murdered the wife of our protagonist, Leonard (Guy Pierce). However, as the movie progresses, or rather digresses, we learn that the man was, in fact innocent. Leonard has a strange case of anterograde amnesia that prevents him from making new memories. Every 5 minutes, he forgets who he is, where he is, and why he is there. As a result,
he uses a complex (but heavily flawed) system of notes and photographs to understand his
everyday life. He relies on these notes to survive, and track down John Doe, the man who raped and murdered his wife. Memento has so many plot twists that it is often hard to keep up with, but in fear of spoiling for you, I will end this review here.",

68,7 December 2006,planktonrules,8, Intriguing idea--but #26 on IMDb??!?!?!?!,"Huh? Talk about an unreliable score for a film! Unfortunately, IMDb is very, very, very skewed by recent movies. So many older great films have very few reviews or have generally lower scores--not because they are worse than newer films, but because there is a bias against older films because SOME reviewers are teens or people who simply won't consider anything that was not made in the last decade or so. Likewise, there is often a strong bias only for Hollywood blockbusters, even though many foreign or ""small"" films deserve recognition but are ignored because people just refuse to try something outside their comfort zone. This is a real shame, as there is just so much more out there. While MEMENTO is a decent and very unconventional film (I sure respect them for trying something DIFFERENT), it isn't great when viewed in context.",
69,28 April 2022,Xarx117,10, Perfect!,"THE ART OF STORYTELLING! Yes many writers have issues with this, but not Christopher Nolan. The way the timeline is introduced gets you fully in the story and it makes you try to understand and guess what's going on. But every time you think you figured it out, you end up wrong. Each scene has a very powerfull way of making this intire story a puzzle that you feel the need to solve, but you wont suceed. And this is why the ending leeves you really speechless. The execution of the black and white scenes is really great. The story dives so much in everyday activity that you don't feel like you are watching a movie, you feel like its happening! Especialy with Guy Pierce's flawless acting. Its one of the most interresting plot in movies ever thought. The characters, the timeline, the soundtrack, the acting, the plot... Everything is perfectly put togheter to make the perfect masterpiece.",
70,8 June 2009,tburke85,8, Memento Much Better Than Anticipated,"Memento was a much better film than anticipated from acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like The Prestige, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008. In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch.",

One problem--he has no long-term memory and forgets things a few minutes after he hears them.  Another thing--the whole story is shown backwards so you have to pay strict attention to what's going on.  It's difficult (most movies don't want you to think) and exhausting but absolutely fascinating. The acting is simply superb, direction assured and the story full of unexpected twists and turns.  Also there were revelations at the end (or beginning) that totally caught me by surprise.  It's not a perfect film--I still can't figure out what Moss' character was doing in this--but how many films can you name that challenge you and don't treat you like an idiot.

The film's story is simple, the characters few, and there's no sex and little action or emoting going on.

Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who has no short-term memory after being attacked when trying to save his wife from a rape-murder. The rest of his life is spent in a quest for revenge - a revenge he can't remember if he's ever been able to achieve because he has no short-term memory. That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past.",

87,2 June 2018,adam-may-bower,5, Overrated,"'Memento' is simply overrated due to its overly complex plot and non-linear structure. While I certainly love films that have depth in them, with multiple possible interpretations, and unconventional structures, 'Memento' was far too excessive for its own good. While it had the potential to be a fantastic film, Christopher Nolan ultimately made this film too complicated to be enjoyed. I kept telling myself that the highly-anticipated plot twist in the end will make the rest of film make sense, and thus become a great film, but I was extremely let down by the climax, as there simply isn't one. The ""reveal"" is never really stated to be true, and it's deliberately up to the audience to decide whether there even was a plot twist which I personally think spoils the entire film. But it's really in the structure of the film that ruins it, by being non-linear to a ridiculous extent. Just when one thinks the film is going somewhere, the scene abruptly ends with another scene beginning and it becomes tiresome after the first half hour. Guy Pearce's acting was also nothing special and didn't stand out. If anything, it was Joe Pantoliano who was the acting highlight. The best aspect of this film was the score by David Julyan, which was highly emotive and rather beautiful.",

The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie. If its rating had been 7.7 or let's say 8.0, it would have been welcome. Probably it is because the script was brilliant, I agree, but as a movie, generally 8.6 is extremely over.",

Intricately unravelling, disjointed piece of pulpy neo-noir that focuses on short-term memory victim/anti-hero Leonard Shelby (Pearce in one humdinger of a role) who is avidly trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Fox in flashbacks) but trying desperately to maintain his own scattershot recollections of things past and current, particularly the latter as he finds himself holed up in a seedy hotel, befriended by possible femme fatale Moss and weasel cop Pantoliano (both excellently skewering the plot aloing nicely) and coming to terms with his own sanity. Brilliantly conceived by novice filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who adapted his brother Jonathan's short story ""Memento Mori"") weaves back and forth with storytelling devices at full throttle including flashback, piecemeal clues and red herrings abound and more tellingly the ingenuous use of editing and the adrenaline pumped consequences the film unspools with great elan and aplomb. One of the best indies in quite some time and original in its execution is only superseded by a heartfelt and justifiably innate turn by Pearce - who adds some black humor liberally when needed - whose identity is in flux from the get go. One of the year's best films, bar none. My favorite: the foot chase sequence when Pearce can't figure out if he is the pursuer or pursuee!",

It's not an easy movie to watch, you have to stay alert, to not miss anything, as the story is mysterious and certainly not obvious. Memento got nominated at the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and Best Editing. A nice and deserved nomination for Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Guy Pearce plays the main character and he did a great job, probably one of his better movies. Memento isn't a movie you watch without being extremely concetrated, it's needed to understand the plot.

She is raped and murdered in their washroom and he was knocked unconscious. The result is a short term memory where he uses photos to identify people and tattoos to identify information. He is aided by a barmaid who is involved with a drug dealer. Ending is questionable pending on one's feeling towards Pearce's condition. Director Christopher Nolan doubles back on perspective and information to deliver one of the more original films of the year. Pearce delivers a flawless performance as a scarred man thriving on a need for truth and vengeance. Joe Pantoliano plays someone who claims to be his friend although he doesn't quite trust him. Carrie-Anne Moss as the barmaid seduces Pearce with a proposition that allows her to elevate deception. Stephen Tobolowsky has a cameo as a short term memory patient who is used as an opportunity for viewers to get a glimpse of this condition. While the conclusion is unsettling, it will not discourage viewers from its jigsaw puzzle presentation. Harriet Sansom Harris plays Tobolowsky's diabetic wife who was unsure of his condition.

114,2 September 2020,aidanratesmovies,10, Unforgettable,"A clever and well written mystery, Memento is great due to its fantastic performance from Pearce- direction from Nolan, and the mesmerising editing of Dody Dorn. This is a film truly like no other. Not only is it unique, twist-filled, and timeless- but it is also a story told in a way that has never been told before. It's a truly brilliant filmmaking achievement, with Nolan's screenplay and direction truly transcending the medium to become a true work of art. The film can be rather complex, and in result, a bit tough to follow, especially in the first viewing- but given time and focus throughout- Memento is incredibly worth your time and an experience you will never forget. It's greatest flaws are its dullest moments, as its pacing can drag a bit from time to time. However, it makes up for this in the way it tells its tale, as well as the fabulous performances throughout. I love Guy Pearce in this role, and I honestly believe it is the best I have ever seen from him. His performance does not only go unrecognized, but also that of Joe Pantoliano who always shines, and actress Carrie-Anne Moss who is also quite underrated in this film. In the end, Memento shines in a way I never expected it to. It's an original take on a classic mystery tale, and a viewing experience that will not only gain your attention but will make you awe as it begins to unfold.

First; Chris Nolan likes to give audience a challenge. I think he toppled it with Tenet, which just ent all out confusing. Memento on the other hand, is a different animal than anything he has done. Based on bro Jonathans script Momento Mori, we are told the story about Leonard who can remember the past, but can't remember what happened 1 minute ago, due to an injury. He is hunting the guy who raped and killed his wife. What's so special is that we are just as confused as Leonhard, because everything is played in reverse. But like a jigsaw, the pieces comes slowly together. This is pure mastery in film noir, and a big wink to Hitchcock. It demands the viewer to never, ever lose focus. And the payoff is awesome. This is one of the greatest endings I've seen, both tragic and you feel for just mutter:, ""Oh no, Leonard. Why? "".

The thing about the film is that when you finish it, you will want to watch it again to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but once you do that is pretty much it. A second viewing of the film does not enrich the experience, the characters don't get better like in better Nolan films like The Dark Knight and really all you do is understand the plot better.

From the moment this film starts, the attention of the viewer will be grabbed through the imaginative storytelling of the director. Having the film take place backward is a brilliant technique that allows the viewer to become engaged in the mental illness of the main character. Predictability is constantly being subverted making each moment of the film feel surprising for each turn that is introduced to the plot. The main character is portrayed brilliantly by Guy Pearce who adds an emotional weight to the role, through the ever-present confusion his character goes through. It makes his journey invoke feelings of sympathy that make the audience desperately want his story to have a happy ending. In the average film, exposition may be used in an eye-rolling and unnecessary way. However, this film's use of exposition is completely justifiable to further illustrate the short-term memory of the protagonist. One aspect of the film that proved to be a minor negative was the lack of Nolan's visual stylized storytelling. It makes the film overall feel bland through its use of colors. Despite this though, this film is a brilliant thrill ride of a character study that, through its imaginative storytelling, attachable characters, and its originality, will have any viewer on the edge of their seat throughout.",

But he received a nomination for his writing here as he also came up with the script together with his brother Jonathan. Nolan was only around the age of 30, maybe even under when he made this movie and it also has as many plot twists and moments that f*ck with your brain as many of his later works. So his style is easily identifiable in here. The one lead actor here is Guy Pearce and it is probably still the most known work of his career, even if he has appeared in several Best Picture winners.

180,25 November 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,10, This is how you direct a psychological film,"Memento stars Guy Pearce and Carrie Ann Moss and is directed by Christopher Nolan. Guy Pearce plays Leonard a man who suffers from short-term memory loss who is looking for the killer who murdered his wife. If I could summarize this in two words it would be mind blowing. This is one of the smartest intelligent psychological thrillers of all time that doesn't go for the usual twist ending. I'm not saying that all psychological thrillers do that; I'm simply stating that no psychological thriller will ever come close to as Memento, except the Sixth Sense. I was impressed how Christopher Nolan decided to make his own psychological thriller so he can mess with the viewer's minds.
This is one of those movies where every detail of the movie counts that you can't cook or do chores, because then you would be lost and confused. We don't know much about this person, but we do get a little brief background information about him. But from the evidence that I gathered throughout I sympathize with his character because he's looking for his wife while at the same time suffering from short-term memory loss. And because of his condition I feel pity for him as the people he interacts with treat him differently. But at the same time his past life he's a jerk if you think about it and so it brings me the question of should I feel his pain or not? I'm going to end my review here because it's really hard not to give anything away with people who haven't seen this movie and I want people to experience this masterpiece without spoilers. And trust me as soon as the movie is over you will be thinking about this again and again trying to piece the puzzles together. And for the people, who have seen the movie, don't spoil it for the people who haven't. It's not cool.",
181,9 October 2015,Maladjusted_1,8, The remarkable narrative of 'Memento' is unfortunately framed around unremarkable characters.,"I've always had a problem with Christopher Nolan's films: I struggle to appreciate his characters. The incredible experiences in which Matthew McConaughey's Cooper ('Interstellar'), Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb ('Inception') and Guy Pearce's Leonard ('Memento') find themselves often accentuate their inability to appear convincing, real, and therefore human. I understand that when a protagonist is designed with no short-term memory (as 'Memento''s is), painting a vivid narrative portrait of him is no easy task; knowing this didn't improve my experience of the film, though. Although I didn't relate to or care for Leonard or indeed any of the other characters of 'Memento', I still gave it a favourable rating, and this is why: The narrative style employed by Nolan in this film truly is something to behold, and it is imposed in a manner which prevents it from being arbitrary or superficial. I'll say no more, as interpreting and coming to terms with the storytelling of 'Memento' was quite rewarding, and I implore you not to check any synopses prior to viewing the film. Whilst the technical aspects of the title are great (I'm chiefly thinking of the editing), I repeat my point about not really being able to invest in the content of Nolan's world. Perhaps I'm a philistine for preferring other ""lost identity"" titles such as Denis Villeneuve's 'Enemy' and Brad Anderson's 'The Machinist', but Nolan certainly makes 'Memento' a unique experience.",

185,2 June 2001,Bob-45,6, Pretty Good STUDENT Film,"I can't believe the number of people that have been taken in by ""Memento"". Sure, it's a clever idea to start a murder mystery at the end and work back to the beginning.  However, it's just as well that ""Memento"" did it that way, because the story does NOT stand up to even average scrutiny.  Worse, it is played out in a sluggish manner, the conclusion of which would be obvious about 15 minutes before the denoument, had the film makers not resorted to cheating (Something a genuinely great film such as ""The Sixth Sense"" never did.",
186,9 April 2001,jon.h.ochiai,10, Inspired film making,"""Memento"" is fabulous film-making. Writer-Director, Christopher Nolan, creates a world for the audience where we experience the life of his ""hero"", Leonard (Guy Pearce), with more insight than the character himself. Nolan telling the story in a reverse time line (i.e. present to past), his attention to detail, and speculation of the nature of memory make the movie powerful. The movie is truly an amazing viewing experience. Guy Pearce gives a stunning performance as Leonard-- a man who has no short term memory since the murder of his wife, and is seeking vengeance on his wife's murderer. Pearce lends a sense of humanity and sadness to Leonard's quest that is touching. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie is perfect as the mystery woman who is definitely not what she seems to be-- the classic femme fa tale. Carrie-Anne is a versatile and talented actress. Joe Pantoliano is so effective as ""Teddy"", whom according to Leonard, can not be trusted. Nolan just gives us so much to look at in terms of our own lives... the memories we have and the stories we create for ourselves.",
187,14 October 2001,shea-8,1, Mass hysteria?,"Memento is far from an original concept and the plot closely resembles Swiss-cheese. It quite simply does not warrant the praise given it, which I suspect is heavily weighted by the 15-21 male demographic (see Bottle Rocket).

Then I wondered where it was heading but I spent so much time admiring the structure , story telling technique and sheer audacious skill  of Christopher Nolan`s super smart script I forgot to look for all the clues that explain the story . That`s the problem with this film : There`s clever , then there`s too clever by half , and then there`s Christopher Nolan`s script",
194,20 January 2006,jonathantstorm,1, The whole film is based on a gimmick and is overrated,"Although people may view this as a stupid comment.The entire film is based on a gimmick,yes,there i said it people i mean its basically a simple story done countless times before.A guy is exacting revenge on his enemies for murdering his wife so obviously in the filmmakers mind they had to come up with a cheap gimmick to throw off the viewer and they use this backwards gimmick nonsense that really makes no sense when you look at it by making the main protagonist in the film,a man with short term memory loss who writes on himself,oh how weird is that.The film has average acting,mediocre cinematography but nothing else going for it except a simple story wrapped in a convoluted wannabe virtuoso type film-making.I mean Christopher Nolan is a great director but this is not an outstanding debut like M Night SHyamalan's The Sixth Sense which had a great story,a superb twist and larger than life characters,a scary movie with doses of romance and the physchological horror.Nolan basically rips off Tarantino here with the chronology type film-making.I'm sure some other filmmaker one day will film a similar story like this sideways or some nonsense and it becomes a sensation like the overrated Memento.Besides IMDb rating sucks anyway.This movie would be forgotten eventually",

What you're left with is yet another thriller with a lame resolution (if you can even call it a resolution - as it resolves nothing!). Come on folks, ask yourself - if it was edited into a regular timeline, would it still be interesting. Probably not, which says a lot about the story. If the story only works with radical cutting styles, then it's not much of a story, is it?

Usual Suspects had good acting compared to this pile of junk. I wouldn't line the bottom of a bird cage with the paper this script was written on. This movie only works BECAUSE of it's backward regression story telling technique, and not in SPITE of that.  If you watched it from start to finish in chronological order (instead of the reverse order...as presented in the movie) it WOULD MAKE NO SENSE, UTTERLY! Granted, the writing is weak, so I guess there was no choice, but to show it that way. **spoiler** coming up:  (if you can call warning you about the most obvious plot holes since spaceships hung from strings in early sci-fi movies...) If the revenge killing actually happened ""last"" in the movie, and then we relive in reverse order the memories that spawned it, what does the principal character then move on to with all his tattoos still pointing him in the direction of vengence for his murdered wife?

198,23 January 2005,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Unique, brilliant and deep","Ever since I first heard of this film, I was intrigued and wanted to find out if it was really pulled off as well as everyone said. Incredibly enough, despite how sky-high my expectations were for this film, I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were definitely exceeded. As you probably already know, this whole film runs 'backwards'... meaning that you start by seeing the end, and then go all the way back to the beginning. There's a line in the film that perfectly states the immediate thought that just about anyone has about this idea when they first hear it: ""I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next."" A reasonable assumption, but not always a true one. Especially not when it comes to this film. Because every single scene, up to (but not including) the very last one, starts with the ending of the next one, and ends with the beginning of the previous one. This makes the mystery even more elusive and adds more intensity to the thriller portions of the film. The brilliant and unique reverse time-line is perfectly explained by the main characters condition. This is the best film I've seen in quite a while, and I can't argue with its position on the top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #20). While some might think it's just a typical mystery-thriller with a non-linear time-line thrown in, but it's so much more than that. Like another reviewer points out, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Between every scene in the backwards moving time-line, there is one in black and white that follows a normal time-line. This is great as a break from the scenes moving towards something you already know, and makes the mystery even harder to figure out. The great thing about this film is, not only do we experience the same confusion that the main character does, but we also find out the truth, which he learns at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. With it comes some nice observations and truths, which I'll let you discover for yourself. I won't jot down the plot here; read a quick summary somewhere or just watch the film and find out about it. I might ruin the surprise for you, a crime greater than most. Everyone deserves to see this film and discover all of it for themselves. I will say, though, that it's brilliant. The pacing is excellent, you're never bored and you never lose interest. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. Do yourself a favor; know as little about this film as possible. Don't ask anyone about it, don't read about it. Just rent it and watch it, you won't regret it. I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate fine film-making, but I suppose fans of mysteries, thrillers and/or dramas might enjoy it more than people who aren't interested in those genres. I do suggest that everyone should at least consider this film. 10/10",

I just rented this movie and was so bored that I didn't even watch it.  I only watched the first 30 minutes.  It was that bad.  Just like one of the users said, the top 250 films list is definetly unreliable.  First they got the Godfather.  I agree with that.  But star wars?  What kind of faggots like that?  The Godfather is excellent, and people voting here, who are men, need to act like men.  The story is boring because it's told in backwards storytelling.  How dumb is that?

I was very impressed with the editing scheme and direction of this tight little noir and hoped the director would gain success. It's too bad that success had to come from ""Momento"". This too plays with the arrangement of scenes, but in so simple a fashion that getting the trick was no challenge. It isn't a bad film, really, but it's not great either. I don't recall having any complaints about the performances. But the story and the way it is presented are not all that interesting. The gimmick of seeing the scenes in reverse order and the little carry-over at the end of each one felt like a running gag that had gone sour. The film is a one trick pony that was lucky enough to snag everyone's attention. If people looked closer they'd know that the movie behind the hype is actually fairly thin and shallow. I'd really like to see Chris Nowlan have a hit with a really good picture. This one just isn't as good as ""Following"", but it is better than ""Insomnia"".",

The first hour is so slow and bewildering I found myself starting to pick holes in the plot and continuity, of which there are a great many.

He witnesses his wife's murder, however, this fact evolves throughout the film. Lenny has to continually photograph his own life with a Polaroid camera in order to elicit his own memory traces. This is due to the fact that he suffers from anterograde amnesia from the concussion he received during the trauma to his wife. The cinematography is remarkable in that it transitions repeatedly from black and white to color. Neurologically, it is an accurate portrayal of this infirmity. Artistically, it is absorbing to the point that it deserves great praise. The director shows intense insight. The actors all give a convincing performance, and I can highly recommend this movie which is now out on DVD. One should not go into this drama with a preconceived notion of reality, for each moment is a shocking surprise time after time. It is a great movie. Don't miss it.",

229,17 December 2022,collt091,10, One of the most thought provoking movies of all time,"I came into this movie, expecting a pretty normal thriller, I had heard the premise, I knew that he tattooed words on his body to remember things about his wife's murder. And that idea alone is fascinating, but I could never have imagined how deep is the movie goes into the psychosis of the main character and the surrounding world, from the first couple minutes of the movie, we are presented a main suspect, in our mind. It can't be anyone else, but him, and within the first couple minutes of the movie he is killed by the main character. This threw me off big time when I first started watching the movie, I thought it was weird. They would kill off the most integral character to the plot in the beginning of the movie. That being said this movie slowly unravels itself, and scene after scene goes further back in time, and slowly opens up many more suspects, maybe even the main character himself killed his wife, the layers of this movie blow my mind. So much deception, false promises, lying, ulterior motives, people pretending to be people they aren't.and this movie, and it's confusing antics never stop at any point in this movie, for some, it is overwhelming, and frankly it is, but another thing about this movie is it reward you for paying attention, if you pay attention there will be hundreds of references to earlier sequences in the movie, personally I could go on forever about the theories of this movie, because this movie ends with no definitive answer or conclusion. Personally, my interpretation of the ending is that he was a crazy person who drove his wife away and because of this he formed this story in his mind that someone killed his wife, and he dedicated his entire life to solving this mystery that he put in his head, I could go on forever by this movie, because simply thinking about this movie after seeing it is tripping me out, there are well over 30 theories that I have about the ending of this movie and ultimately the vagueness and mystery makes this movie what it is......",

233,8 December 2020,ericjcant-1,10, Powerfully dark and beautiful film. Looks into the void of a life only half lived.,"Memento is a spectral masterpiece of relentless and poignant visual story telling. It unwinds a fascinating story, walking a fine line between crime-noir and psychological drama, yet with a self-awareness that somewhat reminds me of Bergman's sincerity. That might sound a bit gratuitous to some, but making a film like this, where the script is so strong, requires a solid director who not only facilitates the story correctly, but preserves the presence of the mood and not sanitizing it. Guy Pearce's delivery of the first person narrative is spot-on in tone and with a strangely fascinating pragmatic determinism as we start to understand Leonard's strange existence. I think this story is told perfectly through Nolan's lens, and with a premise that is compelling from its first dark note. I have to give Nolan credit for not making this film something that wraps up a comfortably resolved climax with a bow on top. There are questions that cannot and should not be answered, and this is partially why it leaves the viewer with such a strong and eerie impact. There are only portions of the mystery that can be resolved due to Leonard's condition. Leonard is a character the viewer feels compelled to immediately sympathize with, and integrity that is unquestionable. You cannot help but to empathize with the excellent narrative and put yourself in Leonard's shoes. But the card that Leonard has been dealt is such a dark echo of functional existence. No matter how bad you want clean cut answers, the bigger picture has too many holes, and the extent of the criminal deeds of every character in this film is suspect. We cannot help but to empathize with Leonard because we know just by his running narrative as we hear his thoughts that his sincerity and resoluteness is unshakeable, but it is never quite clear how far he has been willing to go see justice incurred. Memento doesn't leave us hanging, but the unanswered questions make for a beautifully dark movie that it pulls you into a sea of uncertain reality. It's not that often that you come across movies with a grip that is as alluring as it is spooky.
I have to mention that it is perfectly acted by Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss. And Joe Pantoliano could not have been a better choice.
This is a movie that actually better on a second or third watch, because once you have drawn your conclusions, there are plenty of questions to play with, and the mood is so thick you can cut it with a knife!",
234,10 February 2020,gbill-74877,7, Creative story-telling,"Creative story-telling, interesting mystery, and I liked the payoff at the end. I thought it took a little too long to get there and was repetitive in its overlapping bits, so I got a little less caught up in the cleverness of it all than others. Part of me felt it was too contrived, and part of me wondered why the main character didn't just take copious notes rather than scrawl single lines on photos and tattoo himself, or better yet, shoot videos of himself. How could he be functional on his own, driving, etc in this state? How does he even remember that he has a memory problem? The reverse story-telling is intricate, maybe too much so, or maybe some of it was just lost on me. I just felt it was a decent film, with an average plot, performances, and cinematography, but told in a creative way.",
235,7 November 2013,StevePulaski,9," She deserves vengeance, regardless if he knows or not","Before Christopher Nolan began mixing the spectacle and the narrative device, along with the real show of characters and eccentric personalities. With the recent Batman franchise, Nolan became more about the darkness aspect of the story and noticeably amplified the action spectacle, but with his directorial debut Memento, he was all about the mystery. Memento is a great film mainly because of its element of surprise, mystery, and its narrative device. Nolan conducts the story atypically from the end of the story all the way to the beginning, focusing on an array of characters that may or may not have anything to do with the outcome of the story. But is the outcome the first scene (the story's conclusion) or the final scene (the story's beginning)? That is one of the many questions you'll ask yourself when watching Memento for the first time. Seeing it for the first time, I wasn't prepared for the constant mind-race I'd be experiencing. The plot should not be spoiled, so I'll give basic the story's basic framework. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from a memory disorder after a man apparently attacked and murdered his wife before knocking him unconscious. Now, Leonard wants to avenge his wife's death, but his memory loss makes it more of a challenge than it already is. Leonard can't hold onto newer memories but has all the ones prior to the incident. To keep with the information about his attacker, Leonard tattoos himself with crucial information in his search for the murderer and takes many Polaroids of the people he meets along the way.",
236,12 September 2005,jboothmillard,9, Memento,"Written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception), I had seen this film a couple of times before, but apart from the obvious bits and pieces of it I could not remember everything that happens, so I watched again to be sure of my opinion. Basically the film starts with the reverse of Leonard ""Lenny"" Shelby (Guy Pearce) shooting dead John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell (Joe Pantoliano), which would be the end of the film, this is followed by scenes in black and white and in colour, the black and white sequences take place chronologically. Leonard is in a motel room talking to an unnamed and unseen telephone caller, Leonard has anterograde amnesia and cannot form new memories, the result of an attack following the rape and murder of his wife (Jorja Fox), his last permanent memory, besides who he is. He recalls from that night that there were two men, Leonard believes the second attacker's name is John (or possibly James), with a last name starting with G, Leonard conducts his own investigation to find this man, using a system of notes, Polaroid photos and tattoos. As an insurance investigator, Leonard recalls one Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), also diagnosed with the same form of amnesia, Sammy's diabetic wife (Harriet Sansom Harris) was not sure if his condition was genuine, repeating acts to see if he would realise, he did not and as a result of his repeated requests for insulin injections she fell into a coma and died. The colour sequences are shown in reverse chronological order, picking up from a particular recognisable moment, Leonard gets tattoos detailing the licence of John G, using his notes he meets bartender Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), she resents him as he wears and drives the car of her boyfriend Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden). She does use his condition to her advantage in moments, but understanding his situation she gets Leonard to drive a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie) out of town, and in doing so she agrees to run the licence plate to help his investigation. Leonard meanwhile meets contact Teddy, he helps him with Dodd, Teddy warns him about Natalie, but Leonard left himself a note not to believe Teddy's lies, Natalie provides Leonard the driver's licence of a John Edward Gammell, Teddy's full name, he believes he has found ""John G"", and he lures Teddy to an abandoned building to kill him, as seen at the beginning. But the final black and white scene reveals that the unseen caller was in fact Teddy, he is an undercover officer and has found ""John G"", Natalie's boyfriend, Jimmy Grantz, at the same abandoned building Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him and takes a photo of his body, as it develops the black and white transitions to colour, thus beginning the colour sequences and meeting in the middle of the story. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, who before dying whispers the name ""Sammy"", he has only told those he has met about Sammy, he doubts Jimmy is the attacker, but Teddy tells him that he in fact killed the man who killed his wife a year ago, he helped Leonard find him, Teddy tells him ""John G"" is a common name, he will end up going in circles with his amnesia, he remarks he is a ""John G"" himself. In the end, after hearing Teddy explain everything, Leonard makes the drastic decision to burn the photographs of Jimmy, and writes down the licence plate of Teddy's car to be tattooed on himself as a ""fact"", he will then assume that Teddy is the second attacker he is looking for, this leads to all the events concluding with Teddy's death. Also starring Mark Boone Junior as Burt and Russ Fega as Waiter. The performances of Pearce, Pantoliano and Moss are all good, you could argue that the story is nothing spectacular, but it is made that way because of the really clever editing, going backwards and forwards, this also emphasises the serious amnesia of the leading character, it is a film you really have to focus on while watching, and it may be a little complicated as you gather the facts, but it really tests your sense of reality, a most worthwhile thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing (losing to Black Hawk Down) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay.

The whole story revolves around a man who has suffered a brain injury that makes impossible for him to keep long-term memory from that moment on. He is, however, committed to discovering and punishing a murderer, resorting to post-it notes, tattoos and Polaroid photographs, where he notes what he has discovered. Its an interesting concept, later revisited in ""Before I go to Sleep"", film that approaches a similar story. The way the narrative is constructed, with multiple linearity twists, helps to thicken the mystery and hold our attention but it can have the opposite effect on people who don't understand the film right from the start. And this happens because, from the middle, the movie loses rhythm and interest. The ending works well but it can really disappoint, just as it disappointed me. I did not want the ending to be the way it was.

He employs some blunt methods for retaining important information - hand-written notes and Polaroids for loose facts, tattoos for solid truths - but when you're operating on such a short timer (the dreaded memory wipe seems to occur every ten minutes), I suppose you've got to take what you can get, even if it makes you a target for manipulation.",

That's where the movie's originality stops. The plot itself is filled with huge holes. While the premise is interesting, it is hardly plausible that someone with no short-term memory would not be 'assisted' by society in any way, nor that he could not have a notebook handcuffed to him or something rather than all the tattoos.

Memento throws you in straight away, giving you little information that you gradually get spoon fed through the 'hairpin structure' of the film (how Christopher Nolan describes the structure of this film). This approach just forces you to pay absolute attention which you aren't regressive about because there's nothing you want more than to just know.
This film is definitely more than a well executed high concept piece, its genuinely a brilliant mystery thriller riddled with suspense, that sends you down a path that you just can't turn back from.

264,22 October 2020,gautammayya,8, Nolan at his best!! It's like solving a puzzle along with the main character,"Nolan's second movie about a man seeking revenge for the murder of his wife, truly put the director on the map as an exciting prospect for the future and he has lived up to it. Obviously, the biggest selling point of the movie was the unique storytelling in the sense that the story revealed itself backward. This allowed us to truly be in the mind of Lenard (Guy Pearce) who is an amnesiac who can't form new memories apparently since the death of his wife. We are along with him in the search of what happened in the past. In the process we see all the people taking advantage of him in his pursuit.
There are a lot of things I liked in the movie. Guy Pearce is excellent embodying an amnesiac man who has absolutely no idea what is going on. The rest of the cast doesn't have a lot to do but are serviceable enough. The best thing was the editing. Even though there are two narratives, one told forward and one in reverse, you understand it clearly. Although at the start you feel confused about what's going on, you will get used to it. The flashbacks establish what happened without being distracting. The greatest strength of the movie is the ability in keeping you intrigued and interested. Due to the premise, it feels more of a puzzle that we are solving along with the main character.
Even then, there are stuff which I didn't like. I think the story doesn't allow the main character to be something more than just a tool to move it forward. Nolan and Guy Pearce don't add anything to make the lead more interesting for us to care about. The side characters are forgettable as well. They don't have definitive traits to make them full rounded characters.
Still, I do think it is a wonderful movie which is entertaining and tells us about revenge and violence and how it blinds people to the mistakes they are making. We distort our memory to suit us coming on the right side of things. We try to twist a fact in our favor so that we can do certain things that we want to do.
Watching Nolan's older movies (i.e pre The Dark Knight/Inception) really makes me wish he does those more regularly. Following the success of The Dark Knight and Inception he has chosen to do more of his big Blockbusters with more spectacle and complex plots but falling short on character and humanistic themes. Memento is a true reminder that Nolan isn't someone who can't make good movies about humanistic themes. It is actually his funniest movie (TDK is darkly funny) and has complex relationships between characters.
Highly recommend even for someone who isn't a Nolan fan. A true masterpiece and Nolan's second best film (after TDK). A 9/10",

The movie is effective simply because the audience is trying to figure out exactly what is going on in a moment of boredom -like trying to solve a crossword puzzle being worked out by the passenger in the next seat when you look over their shoulder. You watch it because it is there and you might as well be somewhat amused while continuing to be bored.,

But the structure allows the viewer to imagine what it would be like to be him, dealing with a totally fragmented experience caused by brain damage.

Boring scenes are repeated ad infinitum as the film constantly goes back, then forward to scenes we've seen already, and then go further back only to then run forward into those same scenes again. This is not clever, it may be different, but it's also stupid. Now, all this might even be bearable if you feel any empathy or sympathy with the main character, or anybody, or anything in this. No such luck with 'Memento'. The only positive emotion I felt in the whole thing was when the main character was running down the street and couldn't remember why. At least that was funny.

Really, after I managed to recompose the story from its fragments, all I had was an incredibly thin story. With entirely one- dimensional characters, all equally unlikeable. This one I can spoil in a single line. Guy suffers from memory loss from a head injury, and tries to get revenge, but is used time after time because of his memory loss.

So a guy who has short-time memory loss accidentally kills his wife, doesn't remember it, gets screwed over by a bartender, a motel owner and a cop. Then the protagonist kills two more people and cannot admit to himself that his quest for vengeance doesn't lead anywhere. I suppose I can see what the purpose of the movie is supposed to be, but it's neither particularly deep, nor has a positive message. It just tells you that people will screw you over if you are mentally challenged and that people lie to themselves. That movie is the definition of ""overhyped"" and is not worth more than 4 stars.",

Ok if he did have this condition to where he can only remember 5 or 10 mins at a time since his attack, HOW DOES HE KNOW TO WRITE STUFF DOWN!!!??? Makes zero sense! And the whole tattooing stuff on his body is beyond anything I've ever seen in science fiction. It's a shock or ""cool"" factor, that he tattoos this stuff on his body, so it will give the writers a few mins of dialog in the movie, showing it done and talking about it. And the whole backward thing..... Doing days backwards in time.... No, dumb, idiotic and really adds very little. Yes I understood the movie, the thing I don't understand is how people constantly rate this a 10???? Plus if the guy was really a cop, even a dirty one, would he continue to let this maniac kill people over and over and over? If he did kill all these people wouldn't SOMEONE have turned him in????
Why doesn't he have a tape recorder?????? Maybe I missed it but the first tattoo I'd get is... YOU CAN'T RMEEMBER ANYTHING, PRESS PLAY ON RECORDER! but even then it doesn't make sense because he only remembers 5 or 10 mins at a time.

I believe that the intention of this film is just to mess with your mind, and that was not the sort entertainment that I was looking for when I watched it. Perhaps, at the end of the movie, they hoped I could have empathy with what it must be like to suffer from the memory condition that this guy has, so they tried to create an environment where my brain is turning itself inside out while trying to understand what's going on.

The premise--that this guy has lost all short-term memory and thus every hour is a fresh start--nicely fits the backwards nature of the storytelling.  We see the end and work back to the beginning, and along the way all of our landmarks are turned upside down. Just when you start to think you have a handle on a character, you see what that person did previously and it distorts your thinking.  We know immediately that Leonard, played by Guy Pearce with his usual flawless American accent, is trying to track down his wife's killer.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say that by the end of the movie, you leave the theater wondering if you really know whodunit.

308,6 April 2002,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Memento is the most creatively made and brilliantly engaging film of at least the last decade.,"SPOILER ALERT First of all, I would like to point out that I am a huge fan of Roger Ebert. His reviews are well written and enlightening about the movies that they focus on and often a lot of obscure movies that are related to the one in question, but his review of Memento is one of the most ignorant and just flat-out incorrect pieces of film criticism that I have ever read. Sure, there's a hole in the plot. If the last thing that Leonard remembers is his wife dying, then he should not technically remember that he can't form short term memories. Plot hole, yes. But who cares?! Anyone? Anyone? Me neither. Plot holes plague the Back to the Future series, one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made, left and right. In Part II, Marty McFly leaves 1985 to travel to the year 2015 to prevent his teenage son from robbing a bank and getting thrown in jail and starting that horrible chain reaction that destroys his entire family. In his review of that film, Ebert seems to have overlooked the MASSIVE plot hole that far overshadows the one that he points out in Memento  if Marty leaves 1985 and travels to 2015, there is no longer any Marty left in 1985 to grow into the 47-year-old Marty that he finds in 2015. This little revelation suggests that Ebert is either judging films on varying and unstable criteria, or he has something against someone involved in the making of Memento.",

320,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,9," ""Now... where was I?""","Christopher Nolan gives us two things to think about with Memento. One is what would it be like if you couldn't remember what you did 5 minutes ago. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby who lost his ability to hold on to short term memory after an altercation in his home, where his wife was murdered. Ever since then, Shelby has been trying to track down the murder of his wife, armed with a Poleroid Camera and a pen to tattoo his body with important notes, jotting down notes before he forgets what to write down. Nolan also complicates matters (or challenges the audience) by telling the story backwards, we see the last scene first, and the first scene of the movie, if told linearly, last. This adds mystery to an intriguing story, as we find out things about the characters after we see how they react. Between the scenes, we watch Shelby talk on the phone, to who we don't know, but it fill us in on his disorder and how much he remembers before his accident. Leonard Shelby lives like he died one day, and he sleeps walk through the rest of his life. Joe Pantoliano plays an auto mechanic who may or may not be helping Shelby through his ordeals, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a woman who may or may not be helping Shelby as well. Much like a Tarantino film, the time warping used by Memento is a gimmick that actually enhances the story. While we see what happened last first, the story, what we are shown, works linearly, the climax of the story would be the first scene in the movie, but here, it's last and fits in much better. The filler material that we see between action sequences adds depth to the emotional torture Shelby goes through. Pearce plays Shelby very well, acting confused when he should be confused, the film never takes shortcuts. For once, the audience knows just as much about everything as the main character does, putting the audience on an even level as the character, we're not going to hear him say something just out of the blue. We all try to put the pieces together, and that puts us in the movie. Just like the Seinfeld episode that was backwards, you have to pay attention, we know where we are going, now, where were we?",

Nothing worthwile is revealed after the first half, actually, the thing is pretty much clear after the first scene - never mind the sordid detail revealed later, doen't add anything for me. An uninteresting, unbelievable, unappealing story acted out by characters one cannot get oneself to care for. So it's told backwards, big deal. I've seen similar things before, done much better. No short term memory? Try ""Winter Sleepers"", that idea is used there much better. Acting? The characters had to look bewildered and smarmy, in turns. Not a great range, in my opinion.

335,30 July 2015,sharky_55,9, Now..where was I?,"Many critics have expressed the view that the backwards chronological order of the colour sequences of Memento is nothing more than a gimmick, a story-telling device that doesn't align with Leonard's point of view. After all, he certainly doesn't experience events in backwards order, does he? However, this structure is crucial in many ways in Memento presenting its story. The narrative is fundamentally about self deception and betrayal; Leonard sees it from everyone he knows, right down to the inn manager who tries to rent him two rooms and freely admits to it, knowing Leonard won't remember. The structure deliberately denies the audience the same information that Leonard is denied as a result of his condition, and slowly subverts initial expectations and reveals facts as lies, as the motif of memory is constantly discussed. Leonard doesn't trust himself or his memory - he works on instincts and conditioning, and most of all, the little notes and tattoos he carries. The audience, much like Leonard, willfully submits to their truth. Playing Memento chronologically would remove this set-up and all the confusion and suspense that he rightly feels. Tt would remove the emotional payoff and complexity in the scene which foreshadows his darker motivations, where he hires a hooker to arrange a room and wake him up, yearning for one small moment where his wife still might be alive.

The story immediately revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) who is a victim of a type of brain damage called short term memory or ""he cannot make new memories"". His last memory is that of his wife being raped and killed, and he has devoted his life to finding this killer through clues he leaves himself before he forgets.

346,4 March 2003,WriterDave,10, A Perfect Movie to Usher in the New Millennium,"""Memento"" is one of those rare gimmick movies (it's shown backwards, folks!) where the gimmick actually pays off.  Highly astute director Christopher Nolan simultaneously deconstructs the film noir genre while at the same time gives the audience the feeling that they are suffering from the same malady as the protagonist searching for his wife's killer.  The brilliant structure actually gave me short-term memory loss when I first watched it.  When was the last time a movie actually made you feel what it was portraying so acutely?  Guy Pierce, Carrie Anne Moss, and good ole' Joey Pants give electrifying performances as we the audience slowly learn that no one has a clear motive and you can't even trust your own memory.

So I finally got to see the movie last night. This 113 min long film was worth watching. The backtracking motion of Leonard's days trying to avenge his wife's death was extremely original. Christopher Nolan used excellent directing and the script writer was brilliant. Guy Pearce, I thought played a great performance as Leonard who has short term memory loss and has to use notes everyday on camera photos to get back what he's looking for. I thought it was a very surprising role for Guy Pearce. The movie does get confusing, a bit.

Nolan manages to make this ride incredibly special by using a very interesting and effective method, which was to tweak the screenplay in a way which will ensure that the viewer is allowed as much exposition as the protagonist himself.

358,28 April 2013,BooChanan,10, Not very fulfilling,"Memento was the film that really got Christopher Nolan noticed and it is my personal favorite of his films, just because it is so unique. It uses a non-linear structure that Nolan has used in a lot of his films and gives it a very dark, tense theme. The structure is reverse-chronological and, therefore, means that the film starts at the end of the story and end at the beginning. But what makes this particular use of it so spectacular is that, for the whole film, you know that the film is going to end with the beginning but, as you reach it, Nolan pulls all certainty away from you; leaving you craving for more. This film is not very fulfilling due to the structure - the viewer still wants to see more - and that's what makes it such a memorable film. Nolan's directing skills aren't the only great feature of this film. His script is also stunning. It involves the main character, Guy Pearse, talking to himself but, almost, addressing us; allowing us into his head. Guy Pearse's acting is superb, portraying all the emotions that his character would have. The rest of the (rather small) cast are also great and help to give the viewer the uncertainty that makes this film so great.",

Yes I'm aware of all of that, and based upon all of those things ""Memento"" was brilliant. That being said, I didn't enjoy watching this movie. After being interested for about the first 5 minutes, I lapsed into waiting for the story to progress. It never did. I don't see how anyone could pull off this type of ""pacing"" any better than Momento, the problem is I don't see how the pacing of this story can be good either. It's not the fault of anyone involved, I just couldn't stand constantly receiving the same information over and over. I already know this, I don't care that the main character does not. It could not have been put together any better than it was, but it just kept frustrating me over and over. Every single second of the movie is spent re-hashing information about the movie that the movie has already established. And I don't think that's even possible.

365,24 March 2019,W011y4m5,5, Cold & mechanical.,"I regrettably have to admit ""Memento"" is easily & without doubt Christopher Nolan's worst film; led by a fascinating concept which is explored masterfully; moulding a story from it which is expertly shot & crafted & the narrative is as clever as you'd expect from this particular filmmaker... BUT it suffers from one MAJOR problem; a total & utter lack of any emotional investment.
Let me explain: typically, audiences follow character's stories as they watch & invest themselves in them as they progress from the beginning to the end; here's the immediate dilemma with ""Memento"" - how on Earth am I meant to care about a character who is literally incapable of progressing in any way?
Our lead is a man who suffers from an inability to create lasting memories & that idea is an undeniably intellectual concept to wrap your head around - not hard to see why it was so appealing to delve into as a writer - but when the character is repeatedly discovering himself & his whereabouts in every consecutive sequence, the 2 hour movie rapidly becomes repetitive & fails to go anywhere remotely interesting...
Every new progression of the plot is predictably led by the regression & reversion of the character to the point where he's back to exactly the same person he was before from the beginning, so there's ultimately no emotional anchor to provide the film with any weight. Hence, the feature starts to feel mechanical & cold, taking one clever step forward & two emotional steps in the opposite direction. By the time the credits roll, you're in no doubt about the inventiveness of those behind it, but it's completely devoid of any aspect which could cause me to give a damn about what's taken place so it's monotonous & inconsequential... Completely dull & overlong.
Probably would've been better as a short film instead.",

He takes pictures, makes notes, tattoos himself to try to order his life - but ultimately he does not know what he's doing. All that drives him is the desperate desire to track down the elusive 'John G.', who raped and murdered his wife.

The first thing that will leave you completely confused for maybe the first 15 minutes is that THE SCENES ARE IN REVERSE ORDER. The movie will start at the end of the story, and it will end at the beginning. You'll probably understand this in just a few minutes, but even while knowing, your brain will not process the information and piece the puzzle together correctly. This will also challenge your memory; in normal movies, you can remember the past couple scenes well enough, but in Memento, you will remember them, but your brain just won't attach them together correctly. Whenever the movie progressed and changed scene, I had to actively try to remember what had happened right before, and how it ties into this new scene (which technically happens before the scene you just watched, not after).",

I found myself appreciating Mr. Nolan's directing more at home, and Mr. Pearce's performance stood out the second time around. What remained the same, however, was the complete lack of interest I had in the story. It seems Mr. Nolan was so pleased with the gimmick he had that there was little atttention paid to generating suspense and creating involving and/or compelling characters.

It has a common characteristic of his movies, time, and its taming. Two burglars break into the protagonist's house in order to rape and kill his wife, unaware that he is also there. Eventually he wakes up and trying to save his wife receives a severe hit to the head. This hit leaves permanent damage to a part of the brain so that it can not store newer memories in the long term, and can only remember current moments in the short term. However, he does his best to gather information with notes everywhere, photos, and even tattoos to investigate the crime and find the criminals. A rather simple scenario, without action or suspense, with only a few actors and seemingly low cost, but the plot was presented backwards to the people. Starting from the end of the plot until it reaches an earlier point where everything is explained, and which obviously because the protagonist does not remember, he does not know what things have happened and what he has done after the accident. All the scenes are presented in reverse order, which is unfortunately confusing and tedious for the viewers.

Now after watching this I have to ask, what kind of drugs are people on to find this borefest interesting? By the end of the movie I got no fulfillment at all, I didn't walk away with a message or even entertained whatsoever. There is just no progression in the film. You start in the beginning, in the middle of the movie you still feel like you're in the beginning, and in the last ten minutes you feel like you're going somewhere, but you literally end up in the beginning. Maybe that's what the director was going for because by the end of the movie I felt like I had the same condition as the main character, but there's something called trying to be too deep, which is what is going on here. I put so much faith in Christopher Nolan because of the Dark Knight trilogy but I don't know what he was thinking with this one.",

387,20 June 2022,Shaggers,9, Do not trust his lies,"This movie is incredible and very unique in how it's story is told; backwards. It shows something then it explains it while the things at the start start to unravel for the viewer, until finally the kicker. It's a film that needs to be payed full attention to for sure, as there's so many little details. The backwards folding mystery. And throughout it make you question the entire film. The acting is solid for most of the actors, and I feel it has no s lister syndrome and doesn't have any improper casting decisions. This kind of story telling is replicated in Nolans newer movies like interstellar and Dunkirk though it's not the exact same, and not a literal backwards story like this. The filmography in this movie works effectively, but has not much of note, the zoomed out shots for most of it and it's very few close ups shows the bigger pictures, and the whole environment, black and white scenes for the very far back ones though, which eventually collide as we roll back the tape. It definitely isn't using the highest quality camera though even for the 2000s, but this is a fairly low budget movie. The effects are done well for that as well, and the makeup. The set design is also good, with it's world of just being a mid sized city like any other. This film does the feeling of mystery to engage the viewer incredibly well. And is able to flesh out the character and his feelings while him forgetting all of them by the next day. His rapid analysis of all the areas fit his monologues and explaining of his pasts life, and there are no inconsistencies of his character. As for all the other characters which are played very well, for most the movie you know about as much as he does which I feel is intentional. Until it unfolds. The music in this movie is very efficient while being quite simple and quiet. Not the best soundtrack, or even notable, but it is done well in here. This film is hard to review without spoilers which I try not to do, but it is a must see if you like Nolan movies, or mystery movies. Or both. And over all I'd say it's a 8.8.",

389,27 July 2002,Cheetah-6,4, Clever But Tedious.,"Maybe this film is, as others have stated,  trying to give us the experience of being Leonard rather than just observing him, so we end up being just as confused and frustrated as he is, for that I can give it allot of credit, I know of no other film that attempts to give you the experience of the main character in such a literal way, but this of itself does not make a great movie. Solving an involved math equation might be a better time. There has to be some character development, these characters never become interesting and the motivation of the main character for revenge seems shallow and becomes boring quickly. Everything seems to ride on weather Teddy is telling the truth or not. This is never reveled and so everything is open to speculation. Probably one of the best films ever concocted for the purpose of  discussing endlessly afterward and for multiple viewing.  A plot that you care about would help allot here. I could appreciate the cleverness of it all if the story was more of a hook.  Leonard thinks revenge will give him peace? Even though he'll never remember it? All he remembers is his life up to ""the event"" but is able to remember he has short term memory loss? It seems this film is trying too hard to be something ""original"" and ""creative"" and comes of more like an exam puzzle and is seriously lacking a soul.",

It was a difficult concept to grasp but, as we've come to appreciate Director Christopher Nolan & writer Emma Thomas' work, we can't wait to watch again for more will be revealed. The Nolan movie experience certainly requires some atypical viewer adjustments. We are always shown what we need to know, but as with ""The Prestige"" we really don't want to see it. Their formula here combines loss of a spouse with a haunting guilt of culpability. The staggered murder investigation twists are presented through our protagonists' frustrating lack of short term memory. Memento has an artsy look yet an unmistakably gritty feel. Sequenced just as memory occurs, backwards, and broken up by black and white monologue explanation shorts, pacing is smart and the characters are not to be trusted.A film with an overlying aura of a high class guy in a low class existence",
396,15 May 2002,Aragorn22,9, One of the most original movies ever!,"For people who love to see movies with excellent scripts, psychologic effects and complicated plots, this movie is a must see one! The movie is about Lenny, who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia. This is a memory disease which enables the sufferer to make new memories. So, every day, he experience everything totally new. For example, every human being he has met after his disease onset is seen by him as a totally new person to meet. With this disease, he hunts the people who murdered his wife. The most brilliant thing about this movie is that it is played totally backwards: when the movie starts, you see the final scene. After that, the movie takes you back, scene by scene, to the beginning. In this way, the movie makes you experience it a bit like Lenny. You have to orientate everytime the movie goes one scene back, which makes this movie a bit complicated to follow. But, I can tell you, you will get rewarded with an absolute brilliant ending (or beginning!). Last but not least, Guy Pierce, who´s playing Lenny, gives away his best actors performance of his career so far. After having actors like de Niro and Pacino, we finally get a couple of new great actors in Hollywood.I would say that we have waited long for new great actors, but after Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe, we´ve got two coming men: Edward Norton and the leading man of this movie: Guy Pierce.

I didn't even care what happened before because what was happening on screen was so monumentally dull. And the tattoo element? Gimme a break man. It's where the whole thing unraveled for me. The whole premise is ridiculous, and if the premise is nonsense how can an interesting movie result? Right, it can't. It's artsy rubbish, and the conversations are absurd, annoying and completely unrealistic. It's not unique or interesting in any way. It's rather simple, actually. The back and forth of black and white and color only adds to the overall feeling of a director who really has no clear vision of where to take his film. I didn't like the constant narration either. This is a below average film, make no mistake about it. The sort of film people congradulate themselves on for figuring out at the coffee house with their ""film afficianado"" buddies. The acting was flatline and lifeless. All praise heaped on this are unwarranted. I can't see what the fuss is about. It's just a typical Hollywood piece of dirt going backwards instead of forward. Not complicated. It's got all the same elements that are dense in a movie that goes in a linear direction. Redundant. Bland. Unbelievable. It's got everything to make a movie fail.

The second: The hero's inability to create new memories, due to short term memory loss, which was used by Dana Carvey in Clean Slate. Having said that, I think, like several movies which have had a gimmick to their story or format, that Nolan took the easy way out at the end, knowing people would overlook it due to it's gimmick. Like the Goofs section pointed out, Leonard wouldn't be able to remember he had the condition of memory loss. Even in Clean Slate, the story made a point to remind the main character he had this ""condition"" every time he woke up. And that wasn't written nearly as good as this.  An obvious oversight by the writer/director. Also (I think another user comment mentioned this and I'm surprised more people haven't), Leonard has tatoos on his body BEFORE his wife dies.

It's really terrifying, even if Lenny accidentally commits a regret for life, he can only make up another story as a reason to survive. The most horrible thing is not that we will build countless lies to satisfy the truth that we believe more, but that the memories we believe are just the 'facts' that we have processed.

416,14 March 2021,judemcrobbie,10, A Piece of Art.,"The non linear structure helps us empathise with Leonard as how he doesn't remember these bits because of his lost memories, we don't know them as we work out way through the movie. It's also an incredibly intriguing narrative as it flips the classic mystery/whodunnit plot line on its head and instead of finding out who did it, we find out what they did making for a gripping and enticing watch.
How each scene sets up so brilliantly as it keeps asking new questions whilst answering the new ones.
Probably some of Nolan's best writing in any of his movies, especially considering he has some bad exposition dumps in other of his movies but in this he has it embedded seemlessly especially how characters ask questions which are for exposition but it's actual questions they'd ask about his condition and it'll make it humorous. Furthermore the humour in this movie is mostly derived from his lack of memory and his friends taking the mick.
Each scene is an almost microcosm of the movie how Leonard goes through all his usual progressions, from charming and charismatic at the start to the anger and rage at the end. Guy Pierce does this tremendously as he shows all of these and then more. Because of this Leonard is one of the most confusing protagonists, which ties into the theme of confusion through the movie.
The ending is brilliant. Just sublime. It leaves the ideas to grow on your head, as with many of Nolan's films. It's so up to your perception which completely ties in with the rest of the film.",

And about 1/3 of the way in, you start questioning why this mentally handicapped individual doesn't take better notes. Why not a journal or tape recorder, even a camcorder? He leaves himself pictures of people and things with 1 sentence notes that he sometimes describes as ""fact"" but are little more than here-say or supposition. Now this would be fine for someone who just needs to jog their memory but for someone with no short term memory at all the scenario is ludicrous. For example, instead of simply stating ""don't trust so and so"", a journal entry or tape recorded message fully stating why not to trust someone would be perfectly understandable but it isn't done. At one point, this person who is completely reliant on pens has no pen or any other writing utensil. In fact, he sees the person he is conversing with hiding all of the pens and he doesn't question that? OK, I need to suspend my disbelief. It does become apparent at the very end, that there is no ""wife killer"" and he really isn't all that innocent in his wife's current condition. He seems to dispatch anyone who confronts him with truth or reality yet he welcomes those who would use him for their own means. Killing is killing to him I guess; and reasons can be manipulated to achieve the end result as long as the end result is another death. Shoddy notes are just a means to an end. One gets the impression that he might enjoy killing, and manipulating his memory is just as good an excuse as any in his demented mind.

Eventually both dovetail together in a sequence at the end that reveals crucial details that inform the whole story. This unique structure is brilliant. It's far from a gimmick though, as it is an extremely effective way of putting the audience in the lead character Leonard's shoes. The reason for this is that he is a man with a rare short-term memory loss disease so he, like us in the audience, has no idea of what has happened just a short time before. He has to take Polaroids of important objects, write notes to himself and even apply tattoos in order to proceed through life with any purpose.

And since 2000, hardly any other movie has come close to the brilliance this movie has shown. What other movie has been played backward? 'Memento' starts off with a murder and works its way carefully and uniquely backwards through a mystery a man with no short-term memory and an audience must solve. Pearce plays the main character completely convincingly as does co-stars (and 'Matrix' co-stars) Moss and Pantoliano. A man stricken with no short-term memory after an accident must put together pieces of a puzzle after his wife gets murdered, so he can get revenge. Along the way he meets and re-meets people who might be aiding his quest, all the while we learn certain people are extremely dangerous. I can't say enough, I LOVED this movie. Everything worked for it, and finally a movie (not a dumb summer popcorn movie, sorry 'Transformers') makes me use my brain. You really have to think, take little breaks and pay attention. I admired the episode of 'Seinfeld' when they did the same thing (one of the series best episodes ever) – and that was the only other work I can think of that used this concept: telling the story backwards. Sure, you can like big-budgeted movies, but they hardly ever show the respect that director Christopher Nolan did during this feature. Ironically, Nolan also directed the big-budgeted, latest 'Batman' adventures. Guess what? They're 100x better than the previous four. This man knows what's good and how to show it. Sit back, listen to every word spoken or unspoken and enjoy one of the best mysteries, or simply, best movies ever made.",
434,27 March 2023,kaaffilm,10, Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is a Groundbreaking Thriller That Challenges the Audience's Perception of Reality,"""Memento"" is a gripping and innovative thriller that challenges the audience's perception of reality. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is a labyrinthine journey through the mind of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is trying to piece together the mystery of his wife's murder. The film is told in reverse chronological order, with each scene adding a new layer of complexity to the story. Pearce delivers a tour de force performance, conveying the frustration and desperation of a man trapped in a constantly shifting reality. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, is equally strong. Nolan's direction is confident and assured, making use of a fragmented narrative structure to create a sense of disorientation and tension. The film's themes of memory, identity, and the nature of truth are explored with intelligence and sophistication, making ""Memento"" a truly thought-provoking work of cinema.",
435,12 December 2009,disdressed12,9, a Christopher Nolan gem,"it's hard to comment on this title without giving away major plot points.basically,the gist of it is this,a man has no short term memory due to an assault during which his wife is raped and murdered.he doesn't no who did it or why,but he is driven to find out and bring the perpetrator to justice.but since he has no short term memory he has to use some clever methods just to get through the day,as he tries to piece together what happened.we see events unfold from his point of view.Guy Pierce plays the main character with Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano in strong supporting performances.the time line is a bit hard to follow so you really have to pay attention,and you may have to view the film more than once,but it's well worth it.for me,Memento is a 9/10",

448,18 March 2023,fredrikgunerius,9," A groundbreaking, timeless movie","This elegant and ingenious triumph in film form hides its classic hard-boiled crime story behind young, creative filmmaker Christopher Nolan's narrative stroke of genius. Leonard (Guy Pearce) is on a desperate quest to find his wife's rapist and murderer while dealing with a debilitating condition which makes him unable to form new memories. And to help us get into Leonard's chaotic state of mind, Nolan tells his story backwards in increments - a story filled with familiar noir elements such as motels, derelict warehouses, anonymous letters and undercover cops. Although the mystery is relatively straightforward in itself, seen through Leonard's eyes it quickly becomes a lot more convoluted. It's all thanks to Nolan's craftsmanship and remarkable command of every minute detail that he is able to weave it all together in his innovative narrative structure: A black-and-white sequence of phone calls and Leonard's voiceover is played out parallel with the backwards presentation of his perpetual detective work. The effect is mesmerizing; both intensifying the suspense of the story and adding a new vitality not only to Nolan's film but to the entire film medium. A groundbreaking, timeless movie.",

Now when I see it, I am just wondering how come that it has occupied place in top 250 IMDb rating. May be that I like movies with straight forward story that is gripping and its narration flowing smoothly. It is all as confusing and vague as the mind of the character played by Guy Pierce. It is simply hard to find what he(the lead) did first and what he did later. Whether he commits murder and drives away in car or first drives in and then murders or whether he commits the murder at all. It is taxing on the mind of the viewer to watch the narration going back and forth and it is really tough to keep track of the story line. Many of movies of this director demand certain level of IQ from the viewers to get to his style of narrative.

459,3 October 2001,dfranzen70,9, A field of forget-me-nots,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a memory problem: He cannot form new memories. He forgets things a few minutes after they've occurred. This is caused by emotional and physical trauma he suffered when he once woke up in the middle of the night and saw his wife murdered by asphyxiation. Now Leonard's determined to figure how who the killer is.   To combat his ailment, Leonard takes photos with an Instamatic camera and writes a sentence or two on the back of the picture. He snaps pictures of people whom he's not sure if he just met - and he's also never sure if they're friend or foe. Among the players are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), the latter of whom supposedly lost a loved one in a similar matter and who therefore feels a sort of kinship with the traumatized Leonard. The most fascinating aspect of this movie is that it's shot out of sequence. Because Leonard's memories are pretty much kaput (he can clearly remember everything up to the murder, but not subsequent memories), we actually get to see the same scenes a couple of times. No, it's not repetitive. Here's an example. Scene fades in, and Leonard is running through backyards, cutting, juking, zigging, and zagging. He suddenly says - for we can hear his thoughts - ""Ok, where am I? He spots another man running nearby. ""Oh,"" Leonard thinks, ""I'm chasing him,"" and he starts to move in the other man's direction. Oops - the man suddenly charges back at Leonard. ""No, wait... he's chasing me!"" Leonard thinks. And in another scene, we see the events leading up to that particular chase, as well as events after it. It's up to the viewer to place them in the right order, but seeing the scenes out of sequence, I think, is very useful here. Things are clearer when they're revisited with more information. Now, when Leonard writes on the back of the photos, what he writes is influenced greatly by whatever has happened just prior to the photograph's creation. This complicates things greatly; if he thinks someone's a nice person, he'll snap the picture and write on the back that they're a nice person. But later, he'll look at the picture - without remembering anything - and take the words at face value. If it says he liked the person, then the person's good, even though he might not have known much about that person.",

Memento is about Leonard Shelby and thats pretty much all you'll ever know for definite about it. Yes that's how confusing it is until the very last, dying moments of the film. The script is great ( again the genius of Christopher and Jonathan Nolan ), the cast delivers on every aspect , Guy Pearce was brilliant as Leonard , Carrie Ann Moss also was very good as Trinity but the best performance of the film and one of the greatest performances in film history, Joe Pantoliano as Teddy Gammell. I was surprised that Memento was only nominated for two academy awards because I can tell you it was worth more. Overall, Memento is like a complex jigsaw puzzle that you can try to solve but just can't and it just leads up to an incredible twist ending that no one ( not even me ) could figure out .

464,16 April 2001,meeza,10, Mementous Film!,"The memento has come for me to tell you that you will not see a more original film this year than  `Memento.' The film is about an insurance agent who is on a vengeance mission to find out who raped and killed his wife. However, this is definitely a challenge for him because he has short term memory loss from the time that his wife was murdered. This means he only remembers real life experiences right after they happen for only about 5 minutes (which is very similar to my situation when I go out drinking). He experienced this trauma because of a head injury he suffered when he was trying to save his wife from the killer. Star Guy Pearce delivers an unforgettable performance that academy award voters should not forget during oscar time. The remarkable thing about this film is that is presented backwards. We see the action-packed conclusion at the beginning of the film, and the beginning of the story at the end (which is very similar to how I always hope my dating nights would turn out to be like). Anyway, this makes us be in the same predicament as the main character because of his condition. Whatever you do, don't forget to see `Memento.' ***** Excellent",

Its not a great,classic or a masterpiece!
It is however,a BEGINNING!
A beginning of experience,knowledge,creativity,flair and many more great and wonderful abilities/traits of the work,DIRECTING...Following this,Nolan honed his craft even bigger and wider,and created GENUINE CLASSICS.

481,18 February 2008,Jonny_Numb,7, An Engrossing Puzzler,"A lot of filmmakers have gotten their big breaks on the foundation of films that are, upon closer inspection, more stylistic than substantive...and while there's nothing wrong with an overly stylistic film, its accolades can erode with the passage of time, especially if there isn't much under the glossy surface. What's interesting about Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is how its stylistic touches are synthesized within the narrative itself; furthermore, the backwards-flowing narrative also becomes an extension of our protagonist's robotic, detached, and ""system""-oriented way of living. Guy Pearce plays Leonard, an average man who loses his short-term memory after his wife is murdered, and embarks on a quest to catch and kill the guy who did it; he holes up in a fleabag motel, tattoos clues on his body, encounters a downtrodden bartender (Carrie-Anne Moss) and a man claiming to be a cop (Joe Pantoliano), all while flashing back to a extended phone conversation wherein he tells the tale of a man with a similar condition. As played by Pearce, Leonard is like a postmodern vision of the 1940s noir detective, a perceptive Everyman driven to find closure; his performance is properly detached, only randomly showing traces of normality, but Nolan's structure cleverly plays like a visual extension of Leonard's mental processes, putting us in the midst of his search. Moss provides solid support (and sheds her ""Matrix"" persona gracefully) as the noirsih femme fatale, and Pantoliano keeps us guessing as the mysterious ""Teddy."" While many other films have borrowed ""Memento""'s structure since, few have made it feel so justifiably vital to the credibility of the plot overall--to ""start"" at the very end of a story and move backward to the beginning is a daring move, and Nolan is confidently aware of how the preceding events truly gives the conclusion its impact.",

The narrative device is the kind of flashy gimmick writers dream about being able to use properly: the story is divided into lots and lots of very very small chapters - each chapter connecting directly to the next - and we are given these chapters backwards, last to first.  (Yes, I know it's not as classically simple as that - there's also the black-and-white footage.  But this serves the function of expository narrative; it isn't a chapter in its own right.)  It's amazing that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the umpteen transitions back in time works dramatically, and that the story makes far more sense this way, and is easier to follow, than it would told chronologically.  So perfectly cast is the narrative that it's impossible to tell which idea came first, the technical challenge of telling the story backwards, or the exceedingly clever story that justifies this conceit.",

In the end, color sequences and black and white sequences meet in the grand finale (Or should we say the ""big start""?).

527,3 February 2009,bharatmisr,10, A modern-day masterpiece...,"Distinguished director Christopher Nolan comes out with his second directorial venture 'Memento', and this one surpasses every movie of its genre. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are completely undecipherable to the viewer, as it takes time for the audience to figure out the unique style of multiple narratives and reverse story-telling used by the director. After that, though, the movie grips your senses and takes you on a suspense-filled ride, and the suspense does not end until the credits start rolling down. The climax of the movie takes you off-guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly taut storyline. Guy Pearce acts marvelously well, especially in scenes when he forgets his whereabouts and the identities of people he meets. Carrie-Anne Moss does full justice to her character, though her dialogue delivery is somewhat sloppy. Joe Pantoliano acts wonderfully, as usual. This one is my personal favorite in the genre of psychological thriller. The movie is refreshingly innovative, and I'm sure that viewers looking for an intelligent plot and a lightning-fast narrative. would revere this as the best piece of cinema of all time. The gritty direction also allows each and every character develop deeply, engrossing the viewers even more. Nolan is a master film-maker, and steers the movie through the mind of the protagonist, delivering a gripping thriller. He focuses more on the mentality of the characters, rather than the physical elements of the story. It somewhat reminds me of the short story 'The Sphinx without a Secret' by Oscar Wilde. All in all, this one is a must-watch, and your Hollywood viewing is incomplete without watching 'Memento'.",
528,20 November 2001,CharltonBoy,10," A Brilliant,unique movie.",Momento is like no other movie i have ever seen or am likely to ever see. This a film that that is fairly easy to describe the outline of the plot but almost impossible to describe the story. Guy Pierce plays an insurance investigator who suffers from short term memory loss after a bash on the head during the murder of his wife. this means that he can't retain any memories for more than 5 minutes although he can remember eveything before the accident. With this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge. The way the film plays out is quite brilliant. It has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going. It is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main character.While it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated. Guy Pierce is superb and pulls this off to perfection.But i think a big congratulation goes to Christopher and Jonathon Nolan for the brilliant direction and writing. 9 out of 10.,

543,20 July 2017,swilliky,8, Crazy storytelling and brilliant twists from Christopher Nolan,Christopher Nolan made an excellent film for his second time out with a bigger budget and wild story. Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has short term memory loss so the entire story plays out backward. Leonard kills Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) because he believes he is the one from instructions written on the back of a photograph. He uses tattoos to help him understand what he needs to remember and the message scrawled permanently on his body leads him to a man named John G. who raped and murdered his wife (Jorja Fox). Revenge is his primary motivation and he uses facts and clues to fuel his constant investigation. ,
544,26 January 2006,rebeljenn,7," Unfolding, complex, probably the best film of 2000","'Memento' is a story about a man who suffers from memory loss. He vows revenge on his wife's murder, and he goes about to solve the crime through partial memories and notes that he leaves for himself to help him remember the details of his wife's murder and to track down the murderer. The story-telling and the story itself is amazing; it keeps unfolding like Russian dolls. The film is filled with complex characters, and it is easy to get disillusioned and out-of-focus, much like the main character. That said, it is done well and intentionally and it is an easy film to follow, and it has a complex storyline. I think that Memento was one of the best films of 2000. Interesting, unfolding, and complex, it does not give itself away lightly but calls on you to assess your own judgements.",

Since his hero is also the narrator, it's a tricky narrative; but Nolan complicates things even further by unfolding the story backwards. The result is clever but it's also taxing: your mind has to work harder than it necessarily should. Once the novelty wears off, there are plenty of dead spots and impatience sets in--you want to get to the beginning to get a feeling of completion. The result is like watching a big-screen version of `Columbo' where you know the killer at the onset and watch Peter Falk figure out whodunit and why. If that's your cup of tea, this is for you.

560,21 May 2016,Horror-yo,9," Nolan's best, most certainly","First off, this reviewer thinks Nolan is a massively overrated, so definitely no bias/fanboy-ness here. On its own, this film is superb. It's a good concept, and an even better execution of it. The plot, despite having a very plain core, is actually quite complex and strengthened by strong dialog and other secondary elements, such as the anecdotes for one. All relevant to the plot. Guy Pearce is an excellent actor, however almost too discreet he may always be or difficult to grasp, he puts in just the right performance for this lead role, so very demanding in the field of tight proximity with the audience and raw, realistic acting. So much of the film lays entirely on his shoulders and performance, and it's no coincidence it's such a strong film. The cinematography is deliberately simple, and he is at the center of every scene. The film is straight-to-the-point and there is enough actual story substance that this never feels like it lingers on about the plot or stretches the main concept and rather actively moves forward smoothly. Ultimately, beyond the 'mere' structural strength and unusual chronological format, quality acting and cinematography generally; there is a genuine point, an actual meaning to the story rather than just a (good) story. The twist at the end contributes enormously to the film's strength while maintaining coherence, giving true closure to the story and a sizeable morality; as opposed to soaring out of context as to provide a bigger surprise (which Nolan often does in his films, actually).",

Confidential) receives a violent blow on the head and experiences brain damage. The trauma results in anterograde memory-loss, a rare disorder defined by the inability to form new memories. An insurance investigator who once trusted his perceptions in order to distinguish between people's false and legitimate claims, Leonard must now cope with a condition that challenges his ability to perceive reality, and which presses him to trust others. Nevertheless, Leonard is driven by a commitment to capture his wife's murderer, for the last memory he does retain recalls the traumatic incident. Relying entirely on written notes, Polaroid snapshots, and tattoos, which tell him --rather than remind him-- what car he drives, what motel he is staying in, what his new confidant ""Natalie"" (Carrie-Anne Moss: The Matrix; Chocolat) looks like, and how to find ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano: The Matrix), his wife's killer, Leonard's fate is determined by",
574,5 April 2001,bat-5,9, A wholly unique movie going experience.,"Starting with the ending and moving backward, Memento challenges us with its backwards narrative and shows us that things aren't actually what they seem.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man without the ability to create new memories.  All he knows is that someone raped and murdered his wife, and he's going to find the man and kill him.  In his quest, he is aided by two characters who may know more than they let on.  Joe Pantoliano's Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss' Natalie.  Both have reasons for helping Leonard, but we like Leonard, don't really know who to trust.  As the action progresses backwards, we learn more about Leonard and his condition and we learn more about why things happen to Leonard.  To talk about this film would detract from the fun of watching it unfold, (or is it recede?) in front of you.  You think you know what happens, you think you know why Leonard did what he did, but that's only the beginning.  And nothing is what it seems.",

Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who is struggling to put his life back together after the brutal rape and murder of his wife. But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information, and must resort to copious note- taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered, however, and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life, and he sets out to find him, getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be Leonard's friend, even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted.

How is that possible? Unfortunately it's impossible to describe to you why that is unless you know the premise, so here goes: Our protagonist (Guy Pearce) is a man named Leonard. He is on a seemingly impossible quest for revenge after his wife's rape and murder by an unidentified assailant. The attack left him with a head injury that now prevents him from forming new memories. He knows who he is, he remembers everything up to the moment where he suffered the injury but if he has a conversation that lasts too long, he won't remember how it started. Now, using clues from the night, limited information from the police file that's gone cold, Polaroid photographs, hand-written notes to himself and help from people he has met, Leonard is slowly tracking down the man responsible.",

Giving us endless twists and turns Memento is a great film and an amazing debut for Christopher Nolan, similar to Nolan's later films it's very high concept but it manages to stand up and, in my opinion, even exceed his later movies such as Interstellar and Inception. To go into any detail with the film would require spoilers and while some would be very minor after watching the film I think the best way to experience it is with no prior knowledge at all. When watching you're constantly required to be trying to figure out and understand what's going on and there is no better feeling than when the penny drops and you come to a new realization within the plot. There was really only one part of this film I didn't enjoy which was Leonard (the main character's) short term memory, sometimes felt like it was being used for convenience and that he would only forget when it was helpful to the plot, a minor gripe but still notable none the less. My one last thing to say about this film is you should watch it all in one sitting, I had to watch the first half on one day and the second half two days later and being dropped in halfway through it takes a while to get to grips with where you are in the plot again.

There is no picture in your mind, and you are left to search for your answers. What do you do? To what sounds like a treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle combined, add a strong flavor of revenge and you get a masterly movie all set before your home screens! All you need to do is get the DVD and watch it. Maybe over and over again, like I have been doing The movie begins with the end and the end marks the beginning of the story (did I say that right?).

One of the puzzling pieces was the presence of a picture of Lenny bare chested and happy. It doesn't have a caption and he doesn't question why. He is conditioned you see, he is confident. Leonard believes he can lead the life as the police conducts investigation, taking notes, relying on facts. Well, the problem is what are facts?

What grabs my attention is the mystery of how the plot unfolds surrounding Leonard's explanation of how he came to murder Teddy, but is what he saying really the truth? The answer is that we don't know since there is no reliable narrator to verify our suspicions or tell us what really happened. The reason is because LEONARD IS THE NARRATOR and he wants to believe that his actions are just and that his story about how his wife died and he got his 'condition' is the truth.

626,23 July 2012,axlrhodes,10," Sometimes, it's the way you tell 'em.","Sometimes, it's the way you tell 'em. Such is true of Christopher Nolan's Memento. Based on a short story brother by Jonanthan Nolan, the film is both inventive and compelling as it tells it's story in small chapters moving backwards through the narrative. This editing style is unique to the point that you really feel as though you are witnessing something that has never been done before. The story itself is very simple, the execution is a work of sheer excellence. Guy Pearce is Leonard Shelby, a man who through personal tragedy has lost the ability to create new memories beyond ten minutes and has to to keep detailed records of everything he does in order to function. Early on we learn the catalyst for Leoonard's memory dysfunction was the murder of his wife. Through tattooed notes inked over most of his body, Leonard is slowly gathering clues as to who her killer may be. Christopher Nolan's film is an intimate experience that stays thoroughly focused as the details gradually unravel. In many ways it's the closest equivalent to a compelling page turner as you find yourself eagerly awaiting the next chapter and slice of information. That intimate focus really allows the viewer to become involved in the mystery and gives you ample opportunity within to play detective yourself. With a production budget of just $9m Memento a triumph of intelligent, low budget film making from a director and creative team that were clearly destined for greatness.",

I am a huge fan of the film The Usual Suspects, and was disappointed to find that this film also ranked first place under the category of thriller.  Right above The Usual Suspects.  Memento is a very clever film, yet it does not create the pull that a thriller needs because it takes so long to tell what is happening.  In other words, the movie goes by kind of slowly.  Another mute point that caught my attention was the ending.  Although it left the viewer with something to think about, it didn't give you the "" oh-my gosh-that's-fricken-cool"" feel that a thriller is supposed to leave you with.  To see a truly classic example of a real thriller, you need to see The Usual Suspects.  I do, however, recommend this film.  It uses a unique backwards storyline that makes it very interesting to watch.  Guy Pearce does an excellent job playing a character who cannot produce new memories, and Joe P. delivers his always entertaining performance.  Although it doesn't deserve the great praise up to the point of #9, I do believe that this film is worth any thriller-buffs time.",

""If self-deception can make me happy, I choose to live so."" We must give ourselves a reason to survive, otherwise we will be schizophrenic. But those things we insist on may only be illusions in our own illusions. When I woke up, I looked at the ceiling and asked myself: Who am I and why am I here.

Not that MEMENTO has a bad story, it's just that it cheats in the end. The entire film, I'm wondering and hoping this character will find his wife's murderer, I'm accepting the storytelling style... and in the end the movie falls flat on its face.

First of all this movie is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan he adds such suspense and mystery to every shot and scene in this movie. The movie is one that intentionally played in reverse by starting of a scene in a certain situation and the next scene will take place before that explaining how he got into that situation it's works perfectly for Memento as it is a perfect way to put the viewer in Leonard situation and reflect how much his condition holds him back. Guy Pearce in my opinion is a good actor who can really do wonders when given the right script and wonders is exactly what he did here as this today remains his best and most complex performance because through his performance you are able to feel sorry for him while still being able to be untrustworthy. Carrie Ann Moss is also very good in this movie as like Leonard you don't know how to trust her and she is the polar opposite of Leonard selfish and manipulative. The screenplay in this move is one of the best ever written in my opinion as there's just no other movie like this and every scene has a new mystery to it. Memento is in my top 20 movies of all time at is really should just how good a written and director Christopher Nolan is continuing to keep up this standard over 15 years later. 100%-A+,

This was at least the feeling that Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" gave me and in this case it's not so much the story that is new (although it is pretty great and fresh nevertheless) but the way how it is told. The reverse chronological order makes it a challenging experience. This is really a film that gives you much substance for discussion, because you might not really understand all about it. Whether or not full understanding is possible at all is a question I haven't answered for myself. Did his wife actually die? Was it himself who killed her? Who can he really trust?

This is the best suspense movie that I have seen since L.A. Confidential.  I think Christopher Nolan deserves a Best Director Oscar nod for his excellent direction of this film. Guy Pearce deserves a Best Actor nod for his performance.  Memento also contains some of the best film editing I have seen in years.  I think this movie will probably end up getting at least three to ten Oscar nominations. If not, the Academy doesn't know great filmmaking when they see it.

705,5 August 2003,ian_harris,8, Compelling and superbly constructed,"We found this film compelling throughout and superbly constructed.  The idea of working backwards through time works in this movie precisely because the protagonist suffers from a rare ""total"" short-term memory loss.  The strange time lines induce us to empathise with the protagonist, although it is clear that he is not an altogether sympathetic character.  This is not a great movie for characterisation, but it is utterly memorable and deserves the adulation it has received.",
706,14 November 2002,susansweb,8," If you can ignore a big flaw, an enjoyable ride.","In the beginning of the film, when I learned that Leonard (Guy Pearce) had no short term memory since his accident and wife's murder, I accepted it easily.  But then I got to thinking, assuming he was told about his memory loss after the accident, how could he remember that he had this problem?  To me, that flaw could derail the film but like Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffin, I just let it go.  The reason for the film's success is that by telling the story backwards, we are just like Leonard, we learn everything when he does and there is no way for us to piece things together.  This makes it practically impossible to figure things out.  In ""The Lady in the Lake"", director Robert Montgomery tried to make the audience feel like the main character, Philip Marlowe, by showing everything from Marlowe's point of view.  It didn't work mainly because it was too weird to have everyone in the movie treating the audience like a character.  ""Memento"" succeeds where Montgomery failed.  As for the acting, Pearce plays Leonard a little too intense, probably the way someone would really act but at times too much for the screen.  Carrie-Anne Moss does nothing to distinguish herself and her berating of Leonard was embarrassing to watch.  Joe Pantoliano as the mysterious Teddy, has his best performance to date.

Cause then i look back on other movies, like 'lost highway' and everyone hates it. Well folks this movie isn't all that revolutionary. First off i'd like to mention a certain convience of this movie, how can the main character remember that he has a memory disorder, yet can't remember anything else? Think about it, he'd constantly live in the present, and be completely unaware of living in the present, the only way he'd know he was living in the present would be if someone was there to tell him that. So that's a MAJOR plot hole. that's not the worst thing about the movie, the worst thing is that the character's are flat, the plot is flat - C'mon a plot about a guy searching for the guy who killed his wife, with NO twists (if seen without the contrived plot)boring characters, and lame dialogue. Watched in regular motion this movie is not interesting at all. Some people were comparing this to Lynch. Well, comparing it to what lynch has done so far, he ALWAYS uses interesting characters and great atmosphere to tell his stories, not just some lame plot contrivance. The movie isn't terrible, it has it's moments, but it's annoying that it's getting so much praise when movies like lost highway get trashed.

It's about a guy who cannot create new memories trying to find his wife's killer. That alone is an interesting enough premise. But Christopher Nolan decided to take it even further by making the film go backwards. The film starts with the end, and goes to the beginning. So, right from the start, you know what the end result is, yet, you really don't know what happened. It manages to keep the viewer guessing and asking questions, despite already have given away the ending. That is some truly genius writing and directing on Nolan's part, once again demonstrating his immense talent.

Do the creators of this movie even try to do that? No - the story never strays away from a long-trodden path of a sturdy commercial thriller-mystery. Yes, yes - reverse order, unknown past instead of unknown future etc., but this all looks to me like using a statue as a hammer.

However that's only if you know the movie in chronological order because of this film after Following (1998)'s rave reception Christopher Nolan proves why he is the best director of our time and maybe the best director ever. Also his brother deserves credit for coming up with the short story that inspired this film that you should read but not before seeing the film as it will give the film's plot away. I spent the entire 120 minute runtime trying to figure out what is going on, trust me trying to watch this film with your brain turned off is a bad idea. So make sure you're sober and prepped with a notepad (just kidding although you could if you are avid). Keep your brain on and enjoy the ride.

I recently discovered the IMDb site and was very satisfy with its content at first. But the comments are mostly made by north American residents (wich i am by the way, living in french speaking city of Québec) who rarely see foreign countries films... That ignorance of foreign cinema led people to rank ""Memento"" in the top 10 of this database. I mean come on and please do me the favor to open your eyes a bit! If you don't want to commence by viewing old black & white classics which could seem boring for young audience, please try with contemporary directors as Austrian Michael Haneke or French François Ozon who made wonderfully original movies like ""Code Unknown"" or ""Swiming Pool"" which are i think even available in dubbed versions for an English audience. So make an effort and search for it instead of being crazy about nonsense movies such as ""Memento"" or Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" Otherwise, do like me and watch old fashion classics from Orson Wells, John Huston or H.G.

This is basically what happened when I watched Memento. I went into this movie dry. I didn't know much about it other than it is about a man with memory loss and he tries to avenge his wife. That is basically the story but it sort of plays backwards. I watched this movie on recommendation by a few friends and when I heard Christopher Nolan was involved I was sold. Without further ado here is Memento.,

Christopher Nolan beautifully interlaces human anti-trust into the script and reveals scene by scene an ugly and distorted mess that our lead guy Shelby had to endure due to his condition. Some of the madness that happens is due to Shelby's memory loss and the rest is pretty much his so called friends (who he slowly finds out like 'Teddy') are not to be trusted at all. For my first viewing I was amazed, usually it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up and understand it but I stuck my face in front of my TV for an hour and a half and paid very close attention to the scene development (which I think was just a superb idea of genius on director Nolans behalf). I would recommend this movie to anyone alive and breathing, it definitely has a ton of symbolism and best yet, its a thinking-persons movie. A+ 9/10 stars should suffice. Unlike Leonard Shelby in the movie, we the viewer have to use OUR memories in order to piece everything together, brilliant.",

Perhaps years of reading 'twist in the tale' novels by people like Jeffrey Deaver has made me more immured from excitement of this type of thing, I don't know. I didn't guess the ending, but then like an episode of Taggart, it didn't reveal sufficient plot details along the way to enable you to do this. On the other hand the punchline didn't knock me off my feet either. The best I can say about the story is that it was better than The Usual Suspects (and I did guess the end in that). I was disappointed that the writer or director felt the need to include a scene where a drink exposes just how goldfish-like the hero's memory is. We'd already established that and the scene added nothing to the story other than a eewww moment, but other than that, every little rewind of the story and extra exposure of the plot fitted and worked well. Still, at the end of it all, I couldn't help feeling so what? Guy Pearce filled a character without any depth with real depth. Partially helped by a great physique and some intriguing tattoos, although we knew almost nothing of his character other than his plight, you were driven to watch as he made an otherwise unbelievable character perfectly believable. Ultimately though, just because we believe he could be real, that isn't the same as caring what might happen to him and for all it's clever twisting, take away the superb performance of Guy Pearce and we're left with a rather gimmicky plot rather than a classic film.",

Explored is the similar theme of memory and remembering, one which often comes up in shows like Mr. Robot, which is ending this year and Terry Gilliam's strange dystopian film, Twelve Monkeys, in 1995. The plot is simple: the protagonist, Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, has lost his short-term memory and is trying to find the killer of his wife, Catherine Shelby (played by Jorja Fox). As he tells the audience, he lost his memory as he was knocked out after he shot his wife's killer, so he remembers ""important facts"" on Polaroids he takes and on tattoos across his body. Certain characters literally take advantage of this condition like a local bartender, Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, to kill/intimidate her boyfriend, Dodd, played by Callum Keith Rennie, and the head of a local hotel, Burt, played by Mark Boone Junior, the latter whom charges him for two separate rooms because he ""won't remember."" However, the story posed by John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell, played by Joe Pantoliano, who claims to be an undercover cop which is investigating local gangs, including James F. ""Jimmy"" Grantz, played by Larry Holden. In the story Teddy tells, the protagonist killed his own wife, whom had diabetes, with injection of insulin, and now goes around from town to town killing people whom he claims are the ""killer"" of his wife! If this is the case, however, why does Teddy allow it to happen? Has the protagonist conditioned himself, as he claims happened with the case of Samuel R. ""Sammy"" Jankis (played by Stephen Tobolowsky) and Mrs. Jankis (played by Harriet Sansom Harris)? Or is that just a fabrication in his mind?",

774,3 June 2020,adeckofcards,9, Memories of a crime,"In his first work ('Following'), Christopher Nolan showed his interest in covering psychological issues and telling them through a non-linear narrative. But it is in his second feature film ('Memento'), where he launches his great bet.
The story introduces us to a man who, after an incident, where his wife was murdered, loses the ability to create new memories and must write notes to remember facts, people and places.
To tell this story, Nolan uses a double narrative making this probably his best and smartest script. The first narrative path starts from a fact and goes backwards telling how it got there, this allows the viewer to be on a par with the character, since you do not know what happened before what we are seeing, as if we also had no memory.
The second narrative path is linear, going from back to front. These two narrative pathways intertwine in a fluid and coherent way, making a story that seems complicated very understandable.

But, experimental films often fail to engage because the experiment overwhelms the story or there is no real story to tell.  Timecode is a good example of an experiment that failed.  Memento, on the other hand, is an experiment that succeeds brilliantly.  As you can tell within the first few minutes of the film, this movie tells the story in reverse.  It's almost like they took a conventional movie, cut it into scenes, and played the scenes in reverse order.  This works because you are seeing the world from the eyes of someone who has no short term memory.  As such, this could have been a gimmik.  Instead, it's a tool for telling a complex and fascinating story.

I am happy to say that this is not the case with ""Memento"", a clever and twisted thriller that makes the audience sympathize with the lead character by giving them, in essence, the same lack of info that the protagonist has. By telling the story in the fashion that the writer and director have chosen, if you don't pay keen attention to every line and every character, the film will definitely lose it's impact. The final twist is a whopper that I never saw coming and yet I didn't feel at all cheated.

There's a series of decisions Leonard makes in that scene which he knows he'll forget, and those decisions are recognizably human, and there's some terrific reverberation, particularly to a scene in which Natalie goes out to a car to wait.  Obviously I'm being obtuse, but those who have seen the movie will know what I'm speaking of, and probably agree.

808,26 May 2002,watto124,10, One of the most ingenious films ever devised!,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" anything but mediocre. It is the most beautiful, poetic, and strangely told thriller I've ever come across. Some people are probably not going to like ""Memento"" because of its overwhelming complexity. But the fact that it is so hard to follow is part of the point. Nolan made an effort to allow an audience to be able to tap into the mind of a person with short-term memory loss and be just as confused as Leonard Shelby, the protagonist with the strange condition. He does this, as everybody knows, by telling the film backwards, though all the clues are laid out for you and characters are introduced to you like you're watching a regular movie. Amazing. And of course, an amazing concept like this calls for equally amazing actors to carry the story. And they more than rise to the occasion. No one could've done a better job than Guy Pearce. He is simply spectacular. As is Joe Pantoliano, who brings a charismatic comic relief to the piece (which is certainly needed). And Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job of changing your perceptions of a character just by adding more facial expressions. This movie is perfect, innovative, and down right awesome! 10/10",

Carrie Moss who exhibited no acting ability in the Matrix and very little in the Sigourney Weaver role in Red Planet - finally gets a chance to prove herself.

Not since Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie hit us with ""The Usual Suspects"" have I seen a thriller this refreshing. The plot unfolds in reverse with ingenuity and seamless precision.  Much as McQuarrie relied on Verbal Kint's monologue to carry the viewer from scene to scene, Nolan allows an ongoing telephone conversation to grease his transitions.  A case can be made that Nolan is even more successful.  The film's over arching themes of denial, and the difficulty of living a life that acknowledges a past, present, and future, keep the conversations going well after the movie ends. ",
824,22 December 2021,charbelelaro,9, The way the events are presented places us so deeply inside the mind of the character,"Memento is directed by Christopher Nolan, and centres around a man with short term memory loss, who is on a mission to track down his wife's murderer. This film is incredibly unique in its execution. The premise may be quite simple, however the way in which the story is told makes for such a complex and mind bending experience. A lot of the time, when a movie takes on unconventional methods of story telling, it feels more like a gimmick than something that is actually in service to the story. However, in Memento, the way the events are presented places us so deeply inside the mind of the character. It's as if the audience themselves have short term memory loss, and are trying to eagerly piece information together in each scene. It makes for such a captivating and thought provoking experience. For me, Memento contains one of the greatest scripts of all time. The movie constantly builds in tension, with every conversation leaving the audience feeling more and more uneasy. Once everything comes to fruition, I was incredibly impressed with how all the pieces came together. This was really the first time Nolan revealed his genius in a full length feature film. It's so clear how much time, and meticulous thought went into every line of dialogue. The film's editing is also executed perfectly, as it is so crucial to the story's execution. Overall, I can't recommend this movie enough. Memento is top tier Nolan, and will always be an all time favourite of mine.",

I've just seen it a second time, and it struck me just how much Leonard emphasizes the role of what cognitive psychology calls ""procedural memory"" (and which Leonard quite reasonably calls ""habit"" or ""instinct"") in explaining why he's as functional as he is.  Procedural memory is spared in even the worst cases of anterograde amnesia caused by medial temporal lobe (hippocampus, etc.) damage.

Everything we perceive has some significance to it, and the lesson of Memento pertains to the knowledge of such a concept.

After his wife (C.S.I.'s Jorja Fox - who has bad periodontal disease and can't act) dies, Leonard lounges around budget motel rooms trying to find and put vengeance on the man who killed his wife. He gets helped along the way by a weird looking cop, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano - The Sopranos) and a drug dealer's anxious wife (Carrie Ann-Moss - The Matrix). For those who like solving mysteries and fans of true good thrillers, this is a film for you. Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano give especially excellent performances! Grade: A",

846,25 April 2001,snake77,10," Original, brilliant, and complex","I just saw Memento for the second time.  This film has no marketing tie-ins, no superstars, no special effects and isn't based on a bad 70's TV show. It's simply a terrific film with a original idea (how rare is that these days!), superb direction and acting from all three leads.  It grabs your attention from the first scene and never lets go. If you are a fan of film noir, you really owe it to yourself to see this movie.  The idea for the film itself is clever, but the stroke of genius the way the story is told - from the last scene backwards.  As if that isn't enough, there are additional scenes filmed in black and white which fill in much of the details of the story as you go along.  This is truly impressive work.  I was lucky enough to see Christopher Nolan's other film - the short but very well done Following.  Although solid, that film pales in comparison to Memento and makes me wonder how Nolan can possibly top himself.  Can't wait to find out!",
847,11 May 2001,Aphex97,9, Great direction of original script and great acting make a great movie!,"When I walked out of the theater after viewing Memento I wasn't sure what to think. This movie kept me guessing at every turn and the final twist at the ending (or should I say beginning??) when everything came together was brilliant , moving, and refreshingly original. This whole movie gets major points in my book for being so original. From the opening sequence to the final credits, the viewer can't guess what is going to happen next. In fact, it is so hard to orient oneself in the movie that some people may be turned off by it. However, I enjoyed it thoroughly. ",

Told backwards, this film makes us feel the confusion, delusion, and frustration of the main character (Guy Pearce) as he tries to determine who he can trust and where to go next.  Pearce is on screen for every scene, and he delivers a strong performance, both chilling and inspirational at the same time. Director Nolan also hits us with a subliminal message about the ultimate futility of revenge and the human desire to make sense of the world around us.  In the end, this film's creative style and backwards motion carry it high above an otherwise everyday noir plot.

Using fractured time sequences, delirious flashbacks and a reflective narration to illustrate an anti-hero's perilous obsession with following strangers, Following incorporated a variety of props, things and fragments of décor in the noir iconography that were underscored, naturally, by the film's 16mm black-and-white stock.

857,4 October 2005,jaesboxer,10, One of the best thrillers of all time.,"I was one of very few mainstream viewers who saw Memento in the theatres. Later, when it was out on DVD, it became such a sleeper hit, spread by word of mouth, that practically everybody I knew had seen it. The words ""short-term memory"" loss became a key gimick in film and television. The concept of a movie, flowing out of sequence, generally unused since Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, now came back with a vengeance, forming such films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Memento truly deserves to be called one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The concept of a man who cannot make new memories trying to locate his wife's murderer is a brilliant, but the impetus used by putting it in reverse is shattering. We experience the world of Leonard Shelby, whose short-term memory was destroyed in the same incident that saw the murder and rape of his wife, as he searches for the murderer, the mysterious John G. Tattooed with key information, Leonard is the centre of a drama involving three people: himself, Natalie, and Teddy. The story begins at the end, with LEonard finding Teddy to in fact be the John G. he has been searching for, and murdering him. Thus, Leonard is the romantic hero out for revenge. But as the story unfolds, new faces are revealed. The notes which he lives his life by, written on the backs of photographs, have their genesis one after the other, characterizing who he trusts and who he doesn't. A mark on Teddy's photo, reading ""Do not believe his lies,"" renders everything Teddy says, in Leonard's mind, false. Thus, for much of the film, we feel close to Leonard, sympathise with him, distrust Teddy, and see Natalie as the kind lover and helper. But as facts are revealed, these things begin to change. Natalie is revealed as a truly sinister character, using Leonard's condition to get rid of her enemies. Teddy's advice begins to sound practical, and true. Yet only in the final scene are we shown Leonard's real face: the bloodthirsty killer whose memory creates a vacuum into which all guilt and responsibility vanish, and who, never being able to fulfill his vengeance, and unable to heal by time, is driven by the soul purpose of destruction, by an enigma he created himself. In the final scene, we are left with a genuine feeling of unease. Why? Because we have attached ourselves to these characters as what they were revealed as at the beginning, we have sympathised with them, and never knowing where they came from, were content to assume by the present. But in the end, we find ourselves close to a psychotic, a murderer, a sociopath whose memory destroys all fulfillment and remorse, in other words, a mad man.",

However after I had finished watching it for the first time I felt a great need to watch it again, and so I ended up watching the entire movie two nights in a row. This was for two reasons: firstly, because the narrative of the movie is very confusing and you have to concentrate very hard just to understand what the heck is going on in most of the scenes, so naturally I knew that if I were to watch it again I would be able to follow it and enjoy it much more; and secondly because the movie was just so, so good the first time around I really, really wanted to see it again. I've been a fan of Nolan's films for a long time now (ever since I first saw Batman Begins) and this was almost the last of his movies that I had left to watch.

But When I searched for the details, I've found out some details that comes unlogical to me. Mainly I could not understand how long or until which condition Lenny's memory lasts. In one scene he forgets the events at that moment even while he is trying not to forget ( while looking for a pen).

It wasn't really that confusing but it was enough for (sorry for breaking the golden rule) me to speak out in the theater to my buddy and ask him for some concise guidance.

First, because the end is the beginning and the beginning is the end. You are going to watch a movie invertedly, and it is not enough: the script complicates it much more, but through a way which exacts from you more than mere perception. The history works deeply with the strange amnesia that confuses the poor avenger (Guy Pearce). You and him just don't know who to trust.

Did he die at the end (or beginning)? I have to see the movie again.  And the way Christopher Nolan had the scenes happen and then a few minutes later he showed the scene that was leading up to it and why certain things happend.

This is one of the most confusing movies ever made, and to say that it's not in chronological order would be putting it lightly. But, if you like movies with lots of twists and lots of psychological turns, then this is one of the best out there. It follows a man with short-term memory loss, played by Pearce. He reminds himself of who/what/where/when/why he is with photographs. But as his past and mission emerges, and the pieces fit more and more together, this movie just gets better and better.

What makes this film so unique is the fact the before every scene you get a little bit of the beggining where Guy Pearce is talking to an anonymous person on the phone about a gentleman who is having the same problem as he is having.  Anyways as it goes to color it shows bit's and pieces of Guy Pearces day which is cut into when he losses his memory.  The interesting thing is instead of going foward in the story it goes backward in the story so you meet all the people but the start to be less known in the end.  Then the black and white you find out is the beggining of the story.  Another thing you notice is that Guy Pearce's character is beeing minuplilated by Joe Patilato character which is a cop,and since Guy's character has short term memory loss he doesn't remember the the cop has made him kill people before.

The filmstyle is superb, I won't say anything to spoil the movie but rather explain the style of its approach. The movie starts off in the end and it sequentially plays 'backwards' towards the start of the movie. A very ingenious method of filming, it leaves us guessing in the end (or shall I say start?). Easter eggs (I won't say which!) also linger in the movie which increases the question/discussion count. The character development is superb as it is the only movie to my recollection which 'un'develops the character. ALthough it might be confusing for a first viewing, watching it a second time will make the viewer yearning for more just to get his/her questions answered. Acting is superb, we are left with no hint of overacting or underacting in all cases. I would recommend for all to watch it at LEAST 2 times for the full effect of complete heavenly satisfaction.",

I feared I would be let down since the hype was so great. 1 minute after watching the ending....or should I say the beginning, I was a little frustrated since I too am programmed by Hollywood to expect the expected once in a while.  Then I thought to myself for a few minutes and it all came together. This is the type of movie that doesn't end when the lights go back on. It sticks with you. It makes you think.

903,3 June 2020,thg011093,7, Must watch for its unique storytelling,"Love it or hate it, watching ""Memento"" is a special experience which could never be repeated. What looks like a regular revenge story of a man in search of the murder who killed his wife turns out not to be like that! The movie let the viewers find out the cause, not the consequence, hence the reverse chronology. If you ever feel super clueless or frustrated during watching it, that means the director succeeds in making you live the life of the protagonist - a patient with anterograde amnesia. I give ""Memento"" a 10 for its cinematic uniqueness and a 5 for the story as it doesn't resonate with me. Overall 7/10.",

Memento is a clever, and compelling film that keeps you guessing throughout, still full of tension and intrigue, despite its peculiar structure, it manages to maintain your interest, but could perhaps be a little clever for its own good for some viewers. But if cerebral movies are your thing, then it's well worth checking out, plus the photography and direction is excellent, and Guy Pierce proves once again what a convincing actor he can be. What makes Memento stand out though is that it doesn't appear to take itself too seriously and get bogged down - it maintains a good sense of black humor throughout - and though it's quite hard on the brain cells, and you may wonder how it's all feasible, the very idea behind it is interesting enough to make the film work very well.",

You'll see outstanding actors in this movie who have gone onto bigger things: Guy Pearce, Carrie Moss, even Larry Holden.  Remember him from ""Every Dog Has Its Day""?

I feel sorry for younger people who will likely never experience something like this when watching movies as they watch most at home and at theatres I haven't seen one in a long long time where the audience was really into it as with this one.

912,9 September 2001,Twillhead,8, The Blessings of Continuity . . .,"... and the bewildering nightmare of life without it--therein lies the crux of `Memento', a quietly brilliant film by Christopher Nolan. The film's opening credits, set over the image of a Polaroid photograph in the reverse process of developing itself, indicates the way the story will unfold--backwards. The cast is filled with first-rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby--driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film--who suffers from a rare medical condition which has robbed him of short-term memory. He is on a relentless quest to find and kill the man who attacked and murdered his wife, and who is responsible for Leonard's memory malfunction. The ""rub"" is that Leonard can't possibly remember the identity of the assailant. Leonard is only able to track him down by the use of Polaroid photos scribbled with reminders, a few odd post-it notes, and, most chillingly, by tattooing clues to his body, including a constant reminder of the reason for his mission, emblazoned backwards across his chest, readable only by use of a mirror. (An aside: `We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are', says Leonard at the end of the film--but the film's question to the audience seems to be: what does that mirror reflect? And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?) While some may find the vigilante aspect of the main character abhorrent, the audience's empathy for Leonard is gained by the poignancy of his plight. In one heart-wrenching scene, Leonard, while burning some of his wife's belongings, wonders if he has ever similarly disposed of her things before and thinks: `I can't remember to forget you.' `Memento' is an astonishing homily about guilt and vengeance (and is vengeance ever really attainable?), manipulation and betrayal, and the lies we often force ourselves to believe when we fall into our own self-inflicted episodes of short-term memory.  NOTE: Those with short-attention spans need not apply! This film demands from its audience absolute attention from beginning to end.",
913,7 May 2001,averjee,10, Terrific!!!,"Very clever, spooky thriller that is actually run backwards, so that each event that takes place on screen actually unfolded prior to what you just saw.  The director- Chris Nolan (INSOMNIA) - uses this device to unwrap a mystery: our protagonist is looking for a killer, but he is afflicted by a strange condition that prevents him from retaining information for mor ethan a few minutes at a time. He can't remember where he's been or what he's just done, so the backwards-plot angle makes the viewer oddly in sync with the protaginist - we don't what he's just done, either.  Ambiguous until the end, this is a masterful detective story - every detail is imbued with significance, though we often don't realize it until later.  The lead character is played by Guy Pearce, the fiercely honorable and intelligent cop in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL - here, he has the same kind of mission for justice thing going, but he's flying blind here, unable to remember or trust anyone and ultimately unsure even of his own motives.  Pearce didn't come across      It's a dizzying tale - fractured, repetitive, cryptic, disorienting - just the way that film noir is supposed to be.",

Memento is a film that can fall into all three of these categories. This is NOT a roll into the cinema or when it comes out on DVD/Video get the popcorn in and let the film just wash over you. On the contrary, this is a film that demands effort from its viewers and if you are prepared to give that effort then you get an awful lot back in return.",

One can't believe that such a flat creature would have any kind of sustained motivation to track the killer.   Plus the film's confusingness seems pretentious after a while.

To cope with his condition, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures, writes himself notes and tattoos himself with reminders and instructions that help him on his quest to find and kill the man who killed his wife.

Some reviews here have mentioned good characterizations, yet I think that despite very good efforts by the performers, there was no room for character development because of the very limits the movie imposes on itself.

I have to believe that my actions still have meaning... even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there.""

The whole thing is given you backwards (the first thing that blew me away). Not only, it's been cut in little scenes that repeat recursively from the beginning of the new scene to the end of the last part you saw. I NEVER SAW SUCH A CREATIVE NARRATIVE AS THIS ONE. Nolan brothers are geniuses. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano make a good cast, each one really give the best to their characters. Though Pearce's one is the most difficult and unstable to predict, you get a sense of that guy might actually exist in real life. And to conclude, the end does not explain you nothing solid.

I guess I don't have to mention that his illness does not make his job easy, since once he starts a conversation, at about the fifth sentence he forgets how did it start, and only takes him a while 'til he forgets who is he talking with. Basically he can't remember anything since the day he got the wound on his face, but thanks to the notes and photographs he keeps creating all the time he manages to find the killer. Or at least that's what he thinks The directing is most definitely what makes this movie as unique as it is. The whole story is going backwards, so you just have to wait for the reasons, they will always come later. It reminded me a lot of French movie Irreversible, which had almost the same schema, but of course Memento is two years older, and to be honest I didn't like Irreversible since I found it a bit weird.

This is not your everyday run of the mill, same old, same old JLo film or something, this is an original, thoughtful, intelligent film.  Those that have read or heard that it is ""backward"" or ""confusing"" pay attention while I explain the unexplainable:  when the movie is in color, the plot is from the back and is progressing to the middle, thus the first five minutes of the film occur at the end of the sequence of events.  Then the next five minutes are in black and white and are the beginning of the story arc (there are additional flashbacks of Leonard's memories, but those are fairly easy to follow).  Then it goes back to the next color scene which is the one chronologically in front of the opening scene, then another black and white which is the next scene from the beginning.

Although this movie does leave quite a few unanswered questions, this feeling of wonder as the movie ends is almost comforting, because you can make up your own ending to the story and what YOU think actually happened.

955,18 June 2001,The Truth,8," Clever, but lacks some depth.","The most memorable, remarkable thing in Memento is obviously its structure. The story of the film is told backwards, scene by scene. This unorthodox choice of narrative form has two purposes: firstly, it creates unique twists by showing an character act, and only afterwards revealing the (usually ambiguous) motives behind the action. Secondly, the narration helps us to identify with the main character, Leonard Shelby; Shelby's brain is damaged, and he therefore loses his short-memory several times a day. Like Leonard, the audience doesn't know what happened to him before his latest fit of amnesia. Also, like Leonard, the audience does know what happened to him before the assault that caused the injury. So we know that his wife was killed, and that revenge is the only thing that keeps him going.",

The premise is fantastically original, a man with no short term memory trying to find his wifes killer with the help of someone he doesn't know at all, or at least thats what he thinks. I think the film going in reverse while inter-cutting in forwards action is a brilliant idea and it works fantastically in this film. Guy Pearce deserves a lot of credit for pulling off the role of Leonard Shelby, he is amazing, as is the supporting cast. Like Fight Club, this film was severly overlooked at the oscars, adding to my opinion that the oscars mean nothing whatsoever. Overall, brilliant, everything is great in this movie 10/10",

From the opening sequence, the viewer dives into a world of mystery and leaves much of the interpretation up to the spectators. In a year featuring dud after dud, a film like this restored my hope in entertaining film-making. Christopher Nolan (the director and screenwriter), along with the editor and actors deserve all the kudos for giving the public a film, which is entertaining and actually requires effort. When so many movies (""Jurassic Park III"", ""Tomcats"", etc.)  are having the audience leave their brain at the door, this is one notable exception. The performances are all first-rate, but the story is the star here. The film plays with narrative structure and has many scenes, moments and images which refer back to others.

Told completely backwards, director Christopher Nolan takes us on the hunt for a killer as seen through the shattered reality of a man with no memory. Guy Pearce is simply remarkable as Leonard, whose obsessive persuit of the man that kills his wife has consumed his life, and in the wake of his condition it is, in fact, the only thing he is living for. The supporting cast is amazing, the always terrific Joe Pantoliano for one, who just has this knack for playing likable sleaze, and Carrie-Anne Moss, known best for her role in the Matrix films, is also pitch perfect in a Noir film that redefines the genre for the new century. It can be hard to follow if you're not paying attention, but in the end the eccentricity of how the tale is told makes more and more sense as, just like Leonard, you never know how he got to the point where he is. A brilliant, moving film that deserved better from Oscar this year. it's one of my favorite films and i've told just about everyone I know to go ahead and rent it.  Remarkable.",

Nolan handles his second feature with great discipline and confidence for someone so new to the hostile world of American movie-making.

What makes this different from your average revenge film is that Lenny (Guy Pearce) has a ""condition"" which means that since the incident (involving his wife's apparent rape and murder) he only has a two minute memory span.

Then, when it happens, you asked why in blazes did you waste your time (e.g. the remake of Planet of the Apes). You will not be disappointed with the conclusion of Memento. It's a movie that falls just short of being a classic, but nonetheless one that you will likely remember for some time. The reverse unfolding of the plot was not extremely difficult to follow and didn't force the viewer to continually question the significance of each scene. In other words, it was a user friendly film and the director did not find it necessary to continually confound the viewer with scenes that had to be replayed several times before they became understandable. Fans of CSI, the Sopranos and Frasier will enjoy seeing actors from these shows in another setting. Finally, a movie that's thought provoking without being overly cerebral.",

I want to rave about this film, but I don't even know where to start.

1027,23 December 2004,Krazykopper,10, Unforgettable,"Undoubtedly the most astounding piece of work Hollywood had produced in decades. If Hitchcock was around today even he would surely bow to this movie's understated genius. What is undeniable here is the urge to keep watching. From the start you are shown the plot's climax, but to make sense of it you are pushed into rewind, slowly absorbing the plot, only understanding fully the end (or the beginning), by enduring long enough to finally see the revelations laid down at the beginning (or the end). Anyone who has watched the Easter egg chronological order of this on DVD will know it is not the plot but the reverse telling of the story in which the genius lies. This is a film that doesn't just entertain through its runtime , it will keep you enthralled for days as the outstanding plot reveals more and more with closer scrutiny through 'dare I say it', your own attempt to piece it together through memory. The little known Chris Nolan has outdone himself with this marvel and although his subsequent effort 'Insomnia' failed to make quite the same impression it will be interesting to see what he makes of the much anticipated 'Batman Begins'. A shrewd movie lining up Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano fresh from their success in the original Matrix movie. It is the performance of Guy Pearce 'LA Confidential & Neighbours (sorry Guy had to mention it)' that is enthralling. The audience insight through him into the complex life of a man with no memory is mesmerising. Many films which gradually unveil a series of complicated twists fall down upon subsequent viewing, but this delivers time and time again. In a time when originality is the greatest gift that a talented film maker can give us, this is without doubt the best example of a gripping original film ever made. It is just a shame that such original, independent films go unrecognised by the academy.",

1029,1 November 2008,colinsbob,4," I've got it, I've got it Heck, I've got it.","Since I've started watching and reviewing movies, I was searching for innovation and fantastically. What then happened, it proved actually that my theory about British directors have stile, been wrong. That was when I saw Memento At first, I found it unusual that the film begins extremely violent, do even the most controversial films ever made, like Cannibal Holocaust, or (what's more possible that this film is a copy of that movie) Pulp Fiction, don't begin by killing people, by showing how they die. Its true that's a shock for the audience and that they will stay to see the movie, but the next move, was so unprofessional, like he did never get a video camera in his hands. He broke the main rule, of every filmmaker that ever broke a rule. He tortured the audience by showing too many flashbacks. The rule, of every film is not to do a same thing more then 3 times or 7 times but not at once. Even if you look at Pulp fiction, it's got not less then 7, yeah, seven my friends, seven! Memento's got 22 jumps. A man, a normal human, looses every wish to see a thing if you have repeated something more then 11 times. I'm somehow surprised that it became a success. I have nothing against the actors, because Nolan chooses quite well actors. What I'm really mad, are the characters In every Nolan movie! The characters are mean, evil, stupid I mean, you don't have to think in Nolan's movies, they tell you anything at the end, so you have to just watch the end, cause anything else it for throwing away: the horrible music, poor characters and no style directing, only some trademarks, but nothing else. But let's go back to Memento You may have notice that the characters are changing, but from good up to evil. This lends realism, that's for sure, but it does not automatically made a great feature. Some of you would probably say that a man gets rotten, because the society wont help him with his problem, but that's not the case in Memento. Leo's the guy who actually killed the only person, who was ever kind to him, and understood his problem, Teddy, what makes Leonard a guy, who doesn't want any help from anyone which turns his character not into a anti hero, but more a antagonist: he has no purpose, he doesn't want any help, he loves nobody a villain. Finally, some of you might think that I'm only writhing bad reviews all the time, but true's that I love much worse movies and writhe reviews that show how charming films are. I even see something positive in Michael Bays films, but this film doesn't have a place at IMDb top 250.",
1030,6 March 2017,mattwilde123,10, Memento,"'Memento' is director Christopher Nolan's tribute to classic film noir tales of revenge and mystery. By adding a new twist to traditional conventions, Nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. The aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. The viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). We then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear.",

1032,17 April 2003,guarg,10, Tracing Introspection,"First off I would like to add my kudo to the pile of stars that this film has accumulated on imdb.  It is indeed every bit the cinematic brilliance that its rating suggests and ,in fact, I rented it solely on the rating it had received here on the imdb (part of a little experiment that I was doing to see how well my tastes matched up with those of everyone else).  The film is rife with existential commentary which in the end seems to be the point of the film.  For some individuals this film may be difficult to watch as you are forced to trace the main character's bizarre brand of introspection through a sequence of events and narration that are delivered to you in reverse chronological order.  Our minds perceive time in a linear fashion so out of sequence filming can be an absolute disaster as many film makers have discovered.  In Memento any confusion that results from this sequencing technique is absolutely necessary for the movie to be understood (understanding through confusion, sounds kinda zen).  Well, enough said about this film's greatness.  If you haven't already seen Memento give it try.",

The acting, especially from Guy Pierce, is phenomenal. You feel for the characters even when you don't know much about them, mainly because they don't know much about themselves. From the opening sequence, the movie hooks you in and never lets go. The story moves along quickly, and keeps you guessing from beginning to end. There is suspense, drama, violence, and even some comedy. But the thing that holds this film together is Christopher Nolan's precise direction, which keeps the viewer intrigued but unable to look away.

Every single moment of this movie is gripping. I'm convinced you can watch it ad infinitum and still discover new and eye-opening nuggets each viewing. Guy Pearce is pitch perfect, and Carrie-Anne Moss is so diabolically stunning she's scary. Joey Pants with the comic relief is what seals this as hands-down one of the most interesting and well-conceived and executed films of the 2000's. Adapted from a story that Nolan's brother wrote, this whole movie feels so personal - despite it's oddball topic. Just watch the mystery unfold here, as it deepens with each passing minute.

1048,17 September 2001,famsmith,9, The Convenience of Memory Loss.,"Typically I choose not to comment on the story and instead focus on the craft of a film.  However, in Memeneto the essence, the distinctiveness, the brilliance, the virtue is in the story itself.  This is the first film in quite some time that I can honestly say I enjoyed purely for the sake of the story- the film itself.  The film has a real starkness to it making the noir comparison obvious, inevitable and quickly a cliche.  The device used in this film is not as straightforward as most people have initially described and it is certainly not a gimmick.  When I think of gimmicks I think of filmic devices, techniques, or methods that are employed only to befuddle the audience and to show off the filmmaker's ability. Therefore this film's device is not gimmicky, the story would be just as interesting without the device.  Of course as some people have already observed this film is not only an implausible one, but an imperfect one, but surely we have made bigger concessions for films in the past.  At the heart of the story is the main character Lenny and his inability to as he puts it to make any new memories. This problem though often comical proves to be simultaneously Lenny's tragedy (making Lenny a very ironic character).  Along with the chaos of a daily life in which he can not remember anything longer than several minutes Lenny is determined to exact his revenge by bringing his wife's killer/rapist because as he puts his inability to remember the act is irrelevant because his wife deserves justice.  Caught up in Lenny's world or perhaps Lenny in theirs are several different characters.  The motel worker that feels sympathy for Lenny, but not enough to keep him from charging him for an extra room because as he puts it business is slow and Lenny won't remember anyway.  The bartender (Natalie) who is caught up in a drug racket and is as quick to use Lenny and mock him as she is to help him.  Their is a particularly frustrating scene which illustrates this, in which Lenny is trying to find a pen so he can remember what she has said.  And of course Teddy who more than anyone pops in and out of Lenny's life.  Unfortunately Teddy is as close to a friend as Lenny gets to have in this story.  A truly interesting aspect of the story is the even more fragmented phone conversations Lenny has in which he reveals Sammy Jankus, a character who Lenny investigated who suffered from almost exactly the same condition Lenny does the only difference is he could not condition his instincts (according to himself Lenny can). As the story of Sammy unfolds we see a subplot that is as intriguing as anyone I can remember in recent film and as integral to understanding Lenny as Freud thinks our dreams are to understanding ourselves.  Unlocking the mystery of Sammy and why it is so important for Lenny to remember him sheds light on the whole situation.  In what is without a doubt the most important scene in understanding Sammy in the film and subsequently understanding Lenny we see that Sammy of course without being aware of it kills his wife as she reminds him at least three times over that she needs her insulin shot and as a result of the failed test she goes into a coma and dies.  So in understanding this scene we fully realize Sammy's problem.  Sammy who ends up in a mental institution and doesn't even realize that his wife is dead, loved his wife very much, but is incapable of saving her because of his mental infirmity.  Lenny's problem is the same, but reversed. Lenny loved his wife very much, but was incapable of saving her and as a result he develops almost the exact same infirmity as Sammy.  Whether Lenny's brain damage is a result of physical trauma (the blow to the head) or the psychological trauma of not being able to deal with the tragedy is arbitrary the condition remains the same.  Still at this point we have yet to fully realize the significance of the connection between Sammy and Lenny.  The connection is fully illuminated for us at the end if we are only paying close enough attention.  When Lenny goes to meet John G. or rather Jimmy Grantz (who Teddy has set up for a fall) Lenny asks, ""You Jimmy Grantz?""  Jimmy dryly replies, ""You expectin any other Jimmies out here memory man? (An obvious reference to Lenny's condition, but the only one in their conversation.)  After Lenny has done away with Jimmy he begins to feel guilty and thinks that perhaps he has killed the wrong man.  And here is the kicker he makes a statement that essentially says that he (Jimmy) knew about Sammy, how did he know about Sammy?  He even brings it up to Teddy when he arrives on the scene, but the fact is Jimmy never said anything to Lenny about Sammy or Sammy's condition, the only reference he made was to Lenny's condition. Sammy regardless of whether he is real or not is Lenny's alter ego, a personality that he has constructed and conditioned himself to remember so that he can deal with the situation.  The dream about Sammy's inability to save his wife when she puts him to the test is really a dream about Lenny's own guilt.  As Teddy points out later it is quite irrelevant whether Lenny's wife was a diabetic or not although she may have been.  The important points are (Most of which Teddy makes to Lenny) he doesn't know who he is only who he was, that Sammy in his condition will never be able to reconcile the guilt he feels over his wife's death, and that Lenny's memory while failing him in the short term has permanently failed him, in the long term it has shielded him- for what is there for Lenny to do once he has exacted revenge and brought this animal who killed his wife to justice?  Tragically and perversely what Lenny has conditioned himself to is revenge.  Revenge is what gives his life meaning, hope, purpose.  The revenge is never as sweet as he imagines and Lenny goes on conditioning and even manipulating his own mind so that he may remember those things he wishes to and forget those which he does not want to remember.  Never is this more obvious or conscious than at the end when Lenny's latent desire fully manifests itself.  In this final scene not only has he become aware of what he has been doing, not only has he accepted it, but he in fact rather enjoys it.  Why else would he choose to completely ignore it?  A man that truly wants to solve his wife's murder- to bring her killer to justice doesn't choose to completely rule out the possibility that he may have already done so, and at least makes a note of it so he can seriously investigate. Lenny if he really wanted to bring the killer to justice and resolve the situation would have raised those questions in a way that made sense and sought to answer them.  Lenny wants to be the searcher, the mourner, the vengeful husband he likes playing that role and telling those stories, it is only this that could fulfill him. Teddy says towards the end (at which point in filmic time he is still alive although in our memories if they have served us correctly tell us he is a dead man.) says, ""Lenny you're not a killer that's why you're so good at it.""  Don't be fooled.  Remember he wanted to forget.  Does Lenny truly feel guilty later?  Sure, but rather conveniently he can't remember why.",

In my opinion, the memory loss of the hero is not the physical memory that cannot be constructed. Just like the hero's decision on Sammy's illness in the fictional plot, Lenny himself is the real psychological memory loss. Maybe a lot of people feel sympathy for his misery, and to his seemingly visceral inner monologue, but in fact it's just by the fact that he can't understand is to kill his wife self-deception of psychological suggestion, in fact, in most cases, his memory only for ten minutes, but for some important things, but he can remember very clearly, even put those memories as before the onset of illness some memory, that is to say, Lenny can create or invent some memories, and that part of memory is not as his real experience after onset of illness and memory that lasts for 10 minutes, on the contrary will always exist, Even became the basis and motivation for his revenge.",

Christopher Nolan is just brilliant in the way he paces this movie, the scene transitions mean that the audience is up-to-date with the story as it goes, and the ending, the fascinating climax of what and why help drive this story into ""classic"" status.",

I have never seen a film that did this before. Aside from the storyline, the film has many great highlights. Good performances from Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano. Special effects are decent, though could be improved in some spots. Best parts are during the middle(of the movie running) when he talks about Sammy Jankis, and at the end of the movie, he finds out he's Sammy Jankis. Then there's the moments leading up to it, where Natalie(Carrie Anne Moss) tricks him into beating the crap out of Dodd. Anyways, great movie, go see it.",

This movie is put together so that you have no choice but to sympathize with the main character, since you are trying just as hard as he is to figure out what's going on! Acting is brilliant, plot twists are incredible and unexpected. We watched this movie and the moment it ended, watched it again. Try this out, we taped the movie onto VHS, starting with the last scene and watched it forward. Just amazing, they didn't take a single shortcut, you won't find any holes in this plot which is far more complex than most. See it...see it soon and see it often. 10/10",

The use of continually working backwards in time, ending each sequence where the previous began, is brilliant.  I'm sure I'm not the first to mention Hitchcock, but I'm sure he would applaud this film were he around.

This film is one true example, along with Requiem for a Dream and Crouching Tiger, that the oscars aren't a good meter of how good a film truly is.  Memento totally blows Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring out of the water.  The story possesses a great concept; how would you exact revenge on your wife's killer if you could only remember in 15 minute lapses?  Guy Pearce handles the part well by taking the role seriously and convincingly.  Definitely a film that requires repeated viewings, Memento is THE film noir of the new decade.",

As one of the few movies that has ever kept me guessing until the end it is one of those rare movies where once the novelty of the surprise ending has worn off, you can still watch it again.  The Game starring Michael Douglas has a great ending but after viewing the picture once, is the thrill still the same?

1070,15 August 2002,tyguy-2,8," complex, sometimes confusing, and worth repeat viewings","This movie has received rave reviews and falls into the same category as your Usual Suspects and to a lesser degree, Pulp Fiction.  The story is told in reverse fashion, like the Seinfeld episode a few years back when they went to India to see Elaine's friend get married and George didn't want to take his boots off and Kramer was hexed.  Anyway, the story involves a dude who has some sort of long term memory loss and can only remember things with Polaroid photos and notes that he's tatooed onto himself.  Like the Usual Suspects, we get swallowed up in the mystery, but here we are not so much wondering 'whodunit' as 'what is going on here.'  This works for 75% of the movie, but there are bits in the middle and the ending especially drag it down a notch.  I loved watching it, but at the end felt cheated.  Maybe it merits another look-see as I certainly got confused while watching it.  This is a good movie, but it's not one that you'll be raving about for years on end like Pulp Fiction. It lacks the style and snappy dialogue of that movie. Memento as a whole is very entertaining and one of the better movies you will find, but not quite 'great'.",

There are afew areas of the film that take a great stretch of the imagination to be believable, one area in particular where the main character is manipulated by a female just had way too many holes in it and hurt the entire feel of the film for me. I think the premise of the film was well done but the execution and direction could have been a lot better.

The way you start at the end and end at the beginning reminds me of the Red Dwarf book: Backwards, and the way this style of story-telling works in film is absolutely brilliant. It kept me guessing until the end. As soon as I'd finished it I wanted to watch it again, and not many films can say that! One of the most original films I have ever seen, and along with Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) and Sliding Doors, one of the few films that take a sci-fi theme (in this case; time running  backwards (at least for the viewer)) and use it to create a completely non-sci-fi movie.

1088,14 May 2001,Ace-33,5, Who killed Leonard's wife?,"It amazes me how many people praise this movie yet still don't get it and fail to grasp the full truth of the story. Because the plot is so complicated in the way it was presented it took my wife and I hours to figure out what really happened. Credit that to the director for having pulled off such an incredible and original movie.   ------WARNING***-----SPOILER AHEAD------------- I have read the last 80 comments on this board and not once did anyone observe that Leonard ALREADY had started his body tatooing before his wife died. In an extremely brief scene at the the end of the movie, Leonard is seen laying in bed half-naked with his wife with a few of his tatoos already on his upper chest. This lead me to the following conclusions. 1. Leonard's wife survived the intruders' attack, though Leonard himself suffered severe head trauma which leads to his handicap. 2. As a result of this affliction, Leonard begins tatooing his body, the results which are seen in the final bedroom scene with his wife. 3. Leonard himself kills his own wife with an insulin overdose and then transposes the deed to Sammy Jarkis. The 'real' Sammy never had a wife according to Teddy. Yet in order to justify his 'revenge', Leonard reminds himself that Sammy was a murderer.   4. Leonard is sent to a mental institution (according to the clues in the official website) and begins plotting the murder of the second assailant in his diary. He then escapes the institution and hooks up with Teddy who helps him find the assailant. Teddy photographs the blood-covered Leonard as a reminder of his nasty deed, knowing full well that Leonard will soon forget and continue his killing rampage. 5. Teddy takes advantage of Leonard's affliction and uses him to kill a drug dealer for monetary gains only to be outsmarted by Leonard when he realizes he was duped by Teddy.",

1099,21 November 2019,albinwagsater,7, Rewarding but overrated,To be honest this movie is not really that great. The only reason I like it is because your get the answer to all the questions you had and didn't had in the last 20 minutes. It feels rewarding and makes you feel smart in a way because you had thought of this way before you got it confirmed. But other than that the movie is pretty lame. Not many interesting characters and the story itself is no big mystery. I mean a mystery only gets weirder as time goes (Mulholland dr) but this is the other way around. WHICH IS WHY IT GET SO MUCH PRAISE. To be real people love to know whats going on. But they love being confused and THEN in the end get all the answers. I like this to so don't think im bashing anyone here. But my point is before that moment of truth this is really nothing. The deeper you go the more dragged in to it you get but I can't LOVE a movie because the ending is pleasing while the rest of the picture is bland. But I believe the whole backwards idea is cool. Its not hard at all to follow. If you don't understand this movie im sorry to tell but you may have a mental disability. Props to Nolan for being one of the best of this generation.,

1104,19 October 2004,alan_nicoll,9," Unique, challenging, and rewarding","Memento is a brilliantly conceived Chinese box puzzle of a movie. It tells of Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) who, due to a brain injury, is unable to form new long-term memories. Every time he wakes up he has to rediscover his life and his quest, based on notes, photographs, and tattoos he has created for the purpose. The movie starts at the end and works backwards--most scenes begin with Leonard gathering the threads of his life together. The next scene then shows how he got to the beginning of the last scene. It's an unsettling technique, but it is also a marvelous idea, because it puts the viewer in a similar situation to that of Leonard. When he wakes up, he doesn't know where he is, and we don't, either. This is a unique conception, and it makes a movie not to be missed. Unfortunately, it is also rather unsavory, full of violence and murder; but it also comes to a piquant and satisfying conclusion. It's only later that one begins to pick apart the logic. Not for all tastes, and some viewers will start completely lost and never figure out what the heck is going on. But for those up to its challenges, Memento is a unique viewing experience.",
1105,1 February 2022,jeremiahfuentes-33790,10, Review for Memento,"Just recently, I have started to get into mind bending movies that take the traditional way of telling stories and putting them through a fascinating layout. My first movie I had chosen to watch was made by a very well known director, Christopher Nolan, which is Memento. The movie follows a man with short term memory loss on a journey to find his wife's murderer, but that is sure to be the least interesting thing about the film. What struck me the most when watching the film was it's non-linear narrative. The film is laid out going back and forth in a sequences of the present and past. Doing this allows for the creation of suspense and feeling of unknowingness within the reader. The movie constantly has twists and turns that come unexpected because of its narrative and always keep us on our toes throughout the duration of the film. The writing and performances of the film were perfectly executed and set for the tone and feel of the movie. The performances allows us to actually dive into the world of the movie and most importantly believe that the story is real. Guy Pearce's performance is quite indistinguishable from real life, he gives such a believable performance that makes the watcher actually believe he has short term memory. The writing did a phenomenal job in keeping with the tone of the film, with making no out of place comments or words said by the characters to be acted out. It correctly orientated the characters to what they would say and/or do. I highly recommend watching this movie because of how intriguing and interesting it is which is displayed through the structure, writing, and performances. If you are like me and want to be thrown into a movie that calls for your brain to work and trying to understand the movie even after it is done with the credits, then this movie is for you.",

In brief, it follows the story of a man (Guy Pearce) who only wants to avenge his wife's murder and rape. The catch? He has short term memory loss, which means he cannot make any new memories of anything after 15 minutes, so he lives in fifteen minute segments, the only thing he has got is a polaroid camera, notes and tattoos of things to follow, in order to find the killer.

""Memento"" makes a poignant comment on the role emotion and prejudice play in the construction of memories.  By sequencing events in a finish-to-start chronology , ""Memento"" manages to envelope the audience in the same bewilderment that the main character (Guy Pearce of ""L.A. Confidential fame in a terrific performance) experiences while also playing on our emotions and prejudices.  We have to struggle to keep the plot straight, and as events prior to the ones we've just seen unfold, the assumptions we've made about the characters get challenged and the characters' actions take on new meaning.

The point of view is superb, giving us just a little more info with each scene, confusing the mind with a backwards timeline while suffusing the whole with a forward facing timeline shot through it, using black and white to delineate the ""right"" time line.

1150,9 May 2001,Jaimzay,10, A mystery of rare quality that actually holds some surprises,"""Memento"" featuring Guy Pearce (""L.A. Confidential"", ""Ravenous""), Carrie-Anne Moss (""The Matrix""), and Joe Pantoliano (""The Matrix"", ""The Sopranos"", ""Midnight Run"") is a superb murder mystery told in reverse. The main character (Pearce), whose wife was killed, investigates the evidence while handicapped with a condition that cripples his ability to make new memories.  As a result, he is living in a continuous flow of short-term memory that barely connects moments to each other.  To connect the evidence he collects and to trust it, he must make continuous notes which bear increasingly paranoid messages like ""DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE.""  Since we're connecting the dots backwards, we don't know any more about what's going on than he does.  This is the gambit on which the mystery hinges and it actually works beautifully.  The result is a film with continuous twists and surprises which allows you the joy and the puzzle of putting the entire story into context in your own mind.  Like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", it makes you want to see it again for clues you missed the first time around.",

Watching it a second time, I was able to catch (one of?) its near subliminal tricks, which pretty neatly confirmed what I'd concluded by the end of the first viewing. There's a minor incorrect detail: insulin is never even occasionally injected into a vein.  If I'm nit-picking, it's because otherwise I could find nothing to criticize.

These days many movies are like that, but not Memento. This is a very unique, from the way it was written, to the way it was taped, even to the way it was edited. It is a movie told backwards, in all sense of the meaning. You cannot understand the beginning without understanding the end, yet you cannot understand the end without the beginning. However, at the end of the movie, you do not go away with a feeling that something is missing, instead you get the majority of the movie, and you're are so excited to be able to say that, since most of the movie you were so confused, that you settle for the feeling that at least you got the basic idea behind the movie.",

1163,1 August 2001,joshuastephen4,10, A complex time-puzzle with brilliantly crafted characters,"When I first saw the preview for Memento, I thought, ""Wow, what a good cast and interesting concept!""  Then I saw the movie and thought, ""WOW, what a PHENOMENAL cast and INGENIOUS concept!""  The movie is about Leonard, a man with no short-term memory due to a violent ""incident"" in his past, and his search for the man who killed his wife.  To compensate for his very rare and odd handicap, he takes Polaroids of people and places he needs to remember and, for those truly necessary facts, tattoos them upon his body.  This alone would have held my attention throughout the movie, but director Christopher Nolan shoots the movie in segments starting at the end and working its way to the beginning.  Sounds pretentious, but it truly creates an environment where the viewer feels the confusion and struggle that Leonard feels.  This style of editing makes Memento's characters the hardest to decipher of nearly any movie I have seen.  The two main supporting characters are played wonderfully, brilliantly, powerfully, intelligently and eerily by Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliano.  Each plays a character with such varying motives and actions that the viewer cannot find the line between truth and manipulation.  The ending is a real kicker(don't worry, I won't spoil it) and I could spend a lot more time talking about this film, but I will leave it at this and simply say, ""One of the year's best...without a doubt!

The plot of the movie is impossible to describe in a few sentences - it is so much more than simply a murder mystery.  It is a movie unlike any I have ever seen; for instance, chronologically Memento begins at the end, and ends in the middle, while during the movie the plot jumps back and forth between the present and the past.  The central character of the movie, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), is in every scene.  It is Pearce's depiction of a man uncapable of forming new memories ever since his wife's death that carries the whole movie.

But somehow I made a review myself and thought about the whole plot. Actually, I had to admit: Its not I that got confused, Its Nolan that wanted me to get confused ! The whole thing is made up backwards to learn two things: First - imagine life as it could be, learn to love what you got - because somehow life can change and the only thing you rely on are pity emotions like revenge that provides your life with some sense. And second: Not everything really is, as it looks like on first view. You can adapt this interpretation for almost every situation of life - for example prejudices. And maybe you can also test yourself about how moral you are. Do YOU understand Leonards behavior if Teddy really tried to help him, by burning all the evidence for already killing the real murder but hunting instead Teddy as nothing in life worths than the sense for revenge? Or maybe do you even share this behavior? Or do YOU deny all of Leonards doing? Whatever it is, its all in your imagination.",

This movie has an interesting gimmick and is pretty amusing, but that is all. It is only good for two viewings. One to be surprised, and a second to review it and say ""hmm, that was pretty clever"". I don't think this fakes insights into humanity in so much as it has had them thrust upon it by it's rabid fans, who like to justify their worship with some deeper, albeit nonexistent meaning. This film throws out little morsels of meat to that crowd for them to chew on rather than offering a whole meal of an actual moving experience.

I have read reviews of the nominations, and most of them said that Memento was excluded for being ""gimmicky"".

Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to ""Memento"" is ""The Usual Suspects"" from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in ""Memento.""",

However, it seems to me that this is one of those movies that, upon additional viewings, becomes less substantial rather than more substantial.  That's because the development of the characters is rather limited and the various twists of plot, done so cleverly, nonetheless fall prey to inconsistency and, eventually, little more than melodrama.  There are any number of problems with plausibility that, in the end, cannot be overlooked because of the film's reliance on its regressively expanding unravelling/complication of plot, and there's not enough in the development of the characters to rescue it from the corner(s) into which it paints itself.

Honestly, I can't think of a better way to use editing to create empathy than this. It's hard to imagine just how difficult it would be to have Leonard's condition...until you see it on the screen and realize just what that poor fool would have to deal with, solving a murder and not being able to remember anything about it.

I need it to watch ""memento"" 3 times to puzzle out all the small things in this movie. Main character of the movie is fashionably looking Leonard. He is chasing the guy that killed his wife. The only thing that really gets in his way of looking the murderer, is that he's having short term memory loss. It means that Leonard is forgetting everything he done in a last couple of hours. So he uses all sorts of pictures, notes and tattoos to help himself. Offcourse its much easier to manipulate that kind of guy... The main thing that makes this movie epic is that it has 2 story lines. One of them ( that is in black and white) is telling normally, but the another is telling backwards. It means that things u will see later in the movie have happened before the thing u saw in the beginning. Director Christopher Nolan have tried to do something like that in the movie ""The prestige"". So in the end of the movie two story lines are combining into one event that explains all the movie. In my opinion Memento is a great movie whit good acting and directing. If u are watching this movie first time it may get a little confusing at the beginning, but then u will figure it all out.",

There is literally nobody that I have shown this movie to who didn't immediately like the plot- structure(and I have shown it to quite a number of people). The movie goes backwards and basically starts with the end, a murder. You then consistently go back in Leonard's memories, always rewinding a piece as if you actually were the protagonist himself. The best thing about this is: You never know what happened previously, just like Leonard doesn't. You have to figure. That's what makes this an incredibly good movie on it's own right, the creative story telling and the integration of Leonard's condition of not knowing anything that previously happened.

Christopher Nolan is one the best directors to emerge from the 21st century. As an aspiring director it's great too see that Nolan can make a brilliant indie classic like Memento and then do great big budget commercial films like Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight and not loose any credibility, in fact I think The Dark Knight probably earned him more respect even though he had a huge budget for it. The Movie has it's little holes, but I get passed it because it so creative in every way, especially in it's structure of storytelling and narrative similar to Taxi Driver. The film has a noir feel to it which I love. It asks questions about satisfying our needs emotionally by lying too ourselves and I think shows how the need for revenge can be taken advantage of by other people. Nolan's favorite films are Cinatown, Blade Runner, Lawrence Of Arabia, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Armed only with the tattoos on his body (as a way of reminding him who he is and details about the murderer) and a pistol, he stakes out a town with the help of his friend Teddy, searching for the mysterious John or James G. While the plot may sound a bit traditional, the presentation is anything but. The story is essentially told in reverse, in order to imitate the feeling of short-term memory loss. While there are little snippets here and there that are told in forward motion, that is only for the sake of continuity when the character reveals his background. Everything else is told in reverse. For most of the movie, you are lost, like this man, caught in a perpetual state of disbelief and confusion. However, as the forward clips and the reverse clips intersect, the story comes together completely. For a movie that ends with what is technically the middle, it has an unbelievable twist. The dialogue is thought-provoking and clever, the direction is flawless, and Guy Pearce gives, in my opinion, his best performance ever. Go and see Memento",

Memento is also the kind of film that once you think you have it figured out tears your predictions to shreads. On top of the top notch acting (Pearce, Moss, and Pantoliano all at their best), Memento is driven by your own psychological interest in the plot.

It said something like, ""It's when he kills that we feel most sorry for him"".  Well Memento's backwards approach doesn't give us that context immediately, but towards the end it has sunk in just how sad this story really is.  In some ways they are alike; stories about people who have little in the way of identity, only iron clad purpose and desire.  They don't know who they are, but they're fairly certain where they have to go (even if deluded on that front as well).  Stories about the manufacturing of truth. ",

The main character has short term memory loss, can remember things before the accident, but everything after, he can only remember for a few minutes. He tries everything he can to remember things, from taking Polaroid pictures of where his apartment is to tattooing messages to himself on his body. The story was a very intriguing one all by itself, but the way the film was presented was even better. I don't think I have ever seen a movie do such a good job of making the audience feel like they couldn't remember anything either.

Some of the films detractors say there are plot holes in it. But I think most of them can be explained away be the human condition (people in the movie making dumb decisions and forgetting things).

Its about a man named Leonard who uses notes, pictures, and the tattoo's on his body to try and find the man who he thinks raped and killed his wife. Not too often do you have movies that start from the end of the movie and finish at the beginning using multiple jump cuts, giving you more information each time but also going back farther from the beginning scene. Within the first five minutes a guys head gets blown off and you have no idea why. The reason why i thought this movie was so great was that throughout the movie you are trying to put all the pieces together just as Leonard is. You feel like your in his shoes throughout the entire movie which keeps the audience enticed. I thought it was great in the end finding out that he had actually already killed the man who killed his wife but it never stuck with him, so to make it stick he just changed the details to be remembered as if his friend Teddy Gammel did it because him and the killer have the same last name.",

Christopher Nolan teases the viewer throughout, challenging us. The realization about what really happened with him and his wife just knocks you socks off (if you're wearing socks).

And because of his condition he takes Polaroids and gets tattoos of what he wants to remember. The only thing I didn't like about the film was it (ironically) required memory as the story was told in an odd way, with the colour bits going backward in time e.g if at the start of the first one they said 'what are you doing . . .' at the end of the next one they'd say 'what are you doing . . .' and with the black and white bits going forward in time before they eventually met at the end of the film. Although it was a little inconvenient to remember everything that had happened it was a very interesting and clever was to tell the story as things you thought were true throughout the film were made lies as you learnt more. The story wasn't too hard to follow as long as you were paying attention and the acting was amazing. I really liked how it made you question things while you watching it. Overall a fantastic film, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a not too complicated Nolan film/a very interesting look into how memory is not the most reliable thing in the world/a person just wanting an amazing film.",

I know this film was made a while back but the backward story telling or puzzle story telling has been done before. Many have sighted Pulp Fiction.

1272,15 March 2017,harleyneiditz,7," A brilliant, unique, frustrating film.","Memento concerns Leonard Shelby, (a great performance by Guy Pearce) a man who suffers from short term memory loss. This leaves him unable to form new memories. Director Christopher Nolan puts us inside the mind of Leonard by giving the film a non-linear structure. This brilliant choice is at times a double edged sword. The non- linear time-line makes the viewer as clueless as Leonard Shelby. We don't know what has happened, when it happened, etc. I give Nolan chops for making that choice. I think it gives Memento its unique quality. On the other hand, the jumping back and forth does not allow Leonard Shelby to develop as a character. As I think more about this, it is actually brilliant. As a character who cannot form new memories, there is no reason for Leonard to have a character arc. The audience member is deprived of the same things as Leonard: closure, understanding, relief. This is definitely a film to see more than once. I bet that I will appreciate it more after viewing it another time. Meanwhile, watch, enjoy, and go along for the ride.

1273,26 November 2001,bobbie-12,9, incredible sensation of memory loss!,The movie evokes an uncanny simulation of memory loss for the viewer by the clever way in which the narrative is organized. It shows us how our identity is based on memory; when we lose our memory we completely lose our sense of self and our anchoring in reality. The story (apart from some of the crime stuff) is based on real cases of memory loss like the ones described by neurologist Oliver Sacks. Most people I know watched it at least twice.

1275,12 May 2005,jacktle,9," if we can't trust our own memory, what can we trust? - ""SPOILER""","Christopher Nolan is relatively new to directing, but created a smash hit with Memento. This film is puzzling to audiences all over the world, and no one can really grasp all of its detail without a second viewing. Memento explores a variety of themes such as self-deception, existentialism, truth and the capacities of our memory. In route of exploring these themes, Nolan is able to play with the very structure of the film and what the audience has come to understand. The main highlight that separates this film from many others is the use of time. This reverse order that is shown to the audience works to put the viewer in the shoes of the main character, Leonard. They live and see what he sees. Viewers only know the events that have just unfolded on the scene and do not know what led to it. This is an elaborate gimmick that significantly gets the audience worked up and makes them question more about what they saw and what does it mean. For instance, only seeing a main get shot in the head will make viewers wonder what lead to that ultimate crime. On the other hand, seeing a man with a gun pointed to his head, they can conclude that he will get shot in the head and so the viewer is already speculating what will happen. This same trail of thought can be observed elsewhere in society. When we meet new people, we see them in the current state of time. We do not know their past, but often wonder what led to the creation of this person that we come into contact with. Where did he/she come from? What has he/she done until this time? Even after getting to know a person, how are we to be certain that what they say is the truth? So the viewer, the reverse chronological order can be seen as normal. It's just the same process they go through in ordinary life, only highlighted in this film. Of the many themes, existentialist ideas can be found throughout the film. The striving idea behind existentialism is that existence precedes and rules essence and that humans have free will and are the ultimate judge. It also states that since we are the bear sole responsibility for our decisions and actions, we must also face the consequences. Leonard's decision to deceive himself can be understood similarly. He choose to give his life meaning, by sending himself on a wild goose chase leading towards this Teddy character. He is fully aware of what he's doing, and only in that moment, because he will have forgotten all about it later. We are never certain as to who Teddy was or even what he was doing with Leonard, but we see that Leonard is exercising his freedom and will face the situation of murder. After forgetting that he had deceived himself, he kills Teddy, and now he's faced the ramification of deceiving himself only ten minutes ago. Another scene that alludes to existentialist ideas is during the narration, Leonard makes the remark that, ""The world does not disappear once we close our eyes."" This follows the notion that with our death or unconsciousness, life does not come to a stop. Human existence continues to be. It follows the idea that there is no higher being and that we exist purely for that reason and that we make of it what we do and decide, and so after you close your eyes, life continues on with whatever decisions or actions you've made. If Leonard closes his eyes, it would not change the fact that he killed Teddy and that fact will still be there after he opens his eyes. It can also be said that we live a very fragmented life. Our society today has evolved into short snippets of sounds and visuals seen on television and the radio. We can never have a complete certainty over any of what we encounter each day. The truth remains hidden by the media. When we watch television, it's only a representation of what really happened, such as images of a crash, we don't know when, how, or why it happened. But we take it without question, the details that are given to us on the screen by the anchorman. We can only have truth in what we experience directly. In the case of Memento, we can only be certain of the live events that take place in color. Its fragmented order reflects how our lives too are in pieces. Only once we placed everything in the order we want will we get a message. It's possible to get more than just one message with different placements of order. For Memento, it's not just any order, it's specifically reverse chronological order. And so we get one concrete idea or theme. Other films such as Pulp Fiction have fragmented order, but not chronological or reverse chronological order. And so they would have a more open-ended theme that will bend and flex with the viewer that perceives it. The film also questions the reliability of our memories. It has been a well known fact that the human memory can be inaccurate and very subjective. Eyewitness accounts usually aren't enough in the court systems and can obscure the truth. Our memories can drastically alter the truth as implied by Leonard, ""Memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of your car."" In the case of this film, the viewer must decide whether or not Leonard's memories can be trusted, since he is the one with a long-term memory dysfunction. Nolan's fresh style has won over most of the viewers of Memento. Its unique approach to time is, without a doubt, innovative. The plot is kept relatively simple which helps focus on the main idea of timing.",

The film is by my standards (which are pretty cynical I'm told) a modern masterpiece. Everything about this film is delivered in great detail, from the colour schemes to the cinematography. Nolan gets the structure spot on, if he twists it too much, it becomes wrapped up in so many layers it becomes uninjectable, too little and it becomes pointless and weak. The characters are brilliantly written, even if the dialogue at times is a little pretentious. Pearce and Pantoliano are both excellent and Carie Ann Moss is annoying, which is a shame, but excusable. I would advise anyone who wants to see a truly compelling, unpredictable, thought provoking film to see this, because it is worthy of the top 10 films ever made. And plus, it is far better then The Godfather:Part 2.",
1279,10 July 2007,Mark1988,9, Mind Bending Suspense!,I can't think of a word to describe Memento. What is entirely original and delightfully complicated? 'Intricate' is a complete understatement in the case of this film. Memento simply grabs the viewer by the throat with these two elements. You'll be astounded by the nuances in the plot and puzzled by the unique way in which the story is assembled.,
1280,15 August 2004,mbiajc,9, By far the most creatively made movie I have ever seen.,"Simply amazing. I will admit that it has little redeeming quality message wise, but the film is superbly made, and is really an original creative work of art. I cannot even begin to fathom the technical complexities of writing a script chronologically from two points in time, having the story work from those two points toward each other until they meet in the middle, and make all of it make sense only then, and yet manage to build suspense and keep peoples' interest up to that point. Simply stunning acting on the parts of Carrie Ann Moss and Guy Pierce, and just enough comedy to keep it from being as dark as it could have been. The plot twists keep changing everything you already knew, and there are plenty of moments where you think, oh...so he did that because....oh. It is quite a roller coaster of a film and comes off artistically as about a nine out of ten.",

1286,31 October 2010,swankej,4, Not the most terrible but far from good.,"Watch this movie only if you absolutely have nothing better to do for two hours. The storyline contains an interesting idea but is portrayed in a boring predictable manner. The characters are as dull as the writing. I found it near impossible to relate to any of the characters as they are flat and emotionless, it felt like I wasn't even watching real people. I was disappointed in Guy Pearce's performance and a little surprised that Joe Pantoliano's character was the best part of this movie but it was not enough to make it a good film. I feel like the movie had to run in reverse otherwise it wouldn't be worth watching at all. The stability of the plot is constantly contradicting its self and is at times way over complicated. The flashbacks and narration really seem to distract from the story, not that it's that believable anyway with its lack of continuity. Since the events play out in reverse you already know what is going to happen and that completely eliminates any suspense. I believe with a better script and character development this movie could have been a lot better. I personally enjoyed the short story much better and wish the movie was more like the that. Definitely read the short story.",

Christopher Nolan directed the neo noir type film which grossed over 40million dollars. The film is about a guy called lenny who's wife got killed and now his motive is to kill ""john g"" in the film john g could potentially be made up and that he killed him a long time ago hid friend teddy explains this to him in the film but he seems not believe it at all so lenny is living in a kind of a circular narrative as what he does is in a circle. Moreover, the narrative for the film memento is fabula and sujet which is where the film starts all together but the takes two different paths in time as in the film when the scenes are in coloured frame its in the present and the black and white scenes are in the past. In my opinion I feel like the movie lets the audience kind have their own opinion's about it. Furthermore, the audiences who will enjoy this are people who like to put things together.

He befriends Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) & Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) to help him carry out his deed: Kill the man who murdered his wife. Definitely the most riveting crime thriller in years, and easily the best movie of 2000/2001.

1302,5 May 2001,iamlarsx,10, A Good Brain-scramble,"I really liked Memento the first time I saw it, but knew that the real test of a movie like this is if it holds up on a second viewing.  I'm pleased to say it does.  With the attendant hype, most everyone knows enough about the plot to forgo rehashing it here.  But I must urge those who have seen it to give it another viewing:  so many little lines and situations have such resonance when you know all the movie's secrets (which I won't spoil).  It is most interesting on second viewing to pay close attention to the characters of Natalie and Teddy, as they are the most inscrutable; while they still have great mystery and complexity, it's fun--knowing what you know the second time around--to watch their brains click along and get a better grip on their motives.  And not trying to sort out the mystery gives one a better opportunity to savor Guy Pierce's subtle, amazing performance; he is strangely pragmatic about his situation, yet infused with sadness.

The reverse chronology always keeps you guessing, as you play out the plot in your mind again and again. This is a thinking man's movie to be sure. My only negatives would be that it is quite dark and disturbing in its subject matter, with a lot of tension that some might find hard to deal with. But this ranks up there with the likes of Fight Club and The Usual Suspects in my book. Drop everything and see this now or buy the DVD when it's eventually released!",

It's not as complicated as it sounds and it really flows together nice so even the lesser intelligent watchers can follow the plot. Guy Pearce does an amazing job and he has the perfect voice for a fast talking, intelligent man who has to get things done fast so he doesn't forget.

1334,5 January 2018,troyhoch,10, One of my all-time favorites,"Memento"" in my opinion is legendary director Christopher Nolan's best film I have ever seen, and one of my favorite films of all time. The film commands multiple viewings, as one does not pick up everything from only one watch. Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man coping with short-term memory loss and centers his life around his need to avenge his wife's death. ""Memento"" contains one of the most dazzling scripts of any movie I have ever seen, and also contributes amazing acting performances by almost all actors involved. The story is extremely difficult to understand as obvious time shifts occur, and it is only up to the viewer to keep up (scenes being in color and shifts to scenes being in black and white). It's definitely a mystery and is in the 4th gen of film noir. I would call it art, and I would call it unprecedented, but those not willing to fully engage themselves into a confusing watching experience will dislike it completely. ""Memento"" is an unforgettable journey through a man's mind.",

Increasingly films like this make me feel less and less empathy with the characters. It gets to the point where in films like red planet you want them to be killed off - quickly please.,
1336,10 January 2022,CJ_Hayward,1, Asked for a Refund,"I remember renting this movie for ""family movie night"" from Blockbuster video when it first came out back in 2000. My father was so mad that he went to Blockbuster and demanded a refund because the movie ""was broken and not filmed in the correct order"" lol. They did go ahead and give him his money back. This was the first and only time he ever asked for a refund. The only other time I've ever seen him mad about a movie rental was 2010's Burlesque starting Cher. I recently tried to watch this movie again and could not get through 30 minutes before wanting to poke my eyes out with a pitch fork. I understand that people think this movie is original but I think the concept is absolute garbage. I hate when a movie starts with the ending and then says something like ""48 hours earlier"". This is basically that concept on crack. No thank you. I am in the minority and not a fan of 95% of Christopher Nolan's films. Inception, hate dream sequences in movies, a whole movie based on this idea, nope. Tennant couldn't get through an hour, boring and you literally need subtitles to hear what people are saying. Interstellar, love space science fiction, beautiful movie sooo boring. I'm not sure why everyone loves his movies so much. He makes beautiful movies that are beyond boring. I would rather watch burlesque.",
1337,8 April 2001,Snoogins,10, This movie is great.,"I have been waiting to watch Memento since I first saw a review for it on Ebert and the Movies, but it wasn't playing at any of my local theatres. This is one of the most stylish, interesting, and well-done movies I have ever seen.  I don't know of any movies that I could really compare it to.  I suppose that if you liked The Game, you will love Memento.  It is similar to The Game in terms of the way the story seems to lead you towards one conclusion then suddenly, and continually, throws a new twist at you.  The story is told in an unconventional manner in terms of chronology.  It begins at the end, and over the course of the movie it alternately flashes back and progress towards the middle.  This seems like the best way to show the viewer the way Leonard experiences his life since his accident.  This is a movie that could probably be watched three times consecutively without being able to grasp everything that has unfolded. This movie is about... It does a excellent job of showing how fragile our memories really are.  After watching half the movie, how clearly do you remember about the first five minutes?  As the story progresses, previous events get a little hazier, harder to recall clearly... I was so excited about this movie that I kept going to the website (www.otnemem.com) to find out about it.  Now that I've seen the movie, I realize that the website is really not about the events that happen during the movie, rather it's an extension of the movies' story into the past and the future.  It gives more insight into what has been going on with Leonard since his injury.  I'd recommend to anyone who has seen the film to check it out.  I was confused about a few things by the end of the movie, and if I had to make any complaint about this film, I actually wish the movie was longer.  The story is so engrossing that I wouldn't mind sitting through another hours' worth of film for more insight into Leonard's condition.  Now I'm going to have to try and wait patiently for Memento to come out on DVD. Please make it a special edition with at least a director's audio commentary.",
1338,12 June 2001,skoghee,6, Overrated.,"On the twelfth position in the top 250 of the IMDB I noticed a rather new movie that I hadn't seen yet nor heard from called MEMENTO. After reading some of the reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It is never good to expect a masterpiece when you go see a movie, but the least I expected from this one was that it was going to be pretty damned good ! Unfortunately MEMENTO, for me, didn't live up to its expectations . The attempt to be original by twisting and turning the sequences in my eyes only had an effect in the scene where Guy Pearce hits Carrie-Ann Moss. The rest of the film is rather dull, you wait for a climax that never comes. Many critics will disagree with me but just a six out of ten will do for me.",

It will definitely require multiple viewings to piece it together. However, unlike ""The Lost Highway"", this one can actually make sense. Throughout the course of the movie I found myself fully immersed in this tormented man's world, trying to figure things out along with him, as if I was suffering from memory loss. They let you see just enough to understand, but not enough to make it obvious. Not only is this movie thought provoking and intelligent, it is quite funny, bordering on hilarious at times. The possibilites for humor are endless when a person on a manhunt has short term memory loss. Put it all together and you have an incredible movie, a definite 10.",
1347,20 August 2001,Aeth,6, A string of pearls ...,"This interesting movie is about a man who can only remember stuff that happens within a minute due to an accident he had when some rapists were molesting his wife. The story shows us a man on a quest to revenge the death of his wife, but with a twist!  The movie moves backwards in time although the sequential series of events that progress in clusters are in a normal timeframe moving forwards in time.  This way of telling a story opens up the narration in such a way that new perspectives and surprises revels themselves at the beginning of each new cluster, thus creating a deeper understanding of the previous cluster / action. There seems to be a metatheme in this movie.  The main character was a detective for an insurance company before his accident.  Now the whole movie seems to follow the path such a detective would go by when investigating. Namely, starting out with the crime itself and working backwards untill the person who did it and the motive is found. This movie might also allude to the current state of our historical science, showing that memory, and especially history can be tampered with and changed (especially in the hands of less morally founded individuals).  Thus one might even say it is a profound criticism of the all objectivity. Basically though, this is a thriller about manipulation in its different shapes and forms, and how people use each others weaknesses to outwit each other and sometimes even themselves....",

1363,18 February 2007,kdogsho,5, summary,"This show, Memento, is a very hard one to understand. It doesn't come out and say what is happening in that point in time. It does a lot of flashbacks to what happened a days ago, or sometimes even hours ago. Leonard has this condition that he can't make new memories. I think these changes in time are his memory, and it is showing us the memory he is trying to produce. When it changes that means that he had lost that memory. Also, this show keeps your mind wondering. It doesn't show us the bad guys and who he is looking for, it just shows us people as we normally see them. Such as Natalie when she appears to be a good person, then you realize that later on she is using his sickness against him to kill someone. The conclusion to this show was a real thinker, because it made you think about everything that the main character has been telling us throughout the movie. Just like when Teddy said that Sammy didn't have a wife, that it was his own wife that had diabetes. It made you think that it was possible that this was himself killing his own wife by giving her to many shots and putting her into a coma. Or, could Teddy be lying about every?",

The screenplay is simply unique. However, this is no gimmick - having watched the movie in chronological order (thanks to the wonders of DVD) I am convinced that the story holds its own even without Nolan's remarkable narrative structure.

Add that with slick direction and a cool soundtrack and you got one of the best films of 2000, if not the decade.  Many people say this is nothing but a gimmick picture, which I don't think is right at all.  By telling the story the way it does, you have the chance to come to conclusions that you might not have if the movie was told from scene 1 on.

1367,15 September 2015,Whas,10, Mind-blowing!,"This is the typical movie where you have to pay attention to every detail! I really like the way the story is told, even more than the plot itself! It put you in the situation where you, like the main character, are not able to view the entire story in one single line. You are confused as long as you watch the movie, and you are even after. But then you got the occasion to put all the pieces together, rather than Leonard! I would like to try to put those pieces together now, discovering the real meaning of the movie, so if you haven't watched ""Memento"" yet, stop reading this! His wife was really raped by two bad guys, but she survived. He develops a psichiatric condition, and he can no longer remember new things. The wife is diabetic, and tests him by letting him inject her a lot of insulin. If you paid attention, there is a scene where he's preparing insulin, between one of those where the famous Sammy is doing it. And, in the end, we can see his wife hugging Leonard while his chest is nude, and he has the tattoo ""he raped my wife etc"". For this, he was moved to a psichiatric clinic. He could not live anymore realizing what he did to his wife, because he remembers, as long as his condition is mental (yes, it's a real disease, but he phisically can store new memories), so he invents a puzzle where John Q. killed his wife in Leonard's last memory: the rape. Freddy is the cop to whom the case of the rape was assigned. He starts helping Leonard, giving him the files records etc. Lenny finally kills the man who raped his wife, but then continues to manipulate his own memories! He put away 12 pages of the records, deletes many sentences etc. Freddy now decides to use Leonard to kill people, to become rich, because the main character won't remember anything. But Natalie understands what's going on, and helps Lenny to kill Freddy, in order to avenge her boyfriend. Leonard itself wanted to kill Freddy, because he told him the truth, and he can't hold it.",
1368,6 August 2011,pacifist_parsi,9, I think that it is classical,"I think the film Memento fell under the Formalist editing style. To start off, the cuts from one shot to another were very sharp. They went right from one to another, no fade out. Also, the way they went from the present to old memories, was constantly changing. Since it changes from color to black&white, it created an opposite conflict of time. Lastly, the story created many different view points and stories. This came from the unreliable narrator, and also from the unreliable people who used him throughout it. It made you think throughout the film and was very thematic as well.",

Obviously, the plot structure is the most notable part of this work. While the majority of the audience found it confusing and nonsensical, I thought it was perfect. You didn't have to think until you were exhausted, but it did require the audience to pay attention all the way through. The ending was somewhat predictable. I figured out that Leonard was actually Sammy Jenkins when Teddy said (for the second time) ""That's who you were, but who are you now?"" It made me realize that his story corresponds perfectly to that of Sammy's. It just makes me question the validity of the movie as a whole. What really happened? How do we know? Is there any way to tell? Even if we watch the movie in ""order"", with all the color pieces in their chronological sequence, would the movie be different?

1376,1 December 2015,Leem4004,9, How a low-budget indie should be done.,"Disregard its mind-bending profundities about the nature of memory and existence and what it means to be human. Even if all these things were willfully ignored and Memento were simply reduced to an architectural blueprint, it would still be akin to watching Bobby Fischer play chess, seeing the board several moves ahead of his opponent. It's an exhausting experience just to keep up-be sure to arrive on time and stay seated until the credits roll-but for Nolan to dream up a scenario this complex and yet work it out so thoroughly seems almost inconceivable. His story marries two high concepts that would be baffling enough on their own, let alone together. Traumatized by his wife's rape and murder, Guy Pearce suffers from a rare neurological disorder called anteriograde amnesia that prevents him from creating any new memories. Basically, the world as he understood it 10 minutes ago has evaporated from his mind without a trace. In order to exact revenge on his wife's killer, Pearce has devised an elaborate system of tattoos, Polaroids, note cards, and file folders to help him piece together the facts. He also has to uncover the possible ulterior motives of shady ally Joe Pantoliano and a sullen bartender played by Carrie-Anne Moss. To further complicate matters, Nolan begins with the end and ends with the beginning, so the action takes place in overlapping fragments that move backwards in time. On top of all that, he inserts black-and-white scenes of Pearce on the phone in his motel room, telling the harrowing story of a fellow amnesia sufferer he met in his days as an insurance claims investigator. Memento has endless fun playing with hiccuping time and ephemeral memory: In one of its funniest scenes, Pearce wonders if he's being chased or giving chase; in one of its most suspenseful, he scrambles to find a pen before he forgets a person's diabolical abuses. For a while, Nolan's twin gimmicks seem to exist solely for clever gamesmanship, like the achronology in his low- budget neo-noir debut, Following. But the astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely, unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it.",

I daresay (though there is not much risk involved) I will not see a better movie this year, and I say this even with my excitement over the upcoming ""AI"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring.""  ""Memento"" is a remarkably complex, beautiful, blistering, masterpiece of a movie.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone everywhere in the world.  I am not even going to comment on the plot, because I think you should go in totally fresh as I did and willing to take an active interest in the movie.  This is not your typical popcorn machine movie, where the plot is easy enough that you can fall asleep through half of it and still know what's going on.  ""Memento"" transcends what going to the movies is all about: its complexity and method of storytelling make it almost some kind of a revolutionary audience participation spectacle.  It's twists and turns are not gimmicky like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Fight Club"" but gradual and calculated.  I can not possibly sing this movie's praises enough, so now I am going to give a word to its detractors: LEARN TO THINK AT THE MOVIES.  Stop watching Candycorn Crap like ""Bring it On"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" and invest in a movie that has ideas and wants to challenge you.",

1384,10 October 2001,x-tothez,10, A movie with some pizazz!,"Its about time people that make movies actually got a clue. All these ""great"" directors, and most of them suck.

Film makers make movies to bring in revenue, so they can buy a house in Cali, buy a lot of Cocaine and percocets, and have sex with beautiful women. The typical hollywood cat. I don't care how good an actor is, if the movie sucks, it sucks. bottom line. So heres the deal, once in a great while a director comes along and says I am going to CREATE a movie that is intriguing, mysterious, and very mind-engaging to view. Noyce (director) did this with Memento. This movie is astoundingly good. The characters are all screwed up, and very human. Carrie-ann Moss (chick from Matrix) is in it and actually plays the role of a true female human, a bitch. This is great. If you have not seen this movie then go and see it. It is definately worth the money. You will NEED to see it again. I did.",

One, you will understand it, and that realisation when it comes will put a huge smile on your face, as when the movie plays, (and it does play backwards in segments that link together) you start to figure it out. The other is that it has no resemblance to The sixth sense whatsoever. When it comes to plot twists, i would compare it more to The usual suspects. What we have here is a truly unique movie, one that cannot be faulted in any department, which, due to the nature of the story, will have you on tenterhooks til its closing (or opening) frame. I simply cannot recommend this movie enough, and if you feel im not writing much on its story its because its hard to talk about the plot without giving it all away, and it IS better if you figure it out for yourself.

I agree that it would be just an average movie if told forwards; I think that's part of the point.  Seeing it through the eyes of a man with no short term memory is what's really interesting.  I think if it was told forwards it would've been more of a comedy; everything's being spelled out for Leonard but he can't remember a thing.  We'd probably feel like most of the other characters feel.  As it is, we're just as confused as Leonard, and it's great.  This was a blissfully original movie; I give it a 10.",

This is one of the most cleverly edited films I have ever seen.  The approach that director Christopher Nolan takes to tell us the story is the films strongest suit.  This is not to say that the film is short in other aspects.  The cinematography is superb.  The actors deliver virtually flawless performances.  The score is never overpowering yet facilitates the feel of the scenes as they unfold.  The dialogue is intelligent and provoking.  The action is never boring with its stark transitions working to an integral purpose.,

It's well made, but suffers mainly from being too cryptic.  I'm not a stupid person, but I can't imagine anyone with an IQ of only 100 being able to figure out what's going on and therefore to enjoy it.  (I'm sure the viewers who gave it a ""10"" will be duly flattered.) By the time the movie ends, you have a wonderful idea of what it must be like to lack short-term memory -- the director and editor did an outstanding job here -- but as a viewer you are still owed a denouement, and what you get isn't complete; there are yet a few unresolved facts that gnaw at you. Furthermore, the plot is grisly.  A person with the protagonist's problem could be pursuing an entirely different quest.  Which gets me to the last point:  the scenes of violence were more gratuitous than necessary; they didn't strengthen the plot.  If you really like to work hard while watching a movie, or if you enjoy something out of the mainstream, this one's for you.  It's ""out there"".",

1417,16 October 2002,ckjabroni,9, can you say director on the verge of becoming a legend?,"Here is the deal with Memento. Some viewers feel it is a film that doesn't deserve its rank of #10 on the top 250 films of all time. My response to all those who say that: huh? This is a film that will withstand the test of time simply because there was never a movie before to walk through a story like this one did. These same people would probably also say movies such as, ""Man With A Movie Camera"", or ""Nanook Of The North"" were fads and people would forget about them in a few years. WRONG! Here is a fact for you, when a movie starts a genre, it never dies. Memento started a genre of style of film that will infinitely live on simply because other directors will try to mimic Nolans style in this flick at least to some extent. Films like this cannot be praised enough, because these movies in forty years will be watched by our grandchildren and great grandchildren and even they will be appreciative of it. Guy Pierce in this film is the classic example of an actor that is truly terrible, and has the same exact style in every single movie he ever makes and because of the character, he totally pulls it off! Carrie-Ann Moss is stellar as she is in every movie she does, and deserved at least a best supporting nod for this. Joe Pantoliano also puts in a tremendous acting job, could be considered his best to date. hmmm 2 matrix actors...Other great performances in this were put in by Mark Boone Junior and Stephen Tobolowsky. On top of a great cast where supporting actors are as good as anything, the movie style by Nolan is legendary. Nolan had already made an amazing film in ""Following"", and after ""Memento"", did a tremendous job with his third film ""Insomnia"", the man is on pace to be one of the greatest directors of our time, and also possibly of all-time! This film can be easily understood after 1 time through if you actually think, and has replay value, but unlike movies like ""Fight Club"", the replay value does run out, which is why it gets a 9/10 instead of a perfect score.

All I knew was it was about a man with no short term memory. So pretty much this movie is about a dude that forgets everything that has happened like a minute or two later. And all you skeptics that think this is just a stupid story and nobody has this condition, your wrong. This is a real condition some people have mostly due to a blow in the brain, that messes with your short term memory, leaving that person unable to make any new memories, although all his old memories are still there. Anyways this dude cant remember 2 minutes ago throughout this movie. Trust me its a trip. This guy is trying to find out who killed his wife and left him with this horrible condition only for his own revenge, and as the plot unravels it will leave u wondering whats gonna happen next, or whats happened already or something like that. Trust me if you watch the movie you will know what Im talking about. All in all this movie was a hell of a thriller, leaving u watching with ur full attention.

1420,2 January 2011,jordnthoms,7, A Dome Rumbler,"Leonard Shelby wakes each morning to find that he can't remember anything past the date he and his wife were attacked in their home. During the attack, he received permanent brain damage and is unable to store short-term memory. Memento is a film depicting his journey to track down and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. You experience the movie just Leonard Shelby experiences life -- unable to draw on the past to determine how to perceive the present. Shelby is often confused and disoriented, but his drive to track down his wife's murderer gives him the ability to act on instinct and a few small notes and tattoos. The story itself is an incredible one, and you will certainly enjoy it. The telling of the story engages the brain in a unique way. As the film progresses, the viewer finds the information being presented explains scenes from earlier in the movie -- because the movie is presented basically in reverse. This style is similar to Pulp Fiction, but rather than a loose correlation of characters intimated in brief encounters, most people catch on to Memento's pattern rather quickly. This causes the viewer to desire sources of information that are the basis for Shelby's actions. The movie is an excellent story and presentation with a powerful climax, but some viewers may find the style of presentation tasking. I continually found myself waiting for information and paying less attention to the occurrences of the film. I truly sympathized with Leonard Shelby by the end of the movie, but since the presentation allowed viewers to know what the end result of each scene would be, I really had a feeling that I wanted the key element of the scene to appear. After that element appeared, I completely lost interest in the rest of the scene. Viewed linearly, the characters might be a little unrealistic. The musical score was extremely outdated -- it reminded me of something from a 60s or 70s film. The acting was excellent, with the exception of Guy Pearce -- incidentally the main character. I understand that it is very difficult to play a handicapped person, but I found his blonde hair and clean-cut look to be insufficient in compensating for his overly cool demeanor and emotionless performance. Watch this movie. It is a fair picture of a rare medical condition with a brilliant ending; however, I can only credit Jonathon Nolan with brilliance and Christopher Nolan with some pretty sub-par directing.",

1- Overview (2 out of 10): The way in which the events of the movie went is new by making it go from the end to the start BUT i found it confusing and very bad, I know the way in which the events of the movie went from the final scene without burn the end then start from the beginning and It is better than these way, And i don't got the idea from that girl in the movie ""she helped him because she is lost someone too"" and i don't know how that happened? and what happened to the killer? and how she knew the main character primarily?!.
2- The Goal (4 out of 10): The idea behind the movie is very good .. really good which is that the ""human is just memories"" BUT actually it is messed up for me because of the bad way that the movie goes on it.
3- The Excitement: (2 out of 10): where is it? oh! i found it on the beginning only, then Nothing but boredom.
4- The influence: (1 out of 10): Not that way please nothing affected me , i already know the bad guy from the beginning why i should affected by the events then?.

Instead of being normal, Memento unravels backward(starting with the last scene and working it's way back to the first). The movie is so incredibly confusing, that it's so hard to take in everything at once. You can't understand the scene your watching until you see the next scene. It's great to see all the little connections that you make going along the way. Memento is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.

The hidden story within the story is almost as entertaining as the movie itself and you can probably watch this movie 7 times and still learn something you didn't know the first time. The only way to watch this movie is to truly put your trust in the great Christopher Nolan and believe that in the end you will knoow everything you need to know... if you try to figure it out the whole time you will truly miss some of the things that make this movie great. the performances are top notch and I really believe this to be Guy Pearce's best performance along with that of L.A. confidential.

1430,17 March 2014,michaelisariley,9, Recognition and Praise of Editing and Film as a Whole.,"Before watching this film I was aware that it was shown in reverse chronological order. I was not keen on this also knowing that it was coming from the director of the Dark Knight and Inception, which while they are good films I do not hold them in as high regard as others that i have watched seeing as most of his more recent works aim towards purely entertainment instead of the art of cinema. However I was left in awe of this movie and realized how perfect the choice of showing the film in reverse actually was. Leonard's condition leaves him chronically unaware of how he gets places and what he's doing. By presenting the film starting with Teddy's death at Leonard's hand Nolan is able to leave the audience with the same feeling because they are unaware of what Leonard is doing at the beginning of each scene as well as how he has gotten there. I'm not sure where in the planning process that this decision was made, but it without a doubt changed the chemistry of this movie and took it from what would have been your run of the mill neo- noir crime film to an icon for future films to aspire.",

Erlier in the movie Lenny says, that that ""bodypart"" will only be tattoo then the finds the man who killed his wife... ",
1432,13 January 2019,atulgupta-51816,9, Remarkable telling of a mindblowing tale!,"Memento is one of those movies that you watch this year but will remember till you die. The strangely moral/immoral, philosophical tragedy pictures a man, very much lost, on a quest he knows little about. And the audience is made to rely on him and his interpretation of the 'facts' until we aren't sure anymore, thereby giving us with one of the best original thrillers I've seen in a while.
What's even more remarkable is the way the story is told. Watch this with a group of friends and in the end, you all might have a different interpretation of 'what just happened!'",
1433,6 July 2005,gmiller-16,9, Very impressive.,"I had heard excellent things about this movie for years. I should have known that it would be good with Guy Pearce in it. He has never disappointed me. He is one of those actors that just seems to get involved with good scripts. As for this movie itself, I cannot say enough. I was glued to the set during the entire film. The whole concept of reversing the plot structure is brilliant. One would think this creates a lack of tension but that is not the case. I also love the fact that the hardest working actor in the world, Joe Pantoliano, played a significant role in the plot. Joe is an excellent character actor. He is great as a scum bag and he does not disappoint in this film. Or does he?",

Every time you see what you saw before and that's the way the scene ends, it surprises you and makes you question your own cognition. I loved it! Who needs lsd when you have Memento! That's how Lenny is, he's like on a permanent acid trip that he cannot get out of...at all. ",

1438,21 April 2001,Austin Bindlestiff-2,10, Intriguing,"This the kind of movie, when you start describing it to someone, you can see their eyes glaze over.  It sounds contrived, confusing, and probably boring in an artsy-fartsy way.  It sounds like that movie with Dana Carvey that seemed so boring you never saw it, even on video. Well, forget what it sounds like.  This movie is totally unique, and very intriguing.  It is like no movie you have seen before.  There are a lot of actors you recognize, like the dude with the little glasses from LA Confidential, and Ralphy from the new season of The Sopranos, but the acting and photography and so on all take second place to a Story that is just BRILLIANT.  I recommend it to anyone who likes movies that make them talk out loud by themselves in a theater, ""Oh, I get it... No WAY... So THAT'S why he...""",

Nolan fulfils the promise he showed in Following and more. The ten minute or so overlapping segments that flow backwards to create the movie... It's fantastic. Pearce is brilliant as Leonard Shelby, the main character. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are amazing as supporting cast; they manage wonderfully the sometimes incredibly difficult task of taking up enough of the stage to make the story work, which they have to do, considering the Shelby's disorder, (he can't remember anything for more than 10min.) without taking up so much that we focus on them instead of Shelby and his struggle to find his wife's rapist and killer, the enigmatic John G.",

1441,8 January 2006,ikensey,6, Interesting ideas let down by huge plot holes,"Memento has definite style. the plot goes forwards and backwards at the same time. The ""forward narrative"" is distinguished by the director by being shown in black and white. At the beginning I was really interested with the story, the theme of revenge and the strange narrative. But after a while it became clear that I had hoped for too much. Not as many plot twists as I hoped, and many common sense errors in the plot. Example: in Lennie's phone conversation, if he can't remember things that happened a few minutes ago, why doesn't lose his memory at any point in the call? The ending, though a surprising and definitely unexpected twist, also didn't seem very clear. If Lennie's wife wasn't killed, why would he remember it that way? But much more damning is this: how could he remember his story as Sammy's, if since the accident he couldn't make new memories? However, if you can ignore these plot holes, you should like this stylish film.",

Watch it and pay attention.  It's an incredibly good movie and as I said before, you ahve to pay attention to details.  Something can happen in a split second and you will miss it. I have to give a big thumbs up to Guy Pearce who has sort of stayed in the shadows of big actors until now (L.A. Confidential and Ravenous).

1455,5 September 2001,Mrobbins21,10, SEE IT AGAIN...YOU MAY HAVE MISSED SOMETHING,"This movie is without a doubt one of my favorites of all time.  I saw it twice at the theatres b/c different groups of friends wanted to go.  It turns out each time I've seen it, I discover something new.  Blown away by Pierce's portrayal of Leonard Shelby.  He and Joe Pantoliano have a great chemistry that is not forced upon you.  Here's the thing though, I picked up the DVD yesterday (it came out yesterday 9/4) and watched it again with my buddy who hadn't yet seen it.  I saw two things I had never seen the first time.  Make sure you watch it with someone who has seen it b/c they can help you if you need it.  DO NOT LET ANYONE SPOIL THE ENDING FOR YOU.  If you like movies with interesting twists such as The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, or the Sixth Sense, than Memento is one that you should not miss. Hopefully Pierce will be recognized for an Academy Award nomination.  By the way, for those who will be seeing it for the second time, watch Sammy Jankis very, very closely in the mental ward. Weird effect that I didn't notice the first two times in the theatre.  Carrie Anne Moss also gives a quality performance.  Needs to break out of the shadow of the Matrix and this may help.  Great film, excellent plot, wonderful acting...I can tell why it's #11 all time according to IMDB voters.  One of the few movies I gave a 10 to.

1458,15 August 2001,dasaffe,4," Nice Editing, Poor Film","Perhaps this film's success will signal the transition of film from a medium of words to a medium of pictures, but that doesn't mean i have to approve.  The problem with Memento is that the film shown backwards (ie without the gimmick) would not be watchable.  The plot develops at a slow pace, the dialogue is riddled with ughs, every time Guy says he has a ""disability"" as an example (South Park speaks more intelligently about the topic).  The acting is flat, which i think could be attributed to the filming process during which the actors have said they weren't told much about their roles.  The film is mostly predictible, barring plot twists which seldom make sense due to the backwardity. One thing that this film proves even moreso than The Limey (a better, if average, movie) is that editing counts. Another thing this movie proves, except this time by bad example, MUSIC counts.  The score in Memento is typical pad swells and synth strings, it only hinders a film which would be much more riveting with no music (or perhaps some odd backwards soundscapes). While the directer immerses you in the world of the amnesiac, it's not a world worth inhabiting, as nothing is really happening.  Memento is sort of like throwing a party but spending all your money on the band and not being able to afford invitations.  It's just you sitting alone, enjoying the show of your life (the editing), but wondering why you bothered. 6 of 10",

What this movie achieves with revolutionary time flow and secrets so surprisingly revealed puts it on a level entirely of its own.  While flowing backward in chronology in a perfectly synchronized manner, we yet still move forward in terms of development and yes...even in terms of the drama's critical movement. I thought that what I was going to see was just this clever tapering of scene upon the scene before, but what I got was such a rich and flowing evolution of the central character (as well as support) that I was left with an instant resolve to include this movie in my collection asap.

1466,8 November 2006,bdogg_2001,10, Great psychological thriller that leaves you in deep thought,"Memento follows the life of Leonard Shelby, a man who was diagnosed with anterograde amnesia after the junkie who has just raped and murdered his wife hit him over the head with his gun. The main symptom of Leonard's condition is that he cannot create new memories since the incident. He can only remember seeing his wife getting killed and everything before it. This means he can never remember anyone he's met since the incident, what he's done, or even how long it's been since he lost his memory. Lenny is intent on finding and killing the man who raped and murdered his wife, and can only keep track of his progress by taking polaroids of the people he's met and jotting notes on them, tattooing notes all over his body, and so forth. As well as Lenny not knowing what he's done before each given scene, the audience is kept in the dark, too. This is done by showing each memory sequence in reverse order. That is, we start off by seeing the end first, then the next scene will lead up to how that end scene got started, etc. all the way to the start.",

As a psychology student who is interested in cognition and this magic box of memory, I recommend the ones who haven't watched the film, to understand how hard it can be for a person to find the motivation of going on his life by recreating new facts in his new 'condition' ,as Nolan puts it to use.

After seeing the movie, the crowd waited around in amazement trying to figure out what they just viewed.  The official web-site (memento spelled backwards) is a help in unraveling the story. The movie however is  a bit heavy and requires active participation of the audience, so do not see this while drowsy!  The style of the movie itself is directly related to the plot, placing the viewer in the title characters mind-set. And from my personal experience (I have had short term memory problems, following brain surgery)the story is an incredible view into the meaning of memory.  See it now!",
1483,6 January 2015,AndyWakes,10," ""Memories...they're just an interpretation, not a record""","The most common criticism of this film is that it's ""hard to follow"" or ""too unconventional."" Well, that's exactly the point! The movie is intended to disorient the audience so that we feel the way the protagonist (Guy Pearce) feels with his short-term memory condition. After the opening of the film, it works its way backwards to show how we got to this point. Slowly, the entire plot is shown in flashbacks that reflect the character's 15-minute memory. There is also another ""timeline"" shot in black in white that happens in chronological order, a true showcase of Nolan's skill as a director. We learn that his wife was killed in a break-in that left him with a head injury leaving his long-term memory intact but unable to make ""new"" memories. He is bent on catching his wife's killer, which proves to be a difficult task given his condition. Before his memory resets, he takes annotated Polaroid's and tattoos himself with clues to which he is after, and what his situation is. However, this allows for him to be manipulated by those around him, and even himself. In his mostly positive review of the film, Roger Ebert seemed to discover a huge plot hole. How does he remember that he was short-term memory loss if the last thing he remembers is his wife's death? That seems like a legitimate observation that should discredit the film's cleverness. However, his memory of this is triggered by a tattoo on his hand of the name of another man (who becomes very important later) who had the same condition. Anyway where was I? Oh! ""Memento"" is a brilliant, mind-mending film that works both as a thriller and a psychological drama. It will undoubtedly receive very different interpretations from viewer to viewer (just like memories in real life). As the protagonist says: ""memories...they're just an interpretation, they're not a record.""",

1499,14 December 2004,Michael-Zanoni,10, In its own realm,"Just for all of you who seem to have a problem with this movie, I need you to wake up and smell the coffee. I even saw some person complaining that some people see its better than The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and other instant classics. The problem with these people is that their mind is too closed to see the difference between these movies and a movie like Memento. Memento was shot on a low budget. This means actors like Pacino, etc etc... can not be cast easily. For Pearce, this is one of his best performances, hands down. Also, Pantoliano and Moss deliver a completely unique perspective on characters in any film. The best part about the two is the constant flip flopping of good and evil within them. You never truly get a grasp on whether one is trying to help or hurt Pearce on his ""mission."" And if its realism that people are complaining about (Lenny's condition mainly), go back and check your own favorites for realism, I'm sure not every part is factual and actually possible. With films in the independent genre of film, it is important to keep an open mind, and see what the director and writer(s) have to offer you. The reason they are independent in the first place is to stray from traditional Hollywood production values. Everything the directing, writing, and editing throw into this film has a purpose to the storyline. The performances may not be the best all around (except Pearce), but the story makes up for it. It truly keeps you on your toes and (so cliché in saying this) ""makes you think"" but on a different realm. Not only are you trying to piece together what is happening, but why the person in charge of a certain aspect did it that way. That's all I have to say... if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about movies, I'm game. Drop me an e-mail. What I can't take is the ignorant bashing movies with low production values (like this one) just because they aren't loaded with millions of dollars worth of actors and special effects.

Far from the truth. It's cleverly written and executed! Showing the scenes in reverse, stroke of genius! As we watched it, we felt a bit of what the Lenny must have felt; out of touch with reality, confused and straining for a clue as to where we were in the story. He had tattoos, notes and Polaroid's and we had previous scenes to piece together. It's almost as if you are part of the story :) It unfolds so beautifully. After the first seen, my wife and I thought, ok..Well this is a little anti-climactic. But we were in for a great ride. We are grateful that we saw this in DVD because every 10 min. we were pausing it, going back to some dialogue and trying to piece events together. Normally this would be an annoying task, but it was a joy. The ending blew us away. We will certainly be thinking about this one for weeks. I heard about this movie when the director was on ""Fresh Air"" with Terry Gross last month. It was the first time I had heard about it. It's a great interview and there are some interesting insights. I'm glad that I bought the DVD, I had no doubt that it was going to be a keeper, but had NO IDEA that it would be one of my top five movies of all time!

He,nor the police,nor the ambulance-men,could have known that Sammy's wife had caused Sammy to overdose her;the autopsy would have shown an overdose of medication,but no-one could/would have known that Sammy's wife had kept re-winding her watch to 3 o'clock to get her jab;and Sammy would not have remembered,because he had no memory .The point is,if I remember correctly,that this is a really memorable film :the viewer is ""bounced"" and ""conned"" so memorably that..

1520,22 February 2001,Leonard Shelby,8, Some movies are best remembered,"When we go to the cinema we always expect something new, a film different from the rest, a movie which in some aspect is original. Unfortunately this doesn't happen very often, but sometimes it happens. This is the case of Memento, yet from the beginning we realize that we are not going to see a usual film. The first image we see after the excellent music of the opening titles by David Julyan is a man with a photograph, we don't know anything about this man or the man on the photograph, still we begin to ask questions. That is one of the main achievements of this film, yet from the beginning you are trapped in a plot which will interest you till the end of the film. With a script as brilliant as The Usual Suspects, Memento is an original film in all the aspects. The story is one of the most original ever written, and visually it's very different from the most of the films, as the action doesn't go from beginning to end. To sum up, Memento is a film that everybody who likes cinema should go to see, most of the people who have seen The Usual Suspects will leave the cinema with a very similar feeling, I want to see this film again. I have no doubt that memento will become a cult movie, and the name of John G. will remain in the consciousness of many viewers as the name of Keyser Soze did.",

1526,11 May 2005,gen3ric,9, Memento Review (Contains Spoilers),"When we speak of movies that push the limit, are controversial, and contain layers of meaning, not many can fit the bill. Memento isn't your traditional story in any sense. The first time you see this movie you may be confused and perhaps even frustrated with trying to understand the movie in all it's subtleties. However this movie is wonderfully compelling and full of suspense and surprises. The first and arguably most unique feature is in the way the story is told, completely in reverse. It's not that we watch it in reverse, but we get the chronology of the movie in small segments in reverse order. As far as movies go, Memento touched on issues regarding religion (consequences and actions), philosophy (specifically epistemology and certainly issues in metaphysics), and morality. The main character Lenny (Leonard) we discover to be unique for a few reasons. The most striking is his lack of short-term memory. While many of us can say we have bad short-term memory, Lenny no doubt has it worse. His short-term memory loss is so bad that he must tattoo any important information on his body. With any amount of empathy towards this situation, fear and confusion are immediately feelings of which there is no escape. However, Lenny has no choice, he has to deal with all of this with no one to trust and with no idea who to believe. Lenny suffers from a rare brain disease (or brain damage) from the 'incident'. He tells us of Sammy Jankis, the accountant he came across when he was a claims investigator. Sammy had this same disease where he did not have the ability to create new memories; He had no short-term memory. The most complex tasks were done with ease, as long as he had learned of it before his accident. Lenny tells us that there is a difference between himself and Sammy; He has a reason to live. Sammy on the other hand, had no reason, no system. Within the field of epistemology, testimony and memory are important ideas for the attainment of knowledge. In Lenny's condition, due to his inability to form short-term memory, he must rely on testimony. His reliance on notes, tattoo's, and his specific 'system' as he calls it is the way he has adapted to his condition. Also, because of his condition, the consequences of his actions are of no meaning since he will ultimately forget. He creates his own truth, his own meaning, and his own path. Every time Lenny's memory fades away, he's left in a waking state of forgetfulness. Like after waking up from a bad hangover or a deep sleep, he reorientates himself with where he is, what he is doing, and why he is doing what he is doing. The movie is unique in the way it presents the story. First, we see the end of the movie and we form our own conclusions regarding Lenny, Teddy, and Natalie. Yet slowly, the story jumps back into time, revealing yet another piece of what appears to be the final picture. The director keeps using this technique to keep us in suspense. Aside from the unique way in which this story is told, the simple aesthetics of this film are amazing. Many have classified this as 'film noir' from a previous era in film-making and I would have to agree that they share many elements in common. Yet there are features, such as the way the story is told, that set this apart from its predecessors. While the movie is full of suspense and action, the result of this movie is something that makes us think. We leave the movie with questions of our own, wondering about the true nature of man and how we use people to our own advantage. Certainly we wonder how someone can use another person with a server handicap to murder someone else. Nonetheless, Natalie and Teddy take advantage of Lenny and his condition to further their own interests. Without the ability to remember what we have done, do our actions even have meaning? Lenny said, ""Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless"". He had set out to discover the truth and take revenge for his wife's murder, but slowly the story turns into a direction where you wonder Did this really happen or is this just what someone told me? This movie is without a doubt a well-filmed and well-written story. The elements of surprise and suspense work well to draw the audience into the story and take an interest in the characters. The visual cues (black and white for the film cues and conversations), amazing use of lighting, and the timing of the jumps fit perfectly in with the dark nature of this film. This is without a doubt a wonderful film.",

Definitely a movie to see over and over again. You can't wait to discuss the ending or beginning (whatever) with the other people that have seen it. Guy Pearce was great as always. When is he going to get the darn appreciation that he deserves? Joe Pantoliano was equally as great. Carrie Anne Moss was pretty good also.

Memento it's a movie that can full almost completely this description, but if not do so, it's because we can saw in this movie what happened when you have a thousand of ideas, a strong will of executed them, but failed in what matters the most: makes those who watched the movie believe in that history as them believe in their owns. And this can be verified after the half of the movie, when the history, exciting and fresh until that moment, turn to a extreme confuse narrative, dialogs in the limit of the good sense, with characters taking the most strangers decisions in pro of the most complicated and untouchable final a as possible as can be.

1551,24 March 2003,paul-daniels3,9, Memento is a unique film in many regards,"'Memento' is edited in a way unlike any other movie I have seen. The story in the film is played out backwards in time; this break in the linear timeline of the film is similar to that of 'Last Year At Marienbad'. As you watch the show, you will see about 15 minutes of the story, then it will cut to a scene about 15 minutes before the start of the last segment you saw. So, to try and explain it more clearly, its like if all the scenes in the movies are played in the reverse order (so, instead of going from scene A to scene B, 'Memento' shows the scenes from scene Z to scene Y). This style forces you pay attention to what you have just seen, and remember it. Doing the film this way changes the show into more of a puzzle, a puzzle that you figure out over time. The effect of the movie as a whole is that it causes you to question your own memories (since Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, does not have the ability to form new short term memories), you question what it would be like if you could not create new short-term memories. For that matter, this film raises the question of if you can trust your own memories (did you really ever go to the store, or do you just think you went to the store?) Personally, this show caused me to considered what it would be like if I could not trust any empirical information or knowledge. Because of how different this film is, and how it forces you to think while you watch it (unlike most movies today), I enjoyed 'Memento' very much.",

This is a movie which you have to sit down and watch and not pause it or turn it off or fall asleep & especially not watch while you are drunk or stoned. The film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce) a regular guy from San Francisco trying to find out who raped & murdered his wife. One problem. He has a short term memory loss. Solution. He uses tattoo's & photo's to remember certain things. Ie. where he is staying, his car, the people he knows. The film itself goes backwards and forwards. Your probably saying what the hell is this guy talking about. Well in the movie there are colour scenes & black & white scenes. The black & white scenes are going forward & they are before Leonard has found the person who raped & murdered his wife. The colour scenes are going backwards so right at the start we see Guy Pearce blow Joe Pantolianos brains out (don't worry this isn't a spoiler as it happens right at the start) then we see a black and white scene then we see the scene before Pearce shot Pantoliano and how it got to the first scene and so fourth throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan has just done something i would like to do and that is to breakout through writing & directing one of the greatest movies in the history of film & have it shown. The performances in this film are brilliant from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano & Carrie-Anne Moss. The script is bursting with originality and is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys a good movie. Don't waste money in renting it, BUY IT! RIGHT NOW! because i can assure you, you won't be dissapointed. 10/10",

1559,31 March 2012,rawpow192,10," Very, very good","Memento is about a man who can no longer build memories. Thus he has to write things down on post-its and photographs to remember them, and tattoo things on his body to make sure he doesn't forget them later. Memento is masterfully edited and directed, with a complex plot and unique, intricate time line that puts the viewer in a unique state of mind. Due to the way Memento is directed and put together, you end up not knowing who to trust, what anyone's motives are, or even what happened when and in what order events took place. In short, the movie puts you in the character's state of mind - a man who has short-term memory loss, and all he knows is either tattooed on his body or written on some photos. Memento is disorienting, its confusing, and its a unique experience. Nolan really succeeds in putting the viewer in the character's frame of mind, and in keeping us hooked until the very end. Nothing is clear until the very last scene of the movie, and even then the motives and 'sides' of certain characters will not be clear, and it may take a while to fully understand what happened, in what order.",

But not in an especially good way, as it became wearying to the point of apathy -- I stopped caring what had really happened, the kiss of death in what should have been a psychological thriller. I like Carrie Moss as an actress, but her character in this film was uninteresting -- I stopped caring about her. I also really like Joey Pants as well, but as good as his performance was, even he couldn't make the movie worth it. After struggling to keep watching the movie, overall I found it trite, unsatisfying, and not worth the time spent.

If that's the case, then this is DEFINITELY not a movie you should see. If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. ""Memento"" is an old-fashioned ""film noir""-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the viewer(s) their own perspective as well.

1571,6 December 2007,dschoenike,10, the best film I've ever seen.,"I'd first like to acknowledge all the outstanding reviews and discussions of Memento written by IMDb users and visitors. I'm not a good enough writer to add anything original or thought provoking that hasn't been said before. What i will write about, are some aspects of Memento that make it such a wonderful film. The attention to detail; Memento practically demands that you watch it a handful of times at a minimum. I firmly believe that any little mistake or oversight would have been greatly magnified, due to the fact this films whole premise is paying attention to facts and details. Even when you think you've discovered a plot-hole, or a situation that doesn't make sense, you have to realize thats's the genius of the film. You're viewing the film the way Leonard is going through life. Where you/he cannot be sure of anything, and there's a fine line between facts and perception. The outstanding acting; I think i've read that Brad Pitt and Alec Baldwin were asked to play the part of Leonard Shelby. It's my opinion, that Guy Pearce is the most underrated actor working today. His portrayal of a normal man living through extraordinary circumstances was nothing short of phenomenal. His ability to hold the viewers attention on his every word and action, really made this film work. Joe Pantoliano was great as Teddy, a guy who was maybe helping Lenny, or just taking advantage of him. Or both? The musical score; Composed and performed by David Julyan, the music is chilling and beautiful. It seemed to me like the music was itself a separate character in the film, with its ability to grab the viewers attention and bring about ranges of emotion. And lastly, the director; Christopher Nolan, in my opinion, has made nothing but excellent films. Not a bad one in the bunch. I think that Memento with a lesser skilled director, would have been an above average movie. But not the mind-bending masterpiece Mr. Nolan gave to us in 2001. Memento is a rare film that requires your full attention, (a few times at minimum) that'll have you thinking about it long after you've viewed it. To me, its a movie that in 20+ years, people will say, ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"". Now, where was I? ;)",
1572,28 March 2001,Tiger-4,9, Too Stupid to watch this movie?,"In my opinion it is a fact that there are many people who are too dumb to watch this movie.

This Movie is really great, with a new topic (which is not easy to find these days), a great script that should win the oscar for best adapted screenplay and an amazing directing. You really can not tell much about the plot, because you realize the ""big picture"" at the end of the movie, and the beginning stands in a new light. To say so much: The colored scenes tell the story backwards, for the black and white scenes its up to you. (And perhaps it helps watching this movie at least twice)",
1573,6 April 2001,Kael-4,10, Excellent film transforms reality,"This film has cracked into my own personal list of favorites, and I'm sure I'll like it even more upon seeing it again.  It does an amazing job of transforming reality so that you can see it from the viewpoint of Leonard, the main character, whose ability to remember anything for more than a few seconds has been destroyed in a traumatic event.  For anyone who likes being thoroughly absorbed in a movie, see this.  It will take you some time after seeing the film to readjust yourself to your own reality again.",

It is all there for us to see, there are no ""goofs"" and certainly no holes in the plot, just our minds' confusion. Once you actually understand the whole plot, you will indeed be able to appreciate the complexity with which Mr. Nolan takes us to it. There is so much to digest the first time around.

There is only one, but in defense of the film makers, screenwriters etc. I will make an argument that the one goof isn't a goof at all.  You say that Lenny shouldn't know that he has a condition because his short term memory loss would prevent him from remembering the condition.  But...I say that he knew the condition existed before he was injured.  Remember Sammy?  I realize that it is up for debate whether Sammy even existed, the movie never gives a definitive answer to this question and it is left up to the viewer. I am persuaded to believe that Sammy existed and  Lenny clearly understood that people could in fact have short term memory loss before he lost his.  Since he can remember everything that happened to him before and up to the assault it makes sense to me that he could remember that he had a condition that he was already familiar with before losing short term memory.  Now on the flip side it is well to argue also that if someone knew all about (another disease in the movie) diabetes, and lost short term memory....then being diagnosed with diabetes after the injury would a person realize and remember to treat the disease?  I don't know.  But it was cleaver of the film makers to attempt to explain Lenny's knowledge of his condtion in this way.",

Flawless acting, mesmerising narrative, stunning plot device - this film really is high concept - but with other films which simply rely on a fancy plot, all other factors usually suffer, but not with ""Memento"". Guy Pearce is a revelation (I remember him from ""Neighbours"") and both Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano erase all possibility of ""The Matrix"" being all anyone will remember them for.

Although there is nothing really original about the actual story, a man seeking revenge for the murder of his wife, the presentation is truly phenomenal. Guy Pearce, plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from short term memory loss after being  hit on the head, trying to save his wife.  Although he remembers everything before the accident, he can only remember things for about 15 minutes at a time afterwards, so he keeps the clues through a series of polaroids, notes and tattoos. The film is told in a series of segments, starting at the end and moving back to the beginning, with a wraparound scene in between each segment.  By telling the story like this, it effectively places the audience in Leonard's shoes, we can see what's happening and know what's going to happen, but we don't know what led up to it, just as Leonard doesn't know. The film sports great performances from Pearce, Joe Pantoliano as Teddy, the shady character that could be a friend or foe and Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, who seems to want to help Leonard. All in all this is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, not wondering what's going to happen next, but what happened before.  This film is a true gem and definitely requires more than one viewing. ****",
1595,9 September 2001,amsdragons,10," Original, intriguing, engrossing","I was still analyzing this movie for days after watching it! The gimmick is not really new (see Clean Slate w/ Dana Carvey,) BUT it takes a unique, gripping and deadly new look at trying to live w/out memories! The storytelling is FANTASTIC!  I was hooked after the opening scene! The direction and acting are terrific as well, Guy Pierce was mesmerizing! Even now I cannot answer where the ""right"" person was killed, or if Leonard's wife died as he believes he did.  Perhaps he has convoluted his story so much that he can no longer rely on the memories that he does have! It's a movie that leaves you with many more questions and you're longing to puzzle it out yourself!",
1596,10 April 2001,jcutright,7, Good?....Yes! Great?.... hmmm.,"Ok, I went and saw Memento last night and I liked it, but I didn't think it was great.  First the pros.... the story was awesome.  The whole ""not being able to form new memories"" thing makes for an intriguing film.  Also, the way the scenes are played in reverse chronological order works well. You're thrown into each scene not knowing what has happened just before.... just like Leonard is.  There are also some great characters in this film.  Joe Pantoliano's ""Teddy"" is excellent.",

This movie was not a movie, it was an educational experience:  1)  how a creative movie is made, and 2) how to make an audience think and determine the plot!  This is hands down the greatest movie of all time!",

Guy Pearce did an excellent job of the deep and twisted personality of Leonard.  The subtle ques of the memory loss were really well written.  This should be highly recommened to all movie lovers. This movie has definitely broker the mold!,
1600,18 April 2001,greyman-4,9, A wonderful premise done wonderfully,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I heard about this movie. I mean, a story about a man with no short term memory trying to find his wife's killer, shown backwards in then minute increments.",

Nolan on suspense:  Show the explosion, show the characters responding, and then have the audience agonize over how or why the bomb got there.  The progression of suspense is successfully reversed in ""Memento.""",

The style of the film is great, the acting is top-notch, and the scripting is so detailed it's incredible. The backwards storytelling works to the film's advantage. Better than any movie from 2000, and better than all the movies so far from 2001.",
1607,11 September 2001,armoreddog,10," Memories can't be trusted, only facts can","I just watched Memento, and I am practically speechless. So many times before I have seen movies where a new concept or style is introduced, but the movies only quality is that it tried something new. Memento, however, was a great movie to start out with, and had the bonus of a new concept for a story line and a unique, new, and refreshing way of telling the story. The story is told backwards. The end of one scene ends up being the begining of the scene that preceded it. So, unlike any other mystery, in Memento you know the ending yet strive to know the begining. One line in the movie states something along the lines of how memories cannot really be trusted. Only facts can be trusted. Interestingly, at the end as you try to piece everything together, you realize that you have to trust your memory to figure it out. I don't know if the creators of this film meant for this irony to exist, but if they did, then all the more admiration and respect to them. I rarely ever give a movie a 10 rating, but I made the exception in this case. See this movie. Trust me. It is worth more than the rental price. You usually take a chance when you rent an independent film. Memento is worth that chance and more. Remember, if you can, to see this film.",
1608,22 September 2001,ruspor,10, Great Movie but not as complicated as i suspected,"Well, I heard lots about it before I saw it and that might be the reason I didn't think it was a complicated and hard to grasp movie. I believe that Christofer Nolan will achieve great things in his career after a movie like this, truly great piece of cinema. I also think that the plot how strange and not everyday life encountered situation it describes can easily be related to for all who watches the movie due to great characters and wonderful artists.",

Guy Pearce is wonderful in this picture, as well is Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss. I'd be upset if none of these guys gets at least an Academy Award nomination, particularly Guy Pearce.

1613,12 October 2020,benkelman-90578,10, Thrilling story and character study of a man with a unique condition,"Memento is one of Christopher Nolan's first movies, which gives the audience a glimpse of what Nolan has to offer. Nolan often seems obsessed with the nature of time and the manipulation of time and how it can tell and enhance a story, and it certainly does here. This follows a man with a unique condition in which he has no short term memory after an accident which caused his wife's death, and he sets off on a mission to find and kill the person who did this and get revenge. This film deals with a very interesting concept where the man has to discover clues and write them down, because afterword he will forget and have no recollection of what he has just worked out. Like any Thriller/Mystery film you are racking your brain for what might have happened and who might have done it. This film is an extremely exciting and fascinating film with the cast delivering excellent performances, and at points makes you think you might have this memory condition with you thinking 'Hang on, what just happened?'
It is a interesting story where you feel involved and engaged with the story and is also a character study of Leonard as it is a deep dive into his condition.",
1614,23 May 2001,shotenshinbou,8, Masterful Telling -- Psychologically Flawed Plot,The telling of this movie was truly masterful.

Watching the movie for the second time is also great because you're watching it from a completely different perspective. This movie is, however, only for those up to the challenge.  You've really got to give it your full attention and want to play detective, otherwise you'll be lost and confused and won't experience the movie for what it is. This is a must see!",
1617,13 April 2002,SDSTEWA,5, disappointing,"Highly recommended (IMDB's #10) and Oscar-nominated, I found Memento a disappointment.  Unique ""flashback in installments"" structure became annoying after a while.  Characters, including Pierce, had no real redeeming features.  I felt sorry for Pierce and his ""condition,"" but his ultimate lack of nobility or any nice-guy appeal made it hard to really care. (Compare to his and Russell Crowe's characters in ""L.A. Confidential."") Left me wishing for more substance and less style.  5/10",

An all around great movie that keeps you guessing.  Real twists around every corner, unlike such dull movies as ""UNBREAKABLE.""  Memnto truly is exciting, makes you think indepth. Memento, is about a man who is attacked in his home, leaving his wife dead, and his short term memory lost.  He is totally unable to make knew memories, which makes his pursuit to avenge his wife's death a little difficult to say the least.  The only way he can remember his leads, is to tattoo them on his body, and trust a few people, by using a polaroid camera and take their pictures.  In order not to give anything vital away, I must stop now!  See the movie!",

But to my surprise it was more than amazing. The movies producers did an awesome job at re-doing scenes so that they would be explained. At first in the beginning when Leonard went to the hotel and he couldn't remember anything that he had said to the hotel guy the night before i was a little bit confused. Other than that I started to catch on after Leonard had met Natalie at the restaurant. I love how they used tattoo's as a way for him to remember things. It's something that i've never really seen done in a movie before. This movie was a great hit and will probably be a movie that I recommend to other people! Watch it its great.,

The acting in this movie was terrific. A lot of the actors in this movie have had other big movie roles so they know what they're doing. I thought that it was brilliant of the director to put the whole movie in reverse. This was the first time I watched something from the end to the beginning. I was amazed by the ending. It blew me away that ""Lenard"" had been spending so much time trying to find his wife's murderer, and come to find out he was making up his prey one after the other.",
1630,23 November 2001,cire8648219,10, something new that's great too,"I really enjoyed this movie for it's unique presentation. The story of a memory-impaired man who's looking for his wife's killer, it tells about his quest in a very different way-by reversing the chronological order of events leading to the murder of the man he's looking for. That way, you're like Leonard (the movies' protagonist, extremely well played by Guy Pearce), you have no idea how you got to that point. Oh, Leonard writes little notes and adds remarks to Polaroid photos of people he meets, but still he's mostly in the dark. Not a very good way to search for your wife's killer, and Leonard finds out in the surprise ending (beginning????)  I thought it was great storytelling, but I had to watch it a couple of times to really get it. Excellent movie.",
