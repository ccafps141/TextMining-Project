0,2 March 2023,EVON1TY,10, Tarantino made an amazing Collage with this movie. ⭐,"I can't explain why you like this movie so much. I don't know how rare this feeling comes to me. Actually this happens only for this movie. I don't know how can I explain why I like this movie so much. I don't like that much Samurai movies, I don't like that much Gangster movies. I don't know how this movie effected me this much. Is it revenge? No it doesn't have the greatest Screenplay.",/

However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.",e
3,10 September 2020,dommercaldi,9, Kill Bill Is One Hell Of A Thrill,"Pros:
1. The bright colour palette does a wonderful job at highlighting the over-the-top nature of the film.
2. The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal.
3. The score envelops the movie in a pulsating lively aura, and adds reems of energy to the scenes.
4. The action and fight scenes are incredibly entertaining and brilliantly choreographed.
5. The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes.
6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly.
7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances.
8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes.
9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.",v
4,26 April 2019,SafReviews,9," I love this movie, I don't know why, but I just do.","This is movie is unusual, but it works for me. It kept me intrigued from the beginning with the plot which is not entirely clearly, but that made it more interesting for me. There's a lot of action in the movie which I found excellent and enjoyed a lot. It might not be realistic, but its a movie so it doesn't have to be. The plot is amazing and I can't wait to watch volume 2 soon because of how intriguing volume 1 was.",i

But bare with me, because it does make sense. The film is absolutely brilliant and I loved it. I have not much else to say other than to describe it as ""it's cool"". During the action scenes I'd constantly be going ""oh that's awesome"", ""oh that's so cool"" and so on.",w
7,5 February 2010,planktonrules,10, I don't think this would be mistaken for a Disney flick!,"WARNING: No one who doesn't want to see billions of gallons of blood, severed limbs and super-duper graphic violence should ever see this movie...period. It is the most violent film I have ever seen and find it amazing it didn't get an NC-17 rating. I guess you can't show nudity in American films but bloody graphic violence is okay! What a world. This isn't a complaint against Tarantino--but one about the current insane rating system.",/
8,28 February 2018,davispittman,8, Well made action film,"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a unique film. I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10.",r
9,14 March 2005,Rooster99,10, This movie was brilliant!,"Man, what a film. As a fan of 70's martial arts movies, it was great to see all of the references. I also thought the use of B&W throughout was extremely effective. The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much, but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts, but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee-era action pictures. In those movies, the stories were very similar epics of revenge, and they never had much of a budget for good ""gore"" effects. It was more or less ""throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed"" type of effects, which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies; something despicable happens to the weak hero (whole village razed, family slaughtered, etc..) and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the ""secret move"" which the master normally does not teach, except of course, in this rare instance. That move, as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2, is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.",w
10,10 October 2003,emperorpasta,9, Tarantino's Blue Period is OVER!,"Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie's Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.",1
11,10 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,7, Sit back and enjoy the expertly-choreographed mayhem,"Tarantino's fourth effort and what a build-up; I hadn't seen a film this hyped up and over-covered since the release of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. It's a good movie and even better for those who are fans of the same type of cinema as Tarantino: enjoy pretty much any '70s exploitation movie, from Shaw Brothers kung fu to Japanese samurai, blaxploitation and more, and you'll doubtless enjoy this one. However, this is not up to the level of Tarantino's previous offerings: the plot is wafer-thin and the dialogue is far more sparse than we're used to. His witty repartee is gone, instead replaced with plenty of black humour and more simplistic dialogue. The plot, which feels stretched (perhaps splitting the film in two wasn't such a good idea), involves Uma Thurman working her way through a hit list in a simple revenge drama. Tarantino's idea was to make just the kind of overblown trash movies he loved watching when younger, and he ably succeeded with this frenetic outing.",4

17,13 July 2022,cjm1d,8, Best action film of all time,"Tarantino is an action genius. The bloody scenes may be too much for some people, but that's what makes them so fantastic and over the top. Great characters with a great revenge plot. The story was a little confusing at the beginning but I caught on pretty quick. Not a huge fan of vol 2 because of how great this film was, but still a great pair. Would recommend to any fans of Samurai or cool action and fight scenes.",/
18,29 May 2007,springsunnywinter,10, One of my most favourite films,"When I saw Kill Bill for the first time I just fell in love with the film. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding, The Bride emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback...with a vengeance. Casting was excellent everyone did a fantastic job in their own place, Uma was the best and no other actress could of taken her place. My favourite member of the deadly viper squad is Elle driver the one with the eye patch I also liked the tune she was whistling in the hospital, I was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained in Vol 2. They never showed Bill's face in the film that kept the suspense for the sequel which was a terrific idea especially for me because I never knew what the actor looked like before. The two best scenes are: ",?

27,31 March 2008,hnt_dnl,10, Tarantino's best,"KILL BILL VOL1 is the crowning film in Quentin Tarantino's career. I almost hate to put the VOL1, because alone, this first film is a great accomplishment without having VOL2, although I can appreciate what part 2 was trying to do: add depth and character backstory to the plot. In VOL1, plot is unnecessary! I'll just refer to VOL1 as KILL BILL hereafter. The genius of KILL BILL is that you don't need plot or character development to appreciate its brilliance. It's not about these things. KILL BILL is purely stylistic, an homage to all those kick-ass-and-take-names martial arts grindhouse movies of the 70s with stars like Bruce Lee to led you through the carnage. What was the real substance or motivation in those movies? Not much substance and the motivation was revenge, just like in this one. And you don't need any backstory or extra dialogue (very little here) to know from the start that it is all about revenge.",u
28,28 July 2005,fubared1,1," Trash, absolute trash...pure and simple","Just goes to prove how moronic most present day movie-goers are. How anyone could give this a rating above 3 is totally beyond me. The movie is badly written and directed, end of story. The visuals are just a compendium of clichés stolen from countless other films. The plot is just any excuse for a bunch of over-the-top scenes of martial arts violence stolen from every bad 'B' martial arts film in existence. The only exception being the bad 'B' martial arts films are 50 times more entertaining than this overblown garbage-fest. And if I were Uma or Lucy or any of the other actors, I would be embarrassed to see my name on the credits. If you want to see a good film of this nature, see Peter Jackson's Dead Alive or Sam Raimi's Evil Dead. Those are at least fun, over-the-top violent films. The chances of my seeing part 2 after this are 0 to none. At least I didn't pay anything to see it, because that's what it was worth.",r
29,17 February 2012,Hey_Sweden,9, Escapism of the highest order.,"Described by writer / director Quentin Tarantino as ""a 'duck press' of the grindhouse cinema he'd absorbed over 35 years of his life"", ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" serves as an exhilarating, wild, genuinely visionary epic tale of a character concocted by himself and Uma Thurman. Uma plays ""The Bride"" (whenever her real name is uttered, it's bleeped out, to help accentuate her ""Man with No Name"" quality). The Bride had tried to quit the organization for which she worked, and get married, but boss & lover Bill (David Carradine) sent his lethal international hit squad to eliminate her and everybody at her wedding party. We follow this character as she determinedly hunts down each and every person who did her wrong, and dishes out some thoroughly enjoyable revenge. Tarantino funnels the various martial arts pictures, spaghetti Westerns, and anime that he's admired into one distinct and potent stew, made in a great comic book style, executed with panache and divided into various chapters in a ""Pulp Fiction"" manner, moving back and forth in time, and the pieces are never, ever hard to put together. This is fun and exciting story telling that never shies away from the red stuff, with KNB delivering splatter so unabashedly over the top that it's endlessly amusing. Tarantino's use of soundtrack music is extremely eclectic; what original music there is, is composed by The RZA, but tracks from a rich variety of composers & artists - Bernard Herrmann, Charles Bernstein, Frank Mills, Quincy Jones, Isaac Hayes, Luis Bacalov, Zamfir, Tomoyasu Hotei, Riz Ortolani,and Ennio Morricone make for an excellent listen and a soaring accompaniment to the action, which culminates in a breathless, amazing job of swordplay as The Bride takes on scores of henchmen. The cast is just a pleasure to watch, with Uma an utter delight; it's also fun to see Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Liu as her intended victims. In fact, the whole cast, also featuring Julie Dreyfus, Michael Parks (once again playing Earl McGraw), Chiaki Kuriyama of ""Battle Royale"" fame, and Michael Bowen as sleazy creep Buck (as in ""I'm Buck, and I'm here to..."") is a blast. Michael Madsen briefly sets up his role for Volume 2, and Carradine is only present as a voice at this point; Tarantino having originally envisioned this as one long movie that got broken up into two parts for theatrical release. It's a particular treat to see martial arts legend Shinichi ""Sonny"" Chiba as the old sword maker who takes a liking to The Bride and is sympathetic to her mission. Even at an hour and 51 minutes, the pacing here never flags, and the movie is just plain fun, with a delightful contribution by musical act The 5, 6, 7, 8's who perform covers as well as their own songs. Right from beginning to end, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" kicks a whole lot of ass. Nine out of 10.",v

31,12 May 2007,paul2001sw-1,5, A clever person's stupid movie,"The trademarks of Quentin Tarantino's movies are well known: smart dialogue; self-awareness of popular culture (from the banal to the arcane); cinematographic innovation; ultra-violence; and a pervading air of cool. After the runaway success of his first two movies, his third film 'Jackie Brown' traded some excess of these qualities for a bit of conventional characterisation: I liked the result, although hardcore fans were disappointed. But for his fourth film, Tarantino has moved in the opposite direction. 'Kill Bill', a homage to Asian martial-arts films, sees Tarantino at his most stylised, and is as stupid as its name. The wafer thin-plot sees a female assassin out to kill those who wronged her; and little happens except for an improbable sequence of slayings. The sad thing is that there are many little touches that delight in this movie, Tarantino has not lost his mastery of the art of film-making (at least, not in the detail); but devoid of any rational context, it adds up only to showing off with blood. While Uma Thurman, in the lead role, is wooden, failing to convey either human emotion or cartoon menace. What's really unforgivable, however, is that instead of dazzling us with a quick punch, Tarantino made a film so long that, in spite of its essential vacuity, it had to be split into two movies to make it a commercial proposition. And I'm really not sure I'll be bothering with volume two.",
32,5 May 2004,claudio_carvalho,9, A Tale of Betrayal and Revenge With Lots of Blood,"In Texas, on the day of her wedding, the pregnant bride (Uma Thurman) is shot in the head by her former boss Bill. His squad of international assassins slaughters all the persons present in the church. The reasons are not explained in the story, but The Bride actually did not die and stays in coma for four years. When she wakes-up, she looks for payback and prepares a list of persons that must die. The first one to be killed is O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and then Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox).  The story, a salad of Steven Segal's `Hard to Kill', `Karate Kid', Ang Lee´s `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and many other films, has so many blood as `Freddy Vs. Jason', but is a great entertainment, with lots of action and black humor. The screenplay is very original and violent, a trademark of Quentin Tarentino. The story is presented in a non-chronological way, and the reasons of the massacre have not been presented yet. In Brazil, only last week `Kill Bill Vol. 1' was released in the movie theaters.

It was better waiting more and get something else. How people could rate this mess 8.5? Unbelieveble. This movie seems a chinese movie from 35 years ago which has been remade using famous occidental actors. The plot is pretty cheap, banal and simple. The movie is monotonous and also a little beat boring. Based just on some sword duel (all identical) and that's it. It is not spectacular, too few crowd in the movie, nothing is new. The real vote for this movie should be 1 but, as other many times, the director of the cinematography helps the director to raise some vote more using nice games of colors and giving a nice look to a real useless filmband. I'll don't see for sure the next one (Kill Bill chapter 2). I already know that, after killing, in this one, 3 of her 5 ennemies, Mamba will kill the other 2 in the next one.

Kill Bill has an extreme lead protagonist with Uma Thurman as The Bride. And finally, we get a character who doesn't have extreme plot armor, fails and gets back up, and has true challenges and threats. That all combined gives you a lovable character that has you cheering for her for the entire film.
On another note, the cinematography and editing merged with the vicious, blood soaked action is something to be cherished. It's so simple in its execution, yet there are some really beautiful shots and scenes in this film that stick out so much.
The black / blue silhouetted fight scene is definitely one of my favorites. There's even a short animated sequence in this that threw me off at first but really fits in snug with the rest of the film.
All in all, I think it's safe to say that Kill Bill officially is one of my favorite action films now. Simple in the best way possible, giving light to some brilliant performances, an iconic score, and some fun, brutal action.",

44,8 May 2004,moonspinner55,7, The Tarantino Experience: all flash and crass sass,"A juggernaut of technical wizardry, this Quentin Tarantino film (product?) is winking and nodding but not especially human. A die-hard of the neo-Western (where Japanese samurai flicks meet the new-fangled Old West) and TV action thrillers, Tarantino is the master of quick, canny scenes of carnage. It gets awfully bloody, but not in the NC-17 way. No, Tarantino is much too cute, and his imitativeness isn't exploitative or schlocky (as much as he might like it to be). He gives showy roles to many fine actors, and Uma Thurman seems to inspire him to new heights. But he also gets easily sidetracked and becomes self-enamored of scenes that don't play, plod along or get too cheeky (as with the opening bit featuring Vivaca A. Fox, which is good but not quite as solid as the rest of the film). ""Vol. 2"" is more story-heavy, and gives the actors better room to emote, but also features lots of outlandishness, sometimes just for the sake of a cheap, quick laugh. The trickery, comic mayhem, wild ambushes and female ass-kicking don't amount to much in retrospect. Both volumes include some lovely moments, successfully lowball comedy, and they refuse to let up, but do they honestly turn the audience on? I felt exhausted instead of keyed-up.

Now, action is usually not my favorite genre at all, but there is so much more to it. But let us start from the beginning. The writer and director is Quentin Tarantino and at 110 minutes, this one is much shorter than his more recent works. However, you could of course also see this one and the sequel as one movie and then it would be a 4-hour watch. I am truly surprised this film here did not score any Academy Award nominations, especially in categories such as Cinematography, Art Direction or Costume. It's top-notch in these areas and same goes for Thurman as lead actress. I am generally not even a big fan of her really, but she was amazing in this one.

Tarantino pays tribute to a wide array of his favorite influences in the picture, and it's a twist to see him in action parodying martial arts and spaghetti Western flicks of the Seventies with more gore and violence than either of those genres ever offered. Did you notice the cereal box that Copperhead Vernita (Vivica A. Fox) used to stealthily ambush The Bride (Thurman) in her kitchen? - it was Kaboom! How great was that? ",
53,26 October 2003,rich-106,1, Kill Quentin; why KB1 stinks,"I'm a Tarantino fan. KB1 stinks. Empty dialogue, weak characters, weak plot, tedious fight scenes are the reasons. The yellow suit the Bride wears was ugly. The seemingly endless shot of her toes was boring. The fight scenes were bloody but without any ingenuity, just being faster than the opponent. Many many other Asian martial arts films are much more clever and fun even though they are subtitled such the Blind Swordsman series. The out of sequence flashback approach was confusing and unnecessary. The chapter title and narration slowed up the movie as well. This movie was not a satire, not a homage, not camp, and broke no new ground. Several repulsive ideas in the film including slaughtering a mother in front of her child, sex with a comatose woman, and (GoGo)stabbing a man for no particular reason. There's an animation sequence and a B/W sequence thrown in for the hell of it. I want my money back.  1 of 10.",
54,2 March 2006,Hitchcoc,5, Someone must be in between,"Did everyone either love this or despise it? I watched this with my son shortly after he had had four wisdom teeth removed. He was on pain killers--I was keeping him company and he asked me to rent this. He's much more savvy than I am toward these things. It was intriguing--Quentin Trantino's blood fest. Now, is this a ballet or a movie, because if one does not suspend disbelief (even at the bedrock of the thing) this is just ridiculous. Arms severed, blood flying, one gory scene after another, one trying to outdo the previous one. As with most of this stuff, anyone who has ever banged his shin or cut himself, knows that it takes very little to disable a human being. So, if you go ahead and accept that human beings can handle this, then you move right into fantasy, and as I said, a ballet of violence. Choreographed as are most martial arts movies, it works as a meandering blood portrait, a Jackson Pollock of gore. Numbers mean nothing. One person defeats an army. The army simply widens the landscape and the dance continues. Is there anyone in this movie we care about. I can't think of one. Enlighten me. Everything escalates and we are left with one last part of the ballet.",
55,18 February 2005,majikstl,2," Shrill swill, nil skill, will still fill ill Kill Bill ...","((((SPOILERS)))) I am convinced that Quentin Tarantino, at some point in his charmed life, sold his soul to the devil. There is no other way to explain how someone with such limited talent, lack of vision, poor taste and apparent bloodlust can, not only find huge success in making movies, but earn an astonishing amount of critical praise as a genius. He turns out unmitigated junk like KILL BILL (Vol. 1 & 2), and the only possible, logical reason for it being embraced is that Satan has stepped in and worked the blackest of black magic. QT had better enjoy his success, because someday he may have to pay. ",
56,17 July 2013,mdenvee,1, KILL BILL Vol 1.. in fact kill both films.. please.,"Yet another example of creative film making which had the potential to be fantastic but ended up miserable. Kill Bill Vol 1 (and Vol 2 for that matter) is an ponderous, pretentious, overlong, disappointing revenge drama which clearly and easily could have been saved via the normal efforts of a decent story or objective movie editor who was NOT Mr. Tarantino or influenced by him. I believe Tarantino, like Lucas and many other notables, do their best work when they do not have too much control over the story and pacing. KB has many fine points- an original plot, great casting, music, great camera work. But, fails completely in the script, pacing, and yes the action sequences, which are vital to the creation of a good movie especially of this genre. The scripts were all too 'contrived', boring, irrelevant and unnatural for the characters- too brooding and deeply philosophical, which was as distracting as it was annoying. And Tarantino seems to have this arrogant assumption that we love his pretentious dialogues (and inner monologues) as much as he does. The character development was insufficient- primarily Uma's who is supposed to be such a deadly assassin yet there is little or no back story which validates this. It would have been invaluable to have included some earlier scenes with Uma as the warrior/assassin she proves ONCE (and only once) in the ridiculous Crazy 88 fight sequence- but that is a sequence which is unconvincing because watching her slice up 88 stupid bodyguards is boring. So, instead of having one of the slowest-paced movies I have ever watched, simply speed things up a little (such as that painfully slow animated O-Ren sequence and in other areas) and add in some assassin background on Uma. I enjoyed the fight scene of O-Rens personal bodyguard in Vol 1 and the all-too-short training scene in Vol 2 with the Kung Fu master, but that was not really showing Uma as this assassin, nor unbeatable swordmaster. In fact, probably my biggest pet peeve of the both KBs is the odd fact that neither film shows any real sword fighting or special combat scenes among the ""master"" assassins. There is plenty of ""talk"" throughout both films about sword fighting, etc, but ALL the scenes (except that long, repetitive, implausible fight scene with the 88s) involved quick sequences, usually in tight quarters. THINK ABOUT IT- all the people on her list were killed quickly and without any real martial arts!!! O-Ren, Elle, Green, and Bill all were killed by Kiddo (Uma) quickly and with hardly any sword play! Yes, there was a very brief sword fight with O-Ren... but with all the build-up of O-Ren's ability, I would have expected their sword fight to be 3x longer at least and more exciting- instead of spending 30 minutes watching Uma fighting 100s of stupid bodyguard ninjas, and all attacking her one at a time! This made no sense and for me, ruined the movie, since I would have expected all the villains on Uma's list to be killed in true martial arts combat scenes with SWORDS- since they spend both movies talking endlessly about Hattori Hanzo swords! In addition to O-Ren being killed easily with only a few swings of Uma's sword, Green is killed boringly inside her house (despite ""talking"" about scheduling a knife fight), Elle is killed AGAIN inside a small cramp house without even one swing of either of their Hanzo amazing swords- yawn, yawn. All the fights were more of a street brawl or cat fight than a kung fu battle. Why not go outside for a real fight?? And Budd was killed by Elle (not even by Uma- again boring!). Bill, the ultimate villain, is killed in seconds by Uma with a cool, but all too quick heart explosion trick... after the audience sits through yet another excruciatingly slow pontificating dialogue between them. In both films, there is nothing to validate how deadly and masterful a fighter Bill is!! Geez. All in all, KB is a film which had great potential, but a misguided director and writers/editors who gave the audience no real kung fu or sword fight scenes among the main characters and thus left us with never really seeing any impressive swordplay or hand to hand kung fu. Instead, we have a boring, unsatisfying film. A shame.",

To me his films seem to have a kind of smirking self-consciousness, a smug ""cool"" cleverness to them that irritates me. However, to his credit, ""Reservoir Dogs"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Pulp Fiction"" did have a few moments of dialog that i actually thought were almost as clever as Tarantino obviously thought they were. But ""Kill Bill""? Not a clever line in sight. Quite the opposite, really. The film contained what had to be some of the dumbest dialog i have ever heard. The whole film was like a continuous stream of terrible one-liners and recycled kung-fu clichés. I know, i know, a lot of people found it entertaining, but personally i found it rather boring in it's own hyper-adrenaline way. I need a bit of substance in my films for me to find them engaging, and really, can you honestly say that ""Kill Bill"" had anything resembling substance? Did it even have a real plot that takes more than a sentence to explain? Or even an original, interesting idea? This movie is all flash, and flash alone doesn't get you anywhere in my book.",

People come back watching a movie several time when the plot is complicate (this is enough easy also for dumb or  impaired people but here we get a very simple plot with almost no dialog. 2)Ronin 47 from Sacramento wrote `In a nutshell, the best movie I've seen in 5 years (****) `.

The plot is as simple as a 3rd world movie and the duels seem slow and banal after what we saw in The Matrix or Crouching Tiger. I guess that all those people have been to the movie theatre very rarely in the last 5 years.

70,12 April 2006,tom-darwin,1," Ill Chills, Li'l Thrills, at Facile Bill's Kill Mill","It's a measure of how far you've come in the world when you can drive around in a flaming yellow truck with ""PUSSY WAGON"" in big letters and still have all Hollywood's A-list babes begging to be in your films. It's not a good sign of how far either the entertainment industry or society has come, but let it go. Fine-tuned professional assassin The Bride (Thurman) leaves her coven of knife-wielding Girl Scouts for the white picket fence but is murdered during her wedding by her erstwhile sisterhood, on the orders of their master, silkily manipulative neo-ninja Bill (Carradine, who can't be blamed because he sold out a long time ago). Trouble is, they didn't kill her dead enough. After a long, sexually abused coma (we're only just getting started, pilgrims) she recovers and embarks on a Revenge Quest, hunting down Charlie's Fallen Angels one by one, each encounter leading her closer to putting Chilly Bill on the backyard grill. Does she have more in mind for Bill than just an evening with sharp-edged kitchen appliances? Revenge is a dish best served liquefied, however, and if The Bride triumphs over her old girlfriends (I used to hang out with these trollops? she seems to be thinking), it won't happen without spilling more blood than the Exxon Valdez had crude. This film is too contrived even to be condemned as misogynistic, with the girls's unreal slicing/dicing cutesy machismo contrasting so crazily with their meek subservience to the sedentary Bill (Tarantino might have called him Dick, but that gag's been done) that, if you buy into it, you may be so confused as to need a remedial class in Gender Stereotyping. If so, try ""An Affair to Remember"" followed by ""Tarzan & His Mate."" That this film has nothing original is an understatement akin to saying that Enron was dishonest. No longer content to just ape the budget filmmakers of the past, Tarantino now embarks on a frenetic jamfest of the old cheapies. This includes, but is not limited to: TV, chopsockey, ninja-samurai, Spaghetti Western, anime, film noir, exploitation, sexploitation, blaxploitation and cereal commercials (""Silly Rabbit!""). I'll never eat Trix nor watch Speed Racer again without the dry heaves. I also won't easily take Thurman, Liu, Basinger or Fox seriously again (can you say ""Typecast?"" Good!), despite their demonstrated talent & considerable past accomplishments. No schoolgirls lick the spilled blood off each other, so Tarantino is evidently still too uptight for lesbian vampire flicks, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" notwithstanding. And he hasn't taken a swipe at Sesame Street yet. An artist must have standards, right? (I just hope a deadly Asian swordmaiden named Cookie Munster and her lovable but dumb boyfriend Biggy Byrde aren't in our cinematic future). He still hasn't redone it all (""Truck Turner"" featured sex slavery & a lynched cat) but what he's redone is impressive, if tasteless. Unfortunately, the old cheapies were only made to give a few fast thrills in exchange for a couple of fast bucks. What charm they had, such as Isaac Hayes's glowering presence, Lee Van Cleef's steely smugness, Michelle Yeoh's sexy ferocity & Bruce Lee's matchless, butt-kicking art, was incidental--someone would have done those scripts, if they hadn't. You could take them or leave them, but ""Kill Bill"" rubs into our faces a sense that we are being honored with an interpretation of a high art form. It just isn't there. Wanna watch ""Kill Bill?"" Get a party mix of Cap'n Crunch, Count Chocula and Lucky Charms and do shooters of Jolt Cola in Quik Strawberry mix. I Dare ya! I DOUBLE Dare ya!

This movie is plain and simply unwatchable.  It has the same badly and unbelievable action scenes, extremely corny dialogue, and an almost complete lack of plot. If this movie had been a foreign import, instead of coming from a cult filmmaker, it would be sitting collecting dust in the C section of your video store, probably right next to the pornos. The Matrix and the Run Lola Run movies were cool in that they mixed genres in truly original and entertaining ways.  Tarantino just makes a pathetic attempt at copying those films, trying to recover the aura of genious that he earned with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and later lost with all his other films. There's plenty of gimmicks in this one to spare:  amputated limbs and decapitations that quickly become hilarious, anime thrown in for no reason, a final battle in black and white, and Tarantino's trademark of non-linear storytelling... take away that, and quite frankly, you will be left with not much more.",

A lot of it is based on people reverentially pulling swords out of sheaths and then pushing them back in, and similar ripponese mummery.

102,4 April 2020,aidanratesmovies,9," A very impressive work, despite its flaws","Although cleverly styled, and filled with some fantastic performances and direction, Kill Bill Vol. 1 suffers most from trying to find its tone through its clever, although complex storyline. Quentin Tarantino has no doubt made another very impressive film, and one that will be surely admired. However, Vol. 1 of this series of films is by far the weaker half. The film struggles with finding which tone to take, balancing many ideas, but never sticking to one, and it is because of this that the film can sometimes feel a bit frustrating or hard to follow. That being said, there is plenty of impressive moments in the film to catch your eye. The action sequences are fantastic, although a little drawn out. Uma Thurman shines as her character the Bride, and truly brings the much needed lifeforce to this revenge driven story. The writing can be a bit messy, but is very interesting concept wise, and very intriguing to follow. In the end, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is an impressive accomplishment, bogged down by a few hard moments.

Well, I think that the whole story of this film is just very superficial (simple story of vengeance), has many lacks of logic (as the main actress escapes from the hospital after having been in a coma)and is mostly focused on some gore effects and exaggerated fight scenes without any Asian elegance or philosophy (the almost endless fight scene around the fountain of blood). Sometimes, I think that an aggressive teenager who likes some gore and splatter horror movies and some fight movies in the key of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jean-Claude van Damme rather that Ti Lung or David Chiang had the idea of such a movie, but not a adult who knows the whole genre and has an IQ of 160.",

111,12 April 2021,CadeFilms,9, Tarantino Fully Embraces The FUN Of Cinema,"Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Vol. 1 was the director's first departure from grounded crime dramas into over-stylized displays of chaotic enjoyment. Now, there was a definite need to switch it up from the genre he had explored prior through three films in a row. Fortunately, it does succeed in giving its audience an unrealistically bloody experience of pure cinematic fun. However, Tarantino had STILL at this point not realized that suspense is one of the most important aspects associated with great storytelling. During the final shots of the film's first sequence, the audience is shown that The Bride has already killed the main antagonist (of volume one)! Now, there is no suspense as to whether or not O-Ren is killed at the end of the movie. This is insanely detrimental to the story since their encounter takes up the entire last act. Furthermore, Tarantino then fails at trying to establish suspense at the closing moment of the film through revealing that The Bride's child is alive. However, its inclusion is unnecessarily cheesy and ruins what could have been an amazing moment of the second volume. Why did the audience have to know that her child was alive before she did? It would have been much more impactful to experience this revelation at the same time as the film's protagonist. Besides a lack of suspense, the only other problems with Kill Bill: Vol. 1 are very minimal. The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad should all have had equal introductions. Why was Copperhead not given the same yellow header as the only other two assassins introduced in the film? Finally, The Bride needs to learn her directions since Sophie was definitely standing to O-Ren's left, not her right. Anyways, ignore some tiny mistakes and try to grasp onto your own sense of suspense so that you can get ready to watch an exhilarating film of epic action, entertaining world-building, and a very distinct style that only Tarantino can perfect.",

Only when her stunt double took over did we see some decent moves. I thought maybe Lucy Liu would put up a decent fight but that one was also disappointing.

Quentin is a movie lover, and this movie is his ultimate homage to his movie library of favorites. Yet I found somehow deviated of what his sense of homage is. ¿Is his tribute to Old Westerns Spaghettis and Oriental Films just a pastiche of unnecessary blood, mistaken for art, and his intended ""cool"" characters lose flame as they blade swords into rambling, yet somehow interesting fights? ¿Have we granted permission to Quentin to do as he pleases with the camera? The Power we gave to Quentin led him to believe he could enjoy the Midas Touch. His handling on the filmical elements are wonderful, yet the movie lacks a message and a clear concept more than a mixed tribute. His passion overwhelmed him and audience accepts it as a work of art by a master mind. I'll grant you the latter.

If you've ever seen a Tarantino movie, you just about know what you're getting: violence, killer dialogue, beautiful cinematography, astounding score... feet shots. And this movie gives it all in abundance.
This was a really exciting movie. I found myself on the edge of my seat, eyes fixated on the screen, distractions coming up left and right around me and on my phone, but my eyes refusing to look away from the screen for fear of missing something.
There's not a second of screen time wasted in this film. Tarantino gets right to the point, telling his story without gimmick and leaving the audience genuinely wanting more (lucky, at the time of my watching, Volume 2 is also available for immediate watching so the ending doesn't leave too much of a cliffhanger for me).
Some of the creative choices behind this movie are unique and also add to the charm of the film. The decision to strip certain scenes of their color or to portray certain scenes using anime were extremely interesting and added a certain extra kick to the films that is uniquely Tarantino.
This was a fantastic bloodbath of a revenge story that delivered just the right amount of everything it needed to be a true cinematic success. Quentin Tarantino once again proves himself incapable of producing a ""bad"" movie.",

And 2, I agree with his logic now of splitting his epic in two parts, if only because of the climactic battle between The Bride and the Crazy 88 fighters- any attempt to top this within the same time frame of a three hour+ motion picture is ridiculous. By doing so, Tarantino leaves us with one of the most violent (and I mean that as a compliment, since when violence is frowned upon in movies that means it's impressive instead of tongue-in-cheek like in horror films), visceral, and definitely entertaining films of the year.

What little bit of plot that you do have is simple and just used as a tool to bring you to the next homage from QT. You can't really judge this film on the acting either since it is a tribute to films that really aren't known for acting and KB 1 surely doesn't break the mold. The blood shooting out like a fountain was funny the first time but becomes increasingly absurd after it was shown over and over. The action scenes aren't and are shot very well.

Money and pretty sick ego became his priority. In this film he is convinced that he is at least equal to Sergio Leone so he introduced Jackie Chan to Clint Eastwood, which requires IQ of 40 or lower to love this poor and shallow filming.

153,11 November 2009,michael_the_nermal,7, A Film for Film Buffs----Casual Movie-Goers Beware!,"After having seen ""Resevoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" and Grindhouse"", along with this movie, I can safely assume that Quentin Tarantino makes movies for those in the know about crime dramas, martial arts films, ivory tower academic analysis of pop culture and ""the aesthetics of violence"", and '70s TV shows. Those who are not familiar with any of the four subjects will not understand Tarantino's movies, nor are they likely to fully enjoy them. I, myself, am not a film buff, but merely a casual movie-viewer, much like the general public. I have not seen many crime dramas or martial arts movies, and my knowledge of '70s TV shows is limited to the sitcoms that aired on Nick-at-Nite and TV Land. I spent some time in the ivory tower to obtain a liberal-arts degree, but it was not in film, sociology or any degree which would help me understand film-as-art, much less the concept of the ""aesthetitization of violence"" in art. As a result, Tarantino's films, and ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" in particular, make little sense to me. Not having a film degree or an IQ above 120, I will attempt to judge ""Kill Bill"" as I see it, solely on its own merits as entertainment and as a story.",
154,27 April 2023,freethinkingworld,7, After Thoughts,Pretty Solid! I've missed this huge film of Quentin Tarantino's for a while and finally got around to watching it. It was fun and definitely had a lot of Tarantino type stuff in it. To me I think this and Vol 2 will have been the weakest of Tarantino's work for me personally so far. That's not a bad thing as Tarantino is a master at film directing and writing. So his weakest is most people's strongest. The action was fantastic and the casting was pretty good. I loved the look of it. But I struggled with some of the darker moments. I don't want to rally say exactly what it is but if you've seen the movie you know what it is (when she wakes up from her coma). It's just a subject I personally have a hard time with so it just makes a film less watchable if it's in there for me.,

It looks like this movie is produced when the director has never known how to make it. Avoid this. You will find nothing inside. No emotion, No action, No inspiration, No conversation.

The difference being that, at that time, there really was a story, there really was suspense, and whoever the characters, they all seemed human. In other words, they had FEELINGS. Tarantino seems so much hypnotized by style, that unless you're not a movie-freak, there is no way in which you can't keep on noticing references after references of a superficially exploited collection of stylish movements (mangas, comic strips, Samurai movies, pop culture, watered down atmospheres specific to such or such director, etc.)",

The rest is typical Quentin Tarantino with him pushing the actors for forced and contrived performances which bury the plot which is ludicrous and yet ends up boring by midway anyway. Tarantino often makes movies that make me cringe, and this was one of the ones that really set up the pattern in his filmography for brutal action with nasty one-liners.

When Lucy Liu's character cut off that man's head and the blood shot out. everyone in the room laughed, EVERYONE, and why? Because it looked so fake. The dialogue was appalling, the plot was just an excuse to fill the room with fake blood and try and make the elderly die of fear. An example of the awful dialogue was the scene where Uma arranges a fight with the assassin, at the beginning. They agree to meet in a ball park. This is roughly what it was like Uma: Where? Woman: In the park I coach a team there? Uma: Weapon of choice? Woman: Knives Uma: They always said you were the best with knives. Woman: see you there. Suddenly they kill each other, that burst of action grabbed my attention but it was so crap that it didn't keep it. The woman's little girl walks in, if you are meant to feel sorry for her you don't, Uma: I didn't mean for you to find out. If you feel beaten up about it, come and kill me someday. Cue another a film. I just pray that kid does kill her. The dialogue sounded like a fan written script for a t.v series e.g star trek or something. And sounded like a computer game, weapon of choice? If only Uma could act, the only people I know who like this film are either film addicts who like every film or people who think they are cool for liking this film.

Some western characters are trying to show off as if they were Bruce Lees, Sonny Chibas or Jackie Chans. One matter makes me real uneasy: this piece dealing with second-hand trifle things, which we saw before in other movies, occupies a place of honour on IMDb top 250 list. And note that poor wire stunt on the railing (when the Japanese guy flew horizontally around the main heroine during combat) - that looked so amateurish and goofy.

From what I understand (although the only other Tarantino movie I've seen is Reservoir Dogs), this movie isn't like his other movies because his other movies capture real life violence, and as Quentin says, ""This is the kind of movie characters in his other movies would go to see."" This is because the characters in his other movies are very violent, and they would want to see movies that are violent in a comic book way (Tarantino is excellent at dramatic sampling, and one of the great things he does in this movie was add an interesting black and white cartoon sequence for Lucy Liu's character). This movie is also divided into sections which also adds to the comic book feel.",

Uma Thurman is a horrible actress. And in her leading role, she is in a coma for several years, and then wakes up to kick some baddies, and is completely invincible. The ironic thing is; the fight scenes are terrible. The movements are so stock and regular for a martial arts movie - and the blood looks silly. I can't take this movie serious.",

Tarantino makes it well known that this film is his as he does in all of his films, where he makes it known that he is more important himself than his actual films or the actors acting in his films. Obviously self-righteous but as a high level profile as himself, one is able to do that. ",

181,6 March 2010,Ziya90,10, The perfect mixture of art and entertainment,"I did not know that this movie has also a lot of haters who gave it only 1. I am not a blind Tarantino fan who gives every Tarantino movie 10 out of 10 and I am not one of the critics who try to cover up the flaws in his movies, but we should accept that he is a very good filmmaker. Personally, my favorite Quentin Tarantino film by far is Kill Bill Volume 1. It is quintessential cinema, also a pure mixture of art and entertainment. Kill Bill Vol. 1 has one of the best opening sequences ever, black and white visuals and that great music. I believe that put his directing talent aside, there are two things that he is great at: writing dialogs and music. Like Romance and Cigarettes, Kill Bill is a music collage from the old goods. All the tracks are great and the important thing, so coherent with the content. Visually and even including content, Kill Bill is one of the most colorful movies so far. This was the first cat fight I saw and probably there is not any other better. It seems that to shoot a cat fight scene is very hard rather than planned choreography. People don't fight in front of children in this movie, I know that Tarantino is not such a sensitive director, but I appreciated it. The second part of the movie is like a very stylish modern Western like No Country for Old Men. It is slow paced like Once Upon a Time in the West etc. The plot of the movie is also one of the most engaging and exciting ones, a revenge movie wouldn't be better. As for the anime, how a creative director Tarantino is. I had not seen any anime before, it made me like anime. However, this is quintessential anime, so my favorite in short length. Honestly, still I am not an anime buff at all and I haven't seen anime for a long time, but this is special for me, I watch it as occasion serves. The assassination part was too short, at least to me, because I did not want it end, that's the only problem. The maps recall atari games. Animes, atari games, Tarantino uses all of them. When I was a child, I loved the scenes in the movies which the hero of the movie chooses a weapon, sword from the collection, for example Red Sonja. While watching Kill Bill, I recalled Red Sonja. The story editing after the bride goes to Japan is weird (from the plane till the motorbike), in other words, there are time lapses, but this is not a flaw, it does not make us feel like the editing is scratchy and may be otherwise, the movie might have been pretty cliché, but still Tarantino could added somethings. The sword fights in this movie is the greatest, the longest, the most entertaining one and the most stylish one. I forgot how many times I watched this chapter, almost 50 from 2003 till now? The violence here is not sick at all, like Hostels or Rambo 4, it is not 'explotationish' like Saw movies and it is not disturbing like Romero's zombie movies, yes it is extremely bloody and violent, but somehow looks pure mixture of art and entertainment. It also deserves to be put in action cinema anthology. Especially editing and choreography is great. The last chapter. The place, atmosphere had seemed me superficial when I watched the movie for the first time at theater, but after, I thought that may be it is supposed to be. This chapter is so reposeful and still, it is like relieving tiredness part, not only for the characters, but also for us. Then, great Spanish-like music and Carnage of Flowers, my favorite track. By the way, I couldn't decipher the meaning of the ewer. As for the ending, one of the most impressive finals ever!",
182,15 May 2006,Skullen,4, bad,"Erm, this is pretty bad actually. I like R Dogs, P Fiction and J Brown but this and its sequel have none of the imagination or style of those other films. Uma is good as usual and there are a couple of good shots but the plot is awful, no characterisation, the fight scenes (they aison d'etre of the film surely) are feeble compared to Crouching Tiger (the actors just aren't up to the physicality of it all - even the Matrix had better fights) and the dialogue is dull as well. Basically QT thinks he's such a genius he can do anything and no one around him will dare to tell him otherwise. A pretty pointless way to spend a couple of hours in all.",

Kill Bill has nothing to offer in comparison to a whole lot of other violent movies. Everything I liked about the previous films of Tarantino was missing. Intelligent plot and humor, very good acting, characters with depth, and I could go on, were all missing. The whole movie was a big cliché. Tarantino probably did that on purpose, but then still intentional boring clichés are still boring. Not to say that KB is not well made in a technical sense.

There isn't a wasted piece of film anywhere. Uma Thurman surprised me. I've never had much reaction to her before, aside from Pulp Fiction. She's quite effective whether she's trying to move her big toe or slash another of the 88. I've got to buy the soundtrack. Who'd believe that you could have music of Zamfir (the pan flute guy) and the theme from Ironside in the same film?The dialogue is priceless and reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"". Half smart ass vulgarity, half philosophical musings. I can't wait for Vol. 2. I think I'll have to see it in the theatre. Excellent Tarantino.",
185,12 October 2003,Mrswing,1, Kill Quentin... Please!,"It takes 6 years to come up with THIS? A plotless piece of crap, with non-existent characters, dialogue which is embarrassingly bad (WHY do people still think that QT is a great writer because he uses the f-word as often as possible in his dialogue???), no drive, no tension, only TWO fight scenes, none of which is anything special - the first Uma Thurman/Vivica Fox is a weak rethread of countless superior indoor catfights from Hong Kong B-movies circa 1990 (pick up almost any Moon Lee/Yukari Oshima film and you'll know what I'm talking about), the second is a long slash-fest featuring a lot of black-and-white gore (WHY? it's not like the source movies were in black-and-white) but which once again has no build-up, no excitement outside of shock value (see Uma rip an eyeball out!). The wirework is extremely shoddy (unless that's another deliberate homage of course), no one impresses with any move (not even Liu Chia Hui), Uma is clearly doubled a lot, and there is simply not a single 'wow'-moment martial arts-wise (fans of dismemberment will enjoy the scene, though). Why Yuen Wo-Ping was needed here beats me - any American choreographer who had watched enough early seventies samurai and kung fu films could have put these fights together. And how anyone can talk about an adrenaline-drenched ride when you get only two action set-pieces beats me - especially since the rest of the film has nothing to offer except 'look at how clever I am'-homage ripoffs and (admittedly) a fun soundtrack. When I read the ecstatic reviews this films has gotten I get the impression people are talking about the film they wanted to have seen rather than the film they saw. Moreover, the action quotient in part 2 will be even less than in part 1 - so here's a new theory on why the film was cut into two halves: it's just too damn boring to watch in one go!",

The mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there. However, an ancient proverb states, that ""if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living, then woe betide those who put it there."" Such is the premise of Kill Bill. Once part of an elite group of world wide assassins, 'B.B', the victim, {Uma Thurman} awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her. Throughout the rest of the film, viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the world's most venomous snakes. Not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered, "" Black Manba"" as B.B. was code named, (The deadliest snake) goes after each of the assassins. It has been suggested, were Bruce Lee to have lived, this vehicle would have been his. Instead, the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action Director Quinton Tarentino. From the first to the last, exciting sub-plots and well-choreographed martial arts scenes give this film it's special quality. The main target of B.B.'s revenge is of course none other than Master (Kung Fu) David Carradine as Bill. It is he and his 'Snake"" team which consists of Lucy Liu who plays O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and Michael Madson who now become the intended targets. Interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex, exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action.

So this fits the bill perfectly, ho ho ho. Virtually every scene has the usual cheese soaked dialogue, the macho one liners, the stereotypical characters; including my favourite - the Japanese school girl assassin! Oh the sheer mundane, cheesy crap of it makes me want to hurl. I'm really not sure what Tarantino was on when he made this but it surely must have been hallucinogenic and must have caused brain damage. This movie sucked. The absolutely comic amount of severed limbs, heads and fountains of blood were like something out of a bad B movie horror from the mid 80s. Virtually every character has been lifted, no scratch that, STOLEN from anime movies. It's like a bad kung fu movie - oh wait it IS a bad kung fu movie.",

203,26 October 2005,kylopod,4, Not up to Tarantino's usual standards,"Roger Ebert once wrote that Quentin Tarantino could make a bad film but could never make a boring film. Well, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a boring film. Above all, it's monotonous, because most of the film is just a lengthy series of fights lacking any context that would allow us to side with one character over another. Worst of all, the heroine is presented as some kind of Unstoppable Force whom no one stands a chance against, especially males. This premise reaches the height of absurdity when she takes on a few hundred fighters at the same time. Now, I'm no big fan of ""The Matrix"" or its sequels, but the scene where Neo battles a hoard of Agent Smiths at least makes sense within the rules the story has established. There is nothing to explain why Uma Thurman's character is so powerful. We're just forced to accept that she's this invincible killing machine, a premise that robs of the film of one of the crucial ingredients of suspense, which is that the main character faces a challenge.",

The second important point is that the movie was deliberately chopped in half in order to cash in on those drooling gore seekers that are too ignorant to realize they are being had.  I expected more substance from Tarantino than mindless violence.  Pulp fiction had lots of violence but it had it's place in that movie.  This film is pandering to the lowest common denominator.

Tarantino believed that people wouldn't be able to handle a 3-and-a-half hour Kill Bill film, which is ridiculous because, bringing up Lord Of The Rings again, I know that many people went to see screenings of all 3 LOTR films back-to-back. Now that's one long movie, go ahead and do the math, and that just shows how devoted fans can be. And now, Tarantino has ripped off his loyal fans, charging two separate prices for one film.

213,18 November 2003,b_wooster,1, What a shame,"It's a real shame that people are so easily led astray. Kill Bill was the movie equivalent of of a Sean Combs song. Nothing original, just ""samples"" that attempt to draw similar feelings that the viewers/listeners may have felt when they first saw/heard the subject matter. The real shame is that when I look back at the other Tarantino ""classics"" that I genuinely enjoyed before I find that by and large they suffer from a similar malady. The main difference is that the other three films at least have compelling dialog and some attempt at subtext. Kill Bill was the kind of mindless schlock that I can generally avoid since I stopped watching predictable action cartoons when I was 12. It was particularly sad to see the ham-fisted attempts to create interest in its characters. The way in which Tarantino practically clubs us over the head with the fact that we don't know Thurman's character's name, for instance, seems particularly amateurish when compared with David Fincher's handling of the same sort of device in Fight Club where, if it weren't for the scene where Helen Bonham Carter's character brings it up, you could watch the movie multiple times and probably not notice that you never learn the main character's name. My advice to movie viewers everywhere is that rather than watch a movie that is a remake or ""homage"" to another movie or genre of movies, just watch the originals. They are almost always better, anyway.",

That Tarantino planned at one point to release both ""volumes"" as one three-hour film is astonishing. After the first hundred severed limbs, I couldn't stop yawning. With its inexorable cartoon violence; the predictable BS posturing of virtually every major character; and the obvious trajectory of its threadbare plot, Bill is technically flawless, emotionally antiseptic, and dramatically dormant. Clearly, QT has spent himself.  To be fair, Reservoir Dogs was a masterpiece; Pulp Fiction, audacious and brilliant...tick tock tick tock... Then Jackie Brown, a nice adaptation, but hardly earth shaking.  And now comes Bill, which owes everything to cheesy, grade-C, 1970s Japanese fight-flicks.  Buckets of blood and meat-grinding mayhem do not of themselves make for scintillating cinema.  The trick that eludes Tarantino is how to keep the viewers' attention while he attempts a hybrid of Seven Samauri and the World Wrestling Federation.  The sensual aspects alone should have been enough to sustain interest, but no.  Ultimately, Bill becomes an exercise in fever-pitched tedium.  Perfecting the cinematic equivalent of crap is hardly an achievement, no matter how well-crafted the montages.",

Still, I even skipped the most parts of the final ""fights"". ( I skip very rarely ) I almost get attached to all characters except her. No story whatsoever. And why would she assume that her kid isn't alive? she didn't even asked. I wasn't surprised by the last information in the movie. Someone killed in a hospital, 13 hours later, no one found out. Few months later, no one said where is the patient ( and check the country entrances and exits ) and no one bothered about Buck's car. Oh yeah, his car is invisible, just an ordinary one! A katana cut be another is rather I don't know! ( I have a katana, well I used to, when confiscated by the customs service ).",

Tarantino has enormous skill and, obviously, loves movies but has wasted his, and my, time.  Unlike Pulp Fiction which had exceptional character development and dialog along with graphic violence, all this movie has is highly stylized, but also highly graphic, violence.  In Pulp Fiction I cared about the characters and the story; all that was of interest here is how would Tarantino spectacularly present the next decapitation or dismemberment.  Some great visuals and sound, but overall: absurd -- and disappointing.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of martial arts movies, you should love Kill Bill.",

And that's being generous.  It's actually a white chick holding a samurai sword, swinging it wildly occasionally while being surrounded by talented actor/martial artists like Sonny Chiba and Gordon Lui.  Tarantino completely wasted the talents of Yuen Woo Ping by putting an uncoordinated sloth in the title roll. And yes IT IS a kung-fu film, every interview Tarantino does he calls it a Kung-fu flick.

So do I. But sometimes these unreal element get too many and too blatant to accept or just ignore them! This movie is a fine example to that! Starting with the protagonist waking up from years long coma by a damn mosquito bite!!! Then she carries her sword around openly as if it was some harmless toy, and nobody cares about it. She can even bring it up on a plane! And when it gets to a fight, everyone stand against her with mêlée weapons (mostly swords) as if it would be in the Middle Ages and not the 21st century. There isn't a single gun in the whole movie (except for a toy shotgun which fired popcorn at the protagonist, obviously not hurting her)! And these are just the most blatant bull****s, there are many more! The movie fails morally too: every single person in it are violent a**holes, the good guys are as bad (or even worse) as the bad guys. Actually, by the standards of the protagonist, slaughtering people for the smallest insult makes you good - as we see it by the introduction of the Yakuza leaders personal bodyguard: a 16 yo girl, who is ""mature"" and ""good"", because she gutted a guy who wanted to get her laid. And of course our heroine is really good by this standard, she mutilated horribly (or killed, I don't remember) 2 people right in the first minute after she regained consciousness. (Not to be confused with conscience, because she never regained that - assuming she had any to begin with!) Then she murders a mother in front of her little daughter, and in the end she chops off a few hundred limbs (and has fun doing it).

This shameless self-ploitation film is unbearable for its horrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and bare-floor plot. Its celebrated cinematography, no doubt, is breathtaking. But this is a film, not a painting, and it can't rely solely on its visual elements to carry it forward (in this way it is excruciatingly similar to Eyes Wide Shut, another ego-trip from an otherwise immortal director). The cut is especially deep in that it is ranked ahead of films like Raging Bull, Ran, and Tarantino's own Reservoir Dogs (up there with Pulp Fiction for his best).

Since then, however, I've seen a lot of the sort of films that Tarantino took influence from when it came to this film, and upon a repeat viewing of this first instalment of 'Kill Bill', while my niggles are still there; I enjoyed it much more this time around and have to say that Tarantino definitely achieved what he set out to. The film is an amalgamation of the sorts of films that Tarantino loves, all strung round a revenge theme. Clear influence comes from the martial arts, pinky violence, exploitation and western genres. The plot is exceptionally simple and focuses on a wedding day massacre at the hands of a group of people known as 'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad'.

But it's still well crafted although it doesn't have much substance and the dialogue isn't THAT great, which Tarantino films are known for. It also follows Tarantino's trademark of not going in the chronological order, which makes the film better because it gets more anticipating to find out how Uma Thurman's character got to those points. The first vol starts out with a bang, literally and metaphorically, it's action packed with a lot of blood and fighting, mainly in order to get the audiences attention. I also liked the mix of Asian cinema style in this, but gives it his own style a bit. The visual and the style is the main highlight of this movie, and it's mainly the reason I enjoyed this movie.

First of all, what I want to say is that Kill Bill: Volume 2 needs to be watched in order for the movie to be understood and achieve its purpose. Because the film is actually one film, but because it was too long, it was divided into two parts, and it is already recorded as Quentin Tarantino's fourth film. The division of the film into episodes reinforced its watchability. As the authorities say, you'll be full of action with the incredibly beautiful sword scenes. The animation, which came as a surprise to me in the movie, connected me to the movie incredibly. When it comes to acting, Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and others are just as everyone should play. All I have to say to the music is a unique piece of art.

But Tarantino had proved his worth when it came to out and out substance in films.

Uma Thurman is surprisingly well suited for the role of the double-crossed professional killer on a blood vendetta, as she rampages from one gory smackdown to the next without lifting her icy mask for more than a wink and a nod. The plot is simple enough, with Thurman literally carrying a list of the five heads she's out to collect with her from scene to scene, but doubles down on thick atmosphere and detailed dossiers on every major player. Though it's sliced in half with all the abruptness of a katana slash, the story's split doesn't bother me a bit; in a way it's an appropriate intermission, as the two very different halves are able to stand on their own without getting in each other's way.

Uma was so dead it wasnt even funny, then she magically pulls a knife out of nowhere and kills her right as her daughter walks in.

Now for my respect of Quentin I' going to lay off the idiotic idea of adding the rape scene in.

Kill Bill is comic book cinema at it's very best. Directors that try to make comic book's into film would do good to see how QT does it first.

Over all, I would recommend the movie. This is by no means a film for kids, not even with parental supervision. That's the only warning I'll give.

315,16 May 2006,Tokur,1," Man, what happened?","I have to admit, that I am late at being a fan of Quentin Tarantino's ('Pulp Fiction') movies because I haven't come around to watch any of them. I regret not having to view them any time earlier. His three previous movies ('Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown') were the movies that have made me decide to watch this, because all three of them were clever, witty, and entertaining, but most of all, they were all great movies. I also must add 'True Romance' as it is one of my favorite movies of all time, though it wasn't directed by Tarantino. Anyway, though I do enjoy a martial arts movie here and there, this wasn't that entertaining. What happened to all of those shrewd lines he put into his other movies that make you laugh thinking that was witty? The whole point of this movie is revenge that takes a long time to accomplish, and it's not worth my time. All I can say is, this is the worst movie I've seen that was directed by Tarantino. I haven't seen Kill Bill Vol. 2 yet, and I will probably get around it eventually. I hear the story is much more emotional. In that case, when it comes to Kill Bill Vol. 1, I'd rather read a book. -- (1/10)",

The plot may not be engaging for all but for me it was, just an almost murdered woman who lost, or at least thinks she did, her unborn daughter seeking for revenge on those who were involved.
Some of the shots are just amazing, the action is impecable and constant throughout the film, there are almost no flat points, plus we get some doses of comedy here and there.
Either way, even though I liked this so much it still feels a bit incomplete, maybe some scenes were longer than they could have been, therefore making this movie shorter or adding a bit more information, development to the characters or building a stronger structure for the plot.
The fact that this story is also divided in two parts contributes to making the story feeling incomplete, as the film was coming to an end I noticed it as it was slowing down and, somehow, closing this first half of the story, but it just didn't feel all that right to me, I feels, well, incomplete, and it is, but I just wish it wasn't so noticeable.
I made my complaints look a lot bigger than they were, this is just an amazing film, socking from the beginning, exciting action, an incredible and strong protagonist, good humour and a well managed plot (outside of what I've already said). One of the best action films I've ever seen.",

Kill Bill is, without any doubt, the coolest film I've seen in a long, long time. It's more than just a film; it's a truly refreshing experience and an almost complete encyclopedia for cinema buffs to admire. How can you tell a dreadful, déjà-vu tale of revenge and still look innovating and original? Only QT knows the answer to this He saw the change to extend a seemly repetitive plot (a woman awakes after a 4 year coma and avenges herself) with loads of tributes to `dead' film-genres, such as Martial Arts-movies, exploitation and Spaghetti-westerns. The results of this are absolutely amazing and Kill Bill is a film to watch over and over again, without EVER growing tired off. On the contraryit'll only get better with repeated viewings. The characters are typically Tarantino, which means delightfully eccentric and criminally insane. The main characters are the very ingenious `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', led by Bill who's given image to by David Carradine! He's a 70's Kung-Fu legend and Tarantino more or less did the same for him as he did for John Travolta and Pam Grier. Some of the side-characters are highly memorable as well. Gogo, for example! She's a 17-year-old schoolgirl who makes up in madness what she lacks in age. Kill Bill contains less memorable dialogues than previous QT films, but this is widely made up by an overload of terrifically over-the-top violence. The absolute highlights to this being a grotesque finale and a brilliant Manga-tribute. ",

The opening is brutal but the follow up is so good. This movie as you can tell from how many times I've said it, is pretty awesome and good. The reason why is because you feel for Uma Thurman's character. After getting so much taken away, you want to see her get back up and fight. That's the entire movie basically. An Action packed revenge epic. The reason why I say epic is because it feels big. Her journey takes her to a lot of places. Other things I really enjoyed was how the movie was told to us, and also the overall style. The ""feature presentation"" was a nice touch to the opening. The whole theme with samurai and anime inspired aspects was really cool to see play out. Overall this movie has a real action vibe to it.

I'm sorry - I'm sure it's my fault for not liking this movie (I must be missing something), but in my poor limited mind this movie seems gratuitously hateful, mean-spirited, inhumane and glorifying evil deeds. I have seen the first two parts (because friends of mine dragged me to see them) and I have to say that this is just the kind of film that made me not so anxious to go to the movie theatre anymore. This is the kind of genre that not only sickens me and shows me everything that is wrong with the world but also makes me worry that it will inspire sick minds to emulate the same kind of wantonness this movie revels in. In fact, I suspect it already has. I fear that some weak and disturbed minds might not get the ""joke"" in the Kill Bill films (IF they have one; those that like them seem to think they're funny on some level or satires but I don't see anything funny about gruesome scenes and depraved murders) - and these people might go out and repeat what they've seen in them. It's funny - if you recall the furor Warren Beatty's Bonnie And Clyde inspired, for supposedly encouraging and celebrating violence - it's strange that the Kill Bill films didn't also draw the ire of the critics. Quentin Tarantino knows how to make a film, that's for sure - but not the kind of films that I feel should be allowed to be shown. It's films like the Kill Bill films that makes me think the movie industry should exercise more taste and control over what gets released - are there no standards anymore? With movies like these, why wonder why there is so much violence today? (But that makes me seem old-fashioned and an advocate of censorship - not a popular idea in this culture where we worry about the growing violence in our society yet don't ever open our eyes to the likely causes.)",

The gore and violence was over the top but instead of comedic, I found it banal and disturbing.  Sure, the squirting blood was funny in Monty Python, but as with everything in comedy, it's only funny the first time, and then it just gets lame and pretentious.  Tarantino tries to make a homage to martial arts, anime and all sorts of B flick movies, but one gets the feeling that he never understood the soul of those movies.  Martial arts movies are fun to watch because there isn't too much blood, some anime are great because they have good storylines and B movies are fun just because they have over the top dialogue and silly stories. While I have never seen other Tarantino movies, this one doesn't motivate me to run towards my nearest Blockbuster.  As someone else said, this is only a ""juvenile fantasy"" unworthy of the films that it pays homage to. Tarantino's ""style"" is an endless amount of bloodwash and gore, mixed with stolen shots. It is B movies rehashed, but even a homage needs some hint of originality. Unfortunately, Kill Bill sadly lacks in that aspect.

Basically it is a mixed scene story showing why a bride wants to kill someone called Bill. BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Uma Thurman is The Bride, she has a death list for five people, before she faces main target, Bill (David Carradine). This film focuses on her hospital coma, and killing Vernita Green (Independence Day's Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) with her army of masked swordsmen. Also starring Splash's Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, Michael Madsen as Budd, Julie Dreyfus as Sofie Fatale, Chiaki Kuriyama as Gogo Yubari and Michael Bowen as Buck. There is a fantastic Anime cartoon sequence about O-Ren Ishii's assassin past, with blood splashing everywhere. Even the live fight scenes are like a cartoon, e.g. flying to landings, heads being chopped off, and just as much blood! See it for the violence, its almost hilarious. What also makes it a great film is the multi-genre references. It was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for RZA, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Sound.

Whilst I'm sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them, they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who don't. Neither Kill Bill film has anything else to redeem it. The dialogue is woeful throughout, retaining all the style but none of the substance of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The performances are two-dimensional and completely un-involving, although much of the blame for that must fall on Tarantino for having penned such feeble characters. Because you don't care about anyone on screen, the violence appears aimless and gratuitous. But the worst thing about these films is that the ""Tarantino"" badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws, where any other director would be completely torn to pieces. Those of us who believe that film-making should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films. The tragedy is that they will probably only feed the hype. Whatever the fans say, style can never survive without substance; thankfully we can be sure that this meaningless rubbish will disappear into the mists of time, and the sooner the better.",

The signature styles and techniques of QT are here as well, and he employed some new ones also. Quite frankly, Kill Bill is a damn good movie.  I want to hold off on deeming it a classic until I see the whole thing.  But from what I've seen so far, its a film that will set new boundaries in cinema....the way his other films did. ",
349,4 July 2013,azmosis95,2, Utter nonsense,"I very rarely take the time to write reviews on here unless I feel extremely strongly about a film, and in this case, I find it quite difficult to fathom how this garbage has any good reviews. I was honestly looking forward to seeing it for the first time after hearing about how many people enjoyed it, and knowing what a famous film it is. Reading the synopsis it sounded like a movie with a good storyline and a lot of potential. I, also, am normally one to love a bit of bloodshed in action, thriller, horror or sci-fi films but this movie was just totally ridiculous and over the top. About half the movie was in what I assume was Japanese with no subtitles, which really didn't make it any more difficult to figure out what was happening in regards to the storyline but it did make the film a whole lot more frustrating to watch, and with much of the dialogue in Japanese as well, it really stopped me as from engaging, feeling sorry for, or connecting with any of the characters. Good for you if you speak English and Japanese I suppose. The worst part though, was all the absurd violence. I was literally staring in disgust and shaking my head in disbelief. The whole movie contains graphic violence, all of it entirely ridiculous. There are people getting limbs hacked off left right and centre with fountains of blood spurting from the wounds, psychotic 17 year old girls who like killing things and a fight scene where around 200 people can't take down one whack-job woman. I can see the humour in unrealistic violence when it's done in a light- hearted sense, and I can also see the point of some more heavy violence to create a certain atmosphere, but in this movie what was meant to be a serious plot, was utter rubbish, with people losing more blood than what would even be insides someone's body to begin with. It was totally unnecessary, unbelievable and without the ability to draw any emotional reaction. Not only this, but half the movie was in animation, once again preventing any attachment or interest in any of the characters wellbeing. I understand possibly this movie was meant to be of the 'arthouse' genre, but even so it was disengaging, ridiculous, boring and downright stupid, like someone made it up as they went along and ran out of time before the end. The only half decent thing throughout the whole movie was the music, but if that's of any interest I suggest downloading the soundtrack, rather than wasting your time on this atrocity. I sat through the whole thing, hoping the ending would redeem the rest of the film, but was wrong. I'm kicking myself for electing to watch this stupid film instead or Sherlock Holmes. Bah!",
350,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,9, No plot? No problem!,"If there is a weakness to movies by writer/director Quentin Tarentino, it is that the plots are often thin, at best. The first two of his movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, contained very little actual story, but the experience of hearing what the characters had to say more than made up for it. Tarantino's third effort, Jackie Brown, had much more story to it, and was my personal favorite. Now comes Kill Bill, Volume 1, which is the first half of what was to be one long movie. At nearly 2 hours, I'm thankful that the movie was cut in half, as there is so much energy in Volume 1 that it would be difficult to keep it up for an additional 2 hours during 1 sitting. The plot in this movie reverts back to early 90s Tarantino, very thin, but enough of a set up to carry the movie. Uma Thurman plays the Bride who has to exact revenge against her former employers for reasons we're not completely told of. We'll have to wait for Volume 2 for the psychological reasoning behind the Bride's methods. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is a fun movie that knows it's a movie and knows that the viewer knows that it's a movie. There is nothing real about it. Somewhere, you'd think the FBI would be investigating a 6 foot blonde serial killer, but not in this movie, and that's why it's so fun to watch. You know you're watching something that is fake, there for our enjoyment. The cartoonish way 88 foot soldiers are slayed has a visual style of it's own, and the beauty of the final showdown at the end of the movie is amazing. Notice the bright blue of the snow, bright yellow of The Bride's outfit, and the bright red splatter that is the final result of the duel, and it's a truly beautiful scene. The movie also features appropriate and timely music, another Tarantino staple. Some people will be put off by the over-the-top, uber-violence in Kill Bill, Volume 1, but those who remember that it is just a movie, one that has very little in the way of ""real life,"" will have a good time. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is the set up for the deeper, slower, yet more interesting second half, Kill Bill, Volume 2.",

""Hostel"", while not awful, was talked up way too much. And his endorsement for ""Wolf Creek""? I have no idea what he was on to make him think it was a stellar flick.",
353,2 September 2009,gourav-dhar08,10," A Homage to the Kung Fu Movies, Take a Bow from us Tarantino, u are god of movie making.","Well to write about kill bill in IMDb it is just about adding another comment to some but for me i thought it is a necessity to write about this absolute classic and masterpiece. To those who don't like martial arts i ask why? because the way QT depicted in this movie is above my words. Well in 3 words about this movie i say ""Have A Blast"". The story is about a woman who seeks revenge from his old group of assassinates who killed her friends and child on her wedding day. And revenge gets a new meaning from this slasher movie. I must admit that who are not onto blood and gore should not this movie at all because it contains some very gruesome scenes of body parts flying and blood spurting like fountain. As for the performances, Uma Thurman is my favourite since i saw Pulp Fiction, she is the soul of the movie. You cannot imagine anyone except Uma for this character of the bride. Lucy Liu was terrific and better than ever in this flick though i liked her in Charlie's Angels also. Vivicia A Fox was very Good same goes for Daryl Hannah. Take my word for this Go for this Helluva Ride if u have not seen it yet. Though i warn you again for the violence in this movie. And for Tarantino, Take A Bow sir.",
354,16 May 2005,terencevasa,1, very poor,"i was looking forward to seeing this film after many excellent write ups on IMDb however right from the start of the film i knew it was going to be poor the scene in the hospital was awful and in my opinion was like something out of a b movie. the cartoon sketches were so bad i was tempted to turn it of there and then but i never gave up thinking things can only get better but they don't. (how can a film get 8.3 on IMDb when it is nothing short of crap. i have enjoyed some of q t 's other films but this is utter rubbish. in my opinion dead mans shoes blow this film out of the water when it comes to the story, acting a very believable script.",
355,14 October 2003,almatz,2, BORING!!!!! ,"Is it possible for people to pull their to heads out of Quentin Tarantino's butt just long enough to realize that this movie was nothing more than a bad, boring, poorly executed jerk off? I loved Reservoir Dogs and truly enjoyed Pulp Fiction, but this movie is just bad. For all this screaming about it being the most violent american movie ever made, there was a serious shortage of violence.  and what there was, was too silly to be considered violent.  Jesus, has anyone seen Goodfellas or anything by Scorcese?  I went to see a super violent action film.  I got neither. The big fight at the end went on too long that it became a victim of itself and then had a seriously anti-climactic climax.",
356,24 March 2010,gigan-92,9, Another Very Well Done Tarantino Film,"I had always heard great things about this movie, but for a long time I was hesitant. I was born in 1992, so I'm kind of back tracking threw film history so to speak. Seeing as ""Pulp Fiction"" had been so well done, I decided that this film should be just as exhilarating. And to my pleasure I must say what audiences get is a very different type of movie, let alone martial arts film. So many movies today lack any real style, this was just awesome to watch for that reason alone.",
357,16 May 2005,iwaugh6,1, I yawn at this one,this movie was awful I might be able to see how some people may like there are always those people out the but this movie should be on the list for 100 worst films every it took me 5 times renting to finally watch the whole movie no stop i fell asleep the times before it wasn't what i call good if you want to watch good movies don't watch this this is one movie i can say i only watched the whole thing because of Uma i couldn't avoid missing a film she was in but man I wish i would have spent the money some where else this time I could have got more entertainment from some toys kids play with than this movie gave me but like said we all have are opinions I you want to waste your money you earned it so go ahead maybe just maybe you might like it.,
358,16 October 2003,photogenic,1, Hardly a film,"Frequently boring, extremely disjointed, and way too self-congratulatory. My biggest personal pet peeve was that it was very noncinematic in its heavy use of  voiceover narration, on-screen titles, and speechifying by characters. I like film to convey points of plot and character and mood and attitude through imagery and action... that's what the medium excels at, no? To have these points conveyed through narration and bad dialogue is inexcusable to me. As for the vaunted action sequences... yes, they are well done, but I found myself wanting to go home and watch all of a Leone western, or a early-70's Japanese pop-Samurai film, or ""Battle Royale,"" or one of my favorite HK action flicks, rather than Tarantino's far-too-short pastiches of same. I so desperately want this film to bomb at the box office. If this travesty spawns imitators, I'm packing it in and bidding farewell to multiplex cinema. On a positive note, Uma was enjoyable in the lead and Lucy Liu made a fine villainess. It was great to see Sonny Chiba on the big screen, also.",
359,3 October 2009,fraser-rew,1, Tarantino jumps the shark,"I loved Pulp Fiction, enjoyed Reservoir Dogs and had heard good things about Kill Bill, so was expecting something outstanding. It turned into the biggest disappointment of any movie that I have ever seen. Several times in the last hour I thought that Tarantino could not possibly let things get any worse, and each time I was wrong.",
360,11 October 2003,julliet_saunders,1, Just as I suspected -,"I saw the movie tonight (not by choice) and surprise surprise . it sucked! The last good film that QT made was pulp fiction.  IMO - I don't think QT is a bad director, but there's no depth and not much thought to his films. all he basically does is make a film look `cool"" and that's exactly what this film was! A total disappointment and no surprise there. Plus I think the guy is totally tasteless - he's a professional, he should know better than to talk trash on high-profile films just to bring attention to himself. sad sad sad!",
361,6 March 2008,jb-448,9, Ultra Brilliant,"This is great! Quinten Tarantino always delivers and this is absolutely no exception. Bloody, stylish and wonderful this movie will rock your world. Uma Thurman (The Bride, she has a real name but i wont mention it yet) is a woman, pregnant and ready to marry a guy called Tommy. She was formally an assassin. Her old boss Bill (David Carrandine) and his assassination squad The Deadly Vipers kill everyone at the wedding rehearsal in the El Paso Wedding Chapel Massacre. Except the Bride survives (despite being shot point blank range in the head by Bill). She awakes from her coma and kills a would be rapist. We actually start with her being shot then she kills Vernita Green (Vivcia A Fox) A member of her old team. She then sets out for revenge against O-Ren Ishii. After a spectacular gory battle with the Crazy 88 she kills O-Ren Ishii. We find out at the end that that Bride's baby is still alive! What a cliffhanger! She doesn't know but we do. Anyway, a must see ",
362,13 October 2003,pandora8,3," Charlie's Angels was bad but fun, Kill Bill is bad and painful.","Don't kill me, while watching this I thought of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. They are quite similar but reversed, and I'm not just saying this because they both have Lucy Lui. They both have intentionally bad scripts, beautiful women who report to a man, three who are still with him, and one rebel, no sense of reality, and both are bad. There are two main differences though. Charlie's Angels has a convoluted plot, Kill Bill doesn't have a plot, and There was enough blood, and gore in Kill Bill to fill the Pacific.",
363,28 February 2006,deovalente,2, I suppose I'm probably biased.,Yes. Biased. Biased because I think Quentin Tarantino is probably one of the most overrated directors ever.,
364,26 November 2003,EmperorNortonII,8, Quentin Tarantino: Back With a Vengeance!,"""Kill Bill"" is the long-awaited new offering by Quentin Tarantino.  Six years in the making, it attacks with no subtlety whatsoever.  Uma Thurman stars as the Bride, and amazes in this tale of vengeance.  Her battle against Go Go Yubari stands out among all the scuffling and bloodshed.  The movie bears one of Tarantino's trademarks, a non-linear story.  This gives Sonny Chiba's ""Revenge is not a straight line"" speech a certain significance.  Another of Tarantino's trademarks is graphic violence, and ""Kill Bill"" offers plenty, even more so than ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs.""  The battle in the House of Blue Leaves is especially gory!  After seeing the first half of Quentin's labor of love, all I can say is brace yourself for Volume 2!",
365,24 October 2015,SquigglyCrunch,7, An Excellent Action Movie,"Kill Bill is, as you can clearly tell by the title, is an action movie, mostly focused around killing Bill. It's clear with just one look at this film that it's going to be a action-packed, bloody thrill ride. And boy, it sure is. ",
366,18 February 2006,PIST-OFF,9, can't these flies just leave me alone?????,"Although not as great as Tarantino's early work this movie has plenty of frenetic energy that makes his movies great. The first half of Kill Bill seems to be a meditation on the highly underrated Chop Socky films out of Hong Kong during the 60's, 70's and 80's. In fact the whole film serves as a tribute to eastern culture with a slight nod to the westerns and blaxploitation. Despite it's length the movie rarely slows down and manages to make one interesting scene after another. The amounts of spilled blood (along with the joke that the corpses of defeated foes don't simply disappear once defeated) make this movie stand on it's own as a true Kung Fu film. The appearance of Sonny Chiba will have extra weight for fans of Tarantino. What emerges isn't so much a movie with emotional depth as much as a popcorn movie that doesn't stoop to jerry bruckheimer clichés. As usual black comedy and in-jokes can be shifted through the carnage and most everything falls into place. my only complaint would come from the choice of music during the winter garden fight. I know it would probably be more clichéd, but i would have preferred a dead soundtrack punctuated only by the water spigot to the jarring 70's roller derby music. Other than that I have few complaints.",

368,2 April 2005,MichaelMargetis,10, Tarantino's Amazing Comeback!,"For about 100 years (well actually six), we anticipated the return of Quentin Tarantino to cinema. Many people didn't know what he was doing, and there was some ill-conceived rumors going around that he was dead. In 2000 or 2001 Tarantino was involved with a Broadway production with Marisa Tomei, but most of us don't want to see Quentin act. He was put on this earth to direct. I was immensely excited when Kill Bill was announced, yet very critical when I found out that it would be split into two parts; Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 (due out four months after the release of Vol. 1). When I walked into the theater on opening day for the first showing in Arizona (I believe it was 10:50) I didn't know what to expect. I wanted to expect an awesome tour-de-force film filled with mind-blowing visuals and unlimited coolness, but I had a pretty good idea I'd be let down. Well as soon as the credits started to role, I realized I was wrong. This was not an excellent film, it was something even better. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a masterpiece, a surprising masterpiece.",
369,13 December 2020,sakram,1, Written by a teen ?,"I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, as so many movies of his made me just love his chaotic-calm way of delivering things. This movie however falls in the category of ""Don't like the movie just because you love the director"". It felt alright when it started the it became super dull and predictable let alone how horrible the fighting scenes are. A movie without a purpose, without a tolerable plot or story. It carries on like a drama vengeance cliché written by a 16-year-old person. Unnecessary gore, predictable and uninteresting story, both of which left a lot to be desired.
From this, we all know that even the most brilliant directors may have a career blip or too. Although all those positive reviews come from people with possibly low standards or they're just mad in love with Tarantino's movies nevertheless.",
370,29 July 2021,angryleprechaun,8, Bloody action,"The movie is cheesy and the fights are ridiculous in a good way. So much blood, cool moves and fantastic cast of characters.",
371,17 September 2006,dmgreer,4, Too Hip For Its Own Good,"""Quentin Tarantino's Fourth Film"", what an egomaniac. And it shows in this movie, where he's more concerned with showing us how cleverly he understands all the genres he loves to parody than he is with creating anything new and substantial. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this, having just seen it on TNT.",
