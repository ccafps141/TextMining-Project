0,4 February 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,10, One of the best films ever made.,"So often when you think of sequels you imagine cynical attempts to cash in on successful movies, efforts to bring in the coins with any old rubbish, when you think of the likes of Police Academy, Halloween and Jaws you can understand why, and then there is Aliens......",/
1,7 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,10, Excellent sequel--matches the brilliance of the first film,Series note: It is strongly advised that you watch this film only after seeing Alien (1979). This is a direct continuation of that story.,r
2,13 February 2018,ivo-cobra8,10, A masterpiece - one of the best epic-action films of all time my personal favorite,"Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic. ",e

4,15 June 1999,baumer,10, James Cameron and Bill Paxton at their finest,"There are really good movies and then there's that select few that change your life.  For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that.  By viewing a movie you see life in a different light.  Aliens also did that to me.  I didn't think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more.  The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.",i
5,31 August 2005,Derek237,10, One of the most thrilling films ever- special edition highly recommended,"James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action, but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement, as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I should specify: Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.",e
6,8 December 2004,carflo,10, Gets better every time I see it,"I am just going to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this movie. It is as near to being perfect as any I have ever seen. I will not say that it is much better than Alien - which is just about near to being perfect also. But I do love all the characters in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters were so well developed. Even most serious dramas seldom develops each character so completely. None of these characters are stereotypes even Paul Reiser as Burke, although the slimy company/government man villain is a prerequisite in disaster type movies. I would almost say that my favorite is Michael Beihn as Hicks, just because I like his work & consider him to be underrated. But I also like Lance Henriksen as Bishop, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Bill Paxton as Hudson, and of course, Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez. I liked all of these characters. I cared about their lives & deaths. The final scene for Gorman & Vasquez still chokes me up after seeing it many times. ",w

8,3 September 2020,mark.waltz,10, Who could believe that a sequel could top an already modern classic?,"While Ridley Scott did not return as director, they got someone to take the reins that seems to have proven in teeny tiny ways that he was capable of the job, a man named James Cameron. This film is better (which isn't an easy task considering how good ""Alien"" was) simply because more care is put into the creation of the characters. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, and this time, she gets more dialogue to express who she is underneath the rather sheltered heroin from the first film. She has not given dialog just to hear Sigourney Weaver speak, because this dialogue really expresses the lessons that she has learned through the events of the first film, and how secrets of her personal life impacted the way she was as a human.",r
9,17 March 2015,Leofwine_draca,10, All-time classic; one of the greatest films ever made,"What more can be said that hasn't been said before about one of the greatest movies of our time? One of Jim Cameron's top three films, this is by far the best of the ALIEN saga, an endlessly rewatchable piece of classic action cinema which can best be described as ""Vietnam in space"". The alien is back and has multiplied, so now we have the now-classic action premise of ""group of marines vs. invincible enemy"".",w

11,12 February 2020,one9eighty,10," In space, nobody can hear you s**t your pants","57 years ago Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was part of the Nostromo spaceship's crew that encountered a terrifying alien, as the last remaining member of the crew she has drifted through space in hyper sleep. Awake and alive nobody believes her, so she is asked upon to support a Colonial Marine outfit as they go back to Moon LV-426 - a now colonized moon where the original Alien came from. They have recently gone dark and potentially abandoned the moon, and the authorities want to know why. The Colonial Marines are outfitted with state of the art warfare machinery and an arsenal to potentially deal with any threat.",0
12,15 May 2007,MaxBorg89,10, Hands down one of the best sequels ever!,"Back in 1986, sequels had become very common (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones), yet people were suspicious when they heard of a follow-up to Alien, Ridley Scott's acclaimed sci-fi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie, which had been entrusted to an unknown (at the time) named James Cameron. Fortunately, Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator, and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens, which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.",9
13,14 August 1998,Pluto-3,10, This ain't a film.,"THE sci-fi movie. It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD...",8

15,6 December 1998,Collins,9, ALIENS IS THE SCI-FI GENRE,"""Aliens"" is the best trapped-with-a-monster-right-behind-you movie of all time.  The weird part is that it's not the first of its kind.  Usually, the first of a genre is always the best but these kinds of movies were made decades-and-decades before 1986's ""Aliens.""

18,2 February 2008,sqeaston9,10, The best Sci Fi action flick ever made,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Every aspect of this movie is spot on, which I can only put down to James Cameron's obsessive attention to detail. The characters are distinct, memorable and believable. The plot builds slowly into the most tense, suspenseful roller-coaster ride I've ever experienced in the cinema. The special effects are good even by today's standards, and the sets are simply second to none. This is one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time.",?
19,31 August 2010,Hitchcoc,10, A Masterpiece of Suspense,"This is a fantastic film in every respect. While the original was outstanding, this takes it to new heights. Everything is set up so well. The bad guys in the futuristic corporate world are at it again. They know of the horrors but see people as cannon fodder for the the venomous aliens. Ripley's character is mature and smart. Throw in the little colonist and a group of overzealous (and frightened) Marines and you have the ingredients for one of the best. The story is extremely well plotted. Every single thing that is put in front of us serves a purpose later in the film. The byplay among characters and the actions of the shortsighted bureaucrat all work. The combat scenes with the aliens are intense and frightening. The work in the first movie is drawn on to create this second one. It isn't the slipshod sequel, made to make a few bucks on a previously successful movie. The aliens have now become a silly franchise. This was the real thing. Don't bother with the other stuff.",r
20,11 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Every bit as good as Alien,"Alien is a sci-fi classic, so when I saw Aliens I was expecting great things. Which is exactly what I got. Aliens I have often seen and heard being described as one of the best sequels ever made, and I have to heartily concur. Aliens is every bit as good as Alien, and just a brilliant film. The production design once again is immaculate with the spectacle surpassing Alien(to me), while the script is credible, the story interesting and well-constructed and James Cameron's direction brilliant. As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting. The acting once again is top notch, all the supporting cast do great work but Sigourney Weaver is simply terrific and it helps that Ellen Ripley is expanded upon here. Overall, just like Alien, a sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",e
21,6 February 2003,subarctic,10," ""I knew you'd come...""","ALIENS really does have it all.  Perfect direction.  Beautiful cinematography.  Intense characters.  Big guns.  Action.  Heroism.

22,7 June 1999,WoBiE1,10, A milestone in movie making....,"Just recently, I have purchased the new Alien Legacy box set on DVD, and each one is excellent. Aliens is the second chapter in the Alien saga and is probably the most remembered by today's generation. Let's face it; it changed the way sci-fi movies were made forever,and it hasn't been for the best(I'm not saying Aliens is a bad film). Aliens set such a high standard in action sci-fi(basically the new genre the James Cameron has created) that none of the copycats can compete. Take the recent movies Soldier and Event Horizon(both directed by Paul Anderson). They both try to be Alien movies but do not succeed. My advice to Mr. Anderson is to stop trying to copy what has already been done. Enough said.",_
23,14 January 2008,dorotka24,10, Best of Sci-Fi Action,"Aliens is one of many movies from my adolescent years that is just as good today as it was back then. It is an adrenaline filled ride filled with creepy locations, intense action, thrills, much circumstantial humor and one-liners that will never grow old (mostly thanks to Bill Paxton). It is, unapologetically, a man's movie, filled with everything except nudity (which it did not need).",=

25,31 March 2008,evanston_dad,8," James Cameron's Powerhouse Sequel to ""Alien""","Say what you will about James Cameron's attempts at more ""serious"" film-making (""Titanic""? Ha!), the man does know how to put together an action movie. He takes a completely different approach to this second film in the ""Alien"" series than Ridley Scott did to the first -- whereas Scott's film was slow, creepy and scarier for what you didn't see than for what you did, Cameron's is nearly non-stop hard-core action. It works though, and for all the difference in their styles, the two films cohere very well together.",t
26,17 May 2017,eagandersongil,7," Less terror, more action","After 7 years, ""Alien"" is back, this time brought by another great director, James Cameron, shifting the focus of the movie a little, bringing it from terror to action, but still without losing its origin completely. With an apathetic script, where we have a situation to bring the legendary lieutenant Ripley back to action, even though not being extremely creative, the script never gives in to ridicule, on the contrary, it takes itself seriously and we take it too seriously. 57 years after the events of ""Alien"", Ripley returns to the planet LV- 426 to help families who explore the place, this time accompanied by a troop of soldiers, the ""Aliens"" end up being underestimated ... With less terror and more Action, the script still pleases. Technically the film is exquisite, having the face of the 80's, but better done, packed with visual effects that appeal to this day, James Cameron does well. Lastly, ""Aliens"" is a good continuation and a natural evolution of Plot, characters and context, but will never have the charm and impact of its predecessor.",_
27,16 February 2008,onepotato2,8, The good kind of escapism,"I've been a fan of this movie for over 20 years now. It's hard to believe the years have passed so quickly since it made the cover of Time magazine! 'Aliens' owes everything to 1) a wonder of a script that gives even those in small roles, who may only have a handful of lines, a pretty defined character. Structurally it's very intelligent, and every single new character in the large cast is memorable. 2) Syd Meads impressive gadgets 3) Sigourney Weaver! who knows enough to be fierce AND scared, and is given sequences where she can actually save some of this crew. Which is not to say that other elements aren't also impressive (score, camera work, fx, editing and... it goes without saying, direction). You never doubt this world exists for a moment. It's so convincing and alive. All that, while being true to the first movie, while freeing itself up in amazing ways. Every choice is smart and produces a better movie than the usual cop-outs one finds in a sequel. All this and the only role Bill Paxton has ever been good in.",u

It has got my adrenalin pumping so hard that I almost wanted to slip back to my seat and take a breather! Although during that time I didn't quite understand most parts of it (too young to understand), I was deeply immersed into such rich story-telling and the fantastic alien creatures.

33,27 August 2008,Tweekums,9, A great sequel to a classic film,"Too often sequels are shallow rehashes of what was done in the first film, thankfully think isn't the case with Aliens which is almost as good as the first and quite different in style.

41,22 April 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," In my opinion, by far the best of the series","One of the problems of these is that each director, albeit to varying degrees, were selfish... not only adding their respective styles and touches to their separate efforts, each also tried to make theirs the definite piece(and little was left for the next director to work with). I won't claim that Cameron wasn't, as well... nor for a second deny that he by far had the best starting place(you'll know what I mean if you've watched the first, and perhaps also this... and if you haven't, you shouldn't find out from any other source)... but darn it if he doesn't live up to it and deliver the goods(not everyone manages to, no matter how solid the hand they're dealt is). Where the first has adequate atmosphere, this has it in spades. It had maybe three or four jump scares, this is continually exciting(this actually affected me far more often, and typically more lasting). This also has humor. It looks magnificent, technically and visually speaking. I'm afraid I just cannot claim that I see how Alien measures up to this. Effects are superior(how much better could they really have gotten in seven years? Besides, if you can't get something to look convincing on the screen, why are you putting it up there?). Characters are interesting and strong. The action is awesome, some of the best for the genres(I'm not kiddin'). Direction is effective all the way, and James just gets something much more satisfying, entertaining and engaging out of the title creature. This takes the next logical step in the franchise, and does so almost flawlessly. The plot is marvelous. Pacing is excellent, this is never boring(neither version). Acting is about spot-on(and frankly much more involving and involved than that of its predecessor, with Weaver, Henriksen(nailing his performance unbelievably well), Biehn(by far one of my favorite male actors, and when James Cameron directs him, it gets kicked up a notch of considerable size) and Henn(9 years old, and so talented) being just the top picks in a film which seems devoid of poor performances. Paxton provides perfect comic relief, without being goofy or lame. The sci-fi aspects of the film are also amazing(not to ignore what Alien did have, which should also be noted), and everything about the Marines is great, cool and obviously very thought through. The Special Edition holds about 17 minutes more material, and it's invariably worth the extra time. That cut also has a commentary track, and it is rather good... Bill and Michael are so fun to listen to, and their camaraderie comes off so genuine(though they do also all partake in the, one would presume, mandatory love-fest), Gale, Stan Winston and James have quite a bit to say... even Carrie, if she doesn't throw her two cents in as much, is a pleasant inclusion. All in all, the best of the series, and definitely the most intense(and perhaps scary) of them. I recommend it to fans of Cameron and/or of the Alien series. 8/10",

44,29 July 2017,Dannov747,9, Nonstop roller-coaster ride of action and violence.,"This is, in my opinion, the best action movie of all time, and one of the greatest sci-fi and horror movies ever. Almost as soon as Ripley and her crew land on the Alien planet, the action, and the intensity of the violence, hardly ever drops. And this isn't just mindless action, the film expertly builds each character enough to make them more than just alien fodder. The action itself is of high quality, and the periods of quiet in between the action sequences expertly drum up the suspense. Easily the most intense movie I've ever seen.",

"" Hmm "" I replied "" I didn`t think it was that good Benny . It would have been better if there was more people getting killed by lots of aliens and a lot more action "" It could be that James Cameron over heard my conversation and decided he was going to make a sequel solely to please me , but it`s more logical to assume that he recognised the obvious faults of the pretentious arthouse original and went for a no holds action blockbuster",

54,2 February 2008,Reiko_95,10," When you put your heart into doing something memorable, people will remember your name","You know back in 1987 when i first watched this movie on VHS - later i watched the uncut version - i was at first reluctant at giving it a shot but then i said what the hell might as well go for it and let me tell you i was more than impressed i was awed this movie was THAT good. I thought of it as the best sci-fi flick ever at the time and still do 20 years later. I mean you gotta look at this movie not only from the crew's perspective but also from the audience's. And that perspective scores very high all across the board mainly because from the very beginning the crew was set on making a sci-fi futuristic movie that continued the story from ""ALIEN"" but added new unique elements to the story. Everything is great about ""ALIENS"" the plot the storyline fine continuity and not only it follows where Riddley Scott left off but adds something unique to the gender. And the way the story unfolds gradually building up the tension while at the same time treading on that fine line between dark and light, good and evil, is just amazing how that was done in terms of sentimentality Ripley ,missed her daughter's birthday because fate was cruel to her given the circumstances of her floating out into space for 57 years, after she escaped from the Nostramo, and now she sees in Newt the one and only child who could possibly make up for the hole left in her soul once she found out her daughter was gone only 2 years prior to her rescue and here is her chance to make up for it. The way this chemistry between Newt and Ripley develops can clearly be seen throughout the movie little at first but as the movie advances, their relationship grows ever stronger and culminates at the end when Newt calls Ripley ""mommy"". It's clear that James Cameron and all his crew had their hearts set on making a movie not just for the money but also for providing high quality action to the viewer blended with that feeling that despite all the evil around us, despite all the risks we take all the compromises we might make, love conquers all in the end from start to finish while at the same time making us relate in some way to anyone of the characters..I mean you gotta understand that love, sentimentality and aliens, the story of the movie don't quite mix generally speaking, but by bringing Newt into the picture as the orphan child, the way the chemistry between the main character and the little kid develops, is just amazing..is something unique and you don't get to see this a lot in movies of this gender at least not a lot. I just watched not long ago ""ALIENS, THE MAKING OF - BONUS DVD ONLY and i was just amazed with all the hard work and soul James Cameron and his entire crew put in, in order to give the audience a final product that i'm sure will be remembered for generations to come. And to sum it up that's what this movie is all about...something that revolutionized the sci-fi gender. Of course Riddley Scott did a fine job to with ""ALIEN"" only James did better. Way to go James! A masterpiece! And one other thing...you gotta keep in mind they used 80's technology as far as the equipment used is concerned - the spaceship just to name one, the atmosphere processor, etc- but looking at this movie 20 years later you still cant tell the technology is outdated..is just amazing how they've accomplished something like this and only with an 18-million dollar budget at the time. This just goes to show that if you as a director and crew as well have your heart set on making something memorable, everyone will remember your name. And last but not least, the soundtrack rocked, man, especially given that James Horner had little time to implement it into the movie. Good work James! My vote 10/10",

Make what is possibly the best sci-fi/action movie ever. Eminently quotable and totally enthralling, Aliens burst onto our screen seven years after the original movie was released. At the helm this time was the relatively unknown director James Cameron and didn't he do well? The plot is a simple one. After being cryogenically frozen for 57 years, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is found floating in space. She is woken up and finds out that the planet they first found the Alien on is now inhabited. Despite her impassioned pleas that her crew was killed by a massive alien that burst out of a man's chest, had acid for blood and two sets of teeth, for some reason she isn't believed. Her pilot status stripped away, she is left to fend for herself, until earth loses contact with the colonists. Then Ripley is talked into joining the Marines assigned to find out what went wrong in an advisory roll. The Marines are cocky, brash, over-confident and wielders of immense amounts of firepower. In short they're dead meat. Also along for the ride are Bishop (Lance Henriksen) - an android, and Burke (Paul Reiser) - a sleazy corporation guy. Upon entering the colonists' facility the Marines find signs of a massive firefight, as well as a remarkably cute little girl generally called Newt (Carrie Henn). Eventually they find where the colonists appear to be. All in one area so it's a simple matter of going down there and finding out what's going on.",

The film does a decent job of expanding on the Alien mythos begun in the first film, where even a serious attention to detail fails to reveal what the true life cycle of the species might actually be. Not that all those questions are answered here, in fact there might even be a few more loose ends left by the time it's all over, but by then you're content enough just to catch your breath after a wild thrill ride.

Here she returns to the planet of her nightmares with a company of marines assigned to exterminate the growing colony of voracious aliens, but unlike in the eerie, otherworldly original the emphasis now is strictly on cheap thrills: military firepower vs. insect acid slime. Writer director James Cameron clearly knows how to manipulate his audience: each shock is delivered on cue at a furious and exhausting pace, and every visceral effect (not to mention every line of formula dialogue) has been calculated to guarantee the proper response, whether laughter or revulsion or (says Weaver to alien threatening small child: ""get away from her, you bitch!"") a rousing cheer.

The seemingly obvious call would be to study the original and pick apart the ingredients which helped form, in the case of Alien, an instant science-fiction classic. While the sequel faced trouble getting the greenlight as Fox procrastinated over a project they felt was a costly risk, this delay in production was only leading to the sequel rights falling into the hands of the perfect guy for the job.

What a delight it is to see it (almost) four years later at #54. Now how many movies do go up in the Top 250? Not many. Curiously, it just happens that of those that do, many are also some of my personal favorites: for example, in *just* the last 15 months, Terminator 2 has risen from #61 to #42. And in the last three years, Terminator has managed an astonishing rise from #201 to #158. That's *43* notches! Both are James Cameron movies. Does Avatar have something to do with this?

How could a green rookie director with just a handful of directing credits hope to top that? James Cameron found a way! Aliens improves on its predecessor in every way. Instead of a crew of civilian pilots fighting to survive a single alien, Cameron pits a squad of hardened space marines against an alien infestation. The experience, training, and advanced weaponry fail to protect them from the onslaught of alien xenomorphs, increasing the horror and hopelessness of the film. Cameron's camera work and perspective increase the tension, regularly showing the struggling survivors from the viewpoint of the stalking alien predator. The special effects, the action, the scale, the cast, the directing, the horror, and every other element of Aliens improve on the masterpiece of the original and result in the absolute gold standard of sci-fi horror.",

Treating audiences with engrossing visual imagery and hair-raising thrills, there is almost no wonder the film journeyed to success. This follow-up to the science-fiction thriller arrives with more of the same pulse- pounding human vs. alien onslaught, only with more and bigger surprises. Replacing Ridley Scott in the director's chair is visionary James Cameron following his success with science-fiction hit 'Terminator'. Cameron comes to the picture with a slightly more thoughtful direction and a bigger package of spine-chilling thrills and sharp visual effects that amount to a masterful sci-fi experience. Reducing on the suspenseful atmosphere in favor of more even balance of action and white-knuckle thrills, the film never fails to show Cameron knows how to keep things working. Set almost six decades after the first entry, this film sees the return of Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, who wakes up from a cryogenic sleep and is facing charges from the catastrophe that lead to the death of her crew. With everyone back on Earth failing to buy into her story, Ripley goes on an investigation to another planet with a crew of space marines which include Corporal Hicks (played by Michael Biehn), Burke (played by Paul Reiser), Bishop (played by Lance Henrickson), Private Hudson (played by Bill Paxton), Lieutenant Gorman (played by William Hope), and Private Vazquez (played by Jenette Goldstein) along with a few others.

James Cameron's Aliens is too impatient. There is no build-up of suspense, there are constant close-ups, everybody's made up to look attractive, and the exposition is only long because it seems to think that extension equals suspense, or that there's some quota to fill and then you can play around with your big guns and gore all you want. Cameron presents us with an action film, big fun, special effects, blow this up, blow that up, but there is an hour and 45 minutes of waiting around for it, and less than an hour of action and violence.

Aliens, however, didn't impress me that much when I first saw it in a movie theatre in 1986. Apart from a couple of genuinely gruesome moments (like when the marines discover the cocooned colonists or when Ripley and Newt stumble upon the alien queen's egg chamber), I felt Aliens took a wrong turn when it replaced the slow grinding horror and terrifying uncertainty of Alien with 'bigger and more' all-out action. Even the effects seemed cheaper although seven years had passed since the production of the first film. I was entertained, but not overly impressed.",

110,4 July 2022,cinemais4life,10," ""Game over, man! Game over!""","My favorite movie of all time. It's one of those rare movies that is completely perfect in almost every aspect you can think of. The setting, the characters, the dialogue, the visual design, the writing, the storytelling, the pacing, and the acting. Oh my gosh, this movie is really one of the greatest movies ever made. It might probably be the best sequel of all time. It perfectly follows the story without changing or ignoring the stuff that happened in the original movie. It also has nothing but practical effects and miniatures in the action sequences and sets that makes this blow most of the CGI-filled 'movies' out of the water. And guess what, it has a strong female lead character. But the reason why this works is because there was no woke identity politics or forced diversity to pander to the soy filled SJW leftists on social media and Twitter because this wasn't even a thing in 1986. What mattered was actual good storytelling and writing which is the reason why most movies suck. ""We're on express elevator to hell, goin' down!"" Keep on rockin' on, Aliens!",

Everything from the plot that continues the franchise perfectly. The new characters who are the most memorable characters in the franchise and the old characters who get more development and its all for the better. The aliens are cooler and the final battle is the best part of the film. Also the quotes are so memorable.,

Officially, Aliens should be called an action movie, not a horror like the first, because it is not stop and the special effects are top of the line. Acid for blood, and humans for hosts, the aliens of the film are THE image for aliens you will think of from now on. I've seen this movie countless times, and have never picked out a real flaw. It has so many great characters.. Hudson, Bishop, newt, Hicks, all the marines, and ofcoarse Ripley and the aliens themselves. I loved Bishop as the android, and Hudson's panic and foul mouthed presence earned him a lot of fans. The story is a colony establishing an atmosphere on a planet loose communication with 'the company' running the show. USMC marines are sent in to see what's going on and Ripley the survivor of the 1st film reluctantly agrees to go along. The director even lets you get to know each marines personality, each one is a little unique and I thought the cast was really a timeless one. There's some amazing combination of puppets, animatronics, and miniatures used in the film from the drop ships to the amazing face huggers to the new queen alien from. There's enough beeps on motion trackers, futuristic weapons, and ice cold metal cooridors to fill 3 movies. Not to mention this time 'it's war' with literally crowds of aliens coming at us full speed. The most memorable moments are of the crew preparing for the mission at the meal table and bishop the android doing the knife trick at 100 miles an hour between the fingers of a marine who laid his hand on the table (Hudson). But the mega scene is when Ripley has to find the young character (only survivor colonist) named newt, which leads her directly into the alien breeding chamber. The alien queen is simply amazingly done, and the director Jim Cameran really convinced the effects guys to go all the way with it. Well it worked. The result was amazing and pricless. What really made Aliens an absolute action and horror gem was the writing and the amount that was there was just so richly done I was so very impressed. It's by far the best of the series of movies and the best alien film of all time.",

For Ripley to stand there and say her famous line, ""Get away from her, you bitch!""

The real miracle of this movie is the character development, begun by Ridley Scott and perfected by James Cameron. In a few scenes we are introduced to the heart and soul of the soldier, of Ripley, of Hicks and Bishop. Why do we feel such a connection to them, so immediately, so intensely and so experientially? This is because of Cameron, and his relationship with the actors. Remember Al Matthews (As----es and elbows people!). Right now I'm beginning to think that it is the relationship, the connection, the attunement, between director and actor, that makes or breaks a great movie. Scott and Cameron understood this, and made excellent movies as a result. These days I see so many directors and actors making the same mistakes over and over again, not seeing eye to eye, and failing miserably. When will they learn? No film school can teach this. It's innate, and the stuff that makes a great director, such as Scorcese, Spielberg and Cameron. It's maddening to me, why the power of presence, unconditional positive regard and strength based direction is not taught in schools. Eric.",

For me, 'Aliens (1986)' is slightly weaker than its predecessor but is still a fun experience with some engaging set-pieces (especially a tension-filled face-off with a face-hugger) and a fantastic finale. It is at its best when it brings in the suspense elements that the series so desperately needs, but it always keeps a keen focus on the horrific nature of its eponymous creatures even though their impact is severely diluted this time around.

James Cameron's pounding militaristic sequel to Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1978) is a non-stop action movie with just the perfect touch of humour and pathos. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the tough, resourceful and surprisingly maternalistic Ripley (who once again awakens to find herself in a nightmare) as is Michael Biehn as Hicks, the corporal reluctantly in command of the slowly diminishing squad of Marines that includes motor-mouth Pte. Hudson (the late Bill Paxton) and Latina hard-case Pte. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein). Rounding out an excellent cast is Lance Henriksen as Bishop, an android who painfully proves himself to be as good as a human, comedian Paul Reiser as duplicitous corporate scumbag Carter Burke, and Carrie Henn as Newt, who is mostly the best little kid ever to grace a science fiction film, mostly. The uncannily realistic effects are 'practical' (i.e. Not CGI), and the sets and the production design of things such as the spaceships, the APC, and the titular creatures is outstanding. This is one of the films that no matter where I tune in, there is always a 'good bit' about to happen and I end up watching it through to the end yet again (occasionally rewatching the scene that begins with Vasquez yelling ""Let's rock!"" a couple of extra times for good measure). I loved this film when I first saw it in the theatre in 1986 and it still enthralls me 35 years later. UPDATE Sept. 2020: Finally got around to watching the extended version. Establishing that Ripley had a daughter before the events in the original 'Alien' (1979) makes her bonding with Newt more predictable (and less poignant), but the footage of Newt's family checking out the alien ship is pretty good, as are the scenes with the sentry guns. The many fans of Pte. Hudson will appreciate some extra badassery on the drop-ship.

Not everyone can hold the level and in this case James Cameron reaches immense heights to finally give us an ending that closes a frantic and distressing film. It is fantastic, second to none. They should not have continued with the franchise. If something cannot be improved, it should not be continued.",
155,4 June 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,9, Builds upon the original while maintaining the core fear.,"57 years after surviving the alien on board the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found on board her shuttle and returned to Earth, but 57 years have passed. Ripley is debriefed by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation who dispute her claims of an alien creature as well as the Ash synthetic who was allegedly operating under orders to secure the alien lifeform at the expense of the crew and Ripley is effectively sidelined in her career as she's the only one left to blame for the loss of the Nostromo. In the years since the incident, the moon where the alien came from, LV-426, has since become a terraforming colony with a population of about 70 families. When contact is lost with LV-426, Ripley is approached by company representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) to serve as a consultant on a rescue mission along side a team of Colonial Marines. As Ripley reluctantly agrees to join them, they soon find that the alien threat is even greater this time around.",
156,23 December 2022,jomayevans,10, The GOAT,"It may not be my favourite movie ever, not sure but as a unbiased opinion ALIENS is without a doubt the Greatest movie of all time even to this day.. it combines all genres into 1. Sarcastic comedy, sci-fi , horror, action and drama the set pieces costumes scenery are top notch and effects still better than anything to this day . And the acting is phenomenal. The creatures themselves are terrifying and you can always feel the umcomprehensible dread of ever having to face such a creature. The creatures themselves are pure genius. There has never been anything as scary. Ripley and vasquez are without a doubt the toughest heroines ever to grace the screen. Plus plenty of eye candy with Michael biehn amd Paxton great as always. Every actor plays the role perfectly. An epic ride that will mever ever be beat cinematic wise. It would be impossible to top a movie that is a 10 in every category it covers.

It is especially common for sequels of enormously successful movies to fall flat, particularly in the horror and science fiction genres (remember The Exorcist II?). The first sequel to Ridley Scott's spectacular 1979 film, which set the standard for science fiction for years to come, is placed into the capable hands of James Cameron, who clearly takes some knowledge from Halloween director John Carpenter.

The original film, directed by Ridley Scott was more of a horror film which took place inside a vast cargo ship out in the vastness of space. Aliens, the first big budget venture from James Cameron, is more of an action film. It's filled with shoot-outs, explosions, and has a much larger cast. Most of the action takes place in tight quarters as a group of intergalactic marines battle an army of ""xenomorphs"" which has wiped out a colony on the planet where the crew from the original film first encountered them. The film is relentless as the embattled humans try to ward off the superior numbers of creatures, and escape back into space.",

166,25 May 2018,LnineB,5, I'm in the minority.,"After a brilliant ,claustrophobic and atmospheric first film , Mr. Cameron takes the Alien franchise into the realm of what would become the fail safe formula of success for action movies . He does this a full decade or even two before it becomes the norm for every action film for decades after its 1986 release. For any other franchise this would be good. But after a Sci-Fi/Horror classic original, the second film is horribly dated and predictable. Cameron removes all the horror out of the film and replaces it with an all out assault on the viewers senses. He even changes Rippleys character from a sensitive but strong survivor female lead to an alpha female , who can do no wrong, including out boxing a natural predator while controlling a bulky and clumsy metal machine body crane. The first film appeals to all demographics while the second is an unapologetic attempt to appease the testosterone filled 20 year old audience. Everything plays second fiddle to the action including the cinematography, set design, acting and even the Alien, hince the need for multiple Aliens. It is simply TOO EPIC ,with too much action and having too much ego.",

170,28 September 2015,dworldeater,9, Brilliant sequel,"Aliens is James Cameron at his best in this very ambitious and action packed sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Alien. There are certain aspects of the film that don't come off as well as the first one. Such as the horror elements and HR Giger's superior design of the alien. However, James Cameron is an insane talent and brought his vision to the screen with high efficiency. Siguorney Weaver returns again as Ripley and delivers an outstanding performance that is vulnerable, intelligent and tough. It was impressive enough to get a nomination for best actress that year.(which was pretty much unheard of for sci fi, action and horror, genres the academy usually ignores) There are also some iconic and very memorable performances from Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Hendrickson and Jenette Goldstein. Aliens has a dark tone and packs a mean punch with heavy doses of action. Aliens blend the genres of horror, action, drama and science fiction well. James Cameron is a guy who is a jack of all trades in film and also as a director and storyteller knows what he wants, as well as how to best achieve it. So, with the aid of his very talented crew the f/x, set designs, camera-work and editing are all top notch. Aliens is a great sequel and a classic that in the sci fi/action realm is tough to beat.",

201,4 April 2006,eternalsea,10, Could be the greatest sequel of all time.,"Sequels rarely stand up to the original. Jaws, Jurassic Park and Predator are all big Hollywood franchises that started at a very high standard but as time continued they simply grew worse and worse. However there are those sequels that many believe to be better than their predecessors. The Godfather part 2 and The Empire strikes back are a few of the names but in my opinion the best of this rare breed is the 2nd in the Alien saga. Aliens. The story starts with Ripley being found in space, shes has been floating their for 56 years but due to hyper sleep hasn't aged a day. The company Weyland Yutani picks here up and brings here back to a space station, where She tells them of her encounter of the Alien, which is met with ridicule and disbelief. However the company looses contact with the farmers that mine on the alien planet and together with a group of marines Ripley returns to face her demons. The acting is the best the series ever offered with Sigourney Weaver picking up an Oscar nomination and rightly so. Michael Biehn and Lance Hennrikson are very impressive, giving great depth to their characters. Carrie Henn is a great new comer, but for some odd reason has never worked again. The thrills are in high supply here as are the often grisly scares. The Aliens look even meaner here than they did in the original and the Queen when she appears is possibly the most frightening creature ever to grace are screens. Another great point Aliens offers is the fact you care for its characters, Even the asshole marine types. This means that when ever peril is near we feel even more anxious, simply because we have grown attached to those for whom the danger looms. Few movies these days have that quality, indeed the only action orientated film of the last 15 years that had this factor is the original Jurassic Park. So to conclude Aliens is really worth seeing. Its well acted, well written and highly entertaining. You would be a fool to give this one a miss.",

Probably the best in the series and the director's cut add SO MUCH MORE to the story that you'd be a fool not to see how Aliens was really meant to be seen. The acting is so top notch and sucks you in. You get a feel for the characters without them being too typical or cookie-cutter.

Very much in line with the original, and James Cameron makes sure that he doesn't completely ignore the events of the first film which is so often what sequels with different directors do. There seems to be a lot more action in this one than in the original, which was basically a horror film with some action elements. The characters combat the aliens and in some cases are killed by the aliens in very memorable, distinct ways. The script is sharp as a knife and can bring a tear to your eye at any moment, but also is very funny and keen. Jim Cameron is a great storyteller/director, and when he does both write and direct a movie, you know you're in for a real treat. Aliens gets a perfect 10/10.",
207,21 December 2016,Rickting,9, One of the most exciting films ever,"Aliens is an absolute blast in every way. The franchise goes from horror to action, as Ripley joins a team on a mission to find out what happened to the colony on the moon where she found the alien egg. Alien was a good movie, but I consider Aliens to be superior. Aliens has absolutely everything: it's got great acting from everyone including the child actor. It has a very entertaining script with fascinating war themes and excellent character development for all of its characters. It's brilliantly directed and is one of the tensest and most terrifying films of all time. The action is staggering, but there is some drama here as well. Ripley may have been awesome in the first film, but here she cements herself as pretty much the best female movie character of all time. It's difficult to choose the best moment of the film as every moment moves the film forward and every scene, even the dialogue ones, makes you feel like you're on a high-speed roller coaster flying off the rails. It gets exhausting occasionally, but only because the sheer intensity of the film is an utter knockout. James Cameron's greatest film and something of a masterpiece. ",
208,22 September 2020,andrewroy-04316,9," Aliens is close behind its predecessor in atmosphere, and surpasses it in theme and emotion","Aliens is a very worthy sequel to a sci-fi icon. Alien was a pure, uncompromising sci-fi thriller with no scene or moment wasted. To that end, it's also more of an experience being in that setting and feeling the fear and uncertainty the characters do more so than a film with a lot for the audience to think about. Alien achieves its aim admirably, but for my tastes Aliens manages to even improve upon it. We don't get quite the same level of nervousness and claustrophobia here, and some of the action scenes feel a bit more shoot em up than I'd like, but Aliens more than makes up for it. I do think Aliens is comparable to Alien in how realistic the space mission is, in the excellent alien design, and in the general plot arc and rising tension throughout. The thrills are definitely still present - especially when Newt and Ripley are together and you can see their fear for each other, I was on the edge of my seat. On top of that, Aliens has plenty on its mind. Sigourney Weaver is absolutely fantastic here - the script is great and we feel a deep connection to her journey. Thematically, greed is explicitly explored, and I liked the way human arrogance was considered early in the film, but the omnipresent themes are motherhood and survival. Ripley clearly feels a deep connection to Newt and feels responsible for protecting her. At the same time, the aliens are hyperefficient in doing the only thing they care about: surviving, along with their children. Female roles and trusting women in general is crucial here, as the commanders are quick to write off Ripley as crazy and delusional at the start of the film. It also takes far too long for the crew to start respecting Ripley as a key member. Interestingly, they all respect Vasquez, but that's because the way she proves herself is the same masculine way men prove themselves: through physical prowess and bravado. Ripley has a different type of strength, but it is obvious by the end of the film that she is the most resourceful and hardiest of them all.",

216,19 March 2006,bakchu,6," Good, but no match for the original","Approximately the first half of this movie is really suspenseful - although the viewer who saw the preceding film already knows what the marines will encounter, and that most of them are probably doomed to die, everything is done very well and keeps us in excited expectation of the things to come. Good classic space SF meets good classic horror. However, it gets rather stale later, regrettably. There are just too many aliens and too many fights - when it comes to the last one, I think ""one more time, I saw this already, what's the point?"" - somewhat boring repetitiveness marks ""Aliens"". It's not only repetitive in itself but also in relation to ""Alien"": oh yes, we already had the airlock trick, we already had a butchered android, hadn't we? There are no new ideas here, just more or less successful variations on the original theme. Maybe some people will now think that the little girl should be mentioned. Well - she is only a hollow character. Cute, doing nothing interesting, just there to be saved and to serve as an ersatz daughter for Ripley. To me, Ripley running around to save her new ""daughter"" is too stereotypical and does add nothing to the story which is not in every poor disaster flick. It seems that mainstream movies including disasters very rarely are able to do without saving at least a pet, or a child, or both - still a bit disappointing that ""Aliens"" had to follow this pattern, too. Watching the movie, things became so very predictable. Saved in the nick of time, of course. From a dramaturgical point of view, it would have hugely improved the film and Ripley's character if the girl at least died, if she has to be in the movie at all. The cat in ""Alien"" was much less irritating... the whole movie was done with more restraint, better pacing, and - well, it had the original ideas. Still, ""Aliens"" is very watchable. But not more - it's far from being an important achievement.",

As much as I love the additional scenes in all of James Cameron's ""Special Editions"", when I saw it before I thought the added scene with Newt's family diminished from the effect of meeting Newt later. This time I thought it was actually even better: Meeting Newt as a ""regular girl"" first and then seeing her transformation, actually adds a layer to her character. I really liked the way she acted and thought it was a great combination of casting, acting and direction. Not that her screamings weren't annoying at times, but all in all, I think she was excellent in her role and more believable than many other kids I saw in movies.",

The acting was perfect as was the special effect.  At a budget of $18 million, Aliens beats even today's visual masterpieces.

234,7 June 2006,ddfcmp8,1, Not even half of the first one.,"I'm sorry to disagree with about 90% of this website, but I did not find this sequel to be anything but a rehash of the first. Not only is it a rehash, but it also brought to life, some of the really dumb stereotypes that exist in movies today. Crummy dialog that is fixed to sound 'cool' and 'awesome' or 'in with the times' and you know what? It isn't. Now, before you dismiss the rest of my review, I want to add that I tried to like this film. For a long while I tried to find some cool ways to see it, and you know what? I thought I had for a while. But you know, the thing s that so many people hold it up higher than the first, and I just can't see why. I guess I would be more open to give it a second chance, but people keep saying it is better than the first, and I just don't agree. I think the opening was alright, until the shock sequence when...uh-oh! She might have something in her stomach and.....oh, just a dream. HOW CHEAP! Why would they even rely that much on the first? Especially since it had been a good 6 or 7 years already? Jeez! I just thought that was mistake #1. Next, the film was quite intriguing, but that was because they discussed the originals damages. I just can't say when I lost it. Most of Sigourney's dialog was pretty awesome, and of course, Sigourney was GREAT. I'll give it that, but the rest, it just seems to imposed and buffed, and for what? It just crashes into all the rocks on LV-426.-Oops! There's another problem right there! They just HAVE to bring us to the scene of the crime, and...57 years later! UGH! Why not have the original beast find it's way to earth? Why not make a new type of disaster happen? Taking back to the original scene of the crime was unnecessary! My final word is that this film needn't have been made, but it was, and I watched, actually thinking it would be good. It could have, and should have been, but I just don't think it was.

The plot is not overly complex (thank goodness!), but there are enough surprises and plot twists to keep everyone interested. The overly-arrogant military people start out thinking they can easily defeat anything, and discover differently.
Sigourney Weaver is at her absolute best, and she transforms from ""just an observer"" into a top-notch action hero right before our eyes! Great job, Sigourney!
This film is easily best of the ""Alien"" series; and if this film were made today, it would receive the highest honors. Unfortunately, in 1986, Sci-Fi films were not thought of as highly they are today.
For you young people out there: Give this film a watch; do NOT think of it as ""some old film done in the (sic)""80's"" that just looks 'old'. Instead treat yourself to an excellent film!

Ripley—and her cat—are drifting in an escape pod when another ship recovers it. She's saved and back on earth. There's a committee willing to hear Ripley's story, and like all on-screen committees, they don't believe a single word. However, when all communications are lost with the colony assigned to investigate the alien site, the company decides they might need Ripley after all.

We should all be saying a prayer of thanks they finally came to their senses because 1986's Aliens is bigger, better, and more intense. While Alien was a slow-moving film that builds up horror, it is successor is a brutal action/horror hybrid with a soul-sucking last hour due to its intensity.

Arguably, the elements he bring actually top what the original offered. This is a movie that is iconic in every aspect: in scenes and in dialogue. It holds up extremely well despite being nearly thirty years old. The effects are amazing, perhaps the best animatronics I've ever seen. The final battle with its buildup and shock, pays off and blows you away.

It really set the bar form most sci-fi visual mediums we have now like TV shows (Battlestar Galatica revival, EXO Squad, and the criminally underrated Space, Above, and Beyond)as well as became a big influence on video games (Contra, Gears of War, Halo, Dead Space). This film gave us a new way of looking at sci-fi, it was final frontier sci-fi at it's best where it looked futuristic, realistic, believable and accessible.",

It occurs when a bevy of soldiers are trooping through the remains of a settlement on a desolate moon: it has been ransacked by a series of violent creatures whose sole purpose is to seemingly seek organisms and attack them. As they march through the crime scene, we realise that they are essentially traversing an area which has seen events play out that were very similar to the first film: a group of (largely) unarmed people trying to defend themselves from these animals in a zone they cannot escape. ""Aliens"", however, is just getting out of second gear by this point...",
271,1 January 2013,donaldking,1, Moronic sequel to ALIEN,"Ridley Scott once made a brilliant SF film called ALIEN - many years later he made an equally brilliant prequel called PROMETHEUS. In the years between, people tried to make their own sequels. One of these people was a man called James Cameron. First, he decided to make his version 'sentimental' by introducing an irritating child that kept screaming so Ripley could say dumb things to reassure it. (Fortunately, David Fincher had the brat killed off in time for HIS version.) Cameron also decided he would have the film dominated by a group of US Marines. These Marines were to have a combined IQ of about minus 5. All the Marines said things like 'Let's go!' and 'Oh my God, what is THAT?' Most irritating of all was Bill Paxton (shame on you!) - he ended every sentence with the word 'man.' Fortunately for the viewer, the aliens soon disembowelled him. The heroine of the film was to be given lines just as bad as the Marines'. The aliens were not scary, no matter how many there were. The spaceships looked second hand. After an hour of this farrago one's eyelids began to close. The Marines shot at the aliens with their huge weaponry. Lance Henriksen got his head blown off, but carried on talking. Happily, when the Marines were killed, death applied to their tonsils too. After this success, Mr. Cameron got to make a three-hour long film about a ship that was perfectly designed. It sank.",

A rare classic where, in my eyes out does the original. Classic lines that will be forever remembered. Some of the strongest female leads ever. Original version is awesome, and the directors cut just adds to the amazing story. The fact that this film was in the 80s and still test the time and is far better than 99% of the cgi films done today (and I'm all for marvel films before you judge me) says so much. Will always be in my top 5 films. Sigourney Weaver is just a bad ass and will forever be the ruler of aliens.",

Well, you'd better believe that they go all out. The story picks up fifty-seven years after the original, and sure enough, there are more aliens. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), however, is not to be deterred. If those drooling fiends are around, she's ready to take them on.",
275,28 August 2015,joberfeld113,10," While Alien perfected slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs more of a punch, and features what I think is Sigourney Weaver's best performance.","Everyone says that sequels have a tendency to suck. Then there are the sequels that do not improve upon the original, but are still good movies on their own. Then there is Aliens. A sequel that is not like other sequels. Aliens is one of those sequels that is either as good as or better than the original. The film continues Ripley's story arc at exactly where the first one left off. Ripley has been floating around in stasis for 57 years. When she returns home, her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, asks her what happened. Ripley tells them the entire story which none of them believe. She is also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ripley is told that there are now colonists on the planet LV-426 which is the crew she served with found the ship from the first film. Burke, a high level representative from the company, tells Ripley that communication with the colony has stopped and convinces her to return there with marines and be an adviser. Unfortunately when they get there, the colony is destroyed and the colonists are nowhere to be found except for one survivor, a little girl named Newt. They find out that the colonists did discover the ship and everything that happened on the Nostromo is now repeating itself in the colony. This sequel was directed by Terminator director James Cameron, not Ridley Scott. But it still does not matter as Aliens has a lot of what made the first film great. H.R. Giger's designs from the first film are improved upon. That goes more than double with one of the aliens late in the film. The marines in this movie are armed with state of the weapons that can easily kill, but the film keeps all of the tension by having them completely outnumbered and at a disadvantage with them not knowing what they are up against, despite Ripley telling them earlier in the film. While there are the dumb marines, Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson either leave a lasting impression or remain quotable. Newt is not your typical kid character. Most kid characters in films get annoying, however Newt is a lot fun to watch. She is also smart and realizes that the best way to survive against the aliens is to run. The acting in the film is also impressive. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley and owns the role so much that it is likely the best performance she has ever given. Hicks, Hudson, and an android named Bishop are all played by Cameron film regulars Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen. All three of them suit their roles very well. Aliens is another one of those movies that ages so well over time. It probably gets better and better with each viewing. While Alien perfected slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs more of a punch, and features what I think is Sigourney Weaver's best performance.",

284,9 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, Aliens,"Director James Cameron (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, True Lies, Titanic) brought the superlative sequel to Sir Ridley Scott's science-fiction action horror thriller seven years later, and in terms of spectacle, this is much more elaborate. Basically, Ellen Ripley (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sigourney Weaver) is finally picked up by her company, 57 years later, which shocks her, she also has many nightmares of her past experience. Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) asks Ripley to be an adviser (""that's all"") for a team of heavily armed soldiers that are going to the unknown planet (LV-426), where Ripley and the Nostromo team landed, which has over the years has been colonised, installed with a fusion powered facility to make the air breathable. Their mission seems to be to destroy the aliens (or Xenomorph) after contact with the planet is lost, but Ripley is eventually dragged into the action as more and more of the soldiers are being killed. Along the way, they find a survivor, Rebecca 'Newt' Jorden (Carrie Henn), and not long after they are stranded on the planet, with no communication to the company, and no shuttle to escape. They do make sure that the doors are secure so the aliens, and parasites (facehuggers) cannot get in, while android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) tries to get a shuttle to pick them up. They do eventually get close to escaping, but Ripley, looking for captured Newt does get to meet the mother alien, destroy her egg nest and sack, before escaping and the place that is destroyed. There is one final encounter with the alien queen not long after landing to safety, she in the Exosuit ""power-loader"" utters the great line ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" Eventually Ripley gets rid of the alien mother, throwing her into the blast doors and forcing her into outer space (just like the first one). In the end, injured Cpl. Dwayne Hicks (The Terminator's Michael Biehn), ripped-up Bishop, Newt and Ripley are the last survivors, all put into pods for hibernation. Also starring Bill Paxton as Private Hudson, William Hope as Lieutenant Gorman, Jenette Goldstein as Private Vasquez, Al Matthews as Sergeant Apone, Mark Rolston as Private Drake and Wishmaster's Ricco Ross as Private Frost. The special effects are much more impressive, and the action more intense and gripping, a brilliant sequel. I have also seen the extended version, that director Cameron prefers, the extra material does provide some good background to some characters, including where Newt came from, it is just as interesting and essential as the original. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Music for James Horner and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Ellen Ripley was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Outstanding!",
285,23 August 2012,ignacio-mig14,1," Hey Jim, what have you done to my Ripley???","I usually like James Cameron movies, more than any Scorsese or Spielberg's actually, but this sequel just hurts me real bad. In Ridley Scott's movie, Ripley was a sexy heroine fighting with no massive weapons, who didn't cry for dead daughters or any of those dumb sentimental clichés that most people love but I don't. She was alone and fought. Even her ship partners didn't care for her. She was a horror survivor. Well, for Mr. Cameron that was all wrong. He thought Scott was portraying Ripley as a heartless and useless person, I assume, so he equipped her with the biggest machine gun out there packed with infinite ammo, so violence lovers can drool just staring at it and she only had to shoot, and he added a little girl to replace a coming-out-of-nowhere-dead-daughter (Bravo!), and wants me to cheer for the girl, cry for the girl, and love the girl while she screams like being possessed by a really high-pitched voice demon. Terrific. Well, I didn't do any of that. Instead I've started to hate her and the movie, and that's what I'm still doing. Along with the little girl, Cameron wants me to cheer for more cute people: the U.S. Army. Cool, let's say some people were living on the dead planet, so we send the Army in order to save them and save the day again for the country. Well, I'm not American, so I can't have any good feelings about their Army, I'm sorry. I'd rather watch ""Avatar"" anytime, at least Jim wants me to cheer for the right people on that one. Finally, while the Alien in Scott's 1979 masterpiece was a force of nature that nobody could kill, here Cameron introduce us a bunch of useless bugs that can be killed easier than an ant, just for the sake of appreciate all the weaponry and all the shooting. For that I'd rather watch Terminator. I find this sequel appalling, it destroyed the planet built by Mr. Scott, flooding it with the more basic clichés a movie can have. I hate this movie and specially the annoying little girl. Oh, and the end... a shameless rip-off. 1/10 because there's no 0/10.",

Well, I had no idea how the second Godfather would be so good when I thought the first one was good enough. I write books and I already said to myself I will not make any sequels for my books because most sequels never turn out to be better than the first. I clearly underestimated how good this movie would, it was much better than I expected, same with the Godfather Part II. I am now in love with the first and second Alien movies. Good title, they don't call the movie: Alien 2, just Aliens meaning more than one. In my opinion Ripley is the best female ass kicker in all of movies. The acting is very good in this movie, the special effects are very good, intense action, scary, and extremely powerful. In my opinion the second best Sci-fi sequel behind The Empire Strikes Back.",

312,6 July 2014,dwpollar,8, Very good sci-fi action movie...,"1st watched 7/3/2014 -- 8 out of 10(Dir-James Cameron): Very good sci-fi action movie in this second film starring the perfect alien life form created in the original 1979 movie. This movie doesn't try to imitate the original but just makes a good fast moving scary film that gives us more information about the creatures and introduces us to the big mama who is making all the eggs. It starts with Ripley, played again by Sigourney Weaver, and her cat being picked up by a salvage team after flying around for 56 years in space. When she shares her encounter about the Alien species it's initially dismissed, but when they are unable to contact a group of residents living on the planet where the alien ship was first found -- she's asked to join a bunch of marines on a trip to the planet. There are some homages to the original including the initial title screen, and the scene where the crew wakes up from their longtime slumber, but Cameron definitely has his own way of doing things. He doesn't take too long to turn the movie into action fare, but does also a good job of establishing Ripley's motherly instincts that helps us understand her motivation to kick ass later. Newt, a small child lone survivor, becomes kind of Ripley's adopted child since her real child is already deceased. There are a couple of silly dialogued scenes and some unintentional humor brought out from Bill Paxton's character because he is so caricatured, but other than this the movie is well done. Some of the broadly drawn typecast characters are a negative, but Michael Biehn's characters provides a combat person with a heart which is nice to see. Paul Reiser, plays the nice guys who turns bad and we wish it wouldn't happen, but it does. As an action alien movie it would be hard to get much better than this one...so dismiss the character imperfections --- enjoy this, and wait for the next one!!",

315,8 April 2017,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10, The action horror film,"Each of the four Alien films has their own distinct and noticeable personalities. Ridley Scott's original creeping horror show is a tense, streamlined, gracefully vicious film that slinks along at its own pace, not unlike the resident feline Jonesy who wondered about on the spaceship Nostromo back then. If Alien has the qualities of a cat, James Cameron's Aliens has those of a rambunctious puppy dog, a rip snortin, go get em action backyard barbecue knockout that runs up and gives the audience a big wet slimy kiss. All animal metaphors aside (I'm running out of oh-so-clever ways to open my reviews, OK? Been at this for two years now), Cameron's film is an undisputed classic, still jaw dropping to this day, even after what feels like hundreds of viewings, nostalgic yet fresh in different ways every time, and simply one of the best films ever made. It's the gold standard for creature feature sci fi too, and while many argue whether or not it in fact outdid Scott's original white knuckler, I can't bring myself to be petty and pick favourites out of the quadrilogy, I love them all for a whole bunch of reasons. Aliens picks up quite a while after the catastrophic events of the first, with Ripley floating around in that cryo-pod for way too long, until she happens to cruise past earth, crossing the vision of the Weyland/Yutani corporation once again. Because they always make astute, well thought out choices, they decide to send a research team, accompanied by a very reluctant Ripley and a group of hoo-rah, bull in a China shop colonial marines to far off industrial exomoon LV-426, where they have lost communication with the settlers. After a brief, clammy build up, all hell breaks loose, and we get to see the full impressive extent of Cameron's skill as a visual storyteller, as well as the oh-so-gooey, inspired practical effects work that brings those gorgeous Xenomorph beauties to snarling life. The cast is the epitome of badass, as we are constantly reminded of by Bill Paxton's Hudson, the film's resident squirrel who gets hilariously skittish when things get dicey (""game over, man!"" Will never not out a big, Paxton sized grin on my face), but who heroically holds his own once he gets his sillies out. The other side of that coin is Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn, never slicker), cool as ice, shaken by nothing, including an atmosphere entry landing that would make Alfonso Cuaron pee himself, but doesn't come close to disturbing Hick's afternoon nap. Every Alien team must have an artificial human, some of which are trustworthy, and some not. Lance Henriksen's Bishop is as solid as they come, never losing his head (despite being reduced to a puddle of spilt dairy product) and sticking by Ripley's side until the bitter, hectic end. Ripley herself is a little older, a little wiser and a lot tougher, her intensity calcified into grit after losing her daughter, and given somewhat of a surrogate in the form of Newt (Carrie Henn) an orphaned child who has survived months living like a rodent in the air ducts. ""They mostly come at night... mostly"" she eerily warns Ripley. Oh boy, do they ever. LV-426 is positively teeming with them, and they show up to provide speaker shattering, pixel scattering action like only Cameron can do. The facehugger in the room sequence is still one of the most terrifying sequences in any film, and serves to make you hate Weyland weasel Burke (Paul Reiser) with that deep loathing reserved for the scummiest traitors in film. The final thirty minutes of the film are a showcase of action cinema, and it's amazing to think they pulled off the Queen fight without any cgi back then, a slam-bang marvel of a climax that fires on a thousand cylinders, and to this day has never been topped. That goes for the film too. It's *the* action sci-fi film, and as close to perfection as you can get.",

317,17 July 2016,davispittman,10, Get away from her you b***h!,"Absolutely adored this film! Aliens is far better than the original 1979 Alien movie. Seriously, Sigourney weaver was the ultimate bad a** here! She honestly couldn't have deserved that academy award nomination more. This movie will forever be a classic, James Cameron really did it with this movie, he blew me away will everything. From the top notch acting to the writing and the special effects, it's all nothing but the best. The effects were awesome even by today's standards, they still hold up and that's saying something considering this was released in 1986. The writing here is awesome, the writer really deserves many awards for this. Bill Paxton is the one actor I didn't really care for, but he wasn't all bad, he was just annoying in the beginning. The rest of the crew, including Hicks and the others were good characters that I genuinely cared about throughout. The action here is great too, very exciting and well done as far as visuals go. This movie is so incredible in every way! It's a lot of fun, but it's not just about fun, it's deeper than that, and it's very intelligently created. Also, the chemistry between the characters is spot on and so natural seeming. And of course, the infamous line! ""Get away from her you b***h!"" That line will always be one of the most famous lines in cinema history. Aliens is now one of my all time favorite films! 10/10!",
318,14 February 2023,pcristianjohnson,10, Great sci-fi with a strong female lead without the bs,"Not only is the film exquisite in its action, special effects, and acting. This is a film that shows you can have a very strong independent female protagonist without any of the bs politics in between. No need to just blatantly spit it out and rub it into anyone's face. Sigourney weaver shows that she is a survivor and can survive yet again, without any gratuitous nudity or fan service. She is not your average damsel in distress, she's the one (along with nute) who figure out a way of besting the aliens after they have taken over a planet that had been terraforming for years. I remember being shown this film at a very young age, being almost terrified and looking away from the screen when the xenomorphs first make the presents known but then ripely takes control of that troop carrier and like the bad ass she is fights her way to rescue as many of the colonial marines as she can, after that point in the film I never looked away from the screen and was cheering constantly at how awesome not only the movie was, but she was in particular.",

Featuring a super tight story with excellent direction, the cast makes this movie. When I saw it was still in the US Coast Guard. When Hudson is moaning about being short, you could tell all the military in the audience by their understanding moans in return. It starts out slowly and then explodes with action and violence. The aliens, hive like, are just as frightening as in the original. The extended version is even better than the original cut. I really wish Cameron would have directed Starship Troopers.",
323,14 November 2011,Steffi_P,10," ""Game over man""","The 80s were really the first era where video games began to influence the look and above all the experience of movies. This trend arguably began with Star Wars in 1977, although barring some flight sequences near the end the possible link is more about the Computer-generated imagery rather than a game-playing experience. But a decade later, just as virtual reality was starting to become a really exciting concept in both science fiction and modern technology, the idea of an action movie being a primarily first person experience was, well not born as such (the idea was hardly new), but certainly enjoyed a surge that made the 80s a golden age for the genre. Aliens features no CGI, just a fabulous mix of prosthetics, miniatures and animatronics, but it captures much of the pace and passion of the video game age.",

I think I actually enjoy this movie slightly more than the original. The character of Ripely is more flushed out and she goes full on badass in this movie. I also liked the supporting characters in this movie more so than the first. Likely because the adrenaline levels are turned up and the characters can be more colorful (or colourful in Canadian!). This is a review of the theatrical version, as I have yet to see the directors cut. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made.

326,14 October 2005,The_Void,10," The aliens are back...bigger, better and more!","It has become customary among film fans to name Ridley Scott's original 'Alien' as the best of the series; but that is a notion that I cannot agree with. James Cameron's sequel is bigger, more ambitious, more exciting and just generally a better time than it's predecessor. The claustrophobic suspense-driven horror of the first film has thrown out of the window in favour of a more boisterous action stance. This would normally get on my nerves, but Cameron knows how to handle action so well that it's impossible not to go along with everything he shows on screen; and the switch from horror to action, therefore, is very much a good one. The plot is well thought out, and it follows the rescue of Ripley, the heroine of the first film, and it isn't long before she's being asked to go back into action. People have inhabited the planet where her crew picked up the first alien, and that population has become infested with bloodthirsty aliens. Enter a well-equipped team of space marines given the task of going in and finding out what the trouble is. Of course, it's more trouble than they ever imagined...",
327,18 February 2006,nycritic,10, Two Mothers of a Different Kind,"So many sequels fail because they re-hash the same story and bring nothing new to the premises. James Cameron, however, decided that instead of going for a more amped-up repetition of the horror in ALIEN, he decided to reverse the situation, constrict the action to almost claustrophobic levels, and show not one but an entire colony of those nasty aliens, complete with a gigantic Queen. ALIENS is not a horror film but an all-out war movie that also manages to show how we as a race are as opportunistic as we can be. Where ALIEN implied the notion that the crew of the Nostromo was only bait to lure this elusive but highly efficient species out for genetic manipulation, ALIENS takes the premise to extreme lengths. Even then it retains credibility since it has become common knowledge how the powers of the world create their own viruses and play God to unsuspecting humans. However, this is not an existential film but a non-stop thrill-ride filled with three fully fleshed out females stealing the light out from their emasculated male counterparts (played by Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Bill Paxton). Newt (Carrie Henn) is the little girl who witness the destruction of her own security, and who regresses to an animal state in order to survive -- she is able to play the aliens game blow by blow even when her death is omniscient at every turn. Ripley, more of an unwilling survivor of the first movie, is now a rage-induced fury of a woman who will stop at nothing to ensure this species never procreates and sustains one of the most memorable (and symbolic) fight sequences against the Queen as both try to save their own daughters -- Ripley her surrogate Newt, the Queen her entire colony. Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldman), though a little under-written here and there, has as of yet been the only female to body slam an alien punch to punch.",

I couldn't bring myself to watch it for years and when i did it blew me away. Everything about it, characters, scenes, props(pulse rifle, possibly the best movie prop of all time???) the whole shah-bang. It was a movie light years ahead of its time and showcased James Cameron in my eyes as one of the worlds top directors. There really isn't enough you can say about this movie, its just a shame the following films didn't live up to expectation. Does anyone else notice that it doesn't matter how many times you watch it different things appear that you never noticed before? Suppose thats partly what makes you go back to watch it over and over again!",
330,15 October 2022,RonellSowes,8, Perhaps The Best Sequel,Aliens is perhaps the arguably the best sequel. James Cameron was taking on no small feat with making a follow up to a film as strong as Alien but he knew exactly where to take it. While the previous was a sci-fi horror with one monster killing off members of ship this was a sci-fi action with Earth's toughest taking the fight to a colony of xenomorphs. Its intelligently done and though it's a bit long at a 137 minutes each of those is time well used in this action packed adventure-thriller. Aliens joins the ranks of many great movies with the fact that it breaks genres it combines so many different aspects into this one complete film. Of course the star of the film is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley but Michael Biehn is something of a co-lead for the better part of this film and he delivers. It's puzzling how The Terminator and Aliens didnt lead to a larger action movie career for him because he's terrific in both.,

I just watched it again (2018) and i can't believe what a piece of garbage this is. There are sooooo many plot holes, cringe worthy scenes, and just utter disregard to reality. Yes this is a si-fy movie but MAN did they jump the shark! I just can't believe that this movie was praised at all. There are scenes where Cameron decided to ""intensify"" the action, with NO APPARENT reason!!!!! If its just me than ok. but please re-watch it. It will put this movie in a new perspective",
332,5 January 2016,Sandcooler,9, The perfect horror-action blend,"While the original ""Alien"" certainly got under my skin more with its claustrophobic shots, I would say ""Aliens"" is at least equally entertaining. What I like most about James Cameron's action movies is that he never looks down on the genre. It's not because he makes action that the movie shouldn't feature well thought-out dialogues, a coherent story and actual characters, quite to the contrary: there's no point in doing awful things to your protagonists if we don't care about them in the first place. The first act is purely about getting to know the characters, that way it actually has some dramatic value when they inevitably get killed. The action itself looks amazing as well, it's incredible what you can do with practical effects if you don't have CGI to bail you out. The alien queen was so huge it needed fourteen crew members to make it move realistically, but the upside to that: it moves realistically, not pixel by pixel. I miss that charm in modern day action movies, but thankfully a movie like ""Aliens"" is infinitely rewatchable.",
333,30 April 2016,PredragReviews,9, Let's Rock!,"This film is simply full on action from the man behind ""The Terminator"" and ""True Lies"". Uncomparable to Alien as they are completely different. The first builds tension and is more of a horror film where as this is just a massive bullet fest. Sheer class. It has that classic Cameron action sequences and special effects, but also a frantic and claustrophobic atmosphere. The music is one of the best scores ever recorded for a movie and adds tension as the soldiers fight for their lives in a situation that they cannot hope to win.",

Sigourney Weaver does such a fine job of reprising her iconic Ellen Ripley role that she got an Oscar nomination for best actress, not something that happens too often for genre films. It may not be as innovative as Scotts' film, but it's still got plenty of atmosphere and tension and keeps your interest even though it's very long for this sort of thing (with the theatrical version running 137 minutes and the special edition coming in even longer at 155 minutes). 30 years later, it maintains its status as one of the most popular and enjoyed films of its type.",

This film is one of only a few sequels made that can actually stand toe to toe with the first films in their series. I liked James Cameron's approach to building on perfection, and that's more guns, more gore, and more aliens. It really works well. Another plus for me is the transformation of Ripley, from a dainty survivor to an extremely strong character, and woman. The supporting cast is extremely likable and you don't want them to die but you know it's inevitable. I own the extended version and I prefer it to the theatrical version, as all the extra scenes actually have an impact on the overall film. All in all this is a very good film and i'm looking forward to seeing the new film because it will be ignoring 'Alien3 and Alien;resurrection'.",

Unless you're really young, you have missed the best movie ever made in entertainment history. I really hope that one has'nt been unlucky enough to have seen Alien-3, Alien resurrection or God forbid, AVP, before actually having seen Alien and Aliens for the first time. To maximize your enjoyment and understanding of Aliens, watch Alien-1 first and then go buy a home theater or locate a cinema hall where this is running and then only see it.

But it isn't done in a silly gimmicky way.

There is so much truly stunning cinematography. Sound design continues the epic memorable trend set by the first film. The most memorable being the pulse rifle sounds. Characters are memorable and interesting except maybe Newt who can get a little annoying but overall that is a minor gripe. There are some truly awesome moments in the story that is perfectly told. The special edition is better than the theatrical version but it is very long! I love the action and evolution of the series. It is exciting and fun. I do usually prefer suspense to action.

He was the perfect man for the job, and the result is truly, truly magnificent. The movie acts like a full-blown action movie, like a wildcat, every aspect of lurking excitement from the first is here drawn into a slashing blow-'em up setting that's extremely well pulled off. The mixture of horrifying excitement with right-on military marines is a instant feature, and is just as greatly balanced as only Cameron could have achieved. Weaver returns fantastically as the bewildered Ripley as she once again encounters the terrifying creatures from outer space, and although it's a simple fan-question whether you prefer the first or the second, ALIENS has got all of the strengths from the first and puts them effectively into a new, refreshing setting.

Where Ridley Scott's first film was loaded up with atmosphere, exploration and an overwhelming sense of terrified wonder at the habits of an unfamiliar life form, James Cameron's sequel is faced with the task of expanding upon a theme that's already been fairly thoroughly prodded. Dropping the intellectual angles and dramatic pauses in favor of unbridled, run-and-gun chaos, it still manages to feel akin to its predecessor via more than a monster suit and lead actress. While Aliens doesn't take as much time to appreciate the sights, they're still around, and they remain excellent examples of on-screen world building. The power of the aliens themselves seems very diminished - they're little more than waves of cannon fodder by the second act - but Cameron compensates with a bold determination to examine them as a versatile breed of fauna. Although its dalliances into action tripes can be distracting, and a few lines of dialog are eyeball-spinningly cheeseball, the film is still a success. How much of that is due to its young director's touch, rather than the power of the galaxy that had been established in the original, is open for debate.",

While its predecessor is a work of art, Aliens feels much more like a cheap and desperate Hollywood money-spinner. Sigourney Weaver, so brilliant in the original, is turned into a corny superhero complete with ridiculous plot armour. The obligatory scene of her in underwear at the end is a fair reflection of this film's neediness. The rest of the crew are laughably one-dimensional, particularly when compared with the brilliant cast of Alien. The addition of the little girl and her incessant screaming is another cheap ploy with no purpose other than to appease the popcorn-munchers. And the aliens themselves lose all intrigue, popping up left, right and centre to kill or be killed as the plot demands. The overall look of the film takes a backward step as well- the sets look cheap and the special effects are inferior to the original.",

Ridley's Scott's Alien (1979) is still a timeless atmospheric science fiction-horror classic and while Alien scared you out of your seat, Aliens blew you out of your seat.

What I got was Rambo in space with all the levels of forethought, scriptwriting skills and character development that made films like Commando and the Rambos etc. what they were - very bad movies. The makers of Aliens missed the point of the original completely - the original alien was scary because they couldn't kill it, the characters were imperfect and real and had real fears - in this gungho rubbish the aliens get splattered all over the place and the characters seemed only scared that the director might not get their best angle.

398,23 September 2011,The-Sarkologist,9, A sequel that simply does not seem to stop for a breath.,"This is the sequel to the Ridley Scott movie Alien. James Cameron has taken the original movie, kept the dark and dirty setting and added his own touches which makes James Cameron the film maker that he is. The main difference is that where the original was one alien against a crew of a freighter, this movie is thousands of aliens against a unit of US marines. Cameron does his characters quite well. Hudson (Bill Paxton) is memorable and seems to represent the general mentality of the marines. At the start he is a loud mouthed big head who thinks he is invincible because he is a marine. After the aliens attack, he becomes a scared, helpless human being who cannot handle what he us up against. Most of the marines put their faith in themselves and this collapses, especially with Hudson, when they realise that they are not as mighty as they once were. The evil of the corporation comes out in this movie as I am told it does in the original. It deals with their greed as they are interested more in capturing an Alien rather that destroying them as they are a threat. They see the aliens as a resource that could be exploited and used if controlled. Burke (Paul Reiser) is corporate representative. His character is willing to kill all of the marines and Riply, yet is against destroying the facility as it is worth a lot of money. To him a human life is worth far less than a new product for the corporation. Even though Burke is quite ruthless in his actions, we are shown that the aliens do not care who people are, they are willing to kill Burke as much as a marine. He attempts to flee, leaving the marines to their fate, only to be torn apart by an alien only minutes later. His act of cowardice was finally his downfall. Aliens also shows us that we are not in control of our world. Even though we may think that a team of crack marines can solve anything, the reality is far from it. They are trained to the point where the people in power believe that they can handle anything, but all of their training means nothing in the field. One of the marines is asked how many drops he has been on; the reply is that he has been on about thirty drops but all but two were simulated, and the current one is his second. Even though they are going out to face danger, the marines are very blasé about the whole event. When they get out of their sleeping capsules, they are more interested in joking about slippers, complaining about food, and rescuing colony girls from their virginity. When they are first told about the alien threat, Hudson's response is ""How do I get out of this chicken ... outfit"". Nobody takes the threat seriously. This reflects us. We live our lives in a very blasé way. We don't realise that death may come any minute. When we hear of the truth of Christ, our response is like Hudson's, that is get lost. We don't want to hear about the judgement Christ is going to bring to the world and are surprise when things such as earthquakes and death happen. We curse God and turn our back on him and when everything falls apart, we are ready to put a gun to our head and kill ourselves. This is clearly seen in the 1929 stockmarket crash, people throwing themselves out of windows because of the belief that all their money, the thing they based their entire life around, is gone. God is by far different. By following him does not mean that we won't suffer or die, but death does not have to be fearsome. We understand the world and realise that even though we suffer here, we will not suffer when we meet God after our death. All of the things of this world become meaningless; just because we loose all of our money does not mean we loose out. God is always there; he can never be taken away from us. What do we do, we don't take a Hudson attitude and write him off, but rather take a Riply attitude, by understanding the true nature of the threat and preparing yourself when it comes.",

That said, James Cameron remained remarkably faithful to Scott's masterpiece with its dark, violent tone. The characters although more memorable than other films, seemed to be a bit too dramatic and colorful, which takes the viewer out of the doom and gloom atmosphere. While the writing was down in that aspect, the story-line was really tense and flowed really nicely. What Cameron is best known for though is his visual effects made for the big screen in theaters.

420,17 December 2013,geminiredblue,10, Get Away From Her You...,"In 1979, Ridley Scott's ALIEN invaded the theaters, scaring the pants off of everyone with a highly lethal extraterrestrial. In 1986, James Cameron made this sequel. And what a sequel it is! ALIENS may, in fact, be the best sequel ever! For 57 years, lone survivor Ripley (Weaver) has been floating out in space. Shortly after being rescued, she's asked to go back to the planet where the alien ship was discovered in the first movie. In the 57 years, colonists have settled on the planet and recently went missing. A team of space marines tag along to investigate the disappearance. What they find is truly terrifying! Building upon the original movie's premise, Cameron turns it into an action thriller, with a healthy dose of chills, tough guy theatrics and instantly-quotable one-liners. Ripley's character has been strengthened, now tough as nails and bad-ass. Late in the film, her fight with The Queen is a memorable cinematic battle. Overall, the movies is excellent. My only complaint is with the re-issued SPECIAL EDITION of the film, in which 15 additional minutes were added back in. The extra footage included several unnecessary exposition scenes (one of which introduces Newt way too early). To that version, I give only 9 stars.

423,15 June 2009,tburke85,8, Aliens A Solid Sci-Fi Horror Sequel,"Aliens is a solid sci-fi horror sequel from director James Cameron whose admirable in making this movie. Cameron has show in all his movies his talent as filmmaker and this one is no different. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley set fifty years after the original which finds her character once again battling the nightmarish creature that killed her whole crew except this time there's more than one a lot more. Weaver is effective in the role and continues to be the best Ripley. The talented supporting cast are admirable in their roles including Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Bill Paxton. Some of them may have limited screen time but they make the best of their small parts in the movie. The rest of the cast are good in their roles too. The special effects are equally impressive especially for that time and the alien monster's still look terrifying including the Queen. The creature action is well executed and intense there's definitely more of it in this one than the original which made it feel a little more faster paced. Director James Cameron delivered on nearly everything that fans come to except from a good sequel by amping up the action, suspense, alien monsters, and body count which does make it a worthy sequel to the first one. Despite some flaws with character development the rest of the movie makes up for it. Overall Aliens is an entertaining sci-fi horror sequel with enough monster action, suspense, thrills, great special effects, terrifying villains, and exceptional performances from the cast (epecially Weaver and Biehn) who make this movie worth watching. Well done.",
424,11 April 2000,revival05,8, Second best in the series.,"Sorry for some spelling-misstakes**  What a ride! This is not at all like the first one. I wouldn't want to say it's better but it sure has got more speed. Here we are talking action not thriller. The acting is more of the fun kind, while it was a bit more serious in the first one. This is though the second best Alien-movie. The thought of an army of Aliens chocked the most of us back in 86 after experiencing ''Alien''. At first the feeling is a bit like the original movie. But soon you will find out that that is not the case. This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The special effects are really cool and Cameron really makes it go fast. The tempo is fast just as ''Terminator'' and ''T2''. If you like real fast movies with a lot of action, weapons, slimy monsters, and some really cool characters you will like this movie big time!",

I still think that, but ""Aliens"" is a better made and better thought out movie. Even though there are still a few questions of mine that left unanswered, I did like this movie. Do I think it deserves to be in the top 100? No, even though I did like it, it's still a little over rated. There are better movies, but some people just see some things in movies that other's can't I guess. But I would highly recommend this movie still, because it is a great action movie.

434,30 September 2015,joshuafagan-64214,10, Better than the Original; A Masterpiece,"Before I go into the review, let me talk about the series as a whole. Every entry of this series was made by a different director. This is also true of the Mission: Impossible series, as you may remember if you're a film buff or if you read my very first official film review. But as much as I love the Mission: Impossible directors and although the movies as a whole are superior to the Alien movies, the directing talent of the latter series is ridiculous. In order, you have Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, all of whom have at least one movie on this list. How Alien: Resurrection turned out to be such a mess is still a mystery to me; yes, a lot can happen and people can be put on and kicked off and productions can be basically a toxic waste zone. But you still have not only the director of Amelie but bloody Joss Whedon on your movie. How do you screw that up? Okay: enough ranting. Time to get onto the review of one of the finest action movies ever made. The core of the film, of course, is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, still the finest female character as far as action is concerned. In the first film, she is not the focal character, as the audience was meant to be surprised when she was the only one that survived. It is a good narrative trick that worked perfectly, but I much prefer to see her front and center.",

436,6 April 2020,KoolCatReviews,9," If its war you want, you will get it","Taking the original alien story forward by adding tons of action might not have been the best way for the series moving forward but this entry is good. It is quite similar to other 80s movies at the time drawing heavy inspiration from the veitnam war. With biggest different being with the female lead. There might be lots of macho army guys in this movie but none are as good as Ripley. The plot in this movie works with a few twists and turns that original didn't have. You get great effects and CGI the same as the first movie. The best part about this movie is you get to see alot more of the 'alien' universe. I would recommend watching the extended addition and there is some extra footage that is worth watching. If you want that classic Sci-fi horror blend that is now action heavy, you will enjoy this.",

One of the opening sequences shows an unaccustomed brilliance -- the scene where the face shot of Ripley dissolves/merges into the picture of the planet is of such loveliness, it's jaw-dropping every time I see it. This is much more than a typical ""schlurp and munch"" movie. Great action, great dialog, great plot pick up from the original. Yes, the Marines are rather stereotypical, but at least they're a fun bunch and have some depth and differentiation. Ms. Weaver got the Oscar nod just for her delivery of that classic line ""Bitch!"" line. Too bad she was up against Marlee Matlan for Children of a Lesser G-d. ",

You can't see much on the screen and again you gotta figure out whats going on. Some people say this darkness mixture with blue makes the movie scary and interesting, but comm om, it just makes it confusing. It's not even enough to scare us, but it was enough to make me bored. Acting here goes pretty much the same as Alien (since the first movie wasn't that exceptional), except for some short role characters interpreted by bad actors. But good news: the third and fourth Alien its about to get worse. Soundtrack passes by without get stuck in your memory, it just accomplishes it's role: follow the scene.",

Aliens Is a Crude, but Bitchin' Sequel","When Aliens hit theaters in 1986, it's predecessor, Ridley Scott's Alien, was already a science-fiction classic, and it's director, James Cameron, was a relative unknown in Hollywood. Coming on the heels of his surprise hit, The Terminator, Cameron blew the doors off what anyone was expecting to see in a sequel to Alien. Aliens was a huge, ambitious sci-fi action spectacular that traded quiet horror for slam bang pyrotechnics. It was a rousing success in 1986, but looking back at it today reveals some cracks. As per usual for a James Cameron film, Aliens is a rock solid story with some totally badass moments, but unlike Cameron's later work, it never quite captures the exquisite craftsmanship and event movie feel of The Abyss through Avatar.",
455,13 January 2010,jhughe22-634-62692,5," Overrated Movie, Overrated Director","Unlike Ridley Scott's beautifully directed original, Aliens suffers from the classic James Cameron heavy handedness. Cameron, like Lucas, clearly is a believer that more is more. Where one Alien was enough for the original, a hundred are now necessary. Ridley Scott created an original where the viewer felt for the main character, she was lonely and scared and up against a terrible lurking creature that was terrifying because it was unknown and mysterious. The tag line was even ""in space no one can hear you scream,"" which really captures the essence of what made the original work. So for the sequel James Cameron brought us a group of unprofessional marines with comically impractical uniforms and equipment and plenty of ammunition and set them up against wave after wave of aliens. How could it possibly be functional to have so much equipment hanging off of you and sticking out all over the place to get snagged on anything you walk past? The fear factor of the alien is diminished with numbers, Cameron transformed the story line from horror to standard shoot em up, arcade style action. Aliens pop up just to get shot down just like in a video game. The dialog is terrible, Bill Paxton gave his worst acting job of his career (which is saying something cause he's no Laurence Olivier). I feel that James Cameron and George Lucas fall into the same vein, they are so obsessed with what they can do they don't think about what the should do. They show absolutely no restraint because what drives the medium for them is special effects not story. Ridley Scott showed restraint, and his reward is that he directed one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Cameron on the other hand created an artistically devoid film with terrible acting, terrible dialog, where we don't care when characters die, and aliens are just popping out of the walls and ceiling to get shot down.",

If you haven't seen it before I implore you to watch it, but be prepared it's a scare fest. This is always the answer to the question when someone asks, can you name a sequel that was better then the original? answer yes this one!! Sheer utter brilliance.

The marines all act like marines, Ripley's gradual development works, and the mother/daughter relationship feels genuine. And then, of course, there's the aliens - one of them was scary in the original, so hundreds of them is downright terrifying.

For a movie that is 15 years old the special effects still hold up even today - that is just amazing. Never did I doubt the reality of the movie or the possibility of aliens such as those in the film actually existing. This is a film that will give you nightmares. You'll care about the characters because they are ALL likeable and fun. There's more one-liners than a Schwarzeneggar movie here too, talk about the quotage! The music by James Horner is also first rate and heart pounding. It's also a testament to pacing and intensity that the last hour of the film is filled with so much tension and drama that you will feel worn out by the time the credits roll.

The storyline for this picture is very good and contains many more scenes with the aliens and face-huggers than the first picture. The shootouts and special effects are excellent. The cast are well selected and the dialogue between characters is hilarious and entertaining. The space elements, space craft, weapons and special effects are incredibly well done. The conclusion is awesome and they do a great job of having Ripley emerge as a hero in this film - both in rescuing troops, coming up with plans, and of course her matchup vs the Queen to close the film.

In 1979, Alien terrified audiences and is now hailed - rightly so - as one of the most important sci-fi and horror films of all time. Subsequently, in 1984, James Cameron released his powerful debut The Terminator. (If you discount his true debut, Piranha II. Eek.) While Alien proved how terrifying sci-fi can be, Terminator proved the same - but also how emotional it can be too. Aliens builds on the legacy of both its predecessor, and Cameron's own predecessor. He expertly explores the emotional back-stories of the characters that we just weren't given the time to do in Alien. But he doesn't forget what the sci-fi buffs and the horror fans want - plenty of action, plenty of screams and a grand spectacle. Aliens is, quite simply, the best sequel I've ever seen.",

It voices the reality of a problem gotten bigger. Sigourney Weaver returns as the survivor of the first film and awakens in the presence of military. They plan to destroy the aliens but the sleazy Burke has other plans. Upon reaching their destination Weaver discovers a little girl whose family was killed by the creatures. When the aliens surface, a fight for survival begins. Well plotted sequel with blazing action that never distracts from the narrative. It is James Cameron's remarkable twist in genres creating a great followup to The Terminator. Weaver delivers a knockout performance as Ripley who awakens to a whole new nightmare but the young girl gives her reason to live. Paul Reiser plays the scheming Burke who will receive his just desserts when his plan backfires. Lance Henriksen plays android Bishop whom Ripley first is hostile too after Ash from the first film but he gradually builds trust and ultimately sacrifice. Michael Biehn as a soldier takes charge and benefits. Carrie Henn plays the little girl whom Weaver rescues and determined to keep safe. While the original was horror, this one caters to action with nightmarish creatures underlining the threat that closed lids will not erase from the mind. Score: 9 / 10",
479,11 August 2004,Aaron1375,9, A horror science fiction action movie so good it almost makes you uncomfortable to watch.,"I saw this one in the theaters as a kid with my mom.  I was only eleven, but I really liked the looks of this one from the previews, besides I had an alien toy from the original ""Alien"" movie so I always liked the way it looked.  It was creepy and seeing a whole mess of aliens vs marines was to much for me to pass up.  My mom took me because she liked the first one too and we had a good time.  Of its faults its main one is not really a fault. That is that the movie puts you the viewer in with these people who are in a very dire situation.  It makes you nervous that they may not make it out alive and there are very much doubts to whether they will survive the ordeal.  No matter how many times I see it I feel this way.  Still though what you came to see is also present...future army guys (the marines) going against an army of aliens.  Still the movie builds up rather slowly at first, this lures you into the world of the alien, then it rockets you in with a fire fight where you see very little of the aliens, then finally there is an all out assault.  I will not say much about this assault, but to say the marines do not do to well.  After this Ripley (Weaver) must brave the hoard of aliens alone in an attempt to rescue a little girl all the while a reactor on this planet is about to blow the place sky high.  With this alien movie you are in for a wild ride.",

The movie's pacing is still incredibly slow, but the payoff is still action packed and more that worth the wait.",

Fast paced action, excellent story telling, accurate writing of characters and top notch SFX! Once the movie starts you are totally sucked in the story and feel part of the rescue team. You care about each character and you are worrying about what is going to happen next. Like somebody else already said, Aliens is one the rarest cases of a sequel surpassing the original.

It's rare to come across a superior sequel and this movie by far surpasses the original. First of all, you get to see more of the aliens, and see them go about attacking and killing humans, while the humans think of different survival tactics, which is a lot of fun to watch them go about doing. second, although the characters in the first movie were dull, in this movie they are interesting and you actually care if some of them lives or dies or at least live long enough to know them a bit more or watch them in action some more, especially the character Bill Paxton plays. The special effects are also way ahead of it's time, and made good use of it. The dialogue in the movie which is a bit corny at times, is still fun to listen to especially some of the wisecracks some of the characters dish out. This movie by far the best in the quadrilogy so far...maybe ""Alien 5"" might change that which is currently in the process of being made by Ridley Scott.

490,28 March 2023,kaaffilm,10," ""James Cameron's ""Aliens"" Delivers Thrills, Heart, and Unforgettable Action""","""Aliens"" is a thrilling and intense masterpiece of sci-fi action that surpasses its predecessor in every way. Directed by James Cameron, the film follows Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as she returns to the planet where she first encountered the alien creature, this time accompanied by a squad of heavily armed marines. The tension and suspense build throughout the film, as the marines are slowly picked off one by one by the formidable aliens. The action is non-stop and brilliantly executed, with Cameron showcasing his skill at creating epic set pieces and intense action sequences. The special effects and creature design are top-notch, and the performances, particularly by Weaver and Michael Biehn, are excellent. What sets ""Aliens"" apart from other action films is its heart and depth of character. Ripley is a complex and fascinating protagonist, and the film explores themes of motherhood, sacrifice, and the nature of humanity in the face of unimaginable horror. ""Aliens"" is a classic for a reason, and stands as one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.",

There is no doubt that it is one of the best and most remarkable horror films ever made, and one of the ""fathers"" of contemporary sci-fi cinema. This film was thought to give logical continuity to the story started in that film, and I think it couldn't be better than it is. There are many people who consider the film to be excessively dated, with sets and effects that look old. I strongly disagree. It's true that digital and CGI are not here, but if you think about the amount of bad CGI and bad effects that we have to swallow in today's movies, it's really nice to see a movie with effects that work well and look amazing fifty years later. .",

Not the first movie wasn't good, I love all the alien movies, some more then others and for various reasons. But if I had to pick a favorite and say this is the best of the series, I would have to say this movie. James Cameron starts in full speed and don't stop until a great explosive climax that is worthy of me. The story is great, now for the bad news.

I think it was unfair of Cameron to make an Alien movie this great because it's a hard movie to follow up as the next two Alien movies prove. James Cameron knows what makes a great movie, it's like he's a movie fan more than a director because he knows what we want. Instead of having a few Aliens which would have been acceptable (because the first one had only one) we get treated to hundreds of aliens and marines with lots of guns!

The best of all was the effects. Just outstanding! The cinematography and the production design were good, and visually appealing in general. Anyway, I was not too satisfied with the storyline. The movie had a good beginning and ending, but it was nothing special in total. The pace was very slow between the action scenes because there were only long-lasting and cliché conversations scenes between them. I like Ripley as a character, but I'm not really a fan of the soldiers. The attacks and the shooting were disappointing, and not really creative, in my opinion. The Xenomorph in Alien (1979) felt powerful, but even though there were many of them in this one, they didn't feel that frightening. They were killed too easily. The Xenomorph queen felt dangerous, though, which was good, but she didn't have that long screen time. So to conclude, a movie with a good beginning and ending, but mediocre in total.",

I did not understand about alien killing thing because they should spit sulfur in close combats but when it comes to those characters that should stay alive they somehow are invisible. In movie there is no intrigue because from the beginning you know who will die and order of death. Also they were too stupid to check air shafts and safely wait for airship.

Everybody probably went into the theater either thinking it was gonna be a waste of time, or it would be a pleasant surprise. Of course, 35 years later, you probably already know the answer. It was a pleasant surprise, and MORE! I pick this sequel over Judgement Day, personally. While both movies are equally awesome, it's ""Aliens"" that has the more memorable quotes (of course, Judgement Day has that too, but I just liked the quotes in Aliens more) This sequel takes a more action-y turn than the first, going 57 years after the events of the first movie. Colonial Marine Lieutenant and Carter Burke ask Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) to join an investigation of a colony. Reluctantly, she agrees. When they arrive, they find the place empty. Deserted. While investigating, they find a nine-year-old called Newt (Carrie Henn). She, in my opinion, was a very fine addition to the movie; she was one of the key elements that made the movie work so well. Of course, I will not go on any longer in this review without mentioning the amazing Colonel Marine characters. Each one managed to deliver equally amazing performances, particularly Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein). While Ripley (or Weaver) easily stole the show as flawlessly as she did in the original, these Marines deliver hilarious quotes (""Game over, man! Game over!"") and make this movie a mix of suspenseful and pure fun. While the last hour of the movie is very, very intense, it is very crucial to the plot. Overall, this is a brilliant, suspenseful, and a rare perfect sequel that managed to live up to the original. Yes, I do recommend this to you.",

539,4 January 2006,barnabyrudge,9," Slam-bang sequel to ""Alien"" which is possibly even better than its predecessor.","""Aliens"" is a terrific sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi shocker ""Alien"". This time around the director is James Cameron and unsurprisingly the emphasis has been shifted onto hardware, with a narrative that features a bunch of marines blasting aliens away with some awesome weaponry (whereas, in the earlier film, the emphasis was on jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments). In my opinion, ""Aliens"" is actually slightly better than its predecessor because it is more visceral and urgent, and encourages more repeat viewings. Sigourney Weaver's character has evolved very appealingly too. In ""Alien"" she acted like a victim and her quest was merely to escape from the whole ordeal in one piece; in ""Aliens"" she is physically and mentally stronger and is quite prepared to take on the aliens, comforted with the knowledge that she has beaten them once before.",

Almost every single line he delivered was fantastic, memorable and quotable from his bantering with Vazquez to his honest and accurate assessment of the situations they found themselves in. I really believe you could replace any other character in the movie, but his portrayal of Hudson was so unique it made the movie. Well certainly did for me and my friends when we watched it countless times back in our college years. Thanks for the memories.",

This time James Cameron scripted and directed after his wonderful success in 1984 with The Terminator. Here Cameron has made a sequel that first does no harm to the original or the 'Alien' name in following that film and essentially leading us directly to this sequel. Secondly, in my opinion it brings the bar that Scott has left so high and brings it up another notch. To me this is something that does not happen very often. Interestingly, Cameron did it again when he made Terminator 2 (which to me was even better than the original). Co-written with Walter Hill (who directed the 48 Hrs. movies) and David Giler.",

It's very scary, it's very slow paced and long (extended edition), but the execution is so well done it does not feel boring and instead it's very suspense. The whole film feels unsettling and it's full of jumpscare twists which are extraordinary well executed. The build-up to jumpscares and action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. The action is kind of out-dated, we can only see monster getting shot or characters shooting, but not both at the same time, but on the other hand the practical effects are superb. It has possibly the best female protagonist ever, she's a great lead, feels natural and not forced like we see in nowadays propoganda feminist movies. Aliens is awesome.",

What really surprised me is that this film explores a whole different side of Ripley's personality, all while retaining the spirit of the original movie. If you haven't seen the film, it goes like this: Ellen Ripley (played with a quiet fury by Sigourney Weaver) is rescued after spending 57 years in cryosleep after the events of Aliens, and is called upon to be an adviser for a group of marines who have to head back to planet from the original film, due to the fact that a colony that was established has stopped transmitting signals to them. And that's all it takes for this tour-de-force to start, and by God, it doesn't stop for anything. The creature effects in the film are amazing (and it's hard to believe that the illusion of hordes of aliens were created with just five prop suits!), and all the actors pull off their roles (especially Weaver, Carrie Henn as the frightened survivor Newt, and Bill Paxton as the wisecracking Hudson).

This film was extremely creative for its time. I remember effectively being freaked out when I first watched this film as a child because it was a very wide departure from films like ""E.T.""

The SE special edition features a family who happens upon the egg chamber, setting off events, which I don't think was in the original. Also the robotic guns in the tunnel holding off the aliens. The plot and acting at times are cartoonish and outlandish, but as a teen when first seeing it, was a plus. Once they're killed off, it's Ripley/Weaver in her element. The technological aspects were very visionary at the time, when we had Commodore 64s or such. The only aspect that 'is showing some wear' was the flight of the spacecraft against the clouds...a mildly dated, toylike but still quite good. The movie had a supersize me approach, the more the merrier. Aliens was the peak of this series, though Alien vs. Predator was excellent..a nice comeback.

It's one of the best movies ever made. It's so well made that even if it had bad acting or a poor script, it would be hard to notice but it doesn't have those flaws. The plot has to deal with Ellen Ripley going back on the planet that she picked up the Alien in the first movie. She goes with a team of Marines that have some cool guns. The best character isn't Ripley this time. It's Private Hudson. He's so funny and he's the person you could relate to. Bill Paxton does a great job as the funny guy.

559,30 July 2005,pc95,10, One of the best....,"Aliens is probably the best sci-fi/horror/action movie combination made to date. Its pacing is near perfection with great acting all around from the Sigourney Weaver down to extras. It has the right blend of action, suspense, and horror never overdoing it. It never strays from its focus and constantly involves the viewer in the outer-world futuristic atmosphere. The production design, like Alien is fabulous once again - with FX still well done by today's standards - this goes as a case in point of how live puppetry, modeling, and costuming with a lot of attention to detail easily outdoes today's CGI which is while nice to look at - doesn't bring the same level of realism. Any fan has seen Aliens more than 10x at least. People who rate this against its predecessor are missing the point, that both are equally effective movies while the subsequent movies (Alien 3, Alien Resurrection) are poor and jumbled with effects\acting going downhill. Its no wonder either since Alien and Aliens were directed by Scott and Cameron respectively - tops in the business. Aliens is not for the easily scared - it is an intense viewing experience giving it muster, energy, and force. I'm happy to have it in my collection, and enjoy revisiting it from time-to-time.",
560,6 March 2013,raulfaust,7, Monsters everywhere,"Whilst in 1999's ""Alien"" most of the time we're expecting for the big thing, this one is the opposite. We have aliens here and there every time, with much more action than the first installment. One thing to praise in this picture is the GREAT direction James Cameron showed; he knows how to make suspenseful scenes and a well built atmosphere. Actors are also very professional and do their job as we expect. Everything was going very fine to me, until Ripley decided to go back to the infested ""plane"" to save that annoying little girl. It sounded SO Cliché that I almost gave up on this. Surely it doesn't spoil the movie's quality in general, but it lost some points with me after that. Also, it's irritating that when we think the movie is over, Cameron revives a monster or create a new one out of nowhere. All in all, it is a great movie, but I still stick to the first version.",

This is a real treat and fest to eyes. Sigourney Weeaver, Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn and others did such a marvelous job here. Ripley was never better, more convincing, decent and reckless than here. And then, there are those horrible, ghoulish shrieking aliens, so terrible and so menacing that they make you blood chill and freeze all 2 hours. This film was made in 1986 but still is watched like a very modern, up-to-date, fast, wild and unmitigated audacious attempt. Really good, really great. Highly recommended for all who like such thrillers. Well done, with excellent props, FX's and deep dark atmosphere of fear and horror",

569,1 July 2003,Zoopansick,10, One of the best 5 sci-fi/action movies ever!,"This movie shows what is possible with a good director for a sci-fi movie. Under Cameron's direction this film creates an entirely unique feel from the first one (which comes off as more of a horror suspense film) while remaining creepy.  Aliens is one of the best action movies ever made, and there are several reasons for that.  The first is that it takes time to build up to any action at all, and by the time it does you actually have some feelings for the characters.  I think when the first action scene does come as an audience member you actually feel the desperation of the marines as they get ambushed by the aliens.  The audience actually hates the Paul Reiser character too, and more geniuenly then they do the usual bad guy.  He is slime and people love it when he finally gets what he deserves.  In my opinion most sci-fi films fail because the audience (especially a modern cynical audience) doesn't suspend their beliefs and won't accept spaceships and monsters etc.  But Aliens is one of those rare few that people accept. The characters are developed and human and the aliens themselves look real and believable.  The action is well paced and once it gets going it really moves.  I think this movie is really a blast the first time you see it, because you don't know who is gonna make it out, or what's gonna happen next (though I'm sure many suspected Weaver to survive).  I think the first movie set the stage for that unexpected element, but this one delievers a totally different and in my opinion better experience than the first.  If you like sci-fi or even just action movies this one isn't to be missed.  It's highly influential in both genres and ranks in the top 5 in both, or at least in my opinion.",

573,26 October 2014,joeshing,9, Not better than the first... but,"James Cameron did a fantastic job here. I still prefer the first but we can see Cameron taking his mechanised mania to the extreme with his usual sensibilities. Do I make much sense? Ripley is understandably annoyed at the presence of a synthetic, given what happened last time, but she soon has her hands full looking after the colony's only survivor – little girl Newt (Carrie Henn, who can scream at a pitch I didn't think was possible for humans).

Certainly if you haven't see it by now, you owe yourself that favor.

Of course, with a sequel appearing seven years after the original, Alien had plenty of time to rest on its laurels before the follow-on film came along. Watching Aliens (1986) with the knowledge of James Cameron's other work, it soon becomes apparent that this movie is all his own. After all, if I told you there's a James Cameron film about space marines invading an alien world to eliminate an alien threat, many of you would think I'm referring to Avatar (2009) and not Aliens (1986).",

582,21 September 2013,JamesMitchell451,10, The best sequel ever created,"For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.",

As a matter of fact, I happen to think he is an egotistical blowhard whose claims in the area of storytelling are rarely backed up by his end product. Titanic and Terminator 2 are good examples of this. The former was not a patch on earlier films about what remains the worst maritime disaster on record (I think), such as A Night To Remember. The latter just doesn't cut it compared to the grittiness of the film it follows on from, which was a blatant example technophobia passed off as science fiction. So what is it about Aliens that makes me watch it time and time again in spite of having been directed by one of my least favourites?",
590,18 April 2016,sharky_55,9, It won't make a difference.,"Aliens is in many a carbon copy of the action thriller that was Alien - in which the lone feminist Ripley goes beyond her means to beat down the enemies and go through a personal growth. There is the same time limit which blares through the action to remind us of the impending doom. The same company interfering moral boundaries for their own financial gain. And there is the second chance for the Alien to strike back - they are never truly safe on these spaceships. Interestingly enough although Cameron builds much on the world that Scott created with a larger wealth of secondary characters and regulations and jurisdictions, but is wise enough to remain in the gritty, mysterious final frontier. No doubt Earth by now is either a desolate wasteland or glittering utopia - but the story does not need the contrast. There is a peculiar shot that sums it all up - the despondent Ripley waiting for any news about the current timeline, sitting on a bench within some trees, and then the camera swings around and reveals the background as a phony, two dimensional projection.

When I heard that a sequel was occurring, I was not a happy camper, but James Cameron did a clever thing by following a methodical, deadly serious solemn film using the same main character to make a rip-roaring action film. I was stunned at how good it was even though it contained much lighter and at times sillier characters. Sigourney Weaver is a terrific heroine once again and of the newbies, Bill Paxton stands out as the most welcome. This is one terrific and fun action film that's a little creaky in the special effects departments after 36 years, though not the creatures themselves, and unlike the original, some of the characters seem a tad silly now and then. All the rest of the films that contain the Alien creatures are a must to avoid, though the third in this series had a strong premise, but it ultimately did not work primarily due to it being too dark and ugly with a frenetic, unclear ending by a first time film director. In all of film history, has there ever been a film series that started off with directors of the caliber of Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher?! I think not.

626,17 February 2015,RossRivero99,10, Cameron's best science fiction masterpiece since Avatar,"James Cameron's Aliens (1986) is nonetheless one of the best science fiction movies ever made along with Avatar (2009) , Inception (2010), Gravity (2013), 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968), E.T. (1982), Alien (1979), Minority Report (2002) and so much more, the movie picks up it's story from the last scene where the 1979 movie left off but instead it's 57 years later and Lt. Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver in an Oscar nominated performance) doesn't even know where she is and while being found she knows that the Aliens that she encountered before are about to strike again and everyone thinks she's crazy and then a few minutes later two men come into Ripley's apartment and ask her if she wants to assist a group of Marines on a mission to destroy the Aliens once and for all and things don't come out to be as intended to happen. Director James Cameron was a worthy successor as the second director of the Alien franchise and he proved it to me while I was watching this movie, if I were to choose which one of the two Alien movies to better than the other it would be a difficult decision for me to make because Scott's 1979 film has more suspenseful plot elements and has better storytelling, and this 1986 version is a lot more entertaining, ambitious, and still has great storytelling. The movie also has a great supporting cast to it including Michael Biehn, a young Bill Paxton in a very convincing performance as a soldier who is the most terrified of the aliens out of all his fellow Marines, and so many more. This movie is not only a great film it is also one of the best movies of 1986 period.",

631,6 August 2009,grenmonkey,9, a great film.,"James Cameron had some big shoes to fill back in the mid 80's; Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) had been a huge commercial and critical success and James' job was to create a sequel to this film that was almost an instant classic in the industry. How to beat the first film and live up to the expectations set up so high by the first film and it's growing fan base? James' answer was to take the film into a completely new direction. The sci-fi horror was replaced with action (and even bits of humor), though still maintaining the scares and the suspenseful atmosphere of the first film. The combination of these elements turned out to be very much a working one and Aliens (1986) in my books is the definite ""Alien -experience"" of the franchise. The film took the original idea and developed it into something even more interesting and thrilling. The film can be held responsible of creating a set of pop-cultural benchmarks that still stand sturdy and defining the way action and sci-fi was represented on the film screen for decades to come.",

637,9 February 2021,hoernkeem,9," Aliens review (1986, James Cameron) Cameron takes Ridley's concept and crafts an action horror classic to match the original","Aliens (1986, James Cameron)
Despite immediate interest in a possible sequel it took producers and execs 7 years to get around to making 'Aliens'. Cameron would continue to build his reputation as one of America's brightest filmmakers making 'Aliens' hot off the heels of 'The Terminator'. Ridley Scott made 'Alien' a classic of science fiction horror. James Cameron would take those ideas and craft an iconic science fiction action film. We pick back up with Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, as she is awoken from her stasis aboard the Nostromo. She quickly learns not only have 57 years have passed, but the planet where they had picked up the alien has been colonized. Surprise, suprise contact is all of a sudden lost with the colony and a marine unit is sent to the planet to find out what has happened. They send Ripley along as a consultant of sorts. A man named Carter Burke, played by a very young Paul Reiser, is along as a representative for the ""company"". He plays a wonderful corporate sleezeball. Once again the company seems to know more about the situation than they are letting on. The marines who are investigating are all attitude and hubris. They think this is a grand wild goose chase as they deem Ripley's claims a tad outlandish. The most notable marines are played by Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton. Lance Henriksen's android Bishop rounds out the motley crew. Cameron cleverly plays with us a bit as far as Bishop is concerned using preconceived notions from the previous movie to try to erroneously pigeon hole him. When they get to the colony settlement it doesn't take long for aliens to appear and humans start dying by the truckload. The iconic imagery of the aliens produced by Giger is back but now the aliens are numerous and we have them moving and attacking. Ripley manages to stumble onto a young girl, the seemingly lone survivor and ostensibly adopts her. Eventually when all seems lost Ripley enters major badass mode and slaughters her way through aliens to rescue the girl Newt and get the survivors back to their ship. Here we finally see a new addition and one of Cameron's pivotal contributions to this franchise: the alien queen. Massive, hulking and intelligent it finally provides a question as to where those egg type pods that produce the face suckers come from. After thinking she gets away the queen appears on Ripley's ship in grand entrance fashion. This sets up one hell of a final boss battle. There is a device used here I am not sure if I like and you see it in movies all the time. How often do you see someone in the beginning of a film using or learning a skill that becomes a pivotal puzzle piece later on? Here Ripley learns to use an industrial exoskeleton loader and at the end of the film it allows her to take on the alien queen in hand to hand combat and give her a puncher's chance. I was also surprised that for all Cameron did to build off of what 'Alien' provided him he decided to off the alien queen in the same manner the alien was dispatched in the first film. You would think he would have come up with a more original solution. If there is any other disappointment here I thought the marine arrogance was a bit over the top. It just had a very 80's humor and sensibility to it. A very kind of cheesy male machismo.
Overall though this is an amazing film that takes the brilliance of Scott's 1979 classic and adds another layer to it as well as finally making the aliens action based entities as well as adding the alien queen and keeping Ripley the primary female badass of the movie and the series. More sequels would follow this, but they would all be lesser for various reasons. 'Alien' and 'Aliens' stand as a testament to how superlative an original and sequel can be even made by two creative geniuses on different ends of the spectrum.

I think ""Aliens"" is easily the best movie in the ""Alien"" series, and its one of the best sequels ever made. I thought ""Alien"" was a little slow at times (especially in the first half) which kept it from being a great film. ""Aliens"" starts off slow too, but I was into this film right from its opening frame. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley, the sole survivor from ""Alien"". Ripley returns to the planet where those yukky creatures are hiding out, and she, along with a group of Marine soldiers, plan to wipe them out. While on the planet they find a little girl who has been hiding out herself amongst the aliens. When the aliens come into the picture, it's all action, and special effects. The creatures are scary as hell just like in the first film, and the movie goes over the top to be gross and disgusting at times. The action and special effects (which won a well-deserved Oscar) are outstanding, and the performance by Weaver (who received her first Oscar nomination here) is powerfully spectacular. Director James Cameron knows how to make great special effects pictures, and ""Aliens"" is up there as one of the best. ",

643,5 June 2016,saymaraza,8, Aliens review,"Aliens is the sequel to the 1979 Ridley Scott film 'Alien' I wouldn't say this film was quite as good as the original 'Alien' but it still definitely worth a watch. It follows on well, set the same amount of years since the first one came out. (7 years) This film is Directed by James Cameron (The Terminator, Titanic) and stars Sigourney Weaver again as Ellen Ripley, with supporting cast of Michael Biehn (The Terminator) Bill Paxton (Titanic) Lance Hnerikson (The Terminator) All James Cameron films. James Cameron has the same sort of style to his movies, and it seems that he likes to work with the same sort of people. For example, Arnold Schwarzeneggar (The Terminator, Terminator 2, True Lies) All James Cameron pictures. Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Terminator 2 (uncredited) Aliens) All James Cameron pictures. And Bill Paxton (The Terminator, True Lies, Aliens, Titanic) All James Cameron. Aliens is a great sequel to Alien, and is thought to be just as good as the first Alien movie. In my opinion, i prefer the first Alien just a little bit more. I like it more because of the creepy build up. When they find the egg and we don't know what's going to happen as it's the first time you see the Alien, In this film we've already seen the Aliens, so we know what to expect. The only downfall of the film i'd say is that it was a little rushed, the Aliens came in too soon, and there were loads of them. In the first film, the Alien was really hard to kill (impossible to kill) in this film, they were killing off the Aliens as if it was as easy as stepping on an ant. I think Ridley Scott thought that through really well with Alien, and made it a lot more darker than the sequel. Even though James Cameron's Aliens was still very dark in it's own way, But my favourite of his work definitely still stands as the original Terminator (1984)",
644,19 December 2011,tony_bee,10, Pure and Simply AWESOME!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first alien film but this one by far exceeds the first. The story is excellent and well thought through, Sigourney weaver is excellent as 'Ripley' yet again and the introduction of the other characters fully gains your attention. The action and special effects were incredible, the aliens looked real compared even to some films now. Overall the progression from the first film is perfect. the split between suspense and action is spot on. Its hard to find ways to explain how much i love this film, but simply there was nothing i could find bad to say about the film, even the lesser characters were interesting and had meaning. Michael Biehn as 'Hicks' was a great display of acting and the relationship with 'Ripley' was enthralling. Finally some great scenes in the film for me was: the use of the sentry guns, the facehuggers attacking Ripley and noot, the final fight between Ripley and the queen alien but my favourite was the scene where the marines first fight the aliens. The scene has great suspense the use of the camera throughout the scene was great. James Cameron best director for me.",
645,7 August 2019,theterminator-92378,9, Bigger and Better,"Alien was a smash hit and the best sci-fi horror movie of the 1970s and it began what would continue a franchise and would make sci-fi horror revolution.
Aliens continues after the events of Alien and follows Ripley as she wakes up after being in stasis for 57 years she wakes up and the threat of the aliens is bigger and much worse than it was the first time and Ripley and the space marines have a big challenge ahead of them.
the cast includes Sigourney Weaver {Ripley} Carrie Henn {Newt} Michael Biehn {Corporal Hicks} Paul Reiser {Burke} Lance Henriksen {Bishop} amd Bill Paxton {Private Hudson}.
Aliens is considerd one of the best in the frachise and rightly so because what James Cameron does inprove on what Ridley Scott did in the original and he made it so much better and Aliens add the s making it clear that it would be better and so much more exciting and action packed",

647,29 October 2015,brianberta,9, Almost as good as the original,"It was hard to beat ""Alien"". It was an outstanding movie and I didn't expect this to be as good or better than it. It wasn't better, but it was still amazing. The movie has a huge buildup. It introduces the characters and the setting. When the team makes it into the shuttle, it is highly tense knowing that any one of them could be killed any second. The movie does a great job setting it up by making a dark and atmospheric environment. When they arrive at the planet, they encounter a little girl who's the only survivor and they rescue her. When the aliens show up, they kill several of the crew members and leave them stranded there. The second half of the film is an intense ride of action and death. Several of the characters in the movie have interesting personalities. The fight scenes are very tense and well done. Many other military movies use this movie as a guide to learn off of. I didn't feel the same amount of tension as I did with the first one, but it was still very good. The sequels that follow just try to cash in on the name and rarely bring anything new to the series. However, this sequel is, in my opinion, one of the best movie sequels out there.",

Suspended in cryogenic hypersleep, Ripley has been drifting in space all this time and is revived, only to learn that everything she knew is gone. Also during that time, the alien planet on which the deadly eggs were first discovered has been colonized. Now called LV426, the planet has been made habitable by atmosphere processors, but contact with the colony has been lost. A rescue mission of intergalactic Marines is sent in, and Ripley is brought along as a reluctant adviser. Ripley's fears are soon confirmed: the colony has been obliterated by the aliens and the survivors used as incubators for their embryos. Only one little girl has survived the destruction, a shell shocked second grader called Newt whom Ripley takes under her wing. As the Marines too fall prey to the aliens, Ripley and a small band of survivors find themselves stranded on LV426 with little hope of escape. With their equipment damaged and the planet's damaged reactors threatening to blow the entire world into a nuclear ruin within hours, the small group plans a dangerous escape mission. It becomes a race against time as the aliens close in, and when Newt is kidnapped by an alien warrior, Ripley comes face to face with the source of the alien colony - a huge and fiercely protective Queen Alien who is determined to take personal revenge on Ripley.",

It is so enjoyable that I can take in unlimited viewings of it and never begin to tire of it.  The successor to the equally brilliant ""Alien"", this movie is more action-oriented and in-your-face.  The cast is excellent, as is the cinematography, which allows the viewer a grainy, gritty vision of the terror which ensues.  This is one of the few movies which actually benefits greatly from the reabsorption of its deleted scenes -- the Director's Cut laserdisc and DVD are far superior to the theatrical and TV cuts.  James Cameron's work at its finest, ""Aliens"" is not to be missed by any movie buff, no matter what genre one might prefer.",

For those two hours plus (see the special edition if you haven't!) it is complete escapism into a survival drama rivaled by no other. The characters are all cast wonderfully, the script is first rate, the direction and editing are tight, and the scenery is engrossing.  My faorite film of the sci-fi/horror genre.",

It is even funny and sad in parts. It is also very entertaining and fast paced. I've only seen the extended version. That version is two and half hours long. By the time it was over, I thought it was only about half-way over. It is just so good. It has a great cast of Signourey Weaver, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and... others that I can't remember.

664,2 October 2000,Reaper Man,10, James Cameron would be my celebrity dad,"I've skirted around the subject of doing a comment for Aliens for two reasons.  1) Because this film is so darn popular, no one would ever read it, and 2) Nothing I can say will do this film justice.  It's as simple as this: Aliens IS and always will be the finest example of an action film, a sci-fi film or a horror film anyone on this earth (or the next) will EVER see.  At 14 years old (and counting) this cinematic masterpiece is every bit as impressive, scary and mind-blowing as it was when it premiered.  The rich personality of every character is just as important to Cameron as making someone get cut in half look realistic, and THAT's what makes this film so good.  The Colonial Marines come across as gung-ho idiots alright, but we see them get scared, see paranoia creep over them, see real humanity in a survival situation.  And then we see an 8 minute long action-sequence with acid, grenades and copious swearing.  Could any other film claim to blend such rich character development with such rich character dismemberment?  NO. And that's why Aliens is a one-off, a film that cannot be topped and needn't be topped.  From every infinitely quotable line, to every moment that makes you jump, this film does nothing but make the hairs on the back of your neck tingle with excitement.  I watch this film lots, and I never tire of any part of it.  There, I've done it.  I've poured my heart out on to the screen.  God Bless Aliens, and all who watch her.",

Little do the marines know that there are dangerous aliens roaming the buildings around them. The film sacrifices most of it's atmospheric qualities for a far more action packed punch that I personally prefer.I have absolutely no problem with this film,even if I try and knit-pick.I can not think of anyone that will not enjoy this film it is a complete and total masterpiece. 10/10",
674,6 December 2022,StevenKeys,9, Aliens,"Sigourney Weaver (Ripley), the John Wayne of greater Space, returns for this super sequel to the box-office action-horror hit, Alien (79), playing the sole survivor of the prior mission who, after awakening from a nightmare (gulp), is asked by corporate sponsors (Reiser) to return to the scene of the crime, so to speak, as an advisor to a privatized military mission sent to assess a non-responsive settlement community. Michael Biehn (Hicks) co-stars as the Marine corporal who assumes command, fellow Terminator cast member, Lance Henrikson is the resident android (Bishop) with little Carrie Henn (Newt) making it a family, she, like her adoptive Mom, a sole survivor and top strategist (""Affirmative!""). A horror film never had so much love, and, like sequels Bride-of-Frankenstein and T2-JD, surpassed its terrific original and should've been the finale, the Alien-Terrminator franchises becoming more tiresome with each one spawned. One interesting note: In the future, according to writer-director James Cameron, the people of Earth will no longer be saying 'awesome' every sentence. There IS hope (4/4).",

After the scary and suspenseful ALIEN, I was excited to see what was next, and what a blast! ALIENS is probably one of the greatest action films of all times; the visual is superb, the action suspenseful and the acting is great. Bill Paxton has never been better, as the bad ass-marine, who gets a nervous breakdown and gets all paranoid, when he faces the enemy. The only thing lacking in ALIENS, is the creepiness which made ALIEN scary as hell. But, it's two very different films, and two very different directors.",

The strength of this film has surpassed most of the science fiction films of today. The plot is not static. On the contrary, it is somewhat like a disaster film. It can die at any time. The movie viewing experience is also excellent. It makes people admire the ability of James Cameron. It 's not a joke to set a large set of books. The fantasy of various firearm computers is also very cool. Except for the armored vehicle, it is very unscientific, the chassis is so low and it is not practical. As a chariot company of alien colonists The mountain can't adapt, how can it be applied to the army. This movie made me truly awesome about American science fiction movies. Before watching ""Interstellar"", I found that the theme is very good, but in fact, after returning home, I found that my child is aging (old death). The plot is in this movie. That's it, feelings under fantasy are really powerful. In this movie, it seems that I have also seen the inspiration for many works. The ""Alien"" series is really a milestone in science fiction.",

Not that his already gargantuan ego needs a boost, but the reason why James Cameron is indisputably the greatest action director out there is because he's perfectly meticulous at turning his characters into actual humans. He's not afraid to turn what could have easily been a mere quick-buck 90-minute noise machine into a complex 150-minute epic that yields plenty of time for character development and motivational intrigue to gradually build up into rip-roaring action.",

At first, it was thought that either it would be a bomb and ruin his career or be a box office hit and all the credit would go to Ridley Scott (Alien). Both speculations were wrong.  In 1986, Cameron made the most amazing Sci-Fi movie imaginable.  Adding all the aspects of a thick plot, action, suspence, terror, and realism any movie could possibly handle.  The acting was perfect as was the special effect.  At a budget of $18 million, Aliens beats even today's visual masterpieces.

I don't think it would have worked trying to-recreate the same level of horror/tension in the first Alien, so turning it into more of an action movie with horror sub-elements strikes me as a smart move on the part of James Cameron. The acting and dialogue is more cliched than the original. Not cliched in a bad way (and I love Hudson's dialogue as much as everyone else), but the subtler tone of the original is more enjoyable for me.

Hollywood makes a simple shoot-'em-all action out of a freaking sci-fi concept. We have too little left to our imagination. The aliens are not so frightening any more.

James Cameron is that man. ""Aliens"", to me at least, is right up there with the original. I can never choose which one I like better. Actually, I like ""Alien"" more just because it's more of a horror movie, but still ""Aliens"" is great. Cameron also did it again with ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" which is better than the first. This guy could do a sequel to ""Titanic"" and it would be great. Wouldn't you guys like to see ""Titanic 2""? What makes this movie great is the action. He took it in a different direction and it worked. The first one was more of a horror movie in space and was full of suspense. This is just non-stop action. The problem with the other two sequels (don't get me wrong I like both) was that they didn't try to be different. Part 3 was more or less part 1 and Resurrection was... um, tried to be horror at times, then tried to be action. Since the first one was sci-fi/horror and the second one was sci-fi/action with elements of war, the third one could have been like a sci-fi/mystery. Then the fourth one could have been sci-fi/comedy with elements of drama. Of course I'm joking, but you see my point. 3 & 4 were good, just not great. Sorry, I got side tracked. This is suppose to be about ""Aliens."" The story continues perfectly, which is what you need for a good sequel. The direction is great, as is the story. All the acting is good. There seems to be a lot of dislike of the Hudson character. What most people call annoying, I call funny.

He completely dismembers the horror aspect of the series, dismembers the atmosphere the first contained, and then finally dismembered the one thing that the first had to make it a classic. With all this removed, what could we even possibly have? The outcome could either be bad or even worse. But no, James Cameron knew what he was doing.

Unfortunately things don't go to plan and a battle for survival commences in a bid to escape the xenomorph infested planet. To avoid spoilers, this is one of just a handful sequels that are actually better than the original. The effects for 1986 are amazing and infact better than a lot of todays(2018). The cast nails the film, the music score is perfect, the location is from a nightmare and this is classic great sci fi at its best. Its an all action sci-fi horror thrill ride on an express train to hell.",

Because nothing happens. Nothing. We get the plot set up and are introduced to a bunch of 2 dimensional macho marines, and that's it. It didn't need to take an hour to present this. It didn't establish a mood, all it did was make me wonder why they are wasting my time like this. I also thought the introduction of Newt was a pretty lame attempt to get me to care about the story. I'm glad she died in the third movie after seeing this. ""They mostly come out at night... mostly..."" What a joke.",

I remember watching this when I was a kid many times and being frightened to death and back because of this movie. The movie ""Alien"" established the groundwork for the story and gave us one of the most iconic and terrifying monsters in cinematic history. At the time, the Xenomorph seemed like an unstoppable killer, much like classic slasher villains like Jason Vorhees and Freddy Kruegar, but now not only do we multiple aliens but we also see them in actual combat with space marines. In space, no one can hear you scream...or get blown up.",
705,22 February 2014,skatechannel85,10, one of the best movies ever,"I love this film from start to finish I saw both the special and the theatrical releases and to be honest I think special edition is way better because of the new guns with the trackers and scanners. the queen alien is a beast amazing designs. I love the relationship with Ripley and newt they get together like mom and daughter and they do a great job at that hicks is great Huston he's alright some lines are laughable but still entertaining to watch. now if you watch the special edition then the theatrical release you'll notice some scenes were cut out like the new guns with trackers and scanners, newts parents going in the alien ship then newts dad gets the face hugger, you find out that Ripley's daughter Amy was dead while Ripley was in that hyper sleep in space after the first attack of the alien the credit song is amazing usually I don't sit through that stuff but for this movie its meant to sit through the music has a great tone to it like the first ""Carrie""",
706,16 April 2020,krational66,7, Perfect,"What a scary movie! ! James Cameron is really a great commercial director! To say he is a ""commercial"" director does not mean to disparage him, because commercial films can have as much meaning as so-called art-house films. Just in theory, it gives us more sensory stimulation and more grand endings.
Let's start with the business, maybe because Ridley Scott didn't have a lot of technology when he shot the first episode, maybe because Ridley Scott preferred to create a scary atmosphere rather than specific scary scenes. Anyway, James Cameron did make the second episode a lot scarier than the first. For example, when the female pilot turns around and suddenly finds the alien sitting behind him, for example, the alien victim who suddenly opens her eyes, for example, when the little girl says in a childish voice, ""can't go now, right? ""Like the giant"" alien ""that appears at the end of the movie... I'm scared to death.
Speaking of connotations, I was surprised to find that the movie has a strong feminist flavor. We saw that all the male soldiers who appeared in the movie did not survive, whether they were brave, cowardly, intelligent or stupid. Of course, two female fighters also died, which is a sign that they were too masculine, too strong, too lacking in feminine tenderness and motherhood. Our main character, Ripley, is both masculine and feminine, tender and maternal. (that little girl, Newt, is in part a reflection of Ripley's maternal nature.) After all, she's the only one who survived the alien attacks on the interstellar aliens, and she's the one who found Ripley and his gang an escape route.
Bishop, the robot who always fought bravely and ended up dying, is obviously very important to JamesCameron personally. If the robot in the first episode is the origin of all the tragedies, thus expressing that Ridley Scott, the director of the first episode, is trying to express a certain fear of modern technology, then James Cameron clearly believes that modern technology can bring people more happiness than tragedy. James Cameron has always believed this, and his film career has always been a big step along the way
He liked the ending: the survivors were returning to earth, and Ridley told Newt that he could now sleep well and not worry about nightmares. At this point, the once full of horror atmosphere is no longer exist, leaving us only a calm and peaceful atmosphere, and of course, a sense of security",
707,28 August 2019,gustavo_palos,10, My all-time favorite movie,"Yes, Alien is a master piece, but this one is my favorite.
The music, the plot, the military industry futuristic, the corporation, the cast, memorable and personalities given to the characters that you end up loving, the lines (Get away from her you b**** Game over man, Game over. How did they cut the power? they're animals),the queen, the tremendous Lance Henriksen, and damn the gun sounds.
It takes the great work from Ridley and respecting the original, not copying it, takes it to a whole different level.
When you get to know that the cast went through military training and Sigourney was kept away because she was shooting some other movie, but also to get the feeling of being a 'strange body'. And the scenes where the actor(s) were not told what would happen to capture real reactions. (knife scene with Hudson).",
708,21 August 2000,Aidan McGuinness,10, Excellent in every regard - a superior sequel,"Aliens ranks as my favourite science fiction movie, and perhaps my favourite movie, of all time. It manages to get all the correct elements as far as I'm concerned, and still enthralls me after the umpteenth viewing due to success in many areas :",
709,23 February 2000,Indy-52,9, Aliens (1986) D: James Cameron Rating:**1/2,"Action-packed sequel to the 1979 hit ""Älien"" concentrates more on the action than the pure terror in the first one. The story is well thought, picking up right where its predecessor left off. Ripley has been floating around in space for the last 57 years and is now found by one of those guys from the Company. He tells her that the planet where the alien was found has been colonised and that contact was lost. She accepts to go to the planet to be an advisor to the classical bunch of macho marines as how to kill them. It has suspence and thrills going for it, but that sense of fear just isn't there anymore and the action becomes mechanical after a while.",
710,6 January 2009,HelloTexas11,8, exciting follow-up to a classic,"I once made the observation that 'Aliens' deserves an award for panache for trying to outdo 'Alien.' It would be more accurate to say it takes the story of Ripley and those slimy, malevolent lifeforms in a direction that the first movie didn't even try to; specifically, into the realm of action/adventure/combat flicks. To its credit, it keeps much of the original's look and feel, in art direction and sound. But the volume (so to speak) is cranked WAY up, as is the violence quotient, and the last 45 minutes or so feel like a roller-coaster ride through hell. Opinions differ whether or not this is an improvement; my own feeling is that 'Alien' is the superior film, hands down. But 'Aliens' certainly won the box office battle and has always been more generally popular. The plot has Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) going back to the deadly planet with a squad of 'colonial marines.' It is 57 years later (she slept that long in suspended animation before being discovered) and the planet is now inhabited by humans in a small, desolate community. The aliens (and there are a bunch of them now) never bothered the colonists until recently and when contact with Earth ceases, the marines are sent in and Ripley goes with them as a reluctant 'advisor.' The marines themselves are a colorful group of stereotypes, straight out of an old WW2 war flick- the tough-as-nails sergeant, the quiet loner, the two bad-ass machine gunners, the whiner, etc. They are led by an ineffective lieutenant who we soon discover isn't up to the challenge. Also along for the ride is the 'company man,' Burke (Paul Reiser, in a nice turn as a complete slimeball). After an early encounter with the aliens cuts their number in half, Ripley more or less assumes command by sheer force of personality. (And Weaver out-acts the pants off whoever she shares the screen with.) There are plenty of slam-bang shoot-'em-up sequences, all very well staged and very intense. But somewhere along the way, 'Aliens' diminishes the essential creepiness of the creatures just slightly by making them so often exploding targets. And the audience realizes long before the marines that it doesn't matter how many of them you kill, there are always more. A single colony survivor, a young girl named Newt, is adopted by Ripley and the others and proves more savvy than any of them. There is a funny, scary moment early on shortly after Newt is found; Ripley asks her if she wouldn't feel safer staying with Ripley and the others. The little girl just shakes her head no. Ripley goes on to say these are soldiers, and Newt responds, ""It won't make any difference."" After chases, explosions, more gunplay and one false climax, we get the final showdown between Ripley, in one of the spaceship's loaders, and the alien queen. (Trying to distract the queen from pursuing Newt, Weaver spits out her famous line, ""Get away from her, you bitch!"") The fight itself is fairly brief, and the queen is finally dispatched off out into space, much like the alien in the first film was. Director James Cameron certainly deserves credit for not making a boring sequel; 'Aliens' is anything but. It would probably be hoping for too much to expect a second film to be as wondrously terrifying as Ridley Scott's original; like capturing lightning twice, almost impossible. So Cameron wisely shifts gears and takes us on a different adventure altogether, and it's a very exciting one.",
711,19 April 2000,gstiger,10, Who's laying these eggs...,"One of the greatest action/science fiction films I have ever seen. I feel this film far surpasses the original. James Cameron is a master at creating a good action film that includes bits of human drama, an example of this is Ripley's bond with Newt. The story is good and filled with suspense and terror. The acting is okay. Sigourney Weaver does a wonderful job at reprising her role as Ellen Ripley. It's no wonder she received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in this film. The music by James Horner is very good and adds to the atmosphere. The special effects are excellent, especially the vicious and life-like Alien Queen. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",

717,25 August 2002,pmoney13,10, Now this...this is an action movie.,"Aliens has my vote for best action movie of all time. It's such a great piece of filmmaking, starting with an almost subdued opening 45 minutes, then plunging us into an all-out rollercoaster ride of pure, kick-ass action and adrenaline. Movies today like the crap Jerry Bruckheimer spews out have made movie audiences forget what a real action film is. This isn't a cliched buddy cop pic or a yawn-inspiring spy movie....this is a testosterone-charged, relentless catapult into the best that sci-fi thrillers have to offer. James Cameron followed up the brilliant ""Terminator"" with this masterpiece, solidifying his claim as one of the stronger directors in Hollywood (yeah, I know he made Titanic, but we all make mistakes). Bottom line: Aliens is better than any action film made since it was released in 1986. If you want to know what true, pulse-pounding action is: for God's sake rent Aliens.",

719,21 December 2005,ravenwood80,10, and it was war.............,"A sequel to a classic sci fi/horror doesn't usually bode well. The director and screen writer usually just use the same formula, if its not broke don't fix it. James Cameron thankfully took a different approach. The first film relied on suspense with one alien on board the ship terrorising the shipmates. This time we have a planet full of aliens, face huggers, a huge queen alien and a group of hardened marines with a never say die attitude. Like Cameron said ""its Vietnam in space"", and he's not wrong. The film is all about action and scaring set pieces. I first managed to watch Aliens in 1988 when i was 8 years old, and ever since that moment it remains one of my favourite movies of all time. Set many years after the first, Ripley has been in hyper sleep floating in space since, The workers of a planet have not been in contact recently, so those in charge have decided that there may be some truth to Ripleys alien story, and send in a team of marines and Ripley. The movie contains many classic scenes ie 'they're in the room' and when Ripley goes back for Newt. Even the picture of Ripley with Newt holding on to her whilst she has a flame thrower in her hands is a part of modern pop culture. I feel sad though as imagine how lucky everyone was within three years either way of Aliens, we had The terminator, Predator, Die Hard, Bloodsport, all these classic action films, now we get nothing that even half compares to these wonderful popcorn munchers",

Game over!,"I've been putting off reviewing this movie because I didn't think that I could do it justice but I've decided to start reviewing my extensive collection in order and Aliens is one of the first on the shelf. Aliens is THE best blend of action and Sci-Fi that has yet been made. If you like war movies or action movies or Sci-Fi then this is the movie that you've been waiting for. It is easily the best of the Alien films and the best movie that James Cameron has put out. That is saying a lot but Aliens is no ordinary film. I won't go into the plot because if you wanted to know that then you can look elsewhere on the Aliens page but suffice to say the story promises much and delivers in spades. Everyone in the movie makes their character work from all the Colonial Marines to Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) herself. I will always know Paul Reiser as the scumbag Burke and Bill Paxton will always be Hudson no matter what else either of them do. The set design and prop design of this film are a sight to behold and the makers of this film succeeded in making whatever point in the future this movie is set in come to life. (Throughout the Alien series, there is no mention of date, I'm sure there is a tiny reference somewhere but I'm obviously not hardcore enough to sniff it out. If somebody knows let me know.)The design of the Marines armor, weapons, and vehicles delivers special praise because I can really see Marines in the future looking like they do in the film. That they still use projectile weapons is something that I won't even try to get into here. At least they're caseless. The aliens themselves are the greatest contribution to the world that H.R. Giger has ever made, his weird art nonwithstanding. The bio-mechanical look of the aliens is a great design. The whole look of the movie is simply incredible. Bottom Line: This movie rules, buy it and put it on the mantlepiece in a lighted, dust-shielded alcove. Then worship it in a pagan fan-boy ceremony.

753,21 July 2020,joelgodinho,9," It's Game Over Man, Game Over!!","Aliens is the 1986 sequel to the 1979 horror classic Alien and it was directed by James Cameron, starring Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn and Carrie Henn.
The original Alien stands as the quintessential horror sci-fi movie and it's one of the greatest in both genres so it was probably a big task to make a worthy sequel but I think they succeeded.
Is it better than the original? Well, I really don't think so, however it is a great film in it's own right, maybe even a sci-fi classic just like the predecessor.
The cast, while I don't think is quite as strong as the original, is still really great with Sigourney Weaver continuing to give an amazing performance as Ripley just like in the first one. The story is really interesting with freaking awesome action sequences, the most memourable being Ripley getting on the power loader to protect Newt, Hicks and Bishop from the Xenomorph queen.
Finnaly the visuals and special effects are also really good, I mean the Xenomorph queen laying eggs is for sure a sight to behold.

It's a great movie in every way: storyline, characters, and especially action and suspense!  James Cameron outdid himself with this movie.  I only wish I could have seen it on the big screen in a dark theatre, because from what I have heard, 'Aliens' was the most horrifying movie of 1986.  Instead I saw it for the first time on T.V. and they had commercials every 15 minutes, and I still enjoyed it!  This movie has all the action and suspense of all of James Cameron's films put together.  And that includes 'Titanic'. And when the action starts, it doesn't stop for an hour and a half! The adrenaline rush you get from this movie is so big, you feel like you're there with the charactors of the movie.  It is a great thriller.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it NOW!!",
755,25 May 2006,robb_772,7, Effective combination of SCI-FI and action,"Director James Cameron's follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi classic ALIEN wisely avoids the potentially fatal error of attempting to recreate the original film's style and structure, and successfully strives for something completely different. Instead of a brooding, space-age horror movie like the first film, ALIENS actually plays like a war movie in space. The emphasis is more on action than terror, and this new direction works surprisingly well even if Cameron's clunky dialogue often thuds. While it may lack the much of the haunting aura and ""art house"" inventiveness of the first film, ALIENS delivers on all accounts when it comes to breathtaking action and suspense.",

758,19 April 2007,valleyboiS,10, One hell of a white knuckle ride from start to finish!,"This was the first alien film I watched and is the reason I become obsessed with the aliens verse. I was 10 years old and can remember sitting with my dad (another big aliens fan) and watching this film for the first time (on a old VHS taped from the telly).From the opening shocker of Ripley's dream to the pulse racing confrontation between the queen b***h and Ripley, I was glued to the screen. Even though i had not seen the original i immediately sympathised with Ripley and was amazed at how the new cast were extremely likable and important to the story. No line of dialogue is wasted in this film. This film is so quotable and have had a big influence on movies and other media (just check the original halo to hear multiple quotes ripped direct from this film).",
759,25 May 2009,jmaycock,9, Fantastic stuff,"Okay, some of the dialogue is a bit corny and could have been toned down. However, once the action gets started the soldiers are not so quick to joke around. I recently watched this again and introduced it to my wife who also loved it. Just one thing bugs me about how this film relates to the the previous one. In this film the company doesn't know anything about what happened in the first film until Riply tells them? Wasn't there a report sent? That aside, I really loved watching this again. They don't make them like they use to. What really kills me however is the mess they made with the next film. Everything we invested in this movie wipped out in the first 5 mins? Watch Alien and Aliens, but forget about the rest.",
760,9 June 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,8," Interesting sequel, can't touch the original though","James Cameron directs this sequel to one of the greatest science fiction films of our time: Alien. It turns out that Ripley has been floating around in Space for 57 years and when she lands aboard a space craft, she discovers that the setting of the original Alien film has been turned into a colony. When they lose contact with the colony, she's called in to go with a group of Marines to find out what's going on and to terminate the alien once and for all. There happens to be several accidents and Ripley and the Marines are stuck on the colony along with Newt, a young girl who the Marines nearly killed. As Ripley, Sigourney Weaver plays the part with a much heavier and brooding tone, and she even was nominated for an Oscar. It was a relatively new concept for the woman to be the leading action hero of a movie at the time, but she plays her part very well. The only really other note- worty cast member is Newt, who portrays emotions very well. Unfortunately, the script just falls flat. There is lot room for plot and it is wasted away with sequence after sequence of blasting away aliens. While Alien succesfully built things up, Aliens just decides to forget it all and blast everything. While the special effects are sharp, they don't feel quite as realistic as Alien, which had a much smaller budget. James Cameron directs shortly after making the cult Science- fiction film The Terminator, and he directs with a sort of chidlish ignorance. There are no powerful shots or wildly imaginitive attention to small details, and he just focuses on the action. However, he manages to at least keep focus on that, which ends up deserving some credit. However, even with these flaws Aliens still manages to be a somewhat good movie. The sheer velocity of Weaver's performance, and the finally crafted action sequences make more then up for the flat script and Cameron's direction adds in it a bit too. It's definitely not deserving of it's high status on the IMDb top 250, and should not even be on there nor compared to the original Alien. 8/10",

Aliens is a excellent, well-made, action-packed film. Aliens stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, reprising the role as the human sole survivor of the Nostromo cargo ship. When Marines picked her spacecraft, floating in outer space, she joins forces to do a mission with them. When the team arrives on the planet where mysterious disappearances of colonists on LV-426, they investigates and find out that they are not the only ones on the strange planet. This movie has a lot of action, better than the first Alien. Director James Cameron has a lot of good and neat special effects to bring in this action flick. The thrills? Well, they just keep coming closer and closer to the victims. Aliens has some good action sequences and all though the first Alien was about suspense in space, this one deals with action more than the horror. Still, Aliens is a good sequel to the 1979 shocker and a thrilling ride from start to finish. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars .",

Once again, James Cameron shows what he is capable of. impressive job from the maker of The Terminator and Abyss. The actors are also great; Sigourney Weaver remakes his role as Ellen Ripley, my all time favorite actor Michael Biehn makes a memorable role as corporal Dwayne Hicks, Carrie Henn plays the role of Newt and Lance Henriksen plays the role of synthetic, Bishop. Bill Paxton and Jeannie Goldsmith are also great! Aliens is one of those movies, that never gets me bored and that's because of it's full of fantastic acting and and it has a great plot.

770,2 April 2018,Dutch90,9, James Cameron's Action Packed Follow-Up To Alien,"What makes each Alien film interesting to watch is the series' tradition of going in a completely different direction with each installment. Aliens, arguably, is of greater influence to the series than the original Alien. Whereas Alien provided the foundations - the Alien design and biology, the greedy Weyland-Yutani corporation trying to exploit it - Aliens does a lot of world building and greatly expands the series' lore. Looking at the vast swath of expanded universe comics, books and video games, most are more closely based on Aliens than Alien, featuring Alien Hives, Colonial Marines and of course the vicious Queen, arguably James Cameron's most important contribution to the Alien universe.

I wasn't even thinking about any more sequels. Unfortunately, they went in a different direction and really killed the series with Aliens3 - I did not pay to see it because of all the negative publicity and just the fact that it really wasted the characters that were saved from the previous movie. I watched it later on and it was lousy and the whole story line disappointing . Alien resurrection was another bad attempt to revive the series and really you ask why? . I cant put all the Alien crossover stuff in the same category like Alien/Predator and all the comic book ones with Batman and Superman etc because they are all cash ins off Alien and not original ideas .I mean anyone can take something and toss it in the mix - like say Cowboys Vs Aliens where you start making stuff up and throwing it together. Like all the Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ideas because people start doing weird things - It can make for a fun movie but when you start milking the original idea too much and diluting it - it is just tired and needs to be left alone.

776,20 August 2006,errol1909,9, Great sci-fi fun...,"I'm not a fan of the other Alien films, but I'm fan of Aliens. A excellent piece of cinema magic. Great story, surrounded by great characters, along with some terrific and exciting action sequences. Aliens is the greatest sci-fi film ever made. Forget the Star Wars films, those films aren't serious enough and too goofy. This is a serious film, even though one of the characters is so damn funny. His character however, is not supposed to be funny. It just naturally comes out. What I love about this film is the Vietnam type feel. Marines with weapons raised, walking carefully through one corridor after another in search of some type of alien life form. It's reminiscent of Vietnam movies, of solders trudging through the dense jungles of Vietnam in search of the enemy. It's thrilling stuff. I love how the Marines are so bad ass. High tech weaponry, attitudes, but yet feelings of panic. Just like the jungles of Vietnam. The movie written by James Cameron, shells out some really memorable characters, who aren't just for background. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hudson (Bill Paxton), and Hicks (Micheal Biehn) are very sincere characters who are the heart and soul of this film. Also the other characters are well written. Nobody bores you in this movie, and there isn't a cardboard character in this film. The Predator films are typically Alien films that take place during present day and films that are horribly written to. I recommend this film to anybody. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this. Just a fan of cinema. I'm going to buy the DVD of this film right now. Aliens kicks ass!",
777,3 January 2021,Doublej20005,9, A Worthwhile Sequel,"Whilst the first Alien film was a slow, tension-building, gory horror film, the sequel just takes the franchise in a completely different direction, opting for a straight action film instead, and it really does work. Sigourney Weaver is still at the top of her game, and her bond with Newt is the driving force of the film, and it makes the second half as perfect as it is. Seriously, the final hour of this is just perfect filmmaking. The action is incredibly entertaining to watch and the personal stakes are just ramped up, making the final hour perfect adrenaline-pumping filmmaking. The score is still great, and the new set of characters are great to watch, with Vasquez and Hudson being the standouts (alongside Newt of course). The creature design of the aliens is probably some of the best creature design in history. However, I will say that it took me a little bit for me to be fully gripped by the film. Maybe it's the lame villains towards the beginning, but I just didn't feel fully engaged in the film until the 40 or so minute mark. So whilst so much of this film is just really amazing, and is some of the best filmmaking I've literally ever seen, I can't give this the 5 star rating it potentially deserves. Still, this is a phenomenal film, and surely the Alien franchise can only improve from here, right?",

I know that in space, no one can hear you scream, but you could hardly miss the tough talk of the marines, who, all of them, turn out to be true heroes. I think that every existing stereotype was neatly tucked into ""Aliens"" : the tough military bitch, the tough and dumb marine, the tough but not-all-that-dumb-marine, the brave little girl, the slick commercial weasel and so on... Even the score was annoying. Now I don't say I absolutely hated it, but judging from some of the comments, you might think that this is the best space-flick ever, which it definitely is not. I'm the first to accept that Ripley has managed to say frozen for fifty-something years, but not that she manages to integrate completely in the society she wakes up in, apparently in better shape than the marines.

I shouldnt really have been watching it but there you go. I remember being absolutely petrified all the way through and the only real piece of gore in the film is where you see a chestburster come out of a crewperson. So that wasnt why i was scared. However i WAS scared because of its unique style in portreying darkness using very moody soundtracks, excellent props and most of all the excellent use of the alien creatures. You dont really get to see the creatures very much as most of the tention built up by them is implied. What Cameron has done here is to coax the viewers great imagination and mould it to the dark visions he and Geiger wanted to represent. It is genius film making due to its faultless plot, great cast and dialogue but most of all because it is a sequel (in my mind better than the first). I have no clue as to what goes on in H R Geigers mind but to create what is essentially the devil (or what it represents - pure evil) i feel is touching the boarder of genius and insanity. The essence of the film found my deepest fears and played with them like a cat does a mouse but instead of it being a nasty experience (as it should have) i felt compelled to watch it even at the age of twelve. I am now the ripe old age of 26 and i have probably seen Aliens more than i have any other - star wars included. At a guess i'd say at least 100 times or more. Call me a nerd but i still do not tire of this fantastic piece of storytelling. I just wish they hadn't ruined what could have been a fantastic ongoing plot featuring an adult Newt, Hicks and Ripley in the third and fourth installments of the genre. Alien 3 was awful and alien 4 was just ghastly. The new 'plot twists' they tried to create were just an insult to the first 2 films. Had they kept it simple and persued the route of the Dark Horse comics (earth is over run by aliens and the story centres on Hicks and Newt) they would have had so much more credibility.",

Surrogate Child and the Surrogate Relationship between Newt and Ripley. As neither of them are soldiers due to quit a few things that both of them have in common which allows the both of them to Sympathize with each other. And that is why one of my favorite scenes is not one of the many Actions Scenes, although those scenes where great too. It's just that I enjoyed that particular scene a lot more. Anyways I also enjoyed the fact that the Character of Ripley is Mentally Scared by the events of the First Films was Great too. They could have just simply made a small reference to the First Film by way of just one or two simple sentences. And just left it at that but no they didn't instead they decided to make it a whole Arc a couple of Arcs In fact out of it for Ripley, and the Politics Around that was Excellently Done in my opinion.",

This is an action movie - and it's one of a kind. Not until ""Speed"" have I've seen a movie that kinetic, barely have I seen a movie that well directed. Cameron pulls all the right strings and pushes the action forward like no other could have done. Examples?

807,30 August 2002,zedex,10, One of the best action movies ever!,"-Spoilers- Aliens is the rarest type of film: A sequel that surpasses the original. Set 57 years after the original, Ripley's escape pod has been found, and she is returned to earth. Once she gets there, however, her story is discounted and The Company fire her for detonating her old ship. A few weeks later Burke, an employee of The Company, asks her to go with a group of marines to LV-426 (the planet where she found the first alien), where contact has been lost with a colony of terraformers... Aliens is a fantastic movie. It is quite different from 1 & 3 in the series, in that there is a huge nest of Aliens instead of one, and Ripley actually has some decent firepower. Yet it doesn't descend into the usual action cliches of firefight after firefight: the few marines left after the initial alien attack are stranded, and try to barricade themselves in, leading to some tense and genuinely frightening moments as the aliens grow ever closer. The characters are also well-developed, which is a change, you really feel something as they die, which adds to the overall effect. The acting is extremely high quality; some characters aren't hugely likeable, but they're still enjoyable to watch. It helps to have seen Alien- it explains all the references to the previous battle with the aliens, and Ripley's antipathy towards Bishop, a synthetic. This is undoubtedly the best film in the series: while it doesn't having the shocking ending of 3, the almost-happy ending rings true, which makes the start of 3 even more tragic (but that's another spoiler). Overall this film is interesting, exciting and genuinely scary: 10/10.",
808,5 August 2018,coenbmw,4, Wrong,"James Cameron could be prosecuted for having wrecked the magnificent atmosphere that 1979 Ridley Scott's Alien had created. In the original film, the Alien was a mysterious creature, almost invincible. It was pure horror, in space. Cameron came with the idea to transform this in a ""Rambo in space"", full of thick Marines so caricatural and grotesque that you wonder sometimes if this is parody. The worse is that, to be able to maintain this battle on the length of a film, Cameron had to weaken and banalize the Aliens, who become ordinary monsters that can be beaten with a classic weapon. You have to see how strangely slow and harmless they become, for Ripley to be able to slaughter a bunch of them on her way to salvation, all that with a kid on her arms.
For the rest, the film is well executed, technically impressive, and the subtle storyline Ripley/Newt involving Ripley's deceased daughter (that's in the Director's cut) is quite moving. And it's an Alien, so a film to watch anyway. But the concept of the film is wrong, by essence.",

But, I happen to think this one is better.  Where Alien was more psychological thriller than sci-fi, this one is A LOT more sci-fi, and quite a bit more expansive. Of course, in 1986, the makers had a lot more to work with than in 1979. Aliens has some of the same elements of Alien though.  The last battle with the queen one of the coolest bits of the movie.  I would recommend Alien to anybody, but I will always say that Aliens was better. ",
814,21 April 2006,Craig88,10, best Alien franchise film by miles,"Aliens has got to be one of the best films ever made. The non stop action and plot is fantastic as are the actors.Hudson rules! Aliens begins where Alien left off. Ripley is in cryogenic sleep on the escape pod from the destroyed Nostromo.She is found by a deep space salvage crew and learns she has been asleep for 57 years.After fruitlessly explaining her actions,alien and so on from the first film to 'the company' they inform her that LV426 has since been colonised and the colonists haven't complained of any 'hostile organisms'. Then of course they lose contact with the colony and Ripley joins a group of hard a** U.S marines to go find out whats happened.From then on the film goes into ultra a** whooping mode with aliens ""coming out of the god-damned walls"" left,right and centre. The cast in Aliens is absolutely perfect.Sigourney Weaver is as hard as ever as Ripley which actually got her nominated for an Academy Award. Michael Biehn is the cool and collective Corporal Hicks,while the other hard a** female,Vasquez,is awesome with her gun that is probably taller than her! Paul Reiser is great as the slime ball company man Burke and Lance Henriksen is perfect for the role of the android Bishop. But for me hands down the best character is by far Hudson played fantastically by the so underrated Bill Paxton.How Paxton didn't win an Academy Award for best supporting actor is beyond belief for me.Hudson is as he says ""the ultimate bad a**"" when in fact he is probably the most scared out of the remaining survivors.Hudson is given the best lines in the film and it pays off as his comedy relief/hard a**/scared character are spot on.Some of his brilliant lines include ""game over man,game over!"",""there's something moving in here and it ain't us"" and ""how do i get out of this chicken s**t outfit?"" and many more.If this role had gone to anyone else but Paxton i don't think that the film would have that extra something if you catch my drift. Aliens IS the best film of the Alien franchise hands down and probably one of the best sequels ever made.It was fast,furious and funny.One of the best action films ever made and why wold,t it be?With James Cameron (terminator 1 and 2) at the helm it was bound to be. I strongly urge that you watch this film even if your not that keen, just watch it for Hudson's sake,the bloke will have you in stitches. RATING-10/10",

823,26 May 2018,daryahorenko,10, Aliens > Alien > Other Movies,"Aliens > Alien
I don't wanna make Alien sound bad, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. EVER. And it just gets better on rewatching. Alien was directed by Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors. Aliens was written and directed my James Cameron, also one of my favorite directors. Both are suspenseful beyond your imagination. While Alien is a little better than Aliens in regards to story and originality, these are just some of the reasons Aliens is superior to Alien:
1) It introduces my favorite Alien character, Rebecca ""Newt"" Jorden. It's the only Alien movie she appears in and she has a LOT of screentime in Aliens. Carrie Henn was an amazing casting choice for her character. She gives one of the best, if not the best child performance I've ever seen in a movie (and yes, I've seen The Shining and I know that Danny Lloyd is amazing in it. You can feel her emotions through every ounce of her facial expressions, voice and actions. It's so so sad that she didn't pursue an acting career.
2) They got Ripley even better than in Alien. I love how James Cameron always puts very strong women in his movies and she is such a badass in Aliens.
3) Alien doesn't have a twist like Alien does. The twist that there's a xenomorph queen is awesome. I thought that xenomorphs are the coolest-looking creatures in all of science fiction, but this thing looks even better!
4) Alien has a great finale, but the finale of Aliens is the absolute best and I couldn't take my eyes away both times I saw it.
5) Aliens contains my favorite line from the entire saga: ""Get away from her, you bitch!""
6) Despite not having something like a big theme, the score of Aliens is even better than the score of Alien.",

834,10 June 2009,mrspasm,10," Not as good as first, incredibly dark.","Riply Scott's prequel to this film was a tale of intergalactic terror. Seven friends and their Bumbling Side-kick Jones were travelling home after a long vacation when they encountered a monster. Hearing it's distress call, they let it board their ship, but rather than show its gratitude, it decided to kill off the friends one by one in a terrifying game of cat and monster. The survivors from that film appear again here, namely Captain Ridley and of course Jonesy our heroic side kick. Ridley wants revenge for the death of her friends and recruits a team of super tough marines (that's soldiers to the lay person) to go to their home planet and wipe out the monsters once and for all. This darker tone is in stark contrast to Riply Scott's original, and it continues throughout. This leads to a series of let downs- Jones disappears without explanation early in the film, without explanation so much of the comedy from the first film is lost. Add to this the lack of Cyborg Ash, whose little dance was a hilarious highlight of the first and there are few laughs to be found here. Bill Pullman's marine Ernie 'Dry Heat' Hudson attempts some improvised one liners 'Hey Vasquez- you look like a man!' and tries some banter with his Sergeant 'Can I wear your slippers, Sir?' he asks 'LOOK AT MY EYES!' Capone riplyies. I didn't really understand this comeback, but I assume The Searg was in no mood for fun and games. This is obviously because the film was under the fierce stranglehold of famous control freak Jim Cameroon, known for a lack of humour in all his films. Cameroon reluctantly casts Paxman in all his films as they're cousins and there is a definite tension between the comic genius of the actor, and the ultra serious 'I'm The Daddy' mentality of the Director.",

A Review By: Barry G.,"Well what can I say, James Cameron has truly done an excellent job of turning Ridley Scott's horror classic, Alien, into a high voltage action thriller! This amazing sequel has everything, and I mean everything that a movie fan would want to see in a movie. First of all, there are amazing performances from an all-star cast lead by Sigourney Weaver, who by the way was nominated for best actress for this movie. Second of all, the visual effects are suberb even by today's standards, and lastly this movie is great because it is directed by James Cameron. I mean who's better to direct a science-fiction action movie other than James Cameron (he certainly proved himself in this movie and in the Terminator movies). Just like in The Terminator, James has succeeded in making a wonderful movie! Of course James did have a little help from his friends to make this movie. Stan Winston has done an equally good job of designing the acid-spitting monsters in this movie, the aliens. Above all else, this movie rocks because it has the one, the only Queen Alien in it. The Queen Alien is even more terrorfying than the other alien drones, she is one big egg-laying machine! By the way, this is the one with the awesome fight between Ripley and the Queen Alien! So the bottom line is; go see Aliens and I bet you that you'll be hooked on this epic movie forever!",

James Cameron has done an excellent job of turning Ridley Scott's horror classic ,""Alien"", into an edge of your seat thriller! In this sequel, Ripley, who survived her encounter with the alien in the original, is found floating in space by a deep salvage team. Later, Ripley is brought before a court and questioned as to why she destroyed the ship the Nostromo in the first film. Ripley tells her story to the court, however, the court does not believe her story about the acid-spitting alien, and further more decrees her unfit to hold a license as a Warrent Officer. The court does start to believe Ripley's story though, after they lose contact with colonists on the planet where the alien is from. They tell Ripley to go to the planet with marines to see what is wrong on the planet, and in return they promise to give back Ripley her Warrent Officer license. She decides to accompany the marines to the planet and the rest is movie history! This is a great sequel that is better than all of the other ""Alien"" movie sequels.",
848,9 August 2004,rosti_mitev,10, Best Sci-Fi ever?,"Aliens! My favourite of the tetralogy of the extraterrestrial species! And one of the best both sci-fi and horror movies I have ever seen! James Cameron really did this movie the way a sci-fi horror movie should look like. The action, the thrill, the fights, the shooting - everything is top class, but the essential part of the movie is the atmosphere and the aliens themselves. The claustrophobic environment, the camera and the light effects make the atmosphere extremely tense and frightening. There are no secondary love story-lines, so popular in other sci-fi movies (like in Godzilla, Armageddon, Independance day), that most often spoil the atmosphere and prevent the viewer from concentrating upon the real fear and action. (Who cares that Will Smith's Character has a dream to fly in open space and the alien invasion made it possible for him to do it!) The battle is what's important!",
849,25 January 2006,sternn01,10, Aliens...,"When we last saw Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) at the end of the 1979 classic ""Alien"", she was just putting herself into hyper-sleep after dispatching the creature out of the airlock of her lifeboat.

851,10 December 2006,AlrightGuy,10, Quite probably the perfect sequel,"Most of the time when I hear a sequel is coming out, especially when the original is considered a classic, I get a little bit of a brain cramp. Aliens, however, is a brilliant continuation of an almost flawless original. Take the sole survivor of the first contact, completely ruin her life (and make it due mostly to the fact that she survived), and ask her to go to the one place she would never want to see again. What's more, make it a whole slew of aliens when she knows better than anyone what just one can do. And while you're at it, remind her there are families involved so she will spend every waking moment and every breathless nightmare picturing what they are enduring. Paint her into a corner so she really has no choice, and send her with a bunch of cocky marines who have no clue what they have signed on for. Oh, but Ripley knows. Ripley knows all too well. And she's helpless to stop it. She can't even avoid it...",
852,21 September 2018,meganweaver-72582,8, One of the best sequels in all of cinema,At the end of Alien Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was found floating in a pod. Upon her rescue by Weyland Yutani(the corporation that screwed her and her fellow crew members in Alien) she is told that there is already a terraforming colony on LV214(the space jockey planet) but contact has been lost for some time. She involuntarily agrees to join the team to go have a look. What follows is a fight to death between a bunch of marines and the evil Xenomorphs. Aliens is different in style and tone to Alien and that's a great thing. One of the few sequels that work so well Aliens shows the importance of a visionary director of the caliber of Jim Cameron.,

854,28 February 2001,changingshades,9, Sequels mostly aren't better than the original. Mostly.,"Aliens is the exception to that rule. It takes the Sci-Fi/suspense filled classic, Alien and turns it into a great war movie. The camera work was magnificent as was the f/x. Sigourney Weaver did some of her best acting to date (and yes I know that is not saying much, but anyway). also Paul Reiser is a great manipulative little weasel, but we all already knew that. James Cameron has a history of making better sequels than originals. Don't believe me compare T2 to Terminator and then get back to me. Aliens is one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever. Better than Star Wars or Star Trek in that it focuses more on the danger of space than the majesty. See it if you haven't.",
855,10 June 2002,mooro7,10, my favourite film of all time,"This film will always be my favourite by a long way. Everything about it oozes class and ultimate action from the start to the end. I have it on VHS plus i recently purchased the special edition on DVD. Anyway, Aliens; what can i say? Out of all the trilogy Aliens stands out as the most memorable film due to the contribution of one man ""BILL PAXTON"" he makes the film for me. Without him then the film would not be where it is now. I read an article about the film Aliens and its was about Jenette Goldstein (Private J. Vasquez)It said that she saw the advertisement for a film called Aliens and she turned up at the audition with a dress on and she had hair down to her ass and also she had high healed shoes on. She thought that it was a film about Illegal Aliens and if you notice that in the film after she says the line ""where they are"" Bill Paxton(Hudson) says ""yeah she thought it was illegal Aliens and signed up"" James Cameron found this to be really funny that he gave Jenette Goldstein the part, and what a performance she gave us. Michael Biehn(Hicks) adds in a great performance also which seamed to be a great time for the actor with such films as The Abyss, The Terminator but sadly he has fell down the line now. I feel that the other 2 Alien movies after this one were shocking and a disgrace to have anything to do with this one as they were to laughable and just plain sad. I could of wrote a better script for the last one. I hope that Ridley Scott and James Cameron both give us a blockbuster of a movie with Alien 5 if it ever comes to light. It would be good to see the two masters working side by side, we might see a proper Aliens film once again. God Bless Aliens xxxxx",
856,9 August 2001,marcus40mast,8, Personally I thought it was overrated.,"Having heard so much hype about this film I sat down to watch it and honestly could not see what everyone found so compelling about it. Sure the action sequences were good and the acting wasn't bad, but aside from the classic end sequence I couldn't really see what everyone was so excited about. In my opinion this is a film which can be watched once for the experience, but personally I'd rather stick on Terminator or Blade.",
857,11 January 2002,crowboy181,10, Many movies are great follow ups and this sounds like another one just like it,Like the orginal Aliens is a great movie. It was very grusome and scary just like the original. If there was a follow up that was just like the orginal it was this one.  Very few follow ups are just as good as the orginal.  If I was to recommend a movie this would certainly be on that list.,
858,20 December 2002,enmussak,8, one of the best sequels ever,"Alien and Aliens are two very different films.  I agree with another reviewer in saying that Alien is a psychological thriller, whereas Aliens is more of an action movie.  Both are highly successful at what they try to accomplish.  Personally, I prefer Alien because it scared me much, much more.  There were greater breaks in the action in Alien and the monster was seen much less (putting the viewer in the same uncertain state as the crew). Aliens is particularly interesting because we learn more about the life cycle and behavior of the creatures.  The addition of the little girl could have turned into something horrible, but Cameron pulls it off and makes a stellar film worth seeing.  However, I would recommend that you see Alien first to give you background into the creature and to connect what happens at the beginning of Aliens with previous events.  8/10.",
859,30 December 2007,towt,10, The best movie in the Alien series thus far,"This film, was EXCELLENT. If you have seen Alien3 or Alien 4 (Resurrection), and didn't like them, you have to see this one. By far the best one in the series. I have watched this film over and over again and I never get tired of it. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role and she downright kicks butt.",
860,2 April 2001,insectus,6, A miracle,"Yes, indeed a miracle. This is one of the few movies that follows up and changes the formula of an excellent film and doesn't loose anything at all in quality, relative to its genre. In a very clever way, this movie transports the universe from the sci-fi epic ""alien"" into an action movie that is probably the best of its type. James Cameron shows great talent while directing this film, always keeping connections to the Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" so that the idea of sequel isn't broken despite the great difference between the films. The acting is good, and excellent in the case of Sigourney Weaver (however, how polemic this may sound, I think she's even better in Alien 3). The plot is very simple like in the first movie, but as the few twists come it becomes quite convencing. The special effects are quite good for its time showing a clear improvement from the first movie. The alien queen is quite impressing. The action sequences are memorable and have inspired many ""imitations"" in other movies and even in some video games. This film only receives a worst score than the first because if we put aside the different genres, the movie itself is quite worst than the first, it is in the action genre that it is great.",
861,16 March 2003,danim33,10, My favorite movie of all time!,"The second installment, Aliens, has the best of everything: action, horror, comedy, drama, and a hint of romance. I was blown away when I saw this movie, and the special edition with restored scenes is even better. I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie and it is definitely my favorite. This movie has an amazing cast, with each character being memorable. Perhaps the most memorable character is played but Bill Paxton, who has some of the best lines in the movie next to Sigourney Weaver. I also became a big fan of Michael Biehn after this movie (and of course remembering him in Terminator). It wasn't until Titanic came out and everyone was talking about James Cameron and his past movies that I realized I am a fan of his as well. The Terminator movies, True Lies, the Abyss, and now Titanic are some of my favorites. It therefore does not surprise me that the second of the Alien films is my favorite. The third was dreadful and the fourth had amazing potential but fell short (I will review these also.) If you want to be entertained on all levels, this is the movie for you! Don't rent it, buy it, because I guarantee you will want to see it again and again.",

She was nominated for an Academy Award (she should have won) for her portrayal as Ripley. James Cameron's genius sequel to the 1979 shocker Alien is.......listen to me....I'm positively speechless!

Creating science fiction (SCIENCE!) movie has to be fantasy based on reality, not on unrestrained minds of writers or your 5-year old son. So, what we've got here? Story sucks and don't tell me it's OK, it's just... cant describe how bad it is. Ah, OK, not bad for five year old boy! Characters sucks. For example marines are defective imbeciles, not a soldiers.

The sets, the atmosphere (pun intended) created a perceived situation wherein Ripley became a disposable asset - and, of course, a means to an end.

869,3 June 2006,coldstick,9, One Of The Best Science-Fiction Movies Ever Made,"I've been a fan of 'Aliens' since I was pretty young, and unlike many other movies you end up liking less when you get older, 'Aliens' still stands as the same roller-coaster freakshow now as it was then. The monsters are huge, slimy, angry, and as awesome-looking as it gets. The casting is perfect, the weapons are just plain sweet (gotta love the flame-thrower!), and the film is never boring, even with its lengthy running time. The film isn't dated at all, and is still intense and realistic. It's tough to decide whether 'Aliens' or the original 'Alien' is superior, so I prefer to break it down this way: 'Alien' is the superior horror film, and 'Aliens' is the superior action film. There's just no comparing the two--they're in practically different genres. Plop in 'Aliens' and enjoy!",

It's cinema that embodies all the excess of the 80s, style so OTT that it might as well be padded shoulders and leg warmers. It has some good scenes & characters, these would have benefited from a special edition that reduced the running time around them not extending it. Most of the marines are so hard to sympathise with that I found myself cheering for the xenomorphs.

I got the alien quadrilogy boxset for Christmas in 2005. Aliens was the first film I put into my DVD player. I haven't watched the theatrical cut all I've watched is the directors cut special edition. One thing I love about this film it's different than the original. In the first you never saw the queen in this one you do. In the first one you saw one alien in this one you see hundreds of them. The first one is great as hell. But this one blows it water. Seeing as this website won't let me give it more than a ten star rating I'll tell you right now I rate this film 20 stars.,
883,22 February 1999,movieman9,8, Powerhouse sci-fi thriller that does not let go!,"Some films are just meant for the big screen and nothing else. ALIENS is one of these few treasures. I am a little tired of all this James Cameron bashing that has been going on since his Oscar cleanup and announcing his title of ""King of the world."" If I staked any kind of pursuit on something I believed in that badly, and won when everyone else said I would fail, I would be laughing all the way to the bank too. You see that creativity and gift for entertainment come alive in ALIENS. Cameron has an uncanny gift for making his films run for a considerable timeframe, and makes them thoroughly captivating and riveting throughout their duration, never stopping for a breath. Titanic is like that, and so is Aliens. Aliens, in its last hour, is non-stop action and suspense, using techno-visuals to a vast extent and more energy than it knows what to do with it. Sigourney Weaver is great as Ripley, a heroine that doesn't take any crap from anyone, and does everything a man can do, only better. She also has a heart, which is evident in her perserverance in saving Newt (Carrie Henn). Paul Reiser is devious and slimy as Burke, far from his character on ""Mad About You."" Bill Paxton is also a standout. If you have any brains at all, do not eat too heavily before seeing this film. You'll definitely not be able to hold it in. Rating: Three stars and a half.",

Get to the very end of the movie Aliens and LISTEN to the very end. After the credits and everything, just after the screen fades away. You will hear the very distinct sound of that slithery face hugger emerging from its egg. It is unmistakable!

Just think of it . If the story of Aliens was used for the first part and vice versa everyone would regard Alien as a mediocre sequel ( just like Alien 3 ) . Think of it . Alien was definately a classic because it simply happened to be the first in the row . But classic does not necessarily mean good . This  does not mean that the James Cameron version has not its flaws. Basically the script takes the idea and reproduces it ( more aliens , more weapons etc ) There are many similarities as well in the basic plot ( a double -faced traitor , an explosive finale , the alien comes on board , the alien is neutralised in precisely the same way )I would dare to say at all cost that it is  simply a rehash (or a remake why not ? )  .

Cameron has created without doubt the most realistic and believable fictional world and characters ever seen. The space marines are tough and speak like real military personnel. I believe this was achieved by sending the actors to military style boot camps where actors were in character (I.e a commander was to be obeyed). I also read that actors whose characters had not met were kept separate for a more realistic interaction when filming started. They act like real people not badly written robotic characters that show no fear/emotion. When these guys are scared they look terrified and with good reason. Introducing the first scary aliens ever presented in a movie. HR Gigers creature design plays on the psyche with its flawless but deadly physiology. The aliens move in a silky, graceful motion and are believable as silent deadly predators. I read that this was achieved by using ballet dancers to achieve the poise and grace required for such a perfect killer.",

The film takes a bit of time to develop the story, with Ellen Ripley going back to the planet from the first film to help save colonists and battle the Aliens, but this time accompanied by some real firepower and a small army of Marines. The development shouldn't be viewed as boring or slow, and besides introducing an interesting scenario, it's the calm before the storm, and what a storm!

Enter James Cameron, hot off his success from instant cult classic The Terminator. Fortuitously, some of his ideas for a sequel to Alien were not far off ideas producers Walter Hill and David Giler had. Hill and Giler after producing Alien, had also worked together in criminally underseen 1981 film Southern Comfort, which is similar in many ways to Aliens. Essentially, Aliens brings a Vietnam War vibe into the future, and ties it in with the Alien universe, and it makes for a perfect companionship.",

It doesn't sound so hard considering he basically wrote the same film twice. PTSD suffering hero is dropped back into the location that birthed all their trauma and manages to rescue a lone survivor - a failed rescue leaves them stranded and forced to fight their way out while various 80s yuppie scumbags get in their way. Both films are sequels to very different origin movies and both films up the guns and ammo quotient to great effect and much success. The main diffrerence being that Ripley is given something to live for while Rambo ends up isolated and alone.,

I feel the start of Aliens is actually the final scene of Alien and Aliens begins when Ripley is asked to return to the planet with the marines, from then on this movie is full on.  James Cameron was warned not to do this film and I think it's sad that nobody saw his potential. Aliens is sci-fi/action at its best, including fantastic special effects, non-stop action, one of the most memorable character's on film (Bill Paxton/Hudson) and an incredible music score. The special edition of the film includes elements that should never have been cut in the first place and I think this also shows the lack of faith studio executives had in James Cameron.

Don't get me wrong, there are certain scenes that will truly give you goose bumps, but overall there isn't that same eerie feeling as the first film. In ""Alien"", there was just one alien, and you didn't know where and when it was going to show up. In Aliens, there is a whole army of these gruesome E.T.'s, almost to the point of overkill.

The crew is basically a bunch of idiots, and their leader, the biggest idiot of them all. The 'villain' then, Burke, in that short-sleeved checkered shirt is beyond ridiculous. Not to mention the android that while split in half keeps the girl from falling, and the myriad of absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical situations that come one after the other during the film. The first 'Alien' had an aura of mystery, of suspense that is completely missing here. This film is probably the 'watershed' from writing a story and then creating the effects to back it up, to its opposite, i.e. Burying a risible story under a barrage of explosions, misplaced jokes, utterly unbelievable characters and an absolute lack of meaning. Utterly ridiculous and stupid. On the other hand all subsequent Cameron movies prove to be as evanescent as this.

Sigourney Weaver is the perfect heroine, and does not become stereotypical. The supporting characters fit in, are unique, original (for its time), believable and overall very enjoyable.

There is only one person who dies on-screen, and that person was only introduced to the film 2 minutes before they die.

The acting is good especially from Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser(as Carter Burke) and Lance Henriksen (as the robot). Sigourney's Ripley is such a strong woman, that even put shame to men (somehow I feel this is quite unbelievable, because she has got so much energy, especially the scene where she gets back to the Alien's Queen hatch to save Newt and fought the Alien's Queen alone with the machine.

This movie is what started me on my Paxton obsession, He gives a stunning performance, playing the most profoundly human character in a slew of otherwise unremarkable marines. Michael Beihn gives a moderately good performance, enough to impress, but not astound me.  Lance Henrisken does a startlingly good job of acting without emotion, until you watch anything else he's in and realize that's just how he acts.  I forget at the moment who played Vasquez, but that was a good performance.  And Paul Reiser as a villain??!  HA!  that was GREAT!  I loved it!!  He plays another disturbingly human character(but he pushes the envelope with trying to impregnate Ripley and Newt).  Oh man, though, the screenplay... wow.  The dialog is right on, the story picks up seemlessly from alien, and for once in a sequel doesn't BASH US OVER THE HEAD with the fact that it's a sequel(ala Scream 2? maybe?) And though the idea of marines that deploy from orbital starships was ""borrowed"" from the novel ""starship troopers"", watching ten minutes of this movie and ten minutes of the adapted screenplay for that shows by FAR which is the better movie. Weaver is annoyingly predictable as the ""mothering"" character, and Henn even more so as the squealing little harpy that Ripley adopts.  I would have gladly traded them both for the ressurection of say, maybe Hudson and Vasquez? Can we do that?  But, I suppose it wouldn't be a legacy if the main character didn't survive, would it.  However, there is one thing that Ripley DID teach me.  If I'm ever going into an alien nest, armed only with a machine gun and a flame thrower, I'll bring TWO clips for the gun.",

958,6 March 2013,cosmonadz,10, A sequel to relish,One of those rare moments when a sequel is as good as its predecessor. It starts off from where the first one left off (so watch the first one). Here we have Ripley going back to face her demons but this time she is accompanied by a group of marines. In the first installment it was cat and mouse but here it's all out action. James Cameron delivers a fast paced full throttle action packed monster of a movie doing what he does best. A cast full of zest and testosterone but once again coming up against an enemy which is not only powerful but smart. The pace is fast the cast full of memorable characters and again Ripley is left to save the day. This time round we get to see a little more of the aliens and they are just as terrifying in groups as they are alone. Guns flame throwers grenades tanks rockets space ships are really no match for the aliens. But they do try. It's fun and thrilling all the way to the breathtaking climax scene well worth the wait. Thoroughly enjoyable and probably one of the best action sci-fi films ever made.,

Often, sequels feel the need to be bigger, be bolder, be more complex - and sometimes, it fails in spite of it, but I guess Aliens succeeds in that aspect.",

962,21 November 2010,mhills5,10, One of the best sequels ever made,Aliens is one of the most entertaining and well made sequels ever made. Everything in the movie is pretty much perfect. The visual effects in this film are stunning. And the acting is fantastic too.,

964,3 August 2008,number3assassin,5, a good movie but not a masterpiece,"I loved this movie when it came back in 1986. Just as I loved Terminator and Terminator 2. But Aliens and Terminator 2 haven't really aged that well. Camerons direction is thin and too obvious. There's no depth in the movie that helps you keep the interest up when watching it a second or third time. There are some excellent action scenes in Aliens, that's Camerons real strength as a director. That's unfortunately not the case with the dialog sequences. They feel stiff and artificial. As long as the space marines run around and shout at each other it's not a huge problem, that is, as long as you find shouting marines interesting. The references to Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers are a bit too obvious, especially the focus on the ""space- borne infantry"" (or marines in this movie), ""the drop"" and the units tactics and the ""bug hunt"". ",
965,8 August 2009,mini_productions-2008,6, Aliens is slow paced but in the end pays off.,"Aliens is not perfect. Contrary to belief it is though, Aliens directed by Terminator man James Cameron sees our favorite Xenomorph busting hero Ellen Ripley return. The story is through maybe first 40 to 50 minutes is slow paced and boring. But, then around the last hour or so the action picks up and you have a facehugger here and a facehugger there and everywhere, plus Xenomorphs who just don't want to seem to die. In the end as usual Ripley sets off a self destruct mechanism for the ship she is on and has ""so and so"" amount of time to get out. Well, this time she has a couple of friends accompanying her and by that i also mean the Queen Xenomorph. So, we finally meet the mother behind all of this and well frankly she puts up a damn good fight, she even manages to follow Ripley off the ship and fights Ripley to the death. At the end though you have the same ending, Ripley fights big alien and alien gets sucked into the space vacuum, very simple. Overall I'd advise you to watch Alien first and if you liked RENT Aliens. Bottom Line, rent this first, you may be disappointed.",
966,24 June 2015,aditya-nathan,8, Excellent sequel that take the first movie to a whole new level,"If you've seen the first film, this movie is not the same at all. Alien (the first one) is a slasher thriller set on an isolated ship. As for Aliens itself is more of an action thriller. So it's like comparing Dead Space and Dead Space. Aliens deliver us more action, more suspense, and more aliens. It's a story about a rescue mission with a lot of gunfire, people die, and more aliens that you could ever dreamed of. It's also have more intense moments, more character development as you hate or love some of the character along the way. But if you think this is less scarier than Alien, well it's not. Aliens contains the same horror Alien gave us. It never gets old of seeing a baby Xenomorph jump to people face or people's chest bursting Aliens. So if you like Alien, but wish it to be more action packed, more scary, and more intense. Then this is the movie you've been waiting for.",

However, I was able to watch it on TV a few months later (before my parents came home from work), and I have to say that without a doubt this is one of the best movies that I've ever seen! Even though it's a 20-year-old movie, I can still watch it again and again without growing tired of it; the music and the effects are top-notch, not to mention that the girl who plays Newt is so believable you almost forget she's acting!

971,17 June 1999,MaGiK-i,10, Best movie ever!,"Let me just start by saying that this is the best movie ever made! It just is. I've seen lots of movies, and nothing is as gripping as this movie. The first time I saw it was on video in 1987; and somehow, I saw the director's cut. For almost 8 years after that I kept telling my friends about how cool Aliens was - especially the scene with the motion guns. Well, no one knew what I was talking about when I refrenced to the ""motion guns"" so one day I went to the video store to rent the movie and prove it to my friends. Well, to my surprise, the motion guns weren't in the movie! Well, to make a long story short, I spent a couple of years trying to track down the footage that I knew I had ""scene"". Finally, I ran into a guy who had Aliens on Laserdisc and I was able to dub a copy on to VHS. I was in heaven. You can imagine my excitement when the DVD Legacy pack was released just last week. Oh, by the way, a new PC game was just released ALIENS VS. PREDATOR. I highly recommend this. It's even more intense than the movie (well, maybe not more intense, but it's intense, baby!) Go get the game .... you won't regret it. Long live Aliens!!",

Alien was more of a gore fest, but nonetheless a riveting film, but this one is the rare occasion when the sequel is much better than the original. This film is in my top 5 list and may very well be number one. Sigourney Weaver is beyond spectacular in this movie. She's tough, straightforward, yet not afraid to show she's scared to death. Of all the ""Alien"" movies, this one shines far above the rest. If you haven't seen Aliens yet, for God's sake, what are you waiting for?

Aliens is certainly the best movie of the trilogy, Alien was very good also, suspensefull with a great creepy atmosphere, Alien 3 is not so well done because of the dead of Ripley, it's soo tragic, I just can't watch it.

Ripley played by the amazingly talented heavyweight titan of an actress Sigourney Weaver dominates all comers in a slick, well paced and thoroughly immersive action movie which ticks all your boxes and more when it comes to entertainment.

""at least they don't sell each other"". the acting was great for a sci fi with weaver, biehn, paxton and reiser (didn't you feel happy when he died? i did) and everyone else; though i said the marines lack of discipline, they were quite a funny group. i'm not much a sci fi fan, but i hope from now on they all look like this one. nothing is wasted, nothing is forgotten, nothing looks better than this flick. too bad the 2 next ones aren't as much as good as the 1 and 2.",

Whereas ""Alien"" was a foray into the decay of sanity and the crushing sense of doom and the oppression of fear; ""Aliens"" is one of the most obvious statements made on what is the difference between man and monster? The Marines in the film are not there to dawdle and wait in fear. They are there to do what Marines, or any elite fighting force is intended to do; kill. Ripley returns from the original and her actions and decisions ask the question, ""Which is it you want: Redemption for yourself or revenge for those the creatures have killed?""

Her determination. Her strength. The constant stress that anyone can relate to. It's her humanity and her strength that carry this movie along. The addition of the Queen is a master stroke. Kudos Mr Cameron! And to the special effects that still hold up 30 years later. I get goose-bumps every time I watch this and I've seen it probably 100 times! It's a movie that is best seen in the Blu-ray format (that fixes a few mistakes) and with a surround sound system to bring out the nuances in the sound effects. An excellent continuation of the story from Alien. Hands down, my favorite movie of all time!",
994,10 December 2004,artkozak,10, Best Sequel ever!!,"Now, this is probably one, if not my all time favourite movie. I think that if Alien was good Aliens managed to improve the already excellent film. Sigourney is awesome in this movie, and the cast that accompany her is just the perfect match. The aliens which are the true main characters are flawlessly developed and appear in big quantities but without that feeling of being overdone. And the QUEEN is just so incredible that I think I wasn't able to think about anything else after a month. The movie is gripping and it uses at its best the special effects available at the time, which I think are not one bit out of date. The storyline is solid and the dialogs fits all throughout the film. I think this is the one example of a sequel being better than the actual original film, and as I said I think Alien is already and excellent film. So what you waiting for? get Alien and Aliens, and let yourself have the best time of your life. You must see this movie!!!",

This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you. By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times). The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson). The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digital manipulation. I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also. The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release. Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit. Aliens is an outstanding show!",

This has to be one of the most exciting, action-packed and memorable films ever made, and hasn't dated a bit since its release in 1986. This time, it's war. Ripley is back, and so are the aliens- lots of them. Of course, the effects and creatures are nothing less than outstanding, but one of the best things about the film are the marines who go to battle with the aliens. Each soldier is extremely well written and the scenes aboard the Sulako, where we are introduced to the various characters, are fun to watch.

1002,17 April 2001,Hikage-sama,10, The greatest Sci-fi in movie history,"Aliens is James Cameron´s best picture in his career. Also Sigourney Weaver´s best in her career and everybody else´s, behind & in front of the camera.I am talking about the greatest adrenalin kick of them all. This is a Sci-fi movie with a master director and very good actors. The screenplay is fantastic and has most of elements from Alien. It means you can think back and remember the same atmosphere & places, witch is good and important for a sequel. But it still is original in a special way. Alien is a good movie, but now after more than 20 years if i watching it, i´m going to sleep in the middle of the film. But if i watch Aliens, i even can´t sleep. Not because of the horor but because of the adrenalin kick. I have seen Aliens more than 25 times & even analyzed it. It´s great to find new things every time. The score from James Horner is a ear candy & one of the best of all time. In Aliens you can find the greatest action female character in movie history. You can also find the coolest supporting actor in Bill Paxton. So i rank this as Cameron´s best art work before T2 & Titanic. I was so sad to see Alien3 & 4 because they are far from good. They have already ruined the castle who Scott & Cameron build up. Please do not make Alien5 to ruins it more. I want to say to all of you who thinking that Alien movies are silly: you don´t even need to see all parts, just see THE best part witch is called Aliens (1986)! I would like to thank & celebrate James Cameron because he is such a creative Writer/Director/Producer, and a great inspiration for me and many other people in the world. I just can´t wait until his next film. Life is like a universe of Sci-fi movies, you always know that the crown of it is a masterpiece called: ALIENS (1986)",

1009,23 April 2020,Noro_The_Arbiter,8," An amazing movie, but not a good Alien movie","Don't get me wrong, this film is great, but one thing I didn't like is how scaled-down the aliens' strength is. It might just be because I played Alien Isolation, and watched the first movie, but one thing that was important in both was how strong each alien is. In Alien Isolation (which is canon), an entire space station gets run down by a drone that couldn't have been much more than a week old. In the first movie, the entire crew of the Nostromo is slaughtered by a drone that was only a few days old, and yet in this movie, the fully grown Xenomorphs get mowed down en masse just because the protagonists have bigger guns? No, I don't think it works like that, not to mention the Xenomorphs were fighting head-on when it's already been established that they are at their best when hunting stealthily. Now again, this isn't a bad film. The cinematography is fantastic, as are the special effects (The Queen is just gorgeous). The acting was great for the most part, as always I loved Sigourney's performance (Although the little girl's line delivery was questionable).

1013,4 September 2006,jdslildeb,10, Excellent Special Effects means NO CGI!,"I really love James Cameron because he is truly a consummate artist, first and foremost. He is sensitive and perfection-seeking about all the right things and for all the right reasons as a director; to convincingly tell a good story and to create the human connection with the audience. He really wants the viewer to be transported by his films, which is exactly what a truly brilliant film does. Although this is a ""Sci-Fi"" film, he doesn't ""blind us with science."" Rather he chooses to give only important information at key points to move the story along. The viewer is never overwhelmed with too much information and the pacing never slows down trying to educate the audience about some heady scientific theory. I am so glad that he decided to make this film in the era that he did, B.C., (before computer generated special effects), because I think that is what really makes everything that much more visceral an experience when watching this film. The aliens are flesh and blood, (even if their blood is acidic!), and must be confronted on the material plane. I'm certain that these creatures would not be nearly as scary in CGI as they are in this film, dripping their goo everywhere. Well, case in point, Aliens 3. What a horrific flop and a total waste of everything, paper, film, time, money, talent,...ad infinitum. I actually walked out of the theater 20 minutes into that film and have since never watched it, even though it is included in the box set that I own. In my mind, it is so sub-par that I won't even acknowledge it as part of the franchise. But, then again, I don't like David Finchner's work in general. Enough said,... I have the ""Quadrilogy"" Collection of all the Alien films which includes excellent special features, such as behind-the-scenes peeks at how everything was crafted; sets, props, and aliens. It was really awesome to see how they built the sets and created the special effects! Any, no ALL film students should check out these special features on both this film and Ridley Scott's seminal Alien, which is the foundation work for Cameron's explosive sequel. You can see how Cameron identified the key elements and the core of Scott's film, ie., the physical and motivational qualities of the alien species, the overall condition of life for working-class humans, the corruption of ""the company"" that they work for, and the basic introduction of Ripley's character as sole survivor of the initial encounter with the alien. He then just found a viable continuation of this story within these established parameters. It was a very logical progression, both dramatically and thematically. And even though H.R.Giger was not an art design consultant for Aliens, Cameron already understood what Giger had set up in Alien and used it as a template to draw ideas from for the sequel for his creatures. He had his costume designers base their suits on the original. But Cameron himself was the designer of the queen. Yep! He drew a really creepy, but skillfully drawn, picture of her himself. The man is just oozing talent! I'm so glad he decided to have her constructed to be as terrifying and ""believable"" as possible. She was and is the Queen of All Monsters. ""Real"" monsters rule! It is really hard to believe that this movie was made for a mere 18 million dollars! Put that in your pipe and smoke it, George Lucas. This is definitely a ""must see"" for anyone who likes action, monsters, drama, war stories, and science fiction. You really can't get much better than this.",

You know the types, those that like to mention the director just because they are famous. Those who badmouth them because they are well known. ""James Cameron is a good friend of mine cuz I saw four of his movies, so I have so much important insight that I must share with you. I saw Aliens before most of you people ever did, I saw it back in 1990. That was before James Carmeron was famous so I'm kind of a long-time fan of his I guess, because you know, I really liked Aliens way back in 1990 before he or the movie was popular. He's not as good a director as he used to be sez me the world's biggest J. Cameron fan. That's right, I call him J. Cameron cuz we're close friends and all. Now onto my review which is really important for you to read because I'm an American from America. Burke is evil, he is upsettingly evil. End Spoiler. I will continue this review by pretending that I am writing this while being trapped in a 24 foot deep well in my backyard. This is the last message I will ever have for my family and friends as I have been trapped in this well for three days now and am surprisingly dying of dehydration because this well was empty, oh just my luck to fall into a dry well. Anyways, from what I can remember of the James Cameron film Aliens, I remember enjoying it greatly, oh so thirsty. I hope this package of skittles can tide me over until help arrives. Aliens is truly a Cameron tour de force, oooh I like the lime ones, delicious, back in 1990 when I saw this film I thought this Cameron character is really going places, who the hell has a well in their backyard now a days, I mean come on. The suspense of this movie puts my senses in maximum overdrive, which reminds me of the movie Roadhouse which I am not familiar with. Don't wells usually contain mushrooms, bats, or roaches, there's nothing in this well but pea gravel, this sucks. And that's why the ending to Aliens was so surprising. Lance Henriksen steals the show. feel dizzy, power loader battle sequence felt tacked on...., mouth ,so dry, James Cameron save me.......tell my family about Lance henriksen.ek,.qegu;////////////",

The original Alien of 1979, is one of the best sci-fi of all time in creativity and quality, and in my view, the best in the sci-fi horror genre. This one here copies everything and does not add anything new. Army troops are overly standardized and unrealistic. The characters seem to be drawn from classic post WWII movies with no knowledges to be involved in a high tech environment . Although we have some good characters like our synthetic man Bishop, but Burke is weak in all respect and without much logic.
I can not understand the ranking among the top 100 films of all time. Although with high quality special effects, I do not understand the high rating of 8.4. At the end of the film the fight with the door open to the vacuum, is too unreal and forced. 7/10",

It may have been made 7 years after Alien but Aliens looks far more dated, probably due to the more frequent and more ambitious special effects.

While there may be some truth to this, this film still has many areas which are quite frightening. It might be better classified as a thriller or suspense though then action. Unlike an action film, this film starts out fairly slowly. Aside from one frightening scene early on, nothing specifically scary or action orientated happens for a rather large portion of the movie.

1038,30 May 2006,stream_of_sorrow,10, THE Greatest Action Movie Ever,"I have lost count to the amount of times i have watched this movie. And even after each session...i find myself overblown by the experience of it. Make no mistake, this is the sequel to one of the best sci-fi movies ever made,but i~t takes the alien saga in a completely different direction,this one is action oriented while the first one was more of a suspense movie. Has everyone knows or should know by now,this movie takes place exactly 56 years after the events on alien,and the formerly unknown planet is know a Wayland yutani colony. Ripley is faced with this new reality,and despite her effort to warn the people around her,there is no reason to believe her story...until they lost contact to the colony. And this is where this movie truly begins. Ripley comes back to the planet where this saga began...only this time with a group of marines. You can see that from early performances that the cast was very well selected,after all this is a James Cameron film,so it has to have quality in it. First of all Sigourney Weaver,the main character and one of her best performances ever,the viewer will love her from the start,as she can be so sweet,but ruff at the same time. Strong on the outside,and even more on the inside. Michael Biehn has also an important role. His character has the perfect balance of being a military man,but also a person with feelings and a rational side. In opposition with him we have Paul reiser has the perfect company greedy employee. Then one of my personal favourites,Bill Paxton,and i read this on a user review on this same website ""He truly steals the show"",and i make these my words too. Every scene with him is just phenomenal,a tough guy on the outside,but a very fragile on the inside. He gives a great dose of humour to this action film. The rest of the characters are marine tough guys, simple characters but also here with great performances. Newt is probably one of the greatest characters and most influential to the movies storyline. The way Ripley gets attached to her,and all the complicity they build throughout the movie,makes the audience sensitive,something rare or even unseen in a movie of this nature. The way a woman and a child are trapped in an hostile and alien infested environment,doesn't seem fair at times,and it keeps us holding on to the screen in a powerful way. Then there are the sets,and the overall feeling they transmit. It really seems that the movie is taking place in an alien planet,and the equipments and weapons truly look futuristic,the spaceships are well designed,and the special effects on the aliens are very well done(no cgi here!). The colony complex is very well done,and you actually believe and feel the fear and claustrofoby of the characters. One of the best movies of all time,and even today,20 years after its release,it still manages to stand up on a genre that is overflown my all kinds of good,and bad movies. If you haven't seen this one,stop reading NOW and go buy one of the special edition dvds available everywhere,or buy the complete alien quadriology DVD set. A must seen movie.",

The fact of the matter is that Aliens is a good movie. Was it better than the original? That's a tough decision. Was it as scary as the original? Most definitely not.

Even if the film-making is highly above average action movies (Cameron is the only true Spielberg's heir) the screenplay lacks of truly new ideas and the few ones aren't very well developed . Thumb-up for Weaver's performance (like always) and for Lance Henriksen playing the Android (this time a good one) , but the rest of the troop is made by comic style-bi dimensional characters . What makes this movie worth watching anyway is Cameron's smart direction and technical knowledge , especially in the final duel scene with the Alien-queen . The sense of fear for the unknown which we found on the first episode is lost , and that obscure Gothic-style aura turned into pop-manga spectacular show . For some it could be better , not for my taste for sure . It still remains a good sequel (if sequels can ever be good) , which focuses on action instead of sensation .

It has everything, fantastic cinematography, intense characters and of course, action. Cameron manages to make the Alien just as menacing as before, even tho it is seen much more frequently. the introduction of a child character, Newt (Carrie Henn) who is the only survivor on the terraforming installation adds a sinister vibe to the film, that causes a sense of fear of the unknowing to the viewer.

I can´t understand why so many people claim Aliens as a masterpiece (not to say 'the best all time movie'). First, a masterpiece has to be original and there is very little of 'original' in this sequel, Alien is the movie that introduces the horrible monster, the planet, the alien spaceship, the facehuggers, the horrible lifecycle of the xenomorph, EVERYTHING! Aliens is just a very entertaining movie (don´t misunderstand me, I really like it) but it just follows the real original idea of the first movie but now with a bunch of marines with the idea of kicking some aliens' butt. Now, lets be sincere, that plot is not 'brilliant', it is adolescent and good to sell lots of bucks, and sure it did. As for Aliens being the best sci-fi around...hmm, go and watch, 2001, Bladerunner, Brazil or Alien, in this last you can FEEL how lonely and dark space can really be. Horror and terror?

Probably the most beautiful action film of all time and with Sigourney as the queen of sci-fi hardnecks. The whole serie (at least the first 3 parts) contains more underlying themes and psychological comments than any other action opus and reaches its peak right here, so good that you even fully accept the little girl running around. All the horrifying waiting in the Alien serie spreads through this part like a decieving calmness, a mood that Cameron repeated 3 years later in The Abyss (director´s cut of course)another great movie but at the same time the complete opposit to Aliens in an idealogical sense. A major credit must also go to the creator of history´s most stunning alien race, the strange artist Giger. Jurrasic Park is a Disney film compared to this. You really want there to be creatures looking like this out there in space but you surely don´t want them to act this way!

1055,14 June 2020,Basement_kid,10, Alien Walked so Aliens Could Run,"Although Alien was a masterpiece, Aliens is better than it in my opinion. Alien was a Horrifying Film with many suspenseful moments, but Aliens is a lot more action packed. It feels more like a action movie set in space than a horror movie. This is why I think they are both great, because they are so different in tone that it would make sense to me why either could be someone's favorite. In the first film the Alien infiltrates their ship, but in this film the go to the source to kill it directly. There are way more people on this mission compared to the first one. In this one Ripley is not familiar with the rest if the crew on the ship, but every one else is familiar with each other. This makes the film feel like a fish out of water story. Ripley does not go to fight the aliens, but is a consultant watching from a safe distance with the overseers on the mission. That makes it all the more terrifying when she realizes just how many Aliens there are knowing how dangerous they can be. There are also several action packed sequences throughout the movie instead of just one at the end. This is mainly because of the first movie only having one Alien this film has hundreds of them attacking in hoards. This really ups the anti for what can happen. Even though there are several action scenes in the movie the final scene in the film is still action packed, with the queen alien coming aboard there ship. It also subverts your expectations for who the bad guy will be. You would think it's the android or that he is bad in some way but he is instead is almost the good guy in the movie.

It combines all those genres into one hell of a movie that will blast through you like nothing you've ever seen.  And I can only imagine what kind of force this thing has on the big screen.  It is very different from the original, which was a stark, somewhat slow movie where it was scary for the most part because you would never know when the alien would strike.  In this movie, the aliens are EVERYWHERE: popping out of the walls, air ducts, floors, ceilings...hardly gives you any chance to catch your breath.  The last hour or so is nonstop intensity.

1072,26 June 2009,camkid8,9, One of the greatest sci-fi action movies ever made,When i first saw this movie it was Christmas Eve. I was watching Terminator 2 with a friend. he didn't seem that interested in it since he had seen it so many times so he brought up the subject of how Aliens is an awesome movie. I said that I had never seen it before but I would like to. He then got it from his car. Fifthteen minutes into the movie I was hooked. The way the Colonial Marines acted was really cool. It looked like James Cameron really put some research into how Army manuevers are done. The aliens were really scary but so cool. There was good character development as well. Especially with Ripley and Newt. Michael Biehn who was in Terminator did an awesome job acting and he was my second favorite character. My first being Ripley. If you haven't seen this movie then you should. Horror and action are combined very well.,

But, what's so special about ""Aliens""? Well, for a start, it's a sequel to one of greatest Sci-Fi films ever created - Alien. When released in 1979, Alien pushed the boundaries for Science-Fiction films to their very limits (well, for 1979 anyway). However, James Cameron would push them further still merely seven years later when he released Aliens.",

What I find a bit diminishing about this great movie is the ending of it. I cannot imagine such a huge alien queen to be capable of getting on the ""plane"" just behind Ripley. The queen could not have caught it. And one more thing - Ripley climbing the ladder while the outer door of the spaceship being open. That`s really funny.",

1080,28 June 2000,stavros-13,10, Nothing comes closer,"This is THE best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The story picks up from Alien, where a woman named Ripley, after surviving an ordeal with a bug-like alien, is picked up by her employers while in her ship. She is offered a chance to lead a military expedition to the aliens' planet as an advisor in exchange for her a new job and new life. Ripley and the team then descend onto the planet and that is when the action begins. There are a lot of reasons why I would recommend this movie to anyone. It portrays the characters' personalities extremely well(Bill Paxton's character is an example) and it also creates enough tension to make you pee in your pants. The special effects were good for a movie made in the 1980s, and there is enough one liners and memorable quotes to keep you begging for more. Another reason why I like this movie is because it has none of those kissing scenes and mushy stuff. Every movie I have watched in the past 8 years had a kissing scene. The music was excellent, too. The dialogue, unlike most movies, is easily understood, and can keep the most prominent dialogue hater interested. Aliens is still my number 1 movie. And until now, nothing has come close to it.",
1081,8 June 2006,tommybone17,9," The essential ""run-n-gun"" action movie with smarts and edge of your seat thrills from beginning to end.","""Aliens"", when looking at its content before viewing the movie, certainly seems like a Hollywoodized attempt to cash in on the popularity of Ridley Scott's classic, ""Alien"", but to my surprise, it actually succeeds the original. Yes, ""Alien"" is a straight-up sci-fi horror flick, and ""Aliens"" is a typical sci-fi action ""run-n-gun"" extravaganza based on the creatures found in the original, but there's something about ""Aliens"" that seems to put all of the necessary scares and thrills made famous from the first one, then added much more tension and excitement than the first film can ever hope to achieve. Instead of facing one alien, Ellen Ripley (the main protagonist from the first ""Alien"", played wonderfully by Sigourney Weaver in one of her best roles) and a group of outer-space mercenaries faces off against an army of them! It made even more tension-filled thanks to James Cameron's excellent direction. This is what an action movie should be, so all directors taking on a high explosive action movie should take notes from James Cameron's ""Aliens"". OK, but many would be asking ""Why would some action movie ranks with the likes of classic movies, such as ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"", and even ""Saving Private Ryan"" to name a few. Well, I have an explanation about that. In theory, ""Aliens"" is a typical what I would call ""run-n-gun"" action movie affair such as any typical Michael Bay movie, and since it deals with creatures attacking humans, it would be logical that it can be compared with rather superfluous creature features such as ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""Jeepers Creepers"", and ""Congo"". But that was what separate ""Aliens"" from the rest, in that unlike the others, this one has a story that is well connected to the characters' motives and that it is actually worth paying attention to. For example, Ellen Ripley isn't just some one-woman army that is typical of any heroic action movies, she actually have the motives and realistic tendencies to really give herself a strong presence throughout the entire film. Sigourney Weaver pulled out a surprise by being nominated for Best Actress of 1986 at the Oscars for a role that really shouldn't. After watching it, you would be surprise by how strong of a performance she really delivered. Unlike the first ""Alien"", in which she practically runs away from the creature, in this film you'll see how she must conquer her fears of the creatures in order to save an innocent little girl (played by Carrie Henn) from an alien infested space colony. To put it bluntly, this movies proves why the character of Ellen Ripley is among the greatest movie heroine in cinema history, and Sigourney Weaver will forever be immortalized as the character. The alien creatures themselves are some of the most terrifying, and thanks to the wonderful puppetry, the creatures gives an organic feel that makes them come alive, and gives the film much more tension-filled moments based on the design of the creatures. One little thing of particular notice is the astounding film and sound editing. Since the aliens wouldn't deliver a promising threat to the mercenaries based on presence alone, the film editing gives it a sense of real danger and thrill that would, in my opinion, ruin the movie in the hand of a less talented film editor. In other word, the film would be half as successful if it weren't for the smart editing techniques. And the sounds emitted by the aliens and the surrounding environment gives the abandoned setting a more menacing and terrifying place to visit, which are excellent additions to keep the tension up. The music, while not extraordinarily memorable as say ""Star Wars"", brings the tension package together with grace, since the music adds so much to the terror and dismay in the movie, a great way to bring out the heart-stopping moments throughout the film (and there are tons, with most of them being the most memorable in cinema history in my opinion). And, although I've stated it before, it wouldn't be as great as it is without James Cameron. James Cameron had made a masterpiece with ""Aliens"", in which he took the basic monster ""run-n-gun"" thriller and took it not just to the next level, but also with great balance. There's no overabundance of mindless shooting (although there are plenty to consider the movie a ""run-n-gun"" affair) and, believe it or not, the characters do not play second-fiddle to the action itself. Although some of the mercenaries wouldn't require deep characterizations, Ellen Ripley and her exploit in the abandoned outer-space human colony makes the already tension-filled atmosphere the more tension-filled. James Cameron demonstrated the perfect action movie in my opinion, and thanks to the atmosphere set by Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", this one bring a whole lot more to the table, making the Ellen Ripley battle with the aliens a whole lot more satisfying than the original. Out of the four ""Alien"" films (not counting ""Alien vs. Predator""), this one is definitely the best. Not just the best in the series, but one of the best in cinema as a whole, in my opinion. There just isn't any other movie that delivers this much thrill, terror, and pure excitement as ""Aliens"", and it took only James Cameron to make another run-n-gun masterpiece to match up to it (that would be ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""). Overall, for those who would like to know what movie would deliver in thrills with no bad story bogging it down and a hero (or heroine) that is not dumbed down by the plot, ""Aliens"" is the answer. The definitive action movie that stills holds up today, and to a degree, one of the best movies ever. A 10/10 would seem only reasonable for an action movie with no noticeable flaw, and it is James Cameron's most superb work in years.",

When discussing this particular film among my friends and family who share the same preferences in films (sci-fi, action, etc), we usually agree on the completeness of the film. Way too intense for young viewers, and those with more sedate appetites in their film viewing. There will be violence and gore in this one, as well as some great quotes from memorable moments in the film.

But i disagree it has a different style more focused on terror and action instead of horror like the first one. I think Aliens has great acting and casting and it has a lot of scary and tension filled scenes. In my opinion Aliens is almost just as good as Alien because unlike many sequels it doesnt have the exact same type of plot as the first film. I also like the practical effects that have aged very well when compared to (for example) Alien 3 messy and ugly CGI. Definitely worth watching(unlike the rest of the series).,

Luckily, the nice guy from the future in The Terminator is there to fall in love with Ripley; he of course has experience with cyborgs as well as director James Cameron.

Cameron wisely decides to not retrace the steps of Ridley Scott and goes for adrenaline-pumped action mixed with visceral tension, even more tense than Alien...just think of the motion tracker bleeping as the aliens get closer...genius! This is one of those movies you never want to end and I must have watched it 20 times at least. If you found the Alien concept from the original film interesting, you'll absolutely love this. No real flaws as far as I can think of...it's very long (I watched the Director's Cut) but the time flies by and I never really got bored - the strong storyline, wonderfully diverse characters and strong performances (especially from Weaver, Biehn and Henn) see to that. Unlike in Titanic, Cameron gets the dialogue exactly right here, especially with the rousing one-liners for the marines that have been shamelessly copied ever since.

Ripley, along with a troop of Colonial marines, are not faced with a single alien(which almost killed everyone in the first film), but a hive of them.    The two films marry together quite nicely.

To follow up Ridley Scott's claustrophobic masterpiece was always going to be a tough task but there are very few out there who could seriously argue that Aliens is overshadowed by its big brother. Even if we consider the fact that we are dealing with a film in which the humans and aliens are on a more level playing-field ( well, those guns are awfully big ), Cameron is still able to make the film as tense as its predecessor, with the use of the marines' shoulder-mounted video cameras being a particularly inspired touch.

The Aliens in one of the movies that you must watch :).",
1115,3 February 2006,kamas716,9, On par with the first,"A sequel that rivals the original, while having a completely different feel to it. The first one was horror, this one is pure action. Sigourney Weaver plays the part perfectly. I have to admit that this seems like an odd movie for Paul Reiser to be in, but he plays it straight enough to not be annoying. And it's always fun to go back and watch young actors as they're coming up (Mark Rolston and Bill Paxton).",
1116,1 August 2006,AmigoOfVaz,10, In the words of Comic Bok Guy Best Movie Ever! Warning spoilers,"Great movie, only two problems. 1. Newt annoyed the crap out of me, especially when she screamed and switched between an English and American accent, she sounded different in every scene, and that character does not belong in a war movie.Or any movie for that matter. The other one wasn't a problem more of a either or meaning that this movie could still have been great, even greater if Ripley wasn't in it.This is mainly why I mostly start watch at the Sulaco scene. The Marines(Especially Hudson who was done by Bill Paxton in a should have won an Oscar performance, and Vasquez who was done surprisingly well by Jennette Goldstein, who if I had not known before hand, who never have guessed that was her first movie.) should have been more prominent characters, and in my opinion more of them should have survived mainly Vasquez Hudson and to a lesser extent Drake.All in all in is still the greatest movie ever. So if would pause for a moment of silence honoring the Colonial Marines who died protecting the United States from invasion by the aliens.",

But it was fun to watch. Peeves I guess would be there don't seem to be enough aliens, as young Newt seems to ominously warn. For those who have seen it, some funny goofs are......the visible wire when the face hugger attacks Ripley in med lab. The reappearance of goo on Newt after she is clear of it when Ripley lifts her from the cocoon...Hicks blasting away at the false-cieling when the aliens attack...with no damage to it. & so on.",

Here, every little thing is a real work of art. This is such a great, timeless suspense movie that every time you watch it, you see some new details, some new events, some new revelations. This is a real treat and fest to eyes. Sigourney Weeaver, Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn and others did such a marvelous job here. Ripley was never better, more convincing, decent and reckless than here. And then, there are those horrible, ghoulish shrieking aliens, so terrible and so menacing that they make you blood chill and freeze all 2 hours. This film was made in 1986 but still is watched like a very modern, up-to-date, fast, wild and unmitigated audacious attempt. Really good, really great. Highly recommended for all who like such thrillers. Well done, with excellent props, FX's and deep dark atmosphere of fear and horror",

A feeling that sticks with you long after you've left the theatre or your couch. This feeling can be unsettling, uneasy, shocked, shaken or inspirational but the one thing that counts is that it's unlocked something in you that only it can do.

Theres humor, wit, great chemistry from the leads, and the special effects hold up 100% today when the movie was made in the 80s, not many films can say that.

Ridley Scott is a master of this, and deserved more attention for this masterpiece, which was truly better than the original.  From a popcorn entertainment perspective to a post-feminist deconstructive academic perspective, this film satisfies on every level.  Without Sigourney Weaver, this film would have still been amazing, as opposed to Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection.  Admittedly, the original Alien is also quite good.  But the attention to nuance, to moments, to mini-moments, to asides, to brooding, to mystery, to terror, to human emotions, to anti-emotion, to corporate greed, to labor greed, to child abuse, to psychological trauma, to Giger's incredible artistry, to editing, to storytelling, to entertainment is just incredible.

This particular film is characterised by suspense, darkness and fear (yet less than Ridley Scott's groundbreaking original)- with the twist of a devastating arsenal. This is one of the most successful sequels ever, seconded only by The Godfather Part II and Cameron's second cyborg flick - Terminator 2.

Whereas Alien was a brilliantly brooding dark film, almost docu-drama in places, Aliens is a rollercoaster of action but it never looses sight of the characters it creates. You really get to care about all of them a lot - even the soldiers who are on the edge of the action like Dietrich. And Burke has to be the only character in any Aliens film where I've been routing for the extra-terrestrials! There are so many electrifying scenes - but the one that still sends a chill down my spine (on the 100th viewing!) is when the Aliens awake for the first time and catch the marines off-guard. Ripley is at her morose best in this film and the growing relationship with Hicks and Newt  - and Bishop -is another significant departure from the original and which builds the series as a whole to another level  (sad then that Aliens 3 smashed away all of the fine building blocks set up by Cameron) A definate must see film!",

1139,23 October 2009,mchemb,8," Fantastic, fun thriller that meets the standards of the 1st film and maybe even exceeds them!","'Aliens' is a fantastic addition by director James Cameron to the now somewhat disappointing Alien franchise. He succeeds in meeting the standards of the first film by Ridley Scott and possible even goes as far as exceeding them. The basic premise is the same; a tense thriller set in space where a group of humans, in this case marines, fight to survive against a formidable foe, the Alien. The major difference between this film and its predecessor is that instead of one just Alien there are a lot more! Credit to James Cameron as with worries from the studio about the cost of producing so many Aliens he had to achieve the effect multiple creatures using only 6 Alien suits! An effect he succeeds in doing extremely well. Special mention should also go to to the set designers and lighting on this film who successfully transported me on board the ships and alien planets through fantastically intricate, expertly lit sets. The attention to detail is amazing (see if you can read the profiles of the previous crew members behind Ridley in the beginning of the film) and really adds to the credibility of the film. A real negative point of the film which I feel needs mention is the acting of the awfully stereotypical marine soldiers. With predictable dialogue and over the top Neanderthal caricatures they manage to make the film in parts unintentionally comical! An exceptionally cringy performance from Bill Paxton (usually a reliable actor) ranges from being a cocky arrogant hardman to dribbling scared mess seeming to contradict his own character with every scene. This often takes away from the credibility and suspense of the film. Having said that, the acting is not without star turns the drill Sergeant figure is witty (if still a little stereotypical) but special mention should go to the little girl, Carrie Henn, and of course Sigourney Weaver, who's brilliant heroine character is given more depth in this film which she pulls off with a plom. As a whole, the film manages to sustain suspense throughout through excellent use of fast cuts and POV camera shots, only easing the tension occasionally, allowing the audience to breath, before throwing them head first back into the action. James Cameron set out to make a 'fun, stand alone film that had resonance of the first alien feature'. Well Mr Cameron I say Job well done!",

1142,3 July 2007,horrorfan1023,8," Beautiful, the best of the sequels!","I've watched this movie many times, and I still am amazed at the quality of the work Jim Cameron has put out here. ""Aliens"" does not surpass its predecessor, ""Alien,"" in scares; but it beats it by a land-slide in the action department. I personally prefer the creature design in ""Alien"" over the ones in this one. In ""Aliens"", the creatures looked nothing more than like mutated, wing-less bees. It's always a pleasure to see Lance Henriksen on the big-screen. He excelled as Bishop, the android. Same for Michael Beihn as Corporal Hicks, the tough/nice guy of the bunch. He and Sigourney Weaver had great chemistry together. Sigourney herself portrayed Ripley beautifully in this one, just as she did in the original. Ripley is the role Sigourney was born to play, and this movie is proof. As for Newt, I personally am not a fan. I'll be honest, I never was. She came off as whiny, and most of her lines were just screaming people's names (and in that aspect of the role, Carrie Henn did a good job)! But, she was a necessary evil to give Ripley a daughter figure, since you find out her own daughter died earlier in the film. ""Alien"" IMO, is the best in the series, but ""Aliens"" is the best of its sequels. 3 & 4 do not compare to this one.

We're still reading Beowulf a thousand years after it was written, and I like to think we'll still be enjoying Aliens a thousand years from now. The movie is perfectly cast and the story unfolds just right, so that the tension and excitement build until you feel like you're on a really well made roller coaster, with a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. And frankly, I have yet to see CG effects that are a match for Stan Winston's genius in this film. Never did I think the aliens looked fake or animated (ok, some of the ships were a little too obviously models) as is so often the case with the all-too-perfect digital creature effects we see in movies these days.

Don't get me wrong, Aliens is also a Sci-Fi Horror film in some way, but the action smothers the science fiction and the horror. However though, it's a good action movie with a plot which a liked a lot. Plus it doesn't try to rush any scenes whatsoever.

1157,14 October 1999,Xenomorph,8," Cameron's second best, and one of the very best science fiction films to date","Aliens is absolutely one of the very best best sci-fi movies out there. And Cameron shows the audience one of his very best talents when it comes to directing: To, without any exceptions whatsoever, instantly keep up the level of excitement and fear. In some parts, it's a very predictable piece of film. Even when Ripley says something like ""I said no! I will not go there!"", you still know that she will, and you're not too surprised when Newt, of course, is the only one who gets caught by those slimy b***ards, but still make it. It feels like a cliche, but naturally everyone would hate the movie if she died. Including me. But not all things are predictable, you don't know when the humans will meet the aliens for the first time, and you don't know when they will come through the barricades. The fact that they came from above was just as logical as intelligent. I recently saw Aliens Special Edition, and that was really a lot better then the cinema-shown version. I can't believe why so much was cut out of that one. Personally, I think Aliens is Cameron's second best work so far. And a certain very well known three-hour ocean epic is in the lead. Terminator and it's superior sequel were a bit weaker, but still very good. As a matter of fact, James Cameron has only made two big mistakes in his career: 1) The directing of Piranha II: The Spawning (I haven't seen that one, but you don't need to see it to know it's crap) and 2) Writing parts of the script to Rambo: First Blood Part II (which by my opinion is one of the very worst films ever made).

Geiger's aliens are absolutely excellent, and despite the revolution in CGI SFX, they still don't look dated at all. This dark movie has a malevolent and brooding atmosphere which is maintained throughout the film, by brilliant direction on the part of Jim Cameron, and excellent acting by all involved, especially Bill Paxton as Hudson, who remains my favorite screen character of all time. It is such a pity that the next two films in the saga were so bad, and that they don't make action movies like this anymore.",

It has some wonderful special effects and a fairly believable script, with good performances. It's a great old movie of action, adventure and science fiction, one of the best I would say that also features a performance by the spectacular Sigourney Weaver, a strong woman who faces her fears and becomes a great fighter aliens.",

Well, thats what Sigourney Weaver got. Somehow, however, I believe not all of us would be so lucky to have Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton running around after us, dressed in tight army outfits and wielding some very masculine looking pieces of weaponry, hmm?

1164,18 July 2014,samorchard96,9," ""Game NOT over man!""","This is one of the best films I've ever seen, sci-fi or otherwise. It's nigh-on perfect, and on a par with the original 'Alien', which in itself was an amazing film. Whilst the Ridley Scott original was tense, paced horror with a sense of dread and isolation, this is all-guns blazing action yet with those same senses. It is very well directed and crafted - every character is made to feel real and evokes reaction, from Ripley to the Marines, every twist and turn is shocking to the viewer, and the Aliens themselves are, very cleverly, not overused, except perhaps for the (spoiler) Queen who faces off against Ripley right at the end, but again in a satisfying and very brutal encounter. Aliens could easily stand on its own, let alone as a sequel, and serves as a fast paced, thrilling action film that is sure to be remembered long into the night...",

Absolutely all the cast played their roles well. Thank you james cameroon for making this great movie.",
1166,10 October 2020,Caner81,6, Good fun,"It's a good action film with some cool deaths and a strong central character. However, it's shallow and never gets near the quality of its predecessor. You will forget this one by the next week whereas Alien will stay with you for the rest of your life.",
1167,23 January 2014,jordan-estes,10, Perfect Movie,"This movie is the perfect sequel. Takes everything from the first film and only improves on it. Great blend of suspense, action, drama, and mystery. The characters are well written, fleshed out, and really are memorable, unlike a lot of modern-day sci-fi films. The quality of the script is what makes this gem stand out - they focus a lot of building the relationships, the tension, and the mystery of the peril. This is what's missing in many of todays' films. They just want to get to the action. ""Aliens"" really takes its time to get to it, but its all worth it. Also, this movie has the most BADASS end sequence, that only Sigourney Weaver could've pulled off. Seriously, this is the best female role ever written. The blu-ray makes this film look good to today's standards. Go watch this film!",
1168,19 May 2014,reptileguy321,10, My favorite film of all time.,"James Cameron truly understands how to make an incredible film. In Aliens the creatures are great, but it's really all about the characters. Every single character in the film is memorable and very quotable. I consider the best performance in the film to be Bill Paxton's character Hudson. He provides the perfect amount of comic relief when it's most necessary and he is probably the best part of the film. I originally watched this movie when I was six and from that point on I've had a love for film. Essentially, if you haven't seen this film, you need to see it. I've never been inspired by a film so much in my life. Aliens is by far the best horror-science fiction movie to ever hit the big screen, and I'll be surprised if anything ever surpasses it. I consider Aliens to be the closest thing to a perfect movie in film history. It's straight up awesome.",
1169,23 April 2003,fliper78617,10, The best out of the saga,"Sometimes in movies sequels are made they end up being the same, the worst or the best. Aliens fits in the better than 1st one category. It's sometimes rare that a sequel surpasses the original mainly because of different writers, directors or lack of creativity. However Director and writer James Cameron knew firsthand of what to do and delivered what the audience wanted a fierce action film but with fear and darkness along with it that made it a truely aspiring film. Cameron earlier directed The Terminator a well done film in 1984 that promoted him as an excellent director and now he directs a film that is proberly his 2nd best. The story (Also written by Cameron) takes place 57 years later when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is picked up by a salvage team and lets her know what has happened during her long hypersleep. As the film progresses there have been terraforming factories on the planet that Ripley explored many years earlier that are trying to establish a colony but in reality are working for the company to try and get mysterious aliens. Later on Earth has lost contact with the colonists and decide to send marines in to found out why. A company associate by the name of Burke (Paul Reiser) try's to convince Ripley of going with the Marines to advise them of what these creatures are capable of. After all the bad dreams Ripley has been having she finally agrees to join them. The film progresses on meeting many tough marines introducing them like the respectful Hicks (Michael Biehn), the tough Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein) and my personal favorite the complaining showoff Hudson (Bill Paxton. As they land they discover weird, unusual and mysterious things. However a little girl by the name of Newt (Carrie Henn) is the only survivor and already knows what's happened to the colonists and to her family. As they enter the main complex they discover they have to fight the aliens as well before they become hosts to make more aliens. Once again its up to Ripley to help the marines and later to battle the Queen Alien from laying more eggs again. The performances are the best, Sigourney Weaver gives is what proberly her best performance of her life and is much convincing in this role of Ripley than she was in Alien. I especially like it when she establishes the relationship with Newt since they're both alone and are full of emotion it generally makes you care about them a lot. Michael Biehn gives a great performance as Corporal Hicks, Bill Paxton is a hoot to watch a great one liner ""This ain't happening man"", ""This ain't happening"". Other performances are great including Reiser's performance as Burke, Goldstein as (Vasquez) and a great one to watch Lance Henriksen as Bishop as a synthetic android who's highly intelligent. The Special Effects are still the best and convincing done by Stan Winston who always creates the best Special Effects in makeup especially the slime, Alien warriors, The Face huggers (They diffentely make me jump still to this day and i meant to say just plain face hugger in Alien, but they're still born of a queen). Anyway everything about this film is spectacular Directing, Writing, Production, Music by James Horner is creepy at times and one of his best (Also i should have said Jerry Goldsmith delivered a fine score too) and the acting as well. Only made for 18.5 million dollars proves to me that James Cameron could make any kind of spectacular film out of money and he did. Also get the Special Edition that runs 154mins it makes the film a little bit easier to understand and its more emotional.",

1171,9 July 2004,booyahboy_uk,10, A true rarity....,"Aliens, James Cameron's 1986 sequel to Alien;is one of the few sequels in film history which improves upon its predecessor.Whereas the 1979 original focused on a tense suspense driven approach to horror, Aliens is structured as a war film in space. Still providing horror but now mixed with action; Aliens would be the ideal young, testosterone driven, macho male film if not for its leading character being Ripley (the sole human survivor of the original), a woman who learns to hold her own amongst all the bravado of the colonial marines. I remember renting this film frequently from my local video shop in the late eighties, it really stands well to repeat viewing given the amount of quotable lines it features. It's such a shame that the two sequels never once revisited the quality of either this or the afore-mentioned Alien.",

Weaver, Beihn, Paxton, Henricksen are performing great and almost everyone is above average. The 1st movie made it easy to make a sequel, but to make an even better one is way harder.

I was literally blown away!! A movie of this caliber will always stand the test of time and the evidence proves it. This showing at the cinema was sold out. It has everything you could want in a film, suspense, Action, drama, thriller and great acting! The effects are still brilliant and in my opinion are better than some of the flicks you see nowadays. I would recommend watching the directors cut as well because you get a better insight of the story and situation. This is more than just a film for me, this literally is a piece of art :-)",

1177,15 April 2018,jenniferadarby,1, Absolute GARBAGE!!!,"This has got to be so far the WORST in the series. I am split on this and Alien 3 on which one is worse. First of all there is a cat. I hate cats, deal with it! 2nd is Bill Paxtons WORST role in film. I cannot believe they made an embarrassment of the talent he has in this film. It is one of the cheesiest scifi movies I have EVER seen and I refuse to add it with my blu ray collection. The whole time I watched this I was hoping the cat would get eaten by an alien but nope! The acting was so cheesy I thought I was watching a low budget scifi film the whole time. This installment is pure trash and is def on my top 10 horrible films of all time! Save your brain and eyes from absorbing this terrible peice of cinema. I am so glad I didn't catch this in theaters as I would demand a refund. All copies of this should be burned and I would rather watch the Star Wars holiday special than endure the time I lost of my life watching this. What on earth was James Cameron thinking!!!!?",
1178,25 March 1999,pearseandpearse,9, This is the greatest action movie ever,"As the summary says, this triumph for James Cameron beats all other action movies to a pulp. You could argue that the movie has its corny and hackneyed downside, but this adds to the fun. Despite being enjoyably violent and quite tense in parts, it's the humor of the film that will stick with me. Check out Bill Paxton's hilariously dorky Private Hudson - ""Hey sir, you'll get lip cancer smoking those"". Apart from the humor, the film boasts some great performances, most notably Sigourney Weaver as Lieutenant Ripley and Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop (Don't miss that knife trick he does). More than 11 years before he won the Oscar for Titanic, James Cameron really proved his directorial talent with this. He shows some great touches in the battle scenes, especially where he uses the marines' shoulder cameras to view the action. If you haven't seen this movie before, you should hang your head in shame for 5 minutes, and then immediately go out and rent it",

Where to begin, I think this film has everything, great special effects, great actors and script, even now after 20 years the film looks amazing, to be honest I don't think Hollywood will ever produce an 18 rated film of this calibre, although CGI effects look good there still not as convincing as models or guys in suits, however stupid that sounds! this film follows on where Alien left off but with James Cameron directing it offers a lot more action than Alien, of which I am an admirer but feel it is no where near as good a film as its sequel.",

1185,20 November 2001,dj001k,9," in space, no one can hear you say what a great movie this is","""Aliens"" is without a doubt one of the greatest sequels of all time. Not just because it's a great movie, but because it displays such unique synergy with the orignal. Most sequels of the sci-fi/action genre tend to just repeat the success of the preceding film, but ""Aliens"" puts a new spin on the adventures of Ellen Ripley, taking her from a haunted house to the Vietnam War. The action in the movie is non-stop from the moment the marines land, and could be exhausting to the audience if it were made by a lesser talent. However, it is executed so masterfully by director James Cameron that the suspense is never tiring or dulled. The sets and effects are a marvel, and the Alien Queen, designed by Cameron, is just as frightening and intriguing as the orignal alien designed by H.R. Gieger. The best action movie ever by far.",
