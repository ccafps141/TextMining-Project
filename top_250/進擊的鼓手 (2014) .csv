0,2 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,10, Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece.,"I don't say that often, in fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever. It's a masterpiece. End of review.",/
1,18 July 2015,planktonrules,9, This is review #572....so is there really any need to say more?!,"""Whiplash"" is a terrific film...no doubt about that. Normally, I'd spend several paragraphs talking about how great it is except that I am the 572nd review and many people have already gone on and on about what a terrific film it is....so what can I add?! It's the 40th highest rated film on IMDb after all! ",r
2,23 October 2014,Sergeant_Tibbs,10, An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.,"Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. ",e

10,27 September 2014,ClaytonDavis,9, A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection...,"When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama ""Whiplash."" An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' ""Captain Phillips,"" coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns.",5

I am not a musician but I've seen movies based on things I know very well and it's always exaggerated and unrealistic and it usually bugs me more than other people; I can easily imagine how real musicians may dislike this one.
The directing and acting are great (although J.K. Simmons steals the whole show) as are cinematography and sound. However the whole premise is wildly unrealistic, and the moral of the story ""to be great you need to be pushed beyond your limits"" is a tired trope that has often been done in a better way than here.

The genre primarily glorified stereotypical ""criminal"" behavior in black neighborhoods. Now with Damien Chazelle's, 'Whiplash', he's invented a new genre primarily for a large coterie of Caucasian males: 'Jazzploitation', set in an elite jazz program at a Julliard-like school of higher musical instruction.

21,19 October 2014,billygoat1071,10, Bleeding Passion,"People may quickly picture Whiplash as the Full Metal Jacket of jazz band: there's Fletcher militarily pushing his student, Andrew, to get his task right. The hatred towards the mentor becomes the character's motivation of achieving his orders perfectly; and the similarities could end there. Although this is a very different context; the harsh, shout-y discipline and sometimes its negative human effects are quite reminiscent. But without any grim twists, this movie just sticks directly to one's determination of being successful to his job, either for the instructor or for himself. This is one rough environment that takes you to a relentless study of intense rehearsals and intense discipline until it reaches to the point where their goals lose out of control. And just like those sequences, Whiplash keeps most of the viewers from their comfort zone, and leads them to rewarding results.",f
22,30 March 2021,technicallytyguy,9, Extremely powerful but too intense,"I really do love this movie. It is powerful in the main character's overwhelming passion and drive to become the greatest drummer to ever live. I really do have an issue with the message though. The extreme levels of intensity that the music instructor Fletcher uses really does more harm than good for Andrew. He breaks up with his girlfriend, almost dies in a car accident, and gets obsessed in his single minded pursuit of perfection. It is an extremely interesting character portrait, but I don't think that it brings along a necessarily good message, but it is definitely a powerful one. It does bring along an extremely important psychological question: should you let your passion drive you to the brink of insanity in order to achieve your goals?",_

You have to go the extra mile and work like a dog until you become the master of your domain. (apologies to Seinfeld). Miles Teller is a young drummer who wants to be the next Gene Krupa or RIngo Starr. Good luck with that idea. J. K Simmons tells him, no problem; all you have to do is sacrifice yourself on the altar of unrelenting practice, practice, practice. Play until you bleed, baby. And that is all there is to it; much easier said than done, however. We see the trials and self-doubts of the young Andrew, and the fierce determination of Terrence Fletcher, as he tries to make a star out of Andrew, despite having been a never-was himself.

Actor Miles Teller was recently named as one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch and J.K. Simmons, well, he's J.K. freakin' Simmons.

27,10 August 2015,lee_eisenberg,10, music and obsession,"J. K. Simmons has played a number of stern, demanding characters during his career. But he gets the role of a lifetime in Damien Chazelle's ""Whiplash"". He plays the brutal instructor of a college jazz band. This man resorts to methods that lapse into abuse. In showing these overly aggressive teaching methods, the movie poses the question of what is the right thing to do when encouraging students to succeed. Brutality is understood to be the only choice when readying cadets for a war zone, but when teaching college students how to play jazz? Simmons won a well deserved Oscar for his performance. Although it was for Best Supporting Actor, the movie belongs to him. Miles Teller's performance as the student is truly secondary to Simmons. His character is one of only a few movie characters in history who made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells.",u

30,20 June 2015,plex,4, Stupid and Improbable story.,"Well acted? Sure. Decent directing and production values- yep! Plausible or realistic storyline? Not at all. There is no Shaffer Conservatory. Berklee College of Music in Boston used to be heavy on big-band jazz, but now the school has become far more vocational. None of the conservatory's I am aware of feature jazz as a curriculum, and if they did, it certainly would not be a major. No music professor in the USA would have a job if they behaved the way Fletcher does, and more to the point, no JAZZER would ever behave this way under any circumstances. Jazzers are not confrontational or competitive, that would contradict everything they stand for. The way the other musician behaved and talked in this film is not even remotely accurate AT ALL. Real musicians in REAL life, ESPECIALLY JAZZERS, are brotherly. A professor would never come into another professor's class and take over, would never physically abuse a student or yell at them this way ( with intense profanity, humiliation, and gender-insensitivity). A teacher wouldn't come in and insult the entire ensemble EVER. They would never audition them in the manner Fletcher does. They would never focus so much on the drummer, nor would they put so much emphasis on a stupid and pointless competition. The JVC Jazz festival, like any other jazz festival, does not have label-people attending to scout for new talent like baseball scouts. Labels are overrun with demo tapes and web links to downloads, and his remark that if you screw up they will remember you for the expressed purpose of denying you a deal is absolutely inane.I have NEVER seen a drummer get bloody hands just from playing fast: a stick only weighs about 2 ounces and is very smooth. Oh BTW, drummers never share sticks. Sticks are very personal, and ALL drummers, in a music program, carry a stick bag with them like a woman carries a purse. I have never seen ""alternate"" drummers in an ensemble or page turners for drummer. Big-band rehearsals at 9AM? Are they joking? You'd never get that many musicians to be at class that early and behave like soldiers in bootcamp, NO WAY! Are we to believe that Andrew get tossed from school, before Fletcher, because he messed up playing a song in a competition? Seriously? Even though he was bloody from a car accident? Maybe if this imaginary tale took place in hell, it would have slightly more credibility. Hollyweird NEVER portrays musicians accurately in a feature film. This is not a powerful movie, it doesn't make a point or carry any type of profound message and it doesn't portray musicians or music-schools with an accuracy at all. Im sure its fooled a lot of lay-people.",
31,26 January 2015,jake_fantom,1," Moronic, pointless, and full of crap","If you are a believer in the clichéd notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clichés, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical cliché that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.",

36,22 April 2015,ironhorse_iv,9, This is one compelling drama about the relentless pursuit of perfection. You can't beat that!,"Do you know why I just hurled a chair at you? It's because you haven't, saw this movie, yet! Watch it, and then come back here. Written & directed by Damien Chazelle, and based on his 2013 short film, 'Whiplash', which in return based off, Damien's experiences in the Princeton High School Studio Band. The movie tells the story between an ambitious jazz student, Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) and his abusive, yet driven- instructor, Terence Fletcher (J.K Simmons), as both work together, to see if Andrew, has the guts to be the next big drummer. Without spoiling too much of the film, I found it to be, a very gripping competitive movie. The theme dealing surrounding the cost of perfection is extensive and relatable. I never knew that, trying to be in a top Jazz orchestra was going to be so tough! Both, Miles Teller & J.K Simmons's acting, was top of their game. I'm pretty glad, that both, got a lot of praise from critics. I know, a lot of people would love to see Johnny Simmons reprise his role, from the short film, Whiplash, but Miles Teller does a good job, showing how driven, the character is. Some of the bloody hands scenes were really his own blood, due to him, playing too fast. I'm also, pretty happy to see that J.K Simmons got awarded, for his work in this film. He wasn't injury, free, too. He got two cracked ribs when Miles Teller tackled him during the last two days of shooting. Simmons managed to continue working despite his injury. He deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars in 2014, just for that. Fletcher saying ""Not my tempo."" very frequently, was very sinister. The only criticize, that I can find, about J.K Simmons's performance is how basic, it was. In, a way, it felt like, any other J.K Simmons's performance, just more grounded, and not, over the top angry in a cartoony way, like his role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman films (2002-2007). Other than that, it's hard to pinpoint, anything wrong with their performances. I know, a lot of people have accused the film of distorting jazz history and promoting a misleading idea of wunderkind. I found, those critics to be a bit nitpicking. I do, agree with them, that the movie doesn't put Jazz in a good light. None of the music, they used, didn't stand out. I was hoping for more. One thing that the movie could have, work on, is, getting a better supporting cast. I found, both Paul Reiser & Melissa Benoist co-starring as the student's father and love interest respectively kinda disappointing and forgettable. I know, the movie doesn't give, them, too much time and focus, but they should have, stood out, more, with the little time, they got. I really found both of them, jarring in how overacting, they were, in the small amount of scenes with Andrew. I guess, it was there to flesh out Andrew's character, but was any of their scenes, really that necessary? I found it, a bit unbelievable for Melissa Benoist's character to be, that upset with Miles Teller's character, after only one date. Both, didn't have that much of a connection, in the first place and Andrew didn't really treat her, right. Despite that shortcoming, the movie pacing is pretty well-rounded. I really didn't get bored with any of the sequences. It had really good film editing. I know that no words in the English language are more dangerous than 'good job, but I think, Damien Chazelle did a good job. I found it, very interesting, that Chazelle continue to work, after being involved in a serious car accident in the third week of film shooting. I give him, mad props on completing this film. I love the close shots of the blood, sweat and tears of the drummers. It makes the movie so much, more intense, than it should be. Very memorable scenes. The language is harsh and offensive. Lots of gay bashing and racist quotes. I don't recommended, watching this film, if you are a person that easily gets offended. It's remind me of two films, 1987's Full Metal Jacket mixed with 2010's Black Swan, in the way, Whiplash's story delivers. Whiplash challenges it's viewers to think, with its social commentary. Whiplash criticize, the soften approach to education, where the beliefs states that students deserve acknowledgement. It doesn't want that fantasy cult of mediocrity. It wants to bring back the harsh realistic of competitive, where one success, and the others, don't. The argument that the movie brings about coddling several generations of young people, to the point, that they're ill-prepared for the harsh workplace has its merit. In a way, while, Terence Fletcher might seem like the villain. It's very unclear if Fletcher, truly is. Many of his scenes are very inspiring, and many of his other scenes are just borderline, bullying. He's not clear-cut, and that's what I love, about this movie. The conclusion of the film, might be a bit, bittersweet. Some people might hate it, because it's seem like the Fletcher's extreme effective won out in the end and the glorification of Bullying seem right; while other might believe that Andrew out-best him out and challenge himself to fight against bullying. It's really very much open debate. Overall: Whiplash is a refreshing, heart-pounding, highly engaging film of obsession and art. I do recommended watching. It's in my tempo.",

48,25 February 2015,PWNYCNY,10, The pathway to perfection is not an easy road to travel.,"There are many reasons to dislike this movie. It shows a teenager being psychologically and physically abused. It shows art being portrayed as something painful. It shows someone abusing his authority. It shows the collapse of a romantic relationship, causing deeply hurt feelings. The story in general comes off as being contrived. Yet, this movie is great. It is highly entertaining, the reason being its theme: what is an artist supposed to do to satisfy his quest for perfection? In this case, the metaphor for perfection is Buddy Rich, who was a famous American jazz drummer. In this movie, Rich's work is used as a standard for artistic perfection, in this case, artistic expression through the playing of percussion instruments. The structure of the plot is simple: a music teacher, Fletcher, wants to bring out the brilliance of his student, Andrew. He believes that the best way to accomplish this through humiliation which will test the level of the student's commitment to achieving greatness and perfection. The student becomes the tool through which the teacher can vicariously achieve perfection. For this story is about the teacher. He is the principal character, the one around whom the action takes place. The teacher is a metaphor for all the artists in the world who are striving for something that they themselves cannot achieve, and so seek it out in others. To bring it out is the challenge, and that generates conflict, as the teacher must first break down the student's resistance, which is a painful and risky process. Painful because it involves elements of abuse; risky because he may lose the student. The acting is superb. J. K. Simmons's gives a terrifically powerful performance as the teacher, Fletcher, and Miles Teller gives a tremendous performance as the student, Andrew. The story moves at a brisk pace and achieves moments of extreme intensity that alone make the movie worth watching. True, the movie includes brief but graphic scenes of physical violence perpetrated against a teenager, but this takes place within the context of an extremely emotional and volatile relationship which drives the story, and without which the story may lose some of it strength.",

I expected John Candy or Martin Short to come out at any second throughout the entire movie. Now I know why musicians and music students are making fun of this movie all over the US. I was a HS music teacher for more than 15 years, and a professional musician my entire life, and I've never seen a funnier movie about music in my entire life. The only one that came close to this was Ken Russell's version of ""Tommy"", but Whiplash took itself much more seriously than Tommy did. People are getting more and more brainless about music every day (especially jazz), so it didn't surprise me that many people thought this was a good movie. I guess I'm not as angry about how bad this piece of garbage was compared to the other people that gave it a bad review, because I waited for it to come out on DVD, and didn't waste a lot of money seeing it in a theater.

The writing is good, not great but is suitable for this movie, everything slots perfectly into place and flows very nicely with plenty of twists. My only negative about this is the ending, it wasn't a bad ending at all I just wish I got to see more of it, I wanted to see what happened...but it does make it different from other movies that would continue and feel very cliché. 9/10 great movie, you don't even have to like jazz music to enjoy this movie!",

If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to 'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient state of mind, that is simply following orders.

I'm not a musician and I don't even like Jazz, but I'm sure no music school would employ or tolerate a teacher like Fletcher. People would report him much sooner than it is portrayed in the movie. There are other scenes that discredit this film. For instance, when Andrew, the student, has the auto accident, he walks away from it with hardly any injury (although the car overturned) and makes it just in time to the music hall for the concert. Yeah, give me a break! Fletcher is a sadistic prick, but we are supposed to believe he is moved to tears when he talks about a former student who killed himself? Total nonsense! What really irritated me is that the Fletcher character is so surreal and disgusting, and that Andrew, the student, is so obsessed. Any normal person would have quit or at least reported the teacher, but no, we have to endure this ""drama"" until the ""glorious"" end.

The film is an intense exploration of drive and ambition: it juxtaposes the comfort of mediocrity with the insanity and suffering which comes with the attempt to achieve the extraordinary. Miles Teller brilliantly plays the impressionable ingenue, who is willing to do anything to succeed as a musician. JK Simmons is possibly even more brilliant in the showier role of the mentor that will test his pupil to the absolute limit. Clearly inspired by iconic films such as Powell and Pressburger's ""The Red Shoes"" and Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", the director, Damien Chazelle, has Simmons excude menace and testosterone as he attempts to crush and remold his musical recruits (and his band literally are recruited, watch the film, you'll see what I mean). The script is witty and caustic and the film's depictions of extreme devotion to craft will make you wince and squirm but if you have the stomach to keep watching, you will witness a brilliant character study in which the power struggle between mentor and mentee becomes unexpectedly much less than one-sided. The film's brilliance, aside from some dazzling close-up camera-work and brilliant acting, is that it does not moralise or take sides, it shows us something profound, something rare, something utterly compelling: two human beings' capacity for self-sacrifice and discipline in the pursuit of an ideal. And just when you think its characters can't go any further, they reveal that they're only just getting started.",

Some had to be hospitalized and developed symptoms that debilitated them for life. One of the trombone players lost his front teeth when the instructor threw a metal chair at him, complaining that he wasn't in tune. Later, he told us he was only kidding, and that if the trombonist didn't know he wasn't in tune then he deserved it. Nobody ever thought they were out of tune again because they didn't want their teeth knocked out. One day he threw a cymbal at one of the alto sax players and cut into his thigh, severing an artery. He was later hospitalized and still has a limp. The instructor said he did it because he heard Charlie Parker was named ""Bird"" because he had a cymbal thrown at him, which makes no sense to me but what do you expect from a psychotic band instructor? He swore like a sailor too. I later found out he was in rehab for methamphetamine abuse. I'm so glad I gave up the trumpet. The heck with a music career, those people are crazy.",

Simmons here and this is a film that had me riveted from beginning to end, but I shudder at its message. The fact is, you don't need to be an abusive, homophobic, racist a$$hole and drive those you're teaching to the edge of the abyss to elicit greatness. There are plenty of examples in the world of sports that bear that out, e.g. John Wooden, Bill Walsh, Joe Torre, and Steve Kerr. That's been my experience in other realms as well, like teaching and the workplace, and I'm sure that in the world of music, it's the same. The damage caused to kids by this kind of person, a hard-a$$ wannabe who is really nothing more than a bully, is incalculable, and the film doesn't do justice to that aspect. The fact that this kid (Miles Teller) gets redemption is wonderful; that Simmons's character does is not, in fact, it's more than a little disturbing. The abuser gets to explain himself, show that he's really not such a bad guy, and in the end triumph. How much better would this have been had the kid found a genuine connection to music or his path in life after getting out of that abusive relationship, and we had seen the teacher living in ignominy? Also, since when is jazz about ratcheting up speed to the point of bleeding all over the instrument?

In such an environment any musician would get so tense and so full of fear to fail, he would certainly do exactly that. This is not how musicality and technique is teached. Never. Music is not sports. What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise like a computer. But the music that comes out that way will sound alike. People in music are sensitive.

The story walks you through a jazz class with a Drill Sergeant for a teacher that physically and verbally abuses his student in the name of greatness. The key message is being supportive, respectful and compassionate will get you nowhere. Hitting, abusing and destroying people will make your great! Hollywood for years has been advocating against bullying and now they give not one but three Oscar to a movie that glorifies Bullying??!! I was dumbfounded and sad. Yes, the performance s are great and the actors are very good, but no degree of acting should justify glorifying this method of teaching. What I hated most was that the movie made me like Jazz less. If this is what it takes to have great Jazz musicians then we do not need Jazz. Just to be clear. Hitting, screaming, psychological warfare, abuse and negativity DO not create great people or better musicians. They create abusive, disrespectful human beings that will continue the hate and the abuse. No wonder suicide rates for young people are high; if you are not good enough you are not worth playing, studying, living, etc. Just kill yourself. A very bad message to kids, students and teachers.

75,26 March 2015,Screen_Blitz,9," It is an intense, powerful, and electrifying work of art","Damien Chazelle's Whiplash represents arguably one of the most exhilarating cinematic endeavors in the music genre in recent memory, let alone one by a man making his directorial debut. It is a music-themed that takes on the daunting task of delivering a feverishly thrilling atmosphere not from the emotional resonance of its music, but its bold psychological tone that proceeds its heart- rending story. By Chazelle's thoughtful direction and the uncompromising performances by actors Miles Teller and J.K Simmons, this film doesn't just achieves this task, it embraces. The story here is not one of your battle-of-the-bands tales involving a band or a solo musician shooting for the stars, it is a story concerning the complex and thought-provoking relationship between a young musician and his mentor. And it is one that hits hard in ways that a very few would expect. This film follows Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller), an inspired drummer who enrolls in a local music conservatory where he joins a jazz band conducted by the talented, but maniacal Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is most certainly not a kind-hearted mentor, he is abusive towards his band and holds no bars when splashing his band with an severely ill temper each time one of them makes a mistake. Upon joining the band, Andrew suffers under Fletcher's mental abuse to pushing him to the limits, but at the same time, inspires the immersive talent he never knew he had. ",
76,28 March 2015,ilikeimdb,2, I really disliked this movie,"I didn't ""enjoy"" this movie though I don't fault the fine acting. Movies successfully pitch an alternate reality when internal consistencies makes the unbelievable believable. In the movie The Matrix, as in many Sci-Fi flicks, the director establishes environmental rules and all the characters operate within that framework. My objections to Whiplash focus on its extreme examples of behavior which are so extreme as to make them conspicuously inconsistent with the movie's time and place. Those extremes strain the credulity of nearly every key player. ",

I really wished the kid would have succeeded in spite of Fletcher and showed him that his methods only cause irreversible damage and sometimes even death. Abuse is not the way to make talent (artistic or otherwise) blossom - McCartney, Spielberg, Federer, Bach, Evert, Picasso, Da Vinci - there are countless examples of genius without without abuse.

I can still enjoy a bad horror B-movie, but certainly not this. I did not agree with Fletcher's teaching methods, as it was total abuse. This movie should be used as educational material for methods teachers should NOT use. It was disgusting - to say the least - how he treated and spoke to the youngsters. In fact, so much so it should be considered a crime. There was not a single moment of the film I enjoyed. On the contrary, this horrible movie is one of the most hated films I've ever seen.

Is the only way to achieve perfection by humiliating students with verbal and physical abuse? The drumming was excellent. I'm a musician and I've never heard of students bleeding all over their drums. It's ridiculous. The only thing JK Simmons' character cared about was tempo. Talk about unidimensional. He crucified students only if they couldn't determine his tempo after a few beats. What about dynamics? What about interacting with the band? The script was superficial and lacking.

He has awesome ability which is recognized by Fletcher (Academy Award winner J. K. Simmons). His method involves brutalizing and horrifying his charges and humiliating them in front of their peers. People know he's the best there is, but what a price to pay. He justifies his intensity by repeating some incident where another band member threw cymbal at Charlie Parker's head. While this is good entertainment, if we were to look into the successes of many great performers, most of them were never terrorized. The drumwork is astounding, but all the bleeding is pretty far fetched. Ask some drummers you know. The final scene is all Hollywood as most reality goes out the window.

He reduces all of drumming to ""that's not my tempo"", thereby dumbing down the entire art form into a click track, meanwhile, revealing no insight into what it actually means to play the drums, or be a musician. The film won an Oscar for best editing, although, throughout the film, the drumming that you hear, and what you see being played by the unlikeable lead actor, do not match, and in the finale, the overhead shots obviously reveal that it is not the actor, but rather a stand-in musician. Both lead characters are unlikeable and actually ridiculous. Everything about the movie rings hollow, and, worst of all, false.

When it's pointed out that Parker had a short life of addiction and pain, Neiman says that maybe it's better to have fame and die young than live a long life and be forgotten. It's one of the many nutty but interesting things in this film, which has a great script, tight direction and great acting. It isn't afraid to go over the top, and interestingly, the story continues well after the film's climax, but it works. You get the feeling that many real-life elite artists and their teachers have some sort of mental condition, in pursuing perfection to an extraordinary degree while ignoring their own health and welfare. The scene where Neiman breaks up with his lovely girlfriend, because having a relationship would affect his drumming, is priceless.

After all, there are all those raving reviews and blazing cheers made to this spectacular piece of cinematography. Well, yes, I have watched it, and what I can say? It is very over-rated. Yes, both Simmons and Teller seem to give very impressive performances, and yes, Teller is A Good drummer with neat stroke, precise beat, gentle swing and delicate accents. But then, he does not convince as an actor. The love story is the biggest disappointment and the greatest weakness of the film. It simply passes by. leaving me cold and unaffected. Was that dubious drumming achievement worth losing a beautiful girl? It was not. Simmons is surely the crowning top of the production, but then, he is too sadistic, too dry, too pedantic or a jazz aficionado, he seems more like a drill sergeant than a genial conductor. The final solo? To long and too drawn out for a satisfying coda. Kinda cool, but tiresome and yup, dragging. It is a film for a single watch and quick oblivion.",

Throughout human history, drummers have been tapped to march soldiers to their deaths. The executioner's cue always has been the drum roll.

WHIPLASH shows Andrew on one such occasion speeding 80 mph in a 25 mph school zone, causing a horrific multi-vehicle crash. Fortunately, ""Nicole""--Andrew's short-term girlfriend--wises up and ditches him for a normal guy. I've personally hung out with marching band types all my life (as they make better conversation than the rest of the people around here, who've suffered countless concussions playing with their pigskins). Band folks are great pals, except drummers. The only drummer 99% of Americans can name is Ringo Starr, who is considered the ""black sheep"" of the Beatles.

Read it at your own leisure.","This erosion of innocent ideas, like The American Dream, is becoming more and more prominent, especially amongst young people. The success of Damien Chazelle's, Whiplash, is a testament to this. Miles Teller stars as Andrew Neiman, an obsessive drummer who is hell- bent on becoming a great musician. J.K. Simmons stars as Terence Fletcher, the muscled up old teacher who incessantly yells at Andrew and perpetuates his inferiority complex. A large number of High School and University students found this movie to be scarily relatable. Whether it was the memory of an intimating teacher/mentor, or the shared belief that socializing, relationships and 'fun', will impede on one's ability to achieve some kind of success – audiences clearly empathize with this film, and that may not be a good thing.",

Here's IMDb's synopsis of the film: ""A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential."" This film, however, is about a bully music teacher who insults, assaults, slaps, degrades, and humiliates his students to death. Literally. This film is realistic only in the sense that it depicts the catastrophic effects bullying can have on people's well-being. Everything else in the film would simply not happen. Other reviewers, with music knowledge, have explained why such music institutions and teaching practices and methods are implausible, nowadays. I am a psychologist and I can verify that bullying will not and cannot motivate a person to become greater. Peoples' potentials are most likely to be crushed as a consequence of bullying. Victims of bullying do not easily ""overcome"" or ""harden up"" to become better human beings. Moreover, victims of bullying tend to become bullies themselves, later on in life. So, I would claim that this is a film about the making of a bully.",

But it's fiction, and in that vein every single moment of the film is of course exaggerated for heightened tension. Oscar winner JK Simmons gives the performance of a lifetime as the brutal, cruel and authoritative jazz instructor who pushes his students to the limit and then some. It's a truly chilling character who gets equal parts of assistance and obstruction from the screenplay. Fletcher's frightful tirades are punctuated with moments of genuine kindness and humanity: playful anecdotes, saying hello to a little girl, playing soft jazz piano. Even more important is his reaction to one of his star pupil's deaths; a chilling realisation at the twist of the cause paints him in a very different light. But this stop start characterisation just sets up the audience for the inevitable foul-mouthed blow-up as contrivance after contrivance sees Andrew fail. ",

The idea of the film is great, sort of like a very extreme 'Glee' or 'Fame', but I think that it is actually a bit too extreme. Their are times where I feel that Fletcher should have seen what he was doing and laid off a bit. His behaviour was so abhorrent, even without these moments, that his teaching practices should have been called in to question anyway.

In the brutal world Chazelle crafts in this film, you need to pay a price for your dreams to come true (Chazelle's La La Land has a similar theme). Not only do we see the toll Andrew's pursuits of being a great drummer have on him, but also on his relationship with those around him given his alienation of some of his family or how he cuts off his contacts with someone who may have gotten in the way of his dream. Also, even though Fletcher's teaching strategies technically work, the film simultaneously acknowledges the downsides to them given what we learn about Sean Casey and how some of Fletcher's students leave his program. In spite of the darker bits though, the movie also manages to be a lot of fun. The jazz concerts are both well-shot and edited, with the standout being the technically outstanding ending which dropped my jaw when I first watched it back in 2014. Finally, J. K. Simmons does a terrific job in this film. He's electrifying when he teaches the band and equally compelling in his quieter scenes, with the standout being his conversation with Andrew about Charlie Parker.",

I've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. So they figured I would relate. Sorry, this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks Kenny G is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. First of all, no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals Terence ran, he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do, apparently this school didn't have tenure). And next, jazz is communication, conversation, thoughtfulness, and a big dollop of joyful soul. Any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company, nobody appreciates that. This is the 21st Century equivalent of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland saying, ""I know, let's build a show to save the town!"" as a representation of Show Biz. it's Hollywood hokum, folks, and I resented its basic assumptions. Where is the Soul? That said, J.K. Simmons is great, working with what he's got. And the cinematography and editing are well done (what IS all that water on the cymbals we see so often? Sweat? If Elvin Jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! Oh well.) which is why I grudgingly added two stars to this. It's been a while since I so disliked a film.

139,16 November 2014,zetes,9, Fantastic,"A musical thriller? This one's hard to categorize. One might say it's the exact opposite of an inspirational teacher movie, like Goodbye Mr. Chips. Miles Teller plays an eager drumming student at a music conservatory. He captures the attention of the head honcho of the school's peak band crew, J.K. Simmons. A normal person would wish they hadn't, because the guy's a total psycho. One wrong note or beat and the guy'll be roaring every curse word in the book at you. He's a legend, though, so no one would ever dare stand up to him. Teller is not a normal person - his dream is to be one of the best of all time, so he tries his damnedest to take Simmons' rage in stride. It's not easy. This film is simply gripping. Teller is amazingly focused. One ought not to disregard his physical performance, either. While the editing probably helped him survive this, he really is going to town on those drums. Simmons gives a performance for the ages. I wanted to murder this dude. As a supporting character, the film doesn't get too deeply into what his deal is, but the little bits that are shown are fascinating. The finale is absolutely outstanding.

I'm pretty sure this is one of those philosophical, personal-growth essays cleverly disguised as a real story, but it's not only inaccurate about personal growth and learning, but about music school and jazz in particular - insultingly so - it assumes that Bobby Knight tactics work in a teaching environment.
I'm giving it the rating for very specific reasons - starting with one, because that's the least I can give it, and adding one of J.K. Simmons, just because. I'll add one more for Miles Teller, who did his best at a script of abuse, bullying and justified sadism.

This film was absolutely brilliant. It's about jazz drumming and its probably one of the most intense films I've ever seen. Go figure. Both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons delivered incredible performances. I don't know how much of Miles Teller's drumming was real, but from what I saw, it was mostly real and ridiculously impressive at that. I really felt like he was the next Buddy Rich at some points. J.K. Simmons outdoes himself here. He even beats his performance as J. Jonah Jameson from the original Spiderman movies. He plays a seriously hardcore jazz teacher who really reminded me of that drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket. Every second he's on screen, you can't look away. Probably a career best for him. The music is amazing as well. The level of effort that appeared to have gone into the soundtrack is highly respectable.

Characteristically, Fletcher says, ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'"" The Hank Levy tune ""Whiplash"" is the rack of a tune upon which the drummers in Fletcher's jazz band are broken. Here's a movie where I really felt the tension—it made me clench my fists to the point where my hands, too, were almost bleeding. The playing of the drums enters your skull, and your heart must keep time.",

It's a movie about an abusive teacher and an obsessively self-destructive student, that uses the world of jazz music as a contrivance.

It's an interesting notion. The answer sadly for 99.9% of people would still be no, but what's to stop them trying? Was the character in the movie ever going to be one of the greatest of all time? That's up for the viewer to decide but it doesn't even really matter. What matters is that he had both the person to drive him and also the capability to devote himself to it.

He wants to be and remain the best, at least he wants his band to be and remain the best, at least even more he wants his reputation to remain the best. To do that he must constantly recruit new musicians arriving in the school and he must train them and that's where the gist lies (both ""is situated"" and ""tells a lie,"" the two ""giving the lie to Fletcher""). Fletcher is a terror, absolutely feared to the point of total psychological deconstruction because he demands absolute submission to his own judgment and his own judgment is only targeting his sole objective: bring the daemonic genius out of the student for his (Fletcher's) sole interest.",

173,15 March 2015,pc95,7, Obsessive and Vigorous,"(spoilers) ""Whiplash"", directed by Damien Chazelle, is another movie about a character with an obsession. It begs for comparisons to ""Black Swan"" from a few years ago. Where Black Swan was a hallucinatory, depressive, and obsessed trip into misfortune, Whiplash plays it mostly straight with the main character more in control, and a decidedly positive and redemptive ending. Whiplash then doesn't carry the punch as strongly perhaps, though it does have the same drive. It is a great watch, with Miles Teller character unable to stop his drive and obsession until flirting with near death and a car accident brought upon by misfortune and bad luck. You can identify his drive and feel the ferocity of it fanned by J K Simmons character, a legendary drummer and ""drill sergeant"" crossing the line into abusiveness. The obsession to succeed and exceed here becomes a drug, intoxicating and addicting, much like in Black Swan. Simmons rightly wins supporting actor award in this movie; he is a reminiscent of Louis Gosset Jr's Emil Foley in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" in performance level. He is feared as he is respected, and he is a bully with a purpose such that the means justifies the ends. I enjoyed this strong movie. 7.5/10",

I expected much more from this movie. Maybe it's because of my natural distaste for Jazz music. It's really a genre of music I almost never enjoy. In Whiplash you get repetitive parts of songs that I particularly don't like at all. And then to have to listen to them over and over again is a bit too much for me. On the other hand the acting was good. The battle between student Miles Teller and teacher J.K. Simmons is interesting to watch. I can understand that sometimes you have to push somebody to let him reach his best level but in this case it's just bullying. So maybe if it was an other genre of music (like Metal or so) that I would have liked Whiplash. But it isn't so to me it's just a movie you watch once and then forget about it.,

187,5 October 2014,trublu215,8, JK Simmons is the ONLY reason to see this,"Whiplash chronicles a jazz drummer's tumultuous relationship with a volatile instructor. While this is well acted and shot beautifully, Whiplash fails to catapult itself to greatness with bogging down its story with rather wooden supporting characters and a slow as molasses storyline. Whiplash tells the story of Andrew, a jazz drummer coming into a cutthroat art school and his instructor, Terrence Fletcher, an off the wall and emotionally abusive instructor. The strengths of Whiplash lie solely in the hands of J.K. Simmons. Simmons delivers a tour de force performance, turning a fiery rage into something inspiring for our lead, Miles Teller. Simmons has some truly great scenes, spouting off profanity laced rants when trying to bring out the best in Andrew. The scenes with Simmons send the film into overdrive, making you want to know what happens next. However, this feeling of excellence on screen quickly turns into boredom as we see Miles Teller try to captivate us the same way his co-star did and falters. At the end of it all, this comes down to talent. J.K. Simmons sets a high bar for his co-stars, and this actually ends up hurting the film because of his performance. Miles Teller seems as if he can't keep up in scenes with Simmons and rather than captivating us with his relentless drumming until his blood hits the sweat filled drum kit, it actually ends up feeling as if he is trying too hard to top his co-star in regards to intensity. This creates for an uneven film, one that never truly becomes the masterpiece it wants to be. Despite these lesser qualities, Whiplash does feature some truly great scenes of Simmons berating his students with some of the best delivered insults this side of Full Metal Jacket. Damien Chazelle does showcase his talents, lingering on the physical and emotional tolls that the environment takes on Andrew and other students. Despite this quality, Chazelle fails to connect his characters to his audience. But one thing that won't be lost in translation is where these characters are and how competitive it is. Quite honestly, I feel this worked better as a short film. There is simply not enough for audiences to latch on to or enough for them to care about. But one thing is for sure, J.K. Simmons is ON FIRE in this film and delivers one of the best performances of his career.",

Simmons was an absolute terror, well deserved Oscar win and the music was great as well. However I think the film would have benefited if it was a bit longer, the story is compelling but it never dwells enough on the pain of the protagonist. 107 minutes is a tad bit less if complex emotions are to be shown, in the immortal words of J.K. Simmons, it's rushing and not quite my tempo. Almost all films this season handled the drama aspect better than Whiplash, The Theory of Everything and Foxcatcher both showed the pain and moral dilemma better albeit both being inferior movies to Whiplash. At the same time Birdman and The Imitation Game not only showed better drama but in my opinion are better films because it just felt more appealing to a person of my age compared to Whiplash which seems to aim at younger college going audience, also it's a bit one dimensional even if that one dimension is excellent.

I joined IMDb in 2003 and became active more or less immediately so now we can factor in another figure, two and a half thousand films in eleven years. but we're still miles off because I was already an adult when I joined IMDb. I was probably carried into my first cinema by one or both of my parents around the age of three and by age five I was able to distinguish genres, actors, etc. By ten I had - for a layman - a pretty good working knowledge of how the things worked. I watched most stuff and good distinguish between Warners, Fox, Metro, Columbia, Paramount, RKO etc, with the best of them. I had little taste for horror, sci-fi. didn't mind the occasional Western but was more at home with mellers, straight drama, comedies, musicals, bio-pics if they dealt with songwriters (Night And Day), performers, (The Jolson Story) or , peripherally, jazz (The Benny Goodman Story, High Society). By the time I penned my first review for IMDb in 2003 I had seen, conservatively, some 5,000 films; and yet I've still only reviewed barely half that number. That's because of a self-imposed rule: I don't trust my memory so any and all films I say PRIOR to 2003 are off limits UNLESS they turn up on television, on DVD, or at a Revival House.

It sounds from afar like ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" and, yes, personal breakthroughs are ultimately at stake, but it's precisely here where Chazelle trips up: the film's last third is filled with incredulous incidents that subvert the characters' motivations, especially at the conclusion, where a meeting of the minds effectively undercuts all that went before. And Chazelle's main character is a confusing mess: portrayed as a friendless, defensive loner, he still has no problem approaching the pretty girl (Melissa Benoist) working the concession stand at the local movie house and sparking her interest; he also has no problem dropping her shortly afterwords, rendering the subplot unnecessary.

The lead worked extremely well with his character and quite frankly, I think that's what kept me riveted. Adversity fuels him, exhaustion is merely an obstacle in his path. The actor's nervousness and receptivity is mesmerizing and will entrap you in his world. The camera could have pulled a Lars Von Trier, standing just behind his shoulder and it would have felt the same.",
212,7 January 2015,venom-dushyant,9, Mind-Blowing Jazz Music Harmonising with Some of the Most Amazing Acting,"Miles Teller being an up and coming actor along with JK Simmons who is a well-established underrated actor, whose performances have often been spell-bounding, together have made one of the best movies I've ever seen in the music genre (and I've seen Inside Llewyn Davis). Miles, who plays Andrew, a young drummer studying at one of the top schools of music, shows us his passion in every frame, every single time, whilst delivering a performance. His anger, temper, rise, fall, and everything else in between worked so well with the movie, that he caught my attention with every single frame passing by. As time passes, I am sure he will take the industry by storm along with all the other young up-and-coming actors and actresses. Simmons, who plays Fletcher, delivers a performance worthy of his name. Actually I might actually go ahead and say that this is the best I've ever seen him act. He convinces me completely that Fletcher is an insane perfectionist, so much so that he can forget that the performers were even human, until he gets the beat, tempo and rhythm he needs. Insanity suited his character and he delivered that in an extraordinary fashion. Both the actors showed their passion on screen, but I must give props to the director, who made the film go at the right pace, pushed the actors to show insane amounts of passion, and not allow the audience to divert their attention from these captivating performances. I love jazz music, but don't have much knowledge. But whatever I saw in this movie and heard as well, made me love it even more. Whiplash and Caravan were two genius compositions, and they were so amazingly beautiful. I actually don't know the right adjectives here to help me show how much I loved the score. All the other characters also played their part quite well making this movie one well-rounded show of art. All in all, this is one movie that even the non-jazz lovers will love. If you want passion on screen, you see it delivered in aces.",

I didnt even care about Andrew. Simmons blew him out of the water.,
216,28 March 2016,jean-say-hi,10, Electrifying,"At first it was not the synopsis of the movie that captured my attention but the IMDb score. I thought ""it's just a movie about drumming, how compelling can it be?"". I was an ignorant fool. This movie rocks (or jazzes). From start to end. Your eyes are glued to the screen, you keep guessing what will happen next. I anticipated how the characters would react to one another, not how the story unfolds. The sheer brutality is both refreshing and terrifying. Coming from all characters. They did a splendid job on building original characters. I salute you. It was also an eye-opener for me and my friend. It was enthralling to learn more about the world of orchestras and jazz. Still, it was awesome. A thousand out of ten.",

220,6 April 2022,FilmFinatic062817,10, A story of where passion meets drive,"This film, which I learnt is somewhat biographical, was great, it truly was. Nineteen year old Andrew Niemann wants to be the greatest jazz drummer in the world. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. I thought that a reason that I enjoyed this film so much was because of the editing, it truly and effectively created an atmosphere where the audience would become immersed within the either stressful, tense or calm atmosphere that Niemann was experiencing. J. K Simons plays Terence Fletcher, a conductor with a terrifying thirst to bring the best out of the best in his students. I'm going to say this, he most definitely earned that oscar. His performance was absolutely pertifying, the students cowering away in his presence and fearful of rebelling against him. This film, almost a character study, explores Andrew Niemen's passion and drive to be the greatest drummer of all time and I thought the gradual changes that can be seen were well and truly very well done, it allowed the audience to see where his prior mistakes and the changes he had to make mentally. Furthermore I just want to touch on the sound design, it was amazing and actually led me to listen to some jazz. It was a beautiful culmination of the instruments, the audience slowly realizing the difficulty of the pieces and the recurring melodies. I would definitely recommend this film.",
221,18 March 2015,Horst_In_Translation,8," Mindblowing, our generation's ""Amadeus""","And it does not even need a Best Picture win for this description. Damien Chazelle's ""Whiplash"" was one of the big players this awards season mounting in three Academy Award wins. J.K. Simmons basically dominated the supporting actor (so happy for him, he is such a likable guy, but was he really supporting?) category from start to finish and Chazelle himself managed a writing nomination with the Academy. Given he just turned 30 and has a bright future ahead of him, I am sure he can live without the director nomination. ""Whiplash"" is a great film. It starts off good, but quickly has you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the film. They kept it at clearly under 2 hours, which helped a lot as it would have sucked if they had filled the film with unnecessary scenes. This way now, it's really all essential from start to finish.",
222,30 April 2019,Mr-Fusion,9, Clawing to the top with blood-stained drumsticks,"Tape your fingers now or else those nails will be bitten down to nubs when this is over. Equally unbearable and exhilarating, Whiplash turns the teacher-student relationship right on its head; far more Full Metal Jacket than anything inspirational. To that end, this is the best I've ever seen from J.K. Simmons, spewing venom as Miles Teller strains under his withering abuse. This is psychological thriller against the backdrop of jazz (a sentence I never thought I'd see myself typing), and Simmons is the emotional terrorist you just do not see coming. That goes for the whole movie, one that I've never seen anything like. There's a wealth to appreciate here, from the masterful editing and direction to the music, and the hype is absolutely warranted.",

Whiplash is not really about the finishing competition, but about the mindset of the person wanting to ""get there"" and of the teacher who needs to find a prodigy to validate their own efforts. Most of all, the film is extraordinary for making the viewers ask themselves if there is a line and when can you consider it crossed, in both pupil and teacher.",

I am not talking about a search for happiness, flowing, and connection. Crossing history since Icarus, to be a human being is also dreaming with a power to take things suspended for a moment or to run the show and the attention for while. This film shows what ambition can make to those who want to pay the price of it. The screenplay brings a music student and his terrible mentor, one that is looking for a new Icarus. Humiliating his students taking them to the limits of sanity that's the price his students pay to make him feel great again. Charlie Park, the bird, is used by the teacher as the perfect student, the role model, that could bare everything because a genius never give up this talent. Even with the sun meltings the glue which makes wings attached to his body, Icarus continue to go up. This film is about a musical dream of flying high melting ambitions.",

I remember the first time I watched it I was so captivated that I wished the movie would go on and on and never end. Especially during the solo at the end, I was so completely mesmerized I forgot to breathe. The main character, played by Miles Teller, is very relatable. The character is everyone of us who are ambitious and driven, and have a thirst to prove ourselves. Miles Teller was able to play that part so perfectly, you forget you're watching a movie. It is almost like watching someone in real life. He is such an amazing actor, it is sad that he is so underrated. I hope he gets more good roles like this in the future.",

233,3 June 2015,anuradhamax7,8, A movie not for the simple minded,"A movie not for the simple minded, Whiplash is a film which revolves around the lives of a passionate 19 year old musician Andrew (Miles Teller) and his perfectionist professor Fletcher (JK Simmons). The intense story begins when Andrew enrols into the 'Shaffer Conservatory of Music-a prestigious music college' as a drummer and almost immediately 'impresses' Fletcher enough for him to be selected as a member of the sound team under him. From there on starts the clash of two musical egos; one of Andrew who with all his hard work and dedication does his best to impress Fletcher and Fletcher himself who holds no bar when it comes to pushing his students at all length to get the best out of them and to help him win every music competition. If you think from there on movie moves to a typical storyline where a student becomes a musical prodigy or the professors mends his ways and becomes a less harsh and better tutor, then you are so wrong and this is exactly where Whiplash differs from any other music related movie. The movie in turn sticks with much more believable reality and showcases pure raw emotions of revenge, loathing and pure determination to prove oneself. Both Teller and Simmons have done justice to their respective roles and have carried the movie with their brilliant performance and Damien Chazelle as a writer and a director has kept the story simple while bringing a new prospective of looking at a story. Chazelle also needs to be credited for paying special attention to visual details and getting into the mind of a musician, but the place where he lacks and yet differs from everyone else is not going into too much detail and not trying to justify a character in any way. The pure brilliance of this makes the viewer engrossed as to why a character is certain way and yet makes him also wonder why certain people in the movie even existed. In the end I would say watch the movie for its pure raw brilliance and if for nothing else for Teller's and Simmon's brilliant acting.",

236,26 August 2021,danielmullin,8, My take ....,"I found the whole drumming aspect of the film to be quite clear symbolism for the war against breast reduction surgery. The cinematic parallels between the intense drumming scenes and surgically removing big bouncy boobies is uncanny and is clearly Chazelle's way of expressing the opinion, that he likes big juicy honkers. The fact that Chazelle is willing to be brutally honest and not shy away from the subject matter is honestly empowering and I am internally grateful to have seen someone address this in film. As Abraham Lincoln once said ""God gave you big badonky donk boobies, why would you want to make them smaller?"" this quote directly captures the message that Chazelle was attempting to convey with this film.",

238,2 March 2015,Aodhanrooney,10, Best achievement in Sound Editing of the year!,"Whiplash is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking and totally unmissable! Who thought J.K Simmons would have been offered a role eligible for an Oscar win? Nobody - but that's not the point; the movie is mesmerising to its own extent and outweighs the boundaries of sound editing to a unique and powerhouse level. With so much pleasure to keep the audience glued to their seats, Whiplash is a fascinating tale about a passionate drummer called Andrew (played by Miles Teller) - who's undying dream is to become a musician as a drummer, even if he has to go off the deep end by severely injuring himself, in practise, which he, ultimately, does, when music professor, Fletcher, abusively doubts his talents. It's a careers best for J.K Simmons, whom delivers a masterful performance as Fletcher, as he horribly abuses the students in his music class, in order to make them successful and talented musicians - but Fletcher is not to be messed with. Miles Teller also delivers a mesmerising performance as the young master drummer, Andrew, whom will stop at nothing and will cross boundaries, even with Fletcher, to achieve his dream. It's one of my favourite movies of the year and of all time - and an extraordinary new achievement in filmmaking!",
239,8 June 2015,leonblackwood,8, Original and thoroughly entertaining! 8/10,"Review: I was really looking forward to watching this film because I have been drumming since I was a little boy and I know that jazz drumming is one of the hardest methods to master. The movie is about an inspiring drummer who tries his utmost to impress the top instructor in his school. After showing him his determination and dedication to his art, he gets promoted to be the head drummer in his orchestra but the teachers ruthless methods and constant search for perfection, takes his toll. The movie is original and entertaining from beginning to end. The drumming from Miles Teller is superb but it's J.K. Simmons nasty methods that impressed me. The storyline is quite basic and it seemed really short, for some unknown reason but it's very entertaining and I'm glad that it got the recognition that it deserved. If your not into drumming or jazz music, the relationship between the teacher and student is worth a watch because it shows how far a person will go to achieve perfection. Enjoyable!",

K Simmons was so ruthless and made me hate him, and then in the third act the movie made me see where he was coming from and I hated the fact I was agreeing with him.

Simmons, as a kind of ""second banana"" comedic foil has elevated just about everything he has been used in this guise for. But, Simmons is also an exceptional dramatic actor too when given the right part. Whiplash gives Simmons the part that should remove any doubt about him being able to bring a character you love to hate to a kind of artistic visceral reality. Simply put, Whiplash couldn't rise to the rare air the story aspires for without such a performance.",
246,10 January 2023,noahpoot,10, Toxic culture in music,"This movie shows everything about the toxic practice culture in music. It's an excellent message about pushing yourself further, but not too far. Jazz Is all about having fun and I guess the protagonist missed that idea, being too caught up with himself. In jazz you can only achieve perfection if you do what you enjoy, and you show you enjoy it. The drive to finding perfection I'd expressing your feelings in your own music and expressing it with others, (slight spoiler ahead) and I think it's the ending shows that magnificently. It doesn't matter if you hit a wrong note, if you play with your feelings that's all that's important, and the movie is an excellent portrayal of teachers with the wrong idea of perfection!",

I agree with those who have pointed out that there were too many drill sargent/basic training type scenes, and while professional musicians put in a lot of practice time, what was portrayed here way way over the top. The Simmons character in particular was played with an almost sadistic quality (and little else to his personality), but for me that detracted greatly. I would like to have had some ""backstory"" on the two main characters, but instead it's just the same sort of thing, over and over again, with at least a mildly unrealistic ending that put it in the ""Karate Kid"" category.",

Great writing, great acting, great directing, fantastic editing and amazing music. J.K. Simmons is an amazing actor. I remember him on OZ and boy did he blow the performance out the water... And you know what, Miles Teller met him step for step. This film is about obsession. Obsession of Mile Teller to be the best and Obsession of JK Simmons to never settle. The film centers around Miles as he is studying at a music conservatory. He is picked to be part of the best jazz ensemble in the school. But soon he realizes that the guy he admires is the toughest and most demanding person he has ever met. And you sit on the edge of your seat with each scene, ESPECIALLY when they are in it together. I wish I can tell you how its all going to play out, but I can't. I want you to enjoy each morsel, each moment that happens.

The performances, the script, and the direction are of course essential to its success, as is the economic run-time. But for me what really makes it sing is the way the movie's whole craft - but especially the editing and cinematography - cast it more as an action film than as something more conventional for the plot's structure. Almost everything to do with music in the film is cast with military/action overtones and the result is adrenalised, breathless, and thrilling - with a romantic subplot that's also suffused with heart and soul. All of this means that when a character falls, trips or some other genuine physical incident, it leaps off the screen and grabs the viewer with an intense impact that is missing in many genuine action films. A question at the film's heart - if the relationship between teacher and pupil is bullying, abusive or inspirational - is left tantalisingly unresolved, in the care of the viewer meaning this is a film for heart, soul, and mind.",

The sheer amount of tension between student and instructor throughout this movie is hardcore at times, but Fletcher is ultimately trying to maximize Andrew's potential as a musician by any means necessary (He makes this philosophy clear several times throughout the film.)

Even in something not so popular as the Jazz and classic music world; becoming just an orchestra member means suffering. Whiplash is the story of a drum player trying to succeed with a very extremely perfectionist but sadistic teacher. Did you ever consider drums and important part of a concert ? Yes; they are there but usually just as an accompanying instrument. Aside from STOMP; I really never care about a drum solo concert. Well, this movie will prove you wrong. There are moments in this picture you will hold your breath for the length of the scene; and some bloody moments will make you look elsewhere; but it is not an horror movie; is just a story of fighting your own frustration for some and for others about the God complex.",

The sadistic teacher was a ridiculous stereotype, the bleeding hands were just plain unbelievable, and all the other members of the band just sat around watching but not reacting to the appalling abuse. This method of 'teaching' wouldn't work; there is a big difference between pushing students to achieve more and violent bullying.

I think as film viewers we're typically used to several settings and a variety of locations, this movie is 70% filmed in the music room. I think this is why I only gave the movie an 8, because I'm so used to movies where theres 20-50 settings/scenes throughout the movie. This is not the type of behaviour I want to adopt, but unfortunately this is the mainstream mindset and I've become susceptible to it.

The film refrains from moralization, but instead aims to show the audience the price one supposedly has to pay to achieve artistic excellence.

I felt though at times especially the very beginning the drum solos were boring dreary and unnecessary. The ending was well thought out and planned and the plot was good I however wanted to see the farther of the kid meet the mentor for a period to see his reaction in front of the mentor.

289,24 January 2015,jboothmillard,10, Whiplash,"I saw the trailer for this film and thought it looked good and unusually dark, I liked the fact that the supporting star of Spider-Man was getting a bigger role also, and with award nominations and high praise from critics for it, I knew it was a must see. Basically 19-year-old Andrew Neiman (Rabbit Hole's Miles Teller) attends the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory music school as a first-year jazz student, his skill is drumming, he inspires to be a great drummer like Buddy Rich, and one day he gains the attention of respected professor and conductor Terrence Fletcher (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning J.K. Simmons), only for him leave the room with no word. Andrew elsewhere olives with his father Jim (Aliens' Paul Reiser) and they often go to the cinema, it is there he is often served by college student Nicole (Melissa Benoist), and he asks her out and they start dating, and not long later Andrew is approached by Fletcher, he is accepted into his band as an alternative for core drummer Carl Tanner (Nate Lang). Andrew arrives early to his first session, Fletcher arrives and the class practise the Hank Levy piece ""Whiplash"", it is during this that Andrew sees what he is getting himself, as Fletcher is abusive towards the students, mocking and insulting, and when he hears instruments off tune or rhythm off tempo he will hurl a chair, slap and berate. Andrew is determined to impress Fletcher, so he practises constantly at home with his drum kit, to the point where his hands bleed due to sores from the drumsticks, and he breaks up with Nicole thinking she will distract him, and next Andrew attends a local jazz competition, with a misplaced music sheet he claims he can play ""Whiplash"" from memory and he is promoted to main drummer, however core drummer Ryan (Austin Stowell) from a former class replaces him and he is demoted to alternative. In a following class session Fletcher tearfully talks about talented former student Sean Casey who has died in a car accident, after this the band rehearses Juan Tizol piece ""Caravan"", but Carl struggles with tempo, so Fletcher keeps him, Andrew and Ryan in the classroom for several hours until they can perfect their playing, Fletcher finally gives core drummer position to Andrew. Andrew makes his way to a competition, but problems arise as first the bus he is on breaks down, so he rents a car determined to make the performance, arriving late he is kicked out by Fletcher for forgetting his drumsticks, Andrew drives back to the car rental office to retrieve them, speeding back his car is hit by a truck, he survives the accident and crawls from the wreckage badly injured covered in spots of blood, he arrives on stage but is unable to play properly, Fletcher tells him he is ""done"", and Andre attacks him in front of the audience. Andrew is expelled from Shaffer Conservatory music school, a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey contacts and explains that Sean hanged himself after suffering severe anxiety and depression, Fletcher's abusive methods are being blamed, Sean's parents want to stop him teaching, Andrew testifies and Fletcher is fired. Months later Andrew sees Fletcher performing in a club, they drink together and Fletcher explains his behaviour, he wants to achieve greatness which is why he pushes his students beyond expectations, he invites Andrew to join his band to perform at a festival concert, Andrew agrees and wants to invite Nicole, but she reveals she has a new boyfriend and cannot come. On stage before the performance, Fletcher tells Andrew he knows he testified against him, the band then begin playing a piece Andrew does not have the music sheet of, leaving him humiliated on stage as he tries to keep up with the tempo. But as Fletcher makes a speech Andrew interrupts with his drumming and he begins playing ""Caravan"", he cues the rest of the band to play along and Fletcher follows suit, Andrew continues an extravagant drum solo, playing non-stop, Fletcher is first angry, but during the play slowly supports him. As the solo ends, they share a smile and Fletcher cues the the finale. Also starring Chris Mulkey as Uncle Frank and Damon Gupton as Mr. Kramer. Teller proves a fantastic newcomer as the student who will not give up on his dreams of becoming a ""great"" and making an impression to his teacher, but the film absolutely belongs to Simmons who is a sensational tour de force as the foul-mouthed maestro who thinks nothing of bringing his students to literal bloodshed to make perfect music. I agree Reiser perhaps could have had a bit more to do, but he cannot stand up against the storming performances of Teller and Simmons. This gives the often made ""inspirational teacher"" plot a good kick in the face, it's like a cross between School of Rock and Full Metal Jacket, with a drillmaster-like composer getting the head of the hero drummer, it is a great combination of terrific music pieces, bad language and blistering mind games, with a marvellous script, it will keep you gripped all the way to the showy ending, I cannot say enough how much I loved this film, an exceptional music drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay Damien Chazelle, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction for Damien Chazelle.

With energetic and precise camera work and editing, the films' themes of awe inspiring jazz and physical breaking points pop out like blood on Andrew's crash cymbal. JK Simmons was an absolute marvel, rivaling Heath Ledger's Joker as the most compelling and ruthless characters I have ever seen in a picture.

Think anyone with any sense can tell being a successful musician is one of the hardest things to achieve in this lifetime let alone one of the most talented. But the approach from the teacher Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) would make Drill Sergeants wince, to push people to their limit is one thing, but to constantly do it over and over and over again would drive the most determined to fall short. The shots where Andrew (Miles Teller) is pushing himself constantly were over the top but somewhat realistic, but it all turns when he dumps his girlfriend (Mellisa Benoist) to concentrate on his career was as odd move in the film as she was barely in it in the first place. The part that tips this into the abyss is when Andrew is late and comes under fire from Fletcher and has to retrieve his drumming sticks only to be hit by a Truck. Not only does he walk miraculously but manages to get to the gig albeit to his demise. It just got worse from there really and the ending predictable.

322,2 May 2015,tavm,9, J.K. Simmons deserved his Oscar for his performance in Whiplash,"Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom. She was perhaps puzzled by many scenes especially the ending. She certainly wasn't in love with J.K. Simmons' pretty sadistic music teacher character. Simmons' Oscar-winning role does show quite the range of emotions concerning his wanting his students showing how much excellence-according to him-he wants to get from them. His recounting the story of Charlie Parker and of a former student who died-which he says happened one way but we find out later it was in a much different way-does humanize him in a way that one would feel for him. And Miles Teller is great as the one student who seems obsessed with this teacher in trying to achieve greatness. I also liked his scenes with Paul Reiser as his father. The one question one should probably ask is if the ends of the way the movie goes on justify the means that it achieved when it got there. So on that note, I highly recommend Whiplash.",

Amazing directing, writing, editing, and acting. All of the music in this movie is wonderful and will stay in your head for years. Love how Andrew starts off so innocent and reserved but slowly descends into arrogance and narcissism. Fletcher is the most thought-provoking character in the film and one of the best written antagonists ever. I've noticed how the best villains are always presented as the most evil wretches before they explain themselves and almost make you agree with them (this was also done well by Marvel with Thanos). Seen plenty of movies, but none of them have ever reached the heights of this.",

Music is the lead, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are just supporting, at least that's how I saw the film. You get to know who Andrew & Terrence Fletcher (Simmons) are along the way, but Music is front and center stage. Of course, the actors are important because their characters give life to the music. The drums are once again a noble instrument in the film. Having the camera focused on the drummer's perspective is what gives intensity. Drumming looks, how it should, difficult to master. It requires motivation, dedication, and passion. Andrew Neiman (Teller) works really hard to try to achieve greatness. The investment, the sweat and pain needed for this instrument is tangible. Andrew lives and breathes drumming, it's in is blood.",
327,28 April 2015,anaconda-40658,10, J.K's Whipping Board!,"Whiplash (2014): Dir: Damien Chazelle / Cast: Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell: Riveting and powerful drama about emotional turmoil. It stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman, a promising young drummer who is accepted at Shaffer Conservatory only to be confronted with the reality that his professor is a master manipulator. J.K. Simmons becomes the greatest factor in this film playing Terence Fletcher who conducts the band with ruthless strict discipline. This becomes a back and forth battle of wits as Neiman, frustrated and determined, drums until his hands bleed. Fletcher draws him in with promise and hopes before cutting lose with insults and profanities that draws tears from the students. Director Damien Chazelle presents a screenplay detailed with hard hitting music measured to extreme perfection by students aiming to succeed before their sanity caves. Teller draws off the anguish of somebody constantly hitting bottom despite playing the hardest. J.K. Simmons plays a talented yet sadistic conductor whose methods draw controversy. The climax battle of wills is a masterpiece of push and shove. In supporting roles is Paul Reiser as Neiman's supportive father who shares movie night with his son as well as find legal support when things really heat up. Melissa Benoist plays a girl who works at the theatre whom Neiman strikes up the nerve to ask out until his music becomes too important. There is also two other drummers who endure the heinous emotional torture issued by Fletcher. The road to fame can be a trying one that arrives at the cost of one's emotional endurance. Score: 10 / 10",
328,17 March 2015,GavinHeisenberg,10, A brilliantly tense movie,"""Whiplash"" is a brilliantly tense movie. It has a nice 90's feeling to it. The mental and physical battle between the ruthless instructor and the talented young drummer was so well written. It reminded me a little bit of Ari Gold & Llyod's relationship in ""Entourage"". JK simmons's performance as the instructor is very good but a lil overrated. I personally think Miles Teller was better as the Drummer, because his character had more layers to it. Whilst the instructor is straight up unlikeable. The drummer skips around from likable to unlikeable throughout the whole movie. I also like how it asks the question ""Where is the line between motivation and abuse?"" It is edited to perfection. Not a dull or false moment throughout. A Must See! 10/10",

It's one of those movies that I would typically have no interest in seeing, specifically with the central premise of the flick being jazz. However, I love and appreciate all types of music, and there was some extremely positive reviews surrounding it so I felt like I needed to see what the fuss was about. After sitting through it I can see why it is praised. This movie is completely captivating. It gives you a real sense of the passion invigorating the main character Andrew (Miles Teller) and the boundaries he is willing to push past in his venture for perfection. It plays off as a very dark interpretation of a typical 'master and apprentice' story. With the bold, and sometimes brutal, nature of Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) polars the suppressed, self-conscious drummer with an ambition.",

The strange thing is I have come across plenty of other individuals (who are also musicians) that hate this film, and I mean HATE this film because they feel this does not accurately showcase the music industry or musical process. I suppose it all depends on the experience. Of course, I was never treated to the extreme measures that Miles Teller character endures from Simmons' hardcore ways, but let me just say that it doesn't take much to feel the pressure, especially when you really want a part. But regardless of how realistic the film is or how it makes me feel, the film is well made. So in my opinion, 'Whiplash' is an awesome film.",
334,19 February 2015,pratima347,9, Quiet yet loud,"I have to begin by appreciating Miles Teller. He is a brilliant actor! After watching Two night stand, I thought he'd be stuck doing rom coms but he does Whiplash and shines! J.K.Simmons is a seasoned actor but plays his part amazingly. All the tension and nervous energy that we feel in the movie is brought about mainly by Simmons. He's mostly not likable and I, like many others, did not quite approve of his technique of 'pushing kids over the edge'. He should push but should also know when to stop. Also, I felt like the end dragged a bit although during the (long!)final sequence I was cheering Teller for his drumming slap to Simmons. It was definitely a great shot. All in all, I liked the movie very much and initially, because of all the tension, I wanted to stop watching, but I did not and I am glad. It has many golden moments that will make you go whoa! There are a few points which required me to suspend my belief, like the bleeding hands from drumming, but I guess that just made the movie all the more intense. A very good movie and although it did not inspire me, it surely satisfied me and I will not be surprised if it bags more than a few awards.",

However, it is Whiplash's display of the cost of greatness, it's insight into the nature of sacrifice and ambition, which make it a ten star film. J.K.

When I first watched this film, it was so intense and I couldn't look away the entire time. The last 20 minutes is the best 20 minutes in cinema history. Whiplash is the best movie of all time. I will never get bored watching this. The cinematography especially at the end was surreal and artistically beautiful. Miles Teller and J. K Simmons did an outstanding performance. Unbelievable. The emotionally and physical abuse from ""Fletcher"" makes this movie hard to look away. Everything about this film had no flaws whatsoever. The perfect movie for anyone that likes drama, music, outstanding acting. Like I said the cinematography, soundtrack/songs they are playing in the film, lighting of yellow and green throughout the film, acting, plot, camera work, instruments, script, location, costume design of mainly fletchers black t-shirt really makes the movie more powerful. I don't understand how anyone can hate this movie. While it does have emotional/physical abuse, it makes the film come to life and really dive deep into the plot. J. K Simmons really did slap Miles hard and Miles broke J. K's ribs during the ""tackle"" scene which made it even more realistic. No one in the acting world could be better alternatives for Neiman and Fletcher than the ones we see today. The reason Damien Chazelle (Director) introduced Fletcher as a ""self loathing, sadistic teacher"" was that Damien had a similar experience in his own life while being in a school band. Same as to the songs ""Whiplash"" & ""Caravan"". Damien wanted to bring the film to life and have people accommodate and relate to the film. I actually loved how Nicole wasn't in the film to long because it showed that she wasn't a big priority to Neiman as to what he thought would've been. Now, the ""truck"" scene was just mind blowing. It happened so fast and very interesting of the camera to stay in the same position the whole time the car was flipped which made the accident extravagant. (Last 20 Minutes): The last part of the movie was just pure bliss and extreme relief/hopeful of Neiman's career. My mouth was wide open the entire last segment. The camera work was extremely impressive the way they played out the ""Whip-Pans"" from Fletcher to Neiman many times. The very last segment from when Neiman and Fletcher both stared at each other and smiled, played his heart out the last strand and boom! The end. Just absolutely stunning of a film. That's my review guys. Thanks!",

The directing, cinematography, and editing are all perfect and unique. And the fact that this was Damien Chazelle's directorial debut is unbelievably impressive.

Additionally, although I understand the student's intense desire for success, the lengths he is depicted going to are often counterproductive and even absurd (playing until his finger bleed for instance).

The script (entirely original I might add) is undeniably one that was crafted with care, passion, and love by Chazele.

The cinematography isn't the flashiest (it could've been gratuitously so if put in the hands of a lesser dop) but sets the tone with its dark and ominous atmospheric lighting. The editing is perhaps the best I've ever seen. There are scenes, especially the final one, that could've fallen apart if the editing hadn't been perfectly conducted. The relationship between our two main characters is the driving force of the film and each part of the filmmaking process plays a role in bringing it to life. The ending sticks with you long after the credits roll, making you question whether it was a ""happy ending"" or not and, I'm my opinion, it was probably about the most depressing but brilliant ending possible.

The sheer emotion and power it is able to effectively convey is simply extraordinary. J. K Simmons Performance goes unrivalled by anyone else, and his character is just as well written as it is acted. Miles Teller is also great, and helps to amplify the chemistry between himself and Simmons. Director Damien Chazelle greatly captures the physical and mental toll that Fletcher's psychological 'torture' begins to show on Andrew, using a variety of film techniques. The brilliant writing is capable of capturing the true extent of Fletcher's evil humour, brilliance and his scarce humanity. Chazelle also demonstrates an exceptional ability to edit and direct the rapid paced and high tension segments of the film, which is able to effectively engage and relate the viewer to Andrew and Fletcher's dysfunctional and at times crazed relationship, maintaining the pacing and never inducing a disinterest or boredom. Also some great visual shots during the the high impact tension scenes, which help ground the audience during these sequences. Also, (to no surprise) no musical choices are phenomenal, from the funky stuff displayed throughout the performance scenes, to the eery and well placed sounds that help amplify an important or tense sequence. All of these significant pieces come together to form a truly well-realised Thriller that will keep you engaged from the opening credits.

Black Swan is definitely the most intense film experience I've had with Darren Aronofsky's chaotic direction becoming almost suffocating at times. It's a film which I endlessly admire, as is his second feature, Requiem for a Dream which features a similar intensity with an added emotional punch to the ribs. Whiplash is a film with that same kind of intensity. It's rare to find a film which grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits, but Whiplash manages to do more than that. It actually tightens the grip as the film goes on until you're just about choking by the end of it all!",

I'm not the kind of critic that uses tired phrases like ""kept me at the edge of my seat"" or ""made me sweat bullets"" as devices to trickily describe my heart-rate, but during Whiplash, I experienced both sensations; not in the same way I did when Ghostface was chasing around Drew Barrymore with psychotic fascination in Scream and not in the same way I did when Marion Crane was getting shower-knifed in Psycho.

Even if you try not to enjoy it, you will be met with failure as you immerse yourself in the sheer brilliance of the simple plot. I applauded for the movie once it was over and 3 Oscars tell the same story- this movie is amazing. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons define real acting in this movie and make this an epic experience.

I didn't even know it had been nominated and won Academy Awards, but now I certainly understand why. The acting of both leads was phenomenal which is really what drove the movie, as it was their relationship that it was primarily about. I read only a few other reviews; one of them called Whiplash a study about ambition. I agree with that, and then some. Excellence, perfection, reputation... the main character(s) cared more about these than romance and/or friendships. Given this, I found it very interesting, too, that while there was no overt sexuality in this film, the suggestion of it was there often. Certainly in the use of sexual language, usually in a derogatory fashion by JK Simmons, and also in the intimations of gayness in his character and how he related to the men he taught. (I couldn't help but wonder, are women so absent from the world of jazz musicians?) In fact, I believe part of what was so powerful about the ending is the nonverbal communication that took place between the two main characters and the sexual nature of it (the physicality, the pacing, intensifying, sweating, panting, climaxing). Two people making music together... love of yet another kind? Very powerful.",

You can't have a film without actors, without a script, or without a director. For this particular piece of music, all you need is a drummer and a teacher who will do anything to for a successful performance. I believe that is what Damien Chazelle has done here. He has pushed his actors as well as his audience to their limits and then some. The question this movie asks is: how far is too far? And the beautiful thing is that it never answers it and that was precisely Damien Chazelle's intention when he wrote the ending. We, as the audience, must decide for ourselves. I didn't enjoy sitting through this movie, but that doesn't make it bad. It made me think and ultimately it did what it set out to do. For that, I applaud it.",

The movie seems to be an indie film with a staple of an action movie thrown in for good measure. A car accident, viscerally shown. Lately since the noughties it has been easier to show car crashes.

JK Simmons in his award winning role as Fletcher plays an over the top abusive in all senses of the word teacher.

412,29 December 2014,agblum,9," Makes You Think, and Great Performances from Teller and Simmons","The fictional story of ""Whiplash"" is that of 19 year-old Jazz Drummer student Andrew Nieman, played by Miles Teller. Nieman is a student at the fictional ""Shaffer Consevatory"" in New York, the top music school in the U.S. Nieman aspires to become one of the drummer ""greats"" and ends up in the class of conductor Terrence Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. As the movie progresses, Fletcher is revealed to have display both verbal and physical abuse in his teaching to Nieman and other students. Despite this, Nieman is determined to please Fletcher is his quest for greatness. Both Teller, and Pre-Oscar Nominations Announcement, presumed Favorite Simmons for Best Supporting Actor, both give great performances. At times I rooted, loathed and then rooted again for Teller's character, as his own morals and values are questionable at points in the film. The question of how far is too far for a teacher to push a student, and a student to push his or herself is there, and the movie does make you think. As I heard, the last 15 minutes or so are something, and there is one surprise moment earlier in the film, that you just don't see coming, that really shocks you. In the end, while not the best, it is one of the better films I have seen this year, and I will want a repeated viewing to judge it further. For now - 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars (The ½ Star for Teller's and Simmons's performances and the last 15 or so minutes), 9 out of 10.",
413,13 March 2023,I_Ailurophile,10," Explosive, inescapably riveting, a phenomenal achievement","If I'm being honest I've been nervous about watching this as much as I have been looking forward to it. The theatrical trailer was incredibly sharp and biting, but it would hardly be the only time a trailer has impressed me so much only for the full film to be nowhere as good itself ('Troy,' 'Age of Ultron'). Gladly, such trepidation is very quickly laid to rest, as Damien Chazelle's picture is filled from top to bottom with those same acrid flavors. As reliable a presence as J. K. Simmons is for any production, his performance as monstrous Fletcher is absolutely ferocious, the type of tour de force exhibition that will be remembered for a long time to come. Any glimpse of humanity he shows us in that capacity is a fleeting shade next to the unremitting viciousness, and Simmons becomes someone completely separate from himself for these 100 minutes. To my disbelief, Miles Teller nearly matches that explosive fierceness as blindly ambitious Andrew, and between these two stars 'Whiplash' is filled with such excruciating dark energy as to manifest tension and suspense tantamount to an outright thriller. When the picture does eventually pause for a breath, it's still hard to come down from the earlier peak, and it's only a pause. Make no mistake, this is a total beast, and it is absolutely worth all the anticipation.",
414,29 November 2014,punishable-by-death,10, Best film of 2014.,"Never have I been a part of an audience that universally applauded a film immediately after the images faded to black. Indeed, never have I seen film at the cinema that was more deserving of such a reception. Before I realised it, my hands were coming together. An involuntary action; a result of a perfect movie in every conceivable way. Every scene, every shot, every piece of music that was played. There were certainly a number of subtle themes permeating the background of this movie. The most notable being what it takes, the dedication and relentless determination that is required for an artist, or indeed anyone, to become truly great, to become more than what was thought to be the limit of their capability, or even perfection itself. Despite this, and the many other parallel themes, at its core: this is a movie MADE for drummers. In saying that though, you of course do not need to be a drummer or a real musician to enjoy this movie. It is that incredible and that diverse that the drama, the tension, the comedic quotes, along with the impeccable acting, carry this film on its shoulders alone. This is the best film of the year, by at least a 20 kilometre marathon.",

All while trying to get great!,"Finally saw ""Whiplash"" I must say it's one film that takes a look at what's it's like of trying to gain success and conquer your own working demons all while trying to please yourself and others. The film has Miles Teller as Andrew who's a young up and coming want to be drummer who after enrolling in a music school finds that life behind the drum is tough. It's when Andrew sees that his march to the beat of his own drum instructor Fletcher(J.K. Simmons in a very deviant and sadistic like teacher role and maybe his best performance)is one not to play with as the note and key must strike to his hand right on the drum!

Its ultimate effect is an incredibly compelling, thematically rich one. It's an, at times, gruelling, almost hard-to-watch picture mainly because we care so much about our lead and want to see him succeed, a desire that is bolstered by the fact that we constantly see and hear the genuine skills (in the form of thunderous, top-class drumming) he's told he does not yet possess. This makes the central battle between him and his antagonistic teacher all the more agonising, urgent and investing, until it culminates a riveting confrontation and the whole things ends on a fantastic final beat. 8/10",

The storyline is far from original and brought in a far from original way, the acting is o-k-ish (just Simmons though, Teller is as weak as ever), the little love-angle that was put in might as well have been skipped and the story itself with the dictator-like teacher who, although the school principal said he was being watched, can do what he wants is just totally implausible.

This movie revolves around the human ambition for greatness and how not everyone is how they seem. This is just simply a sensation film making from start to finish and it really had my attention all the way through. Certain people need that kick in the rear to focus and get started, but the question is how much pushing can some people take. I guess if they want it enough they can handle it, because the end justify the means for them. Watching this film was sort of like a more artistic and powerful portrayal of how Gordon Ramsay treats his chefs on television. Except Ramsay is probably doing it for rating and publicity stunt. Although certain portion of him makes him do that, it's mostly for the ratings. Overall, this is a film that really hits the core with it's emotions and intensity. I highly recommend it.

I even think it's important in some areas. But it makes absolutely no sense when artistic creation and music is involved.

437,31 January 2015,Robert_duder,10, Where did this movie come from...doesn't matter...you won't ever forget it...period.,"This was the final film I needed to see for a couple of reasons. One it is the last of the Academy Award Best Picture nominees that I needed to see. It is also the last film I wanted to see before I went ahead and did my personal best of 2014 list. Good thing I waited because guess what? Whiplash is on it. Whiplash is headlining it. In the last three weeks of trying to see the best of 2014, I found THREE films that I am giving a huge ten to without hesitation. I suspected Whiplash would be good, I just don't understand where it came from. I may have seen a trailer once but for it to show up as a best picture nominee was perplexing. I didn't hear it doing particularly well or even any reviews on it. Whiplash is mesmerizing. Whiplash is an instant classic. Whiplash is probably the best film of 2014. I was entranced. My jaw was dropped for much of it and it is one of the best performances in a film I have ever seen. Whiplash is phenomenal and that doesn't do it justice. It is gut wrenching and expressive and explosive and if you are any kind of musician you will adore this film and if you love jazz or percussion music...well you'll just explode with joy. I could literally go back and watch this again as soon as the credits are done rolling and be blown away all over. Whiplash is a must see film in every sense of the word.",

I love jazz, I love listening to it, love the sense of humor it has, the style, the spirit and yes, the tempo - jazz is way more complex than your normal, every day music whether it's classical, rock or whatever. Whatever people think about the brutality or how music teachers push their students towards greatness is really not the point to me. The point is that it takes extreme discipline to reach perfection. How does one measure perfection? The only measure I know myself is if I get goosebumps when listening to a performance and if I hear that Big Boy Tempo without any hiccups. This movie and its music gave me goosebumps. Simple as that.",

Matter of fact it should have never been in question, especially after The Spectacular Now or even Divergent. He is getting better with every role and it's only a matter of time before he is also being nominated for an Oscar. J.K. Simmons plays the ultimate jacka** teacher, who looks to other means of educating the Jazz band, abuse. When I say, I don't think there has ever been more of a despicable character I mean it.

It was over-the-top absurd at times and I didn't ""buy"" much of the action. The music school was preposterous, people simply wouldn't let this behavior fly in this century. Miles Teller was quite good as the student, but I felt JK Simmons was miscast. Not because he is not a good actor, but because his TV persona is so memorable and opposite, that I just couldn't believe him in this role, unfortunately.

This movie has affected me in so many ways that I am not sure I am good enough to express each and every one of them. First of all, anyone who gave 1-5 star to this movie, really?! Go see some chick flicks and entertain yourselves. This movie is absolutely not for such people.
Secondly, J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller were so good that I cannot decide which one is the best and the other follows so this movie, as in its original story has two marvelous characters played by most talented actors, one junior and one senior and they deliver and convey every single note of this story perfectly. They actually painted a very difficult yet beautiful ""The Master and his student, meant to be one soon"" story for us in this film.
Yes, the scenes were pretty rough, I did not like them either. There are some disturbing scenes and yes, there is certainly abuse, both verbal and physical in the relationships between Fletcher and his students but that's all about folks. This movie intends to make us see that either you take everything and endure to become perfect in this life or you simply submit to loose. As Andrew says: ""I do not want to be great. I wanna be one of the greats"". If you just aim to be one great person, find a cuddly thoughtful teacher and dance with him/her. If you want to become legend, find a legendary master who takes no sh.t from you whatsoever. That is the only way you will be molded and become a dazzling sculpture out of an amorph piece of stone.",

449,13 June 2015,lesleyharris30,9," An Intense Piece of Film that is sure to Delight all Moviegoers,","Whiplash is an fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I was in shock and awe throughout, it is a very intense film as we get a very deep look inside the life of a young man wanting to make a career in playing the drums, there are many scenes that are so powerful that I found myself not taking my face away from the screen for one second, not even blinking, I don't want to spoil any of these but I will just say that there is nothing like them in any other movie. I think we could have been given information about Fletcher, I know that we are following Andrew, but I would have liked to known some more about Fletcher's past and what made him turn out this way, it would have made J.K. Simmons performance even more substantial than it already is. The performances made this movie, as it is one that would have been terrible without great acting, J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller hit it out of the park, I was always saw Simmons as a versatile actor, but he was never really given roles where he could really shine, he is given that opportunity in this and uses it to full effect, he is terrifying and in a strange way very likable, Teller also delivers a spectacular performance, particularly in parts where his character lashes out, and he clearly put in some serious drum lessons, which is very impressive. Dramatic, intense and all around outstanding, three Oscars dosen't lie, I would recommend Whiplash to all moviegoers. ",
450,20 October 2014,Likes_Ninjas90,6, The film is based on Chazelle's life but is fiction because reality is realising not everything is possible if we're willing to try,"Reality television shows like The X-Factor and American Idol have created a culture of humiliation where it is as fun to watch people fail stardom as it is to discover the next great talent. But the behaviour of J.K. Simmons's character in Whiplash is so extreme and over the top it would make Simon Cowell wilt in disbelief. Imagine an episode of The X- Factor where Redfoo repeatedly slaps one of his contestants in the face or Ronan Keating lays down a homophobic slur. That said, the vision of Delta Goodrem in previews of The Voice screaming at young children ""I need you on my team!"" and telling kids they're mega stars amplifies the pressure and expectations placed on young people to be successful today. The stakes are higher than before because technology like the Internet and Youtube has increased the volume of global talent and shortened the waiting time. With his second feature film Whiplash, writer-director Damien Chazelle addresses the culture of fear and expectations he suffered firsthand. As a drummer in a high school jazz orchestra, his anxiety grew from not playing for fun but necessity. He was isolated by a desire to succeed and pushed by the encouragement of his school conductor, which became the basis of a short film and this feature produced by Jason Reitman. ",
451,1 June 2020,briancham1994,7, Terrific and terrifying actor,J.K. Simmons really steals the show here.

The man is a Vince Lombardi type of instructor who treats everyone with equal contempt in order to get the best out of them. I am not a fan of jazz, but I as a music lover, I was able to appreciate the struggles of musicians of any kind. Teller is excellent as the kid who plays so hard that his hands bleed, and Paul Reiser appears as his supportive father. Simmons has been nominated for best supporting actor and he should take home the Oscar. I remember him playing a neo Nazi on the HBO series ""Oz"" and he is clearly a great character actor.

Winner of the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, the semi-autobiographical Whiplash is a visceral, adrenaline-pumping musical drama that raises but does not resolve the age-old question of whether the end justifies the means. In the film, 19-year-old Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller, The Spectacular Now), an ambitious drumming student enrolled at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory of Music (fictional) in midtown Manhattan, comes under the tutelage of Terence Fletcher (J.K.

In large part it is because Fletcher, Andrews views on what Greatness mean-especially in the context of art-is compelling, utterly clear and completely horrifying. To be great one must suffer and deny to yourself all experience outside the narrow pursuit you have elected. I don't know if this how art work but I do know some people think so. Chazelle has created a hypnotic ode to such people *while* criticizing them. Nothing is more compelling and ambiguous then the final shot of Andrew's father with a look of awed horror at what is son has become.

I just had the Devo inside in that intro for my movie review of the fabulous movie ""Whiplash"". What a gem!! ""Whiplash"" stars Miles Teller as first year music student Andrew Neiman. Andrew is a student drummer who is more than just a little drummer boy in his pursuit to excel at his beat craft. However, he has to prove his skills to the extremely rigid music school instructor/conductor Terrence Fletcher. Let's just say that Fletcher is trying to make a newman out of Neiman. As Andrew tries to excel in the battery, Fletcher's own authoritarian battery charge is always on full in pushing Andrew to the edge. Damien Chazzelle orchestrates ""Whiplash"" with a magnetic flow that hits all the right beats in his direction of the picture; and his screenplay also hit all the write verbal notes. Miles Teller delivers yet another stellar performance in his rising career; here as Neiman. J.K. Simmons was terrible as Fletcher! Wait, wait! I was J.K. (just kidding!) Simmons' work as Fletcher might just be the best delivered by any actor or actress this year. Paul Reiser also delivered an impressive supporting performance as Andrew's supporting dad; but I was not as mad about his performance as I was in Simmons' classic masterpiece thespian conduction.

Whiplash is certainly one of the tightest movies ever made, in terms of both writing and editing, but those elements work in tandem with the performances. Miles Teller pushing himself beyond his limits, sweating and bleeding, give the movie an urgency that fits the technical austerity. And of course JK Simmons, who won every award a supporting actor possibly could, for one of the most intense acting jobs ever put on film. Are the characters likable?

After everything Fletcher did to Andrew throughout the entire film, Whiplash ends giving us the idea that perfection (obsessions) can be reached by human beings, which is stupid because this only exists as an ideal. It makes us believe that through ""hard work"" and immeasurable demands, a musician can become ""successful"".

The dinner at his family home was really great as most of the people don't appreciate musicians and their achievements while they praise subpar sportsmen and others. I loved how he talked back to the others by the table. The fact that his father and he goes to the cinemas regularly was really nice. He asked the girl working at the cinemas out and they dated but he behaved really rude to her saying he want to be great and don't want anyone in his life. Fletcher wanted them to come to a concert in a different town. He was on the way and the bus had a flat. He rented a car and barely got there on time. He forgot his drumsticks in the car and after he argued with fletcher he rushed out to fetch them and got an accident with a truck. Covered in blood he returned to the studio to play and but he failed. He then had a mental breakdown and assaulted fletch. He got dismissed from the school. Someone asked him to testify about fletcher being abusive because a student committed suicide and his parents thought its because of fletcher. (He actually made the band listen to his record in the class and cried and said he died at an accident) then he saw him play at a restaurant. When fletcher saw him he wanted to talk and he explained why he was so hard on them and I somehow thought he's right. He then invited to play at a festival for him in his new band and he came back but it was a trap because he knew he's the one who talked about him to the people in charge.(he invited Nicole on the phone but she said she had to ask to her boyfriend) Then he wanted them to play different song that Andrew don't know of. Andrew failed miserably and left the scene but returned and started his solo show on the scene. I laughed when he looked at fletcher and said f. You to him. He then had to get along with him and he was even glad at the end. I felt euphoric and it was one of the most tense movies I've ever seen.",

He humiliates Andrew at his first day on the band, to the point where Andrew cries. Andrew asks Nicole, the girl working at his favorite cinema, to go out with him. In a competition, Tanner, Fletcher's band's core drummer left his music sheets to Andrew, who neglects it for two seconds. The sheets disappear oddly. Tanner can't play without the sheets. Andrew steps in, stating he knows the song, Whiplash, by heart. Andrew plays well and earns Tanner's spot.

Seriously, just go scroll through the list of awards this movie took home. Jazz, normally a subject I would make an effort to avoid, is the heart of this film about young Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) who is accepted into the Schaffer Conservatory's award-winning jazz band as an aspiring drummer. Andrew loves jazz drumming, spending 100% of his waking hours listening to it, talking about it, or practicing it (except the odd occasion when he's not taking in a classic movie with his dad). Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime, yeah? Enter Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is the head of the band and a jazz aficionado, and he does not accept anything short of perfection. His methods are unconventional and, well, downright abusive. He often recites a tale of Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head and how it supposedly inspired Parker to become the legendary drummer he's known as, and he has apparently based his entire teaching method on that one moment. If Andrew wants the opportunities being in Fletcher's band will afford him, he is going to have to push himself to the limit and beyond. But that sort of dedication doesn't come without a price and the strain of it all becomes overwhelming. Does Andrew have the drive needed to become the jazz drumming legend he aspires to be? Or will he fold under the pressure?",

512,27 July 2015,brchthethird,10," A blistering, intensely gratifying study on what it takes to succeed","My head is still spinning from the whirlwind of what I just experienced. WHIPLASH isn't just a film. It has to be seen to be believed. The plot, although it probably won't do it justice, is about a young drummer (Miles Teller) who is accepted into a conservatory jazz band led by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Miles Teller's character wants to be one of the greats, and Fletcher uses what some would consider questionable methods to push him in that direction. That's really all you need to know going in. I should say that this is the absolute best I've seen out of Miles Teller, having graduated from teen fare like THE SPECTACULAR NOW. And J.K. Simmons? Wow! He brought such an intensity to his role that I wasn't prepared for. He's probably the best antagonist I've seen since R. Lee Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET, and pretty much as creative. However, it's not just the performances that make this such a compelling watch. This film has some of the best editing I've ever seen, and it fit so well with the jazz score. The various production elements were tightly woven and integrated in a way that pulls you into the story and never lets you go until the final frame. Unlike, say BIRDMAN, this completely lived up to the hype in my opinion. As a character study on what it takes to succeed, WHIPLASH is second to none. This feels like something that will be studied in years to come, and it's definitely worth your time.",

There are two words that come to my mind that wholly define the movie: BLOODY INTENSE and ELECTRIFYING. Easily, Whiplash is one of the most thrilling dramas that you will ever come across. The movie rightly earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture as it captures the various human emotions like passion, determination, perseverance and dedication to superior effect.

I almost gave up several times myself because the intensity was more than I wanted to watch, but I did come back in the end.

Miles Teller is perfect as the gifted student, you really do believe every step of the way that the guy can achieve something if pushed, but you never truly know for sure if he is being pushed too far. This has all the bases covered in terms of acting, writing, and direction, with J.K Simmons brilliant performance just about nosing it above all else as the best asset. There's also some white-knuckle plot twists, a huge amount of politically incorrect insults thrown around, and a brilliant (and somewhat deafening) ending.

541,18 January 2015,bsbulldogs,9," All it takes is two, Teller and Simmons lead the way in Whiplash","I had high expectations going into to this movie the other day and I must say it delivered. Miles Teller stars as Andrew Neiman, a promising young drummer who enrolls at the Shaffer Conservatory which is one of the best music schools in the US and he wants to be the best he can be and one of the greats. Enter Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a ruthless conductor who happens to be looking for a new drum alternate. One of the great qualities of this film is the relationship between Andrew and Fletcher as it plays a bit like a two man show and how the relationship between the two changes as the film progresses as it is them two that carry the film on their back. This film is great as it also proves you don't need a well known cast to have a beautifully made film. One weakness is the lack of character development between the other band members as they're in the periphery for most of the film although the supporting roles from Paul Reiser as Andrew's father and Melissa Benoist as Andrew's girlfriend Nicole add just a little bit of sparkle. Positives for this movie are the performances of the two leads in Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, the storytelling as it takes you for a ride with the use of the music played throughout the practice scenes and the cinematography is superb. I had only previously seen Miles Teller in Divergent but boy is he a young star on the rise as he has talent to burn and I have seen J.K. Simmons in a few Coen Brothers movies and Spiderman but this is the first time in his career as a successful character actor that he completely steals the show with his tirade of insults towards his student accompanied with acerbic wit and the like and when is yelling at the class, I could feel my pulse racing as if he was also yelling at the audience which makes it play out like a thriller even though this film is technically not a thriller. Truly a great manipulative villain here in Fletcher as he made me despise him. I don't normally say this but in my opinion, Simmons is so great here that he must win the Oscar as he gives one of the best supporting performances of the last decade and anything less would feel like a tragedy.",

I was in the third grade when I quit taking lessons from him. Anyway, quite a bit later on, I ended up deciding that performance was not for me, in part for some of the very reasons highlighted in this film: that excellence in this realm requires obsessive compulsive concern with audience reception, aka: fame.

Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a jazz student at Schaffer Music School who meets teacher Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) an abusive tyrant known for his terrifying methods of conducting. As Andrew tries harder and harder to please Fletcher he closes off everything else that mattered to him and turns his desire to be the greatest into an obsession. It's an exhilarating story that doesn't let up from beginning to it's incredible final act. The acting from Simmons is great and it's really no wonder that he was given an Oscar for his role as Fletcher. Teller is also great as Andrew and we really see his change through the movie.

Whilst the anwsers to the questions the film poses are not the right ones, this is understood by filmmakers and explored in a ferocious and unapologetic means that only heightens the movie's insane energy and tense atmosphere. Whiplash is a simple premise, especially compared to the oversaturation of franchises we face today, yet manages to seem all the more important in today's climate, with it's demand for only the best and most significant art. Whiplash fits that category.",
554,16 November 2016,oOoBarracuda,10," ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ""good job"" ""","Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller) is a teenager, newly enrolled at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music--the school with the best music program in the United States, hopelessly obsessed with his compulsion to become one of the greatest drummers to ever live. He is the black sheep in many aspects of his life; his family is not musically inclined, he struggles in social situations and has no desire to forge friendships. Andrew is a loner, driven only by his musical passions. One of the most noted bands at the Shaffer Conservatory is Terence Fletcher's (J.K. Simmons) jazz studio band. Fletcher's band is as well-known for its penchant for winning band competitions, as it is for it's militant and abrasive conductor. Students vie for a seat in Fletcher's band due to their consistently high competition standings, but Fletcher's brand of leadership is not one that all students can endure. Fletcher pushes people to their very limits with his verbal abuse knowing exactly what punches to throw based on the individual. Despite his constant abuses, Andrew wants nothing more than to gain Fletcher's respect and accolades. Being brought into the band as an alternate drummer, Andrew will stop at nothing to prove himself to his disparaging instructor. Eventually sacrificing everything in his life, including his coveted relationship with his single-parent father and his health, Andrew must decide what he is trying to do in his life and how Fletcher and his expectations correspond with Andrew's desires.

An awards season favourite, Whiplash boasts many fine qualities which will see it take home at least one award come Oscar night. Miles Teller shows vulnerability, character depth and determination as the main character, although his performance is overshadowed by J.K. Simmons as Terrence Fletcher, probably the Margaret White of music teachers. Fletcher is a very frightening character and is the antagonist of the film, but he is given depth and motivation as well.

The cross-editing of his playing was incredible and deserved every ounce of praise it got, but I learned that he was really playing in the movie and for that I applaud him greatly. On a similar note, Simmons' performance was nothing short of astounding and when he's screaming his head off in the film it really feels like he's screaming at you. The film was also very engaging for me as I found myself getting furious, excited, and even genuinely worried at times. Overall, great film with not a flatly-traited character in sight!",

578,12 March 2015,sizeryerger,4, Hyped up melodrama / Offensive to the meaning of art.,"""Whiplash"" on the surface is a tense, complex study of artistic struggle, obsession, and megalomania. I hated it. Not because it wasn't well constructed; not because it wasn't well acted; not because it wasn't well directed, it was all these things and more. No, I hated it for it's heart, its misguided insight into what art and beauty are truly about. It is not lost on me that any discussion or criticism about art could be argued to be completely subjective; I would still say that this movie does not reflect the beauty of art or do credit to the struggle of the artist. Thats not just my opinion either, to me that is a fact. I am not trying to argue an opinion here, I am actually commenting on something that I truly believe. It has been said that ""Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty"". I believe in Truth and truth can not be an opinion. ""Whiplash"" takes a swing at what it believes is necessary to reach that truth and fails completely at capturing what it means to be an artist. This movie would have one believe that suffering, obsession, sacrifice and ugliness are the building blocks that ""great art/artist"" are founded on. I couldn't disagree more. As an artist myself I understand how all these ""negative"" motivators can drive an artist to produce art, even to produce great art, yet I feel this movie celebrates them as a necessary right of passage. That in order to be great one has to work harder; it implies that those who are successful are those who have suffered and sacrificed the most, and those who aren't just didn't try hard enough.(How many great artist has history ignored only later to discover their beauty?) Perhaps most disturbingly It implies that one's self worth is dependent upon the reception of their art by an audience or someone outside themselves. Enter the ""evil"" music/art instructor who's job it is (by this movies logic) to push someone past what they think is possible to open up new untapped potentials hidden away by psychological blocks of complacency and self-pity by employing the tools of cruelty, manipulation and terror. All this hidden behind some BS ideal that their is some great nobility inherent in not depriving the world of a great artist no matter what the cost. GAG!! What overblown melodramatic tripe. I don't argue that we all couldn't use a swift kick in the pants occasionally in order to rise to our potential,or that honest criticism can be crucial to progressing as an artist but to ruthlessly and doggedly bully and torture someone in the hopes of achieving said effect is where i take offense. Who the hell gave him that cross to bare anyway!? There is a line. This movie even mentions this ""line"" at one point and comes really close to reaching a redemptive conclusion....then misses the mark entirely and descends into the abyss. At this point the movie could have had some valid commentary on the consequence of tyranny and obsession and lifted itself to having a message worth sitting through. I had a glimmer of hope that the movie""s heart was true and had been enact all along. Unfortunately this was not to be. The scene that twists the knife comes when; after being set up and sabotaged by Fletcher, Andrew rises to the occasion against all odds and puts on the performance of a lifetime. Had he done this despite the villainy of Fletcher and the movie just ended, then one could have left the movie with a certain ambiguity, open to contemplating the various themes and questions the movie raises about art and the artistic process. However the damning evidence of the movie's actual message comes during Andrew's fevered solo when despite everything Fletcher has done to Andrew there is a nod of acknowledgment from Fletcher that conveys the approval that Andrew has been so desperately seeking and the movie ends as if something triumphant and beautiful has been brought into the world. Uunnghhh! Never mind that Andrew is an obsessive with no sense of self (or self worth), never mind that Fletcher is a maniacal, narcissistic power drunk bigot (who may have even played a hand in pushing a young mind to suicide), never mind that there seems to be no consequences for any of these characters in their pursuit of greatness. No at this point the movie decided to celebrate this twisted moment as a triumph of art and truth. As if tormenting a person is how great art is born. No I don't think it is cool to celebrate this message nor do i think it is healthy to celebrate Fletcher's and Andrew's relationship as justified and productive. As an artist it offends me with its clichés, I feel it lacks insight, responsibility and any awareness as to the very purpose of art. Art doesn't have to be beautiful, art can be dark. It is both and it is neither. Art is truth and that is all I would ever ask of any form of expression. In ""Whiplash"" I got pandering, ""Top Gun""-esque melodrama and a self indulgent study in cruelty that pretentiously masquerades as if it knows what it means to be an artist. (2 stars for the undeniably fine craftsmanship and performances, but on those alone does not a good movie make.) -Sizer",

One could say that the simple lesson of whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but that would be too much of an arc. Whatever doesn't kill you can still put you through social and passion crushing hell. That's what I can relate to in our drummer and Conductor, brilliantly portrayed. having personally been embarrassed by my HS musical director in class and on stage, I can tell you that ""soul searching"" is a perfect phrase for such events, whether they are caused by you (in class) or by the conductor himself (on stage).

7.

599,22 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.,"This film mainly tells the story of a teenager who is determined to become a top drummer when he meets a strict teacher. Under the teacher's devil training, his skills and willpower continue to improve, and he finally completes a perfect work on the music stage.
The director is very skilled in the use of light. Different lights further explain the situation and inner emotions of the characters in the film like the audience.
At the beginning of the film, the method of pushing the lens is used. At the end of the dark corridor is a practice room. As the lens continues to move forward, the scene of the picture gradually becomes only the practice room. A white light illuminates the The teenager who is seriously practicing alone in the practice room is completely immersed in his own world. He is the best drummer here. At this time, the teenager has some pride. The teenager suddenly stopped the drum hammer, as if he found something. As soon as the picture turned to the teacher standing opposite the teenager, let the audience know that the promotion of the camera was actually the promotion of the teacher 's perspective, and the teacher stepped forward step by step. As I walked, my slow steps seemed to imply an examination of the teenager. The teacher stood in the dark and asked the teenager to walk. The light was shining from the top of the teacher's head. The solemn and majestic image came out. At this time, the light on the teenager was not as bright as before. Leaning forward, subconsciously swallowing, and anxiously answering questions before the saliva is fully swallowed, all show less emotional tension and anxiety. After thinking that he had received the teacher's acquiescence, he showed himself in front of the teacher, and the teenager's face showed bright lights. He was to be praised by the teacher, but he got a ridicule from the teacher. When the teenager concentrated on drumming Close the door and leave, so that the light on the teenager's face dimmed again. They suddenly opened, and the teacher came in. The young man thought that the teacher had changed his mind. Maybe he still had a chance, and the lights appeared on his face again, but the teacher just came in to get the coat. The young man 's face was bleak again ... After the teacher left, the angle of view switched, for everyone It shows a panoramic view of the practice room. The whole color is turquoise. The large practice room is only a young man sitting next to the drum, and the thousands of lights outside the window make the younger more lonely. In just four minutes, the director not only explained the identity, relationship and personality traits of the two, but also showed the psychological changes of the teenager through the lighting, showing the ups and downs of the character 's innermost heart, and tightening the audience 's heartstrings and tense atmosphere Come out spontaneously.
The film also appeared dark green light tones many times. The first time when I was alone in the practice room, the feeling of loneliness and disappointment blended with the green. The second time was when the three drummers were trained by the teacher in turns and blamed for nearly three hours. On the way home, the dark green light shone on the tired face of the teenager. The third time was when the teenager went to the show, the bus tire of the bus punctured. When the rental car arrived, it was discovered that the drum hammer had forgotten to the car rental company. On the way back to the drum hammer, a car accident occurred. The teenager struggled to climb out of the car, regardless of the car over the ground. Disregarding it, he ran to the scene of the performance in a bloody head. When playing on the stage, the screen lights were dark green, and the teenager was unable to complete the performance normally due to physical injuries and was unable to handle it. The film was edited at a fast pace on the way to the scene when driving to the scene and on the road back to the car rental company. The young man's heart was like a tight drum surface, nervous and hesitant. The use of the green light three times showed the uneasiness and depression of the teenagers, all of which appeared when the teenagers experienced negative emotions, and could cooperate with the psychological feelings of the teenagers.
At first, the teenager was very self-respecting, with a little pride in his heart. He kept the videotape where he was playing drums when he was a kid, and choked with his family at the table, saying that he would rather live a successful life, even if he could only live to the age of 53 Asked to live to the age of 90, he thinks he can be a great and top drummer. He is a confident and confident child. But when he joins the teacher 's orchestra, he always receives insults and abuse from the teacher when he trains with the teacher. He even beats him and throws him a chair. The teenager slowly begins to recognize himself, but he is unwilling to accept the spirit of losing and wants to correct his name. The wish made the teenager work harder. The arrogance of the teenager was dulled. He wanted to be a strong person like a teacher. The light on the teenager shone on the teacher. After reconciling with the teacher in the bar, the teenager was invited by the teacher to board the performance stage again, only to find that this was just a conspiracy. It was the trap set by the teacher for reporting his own revenge. After a long period of training by the teacher, the teenager's willpower increased. Not only did he not leave in a hurry, but instead he went on stage to forget to play, and brought his level to the extreme. The teacher was gradually shocked by the teenager. At this time, the bright lights were transferred from the teacher's body to the teenager's body, and the teachers and students also resonated. This video uses a camera shake to quickly express the passion of the teacher and the students, and the success of the teenager's performance with the teacher's excited movements and expression.
The theme of this movie is that there is no madness and no survival. Finally, the hearty performance of the male host and the teacher's expression all indicate that the male host has reached a kind of ecstasy, a kind of ecstasy.",

603,27 February 2015,saschakrieger,9," Blood, sweat and music","No, this will not be fun and games. This much is clear as the camera moves slowly through a dark corridor towards a similarly dark and bare room with a sole drum kid behind which a young man is sweating. Relentlessly – against his instrument and himself – he is repeating the same patterns and rhythms, again and again. The distant view of him becomes intimate and then dissolves – into partial glimpses of his face, hands, drumsticks. There will be much sweat, tears, blood, the drumsticks will become instruments of torture inflicted by the young man to himself. If love for music was the initial motivation to take up this strenuous activity, he has moved far beyond it at the film's outset. Miles Teller plays Andrew, an ambitious young musical student moving into the dark realm of obsession, willing to throw away family, friendship, love in pursuit of that elusive dream and nightmare of being someone special, being remembered, not fading into oblivion when his tombstone is erected.

As expounded on, a year before Whiplash, in Blue is the Warmest Color, we all want guidance, a mentor, in this unknowable world and we try to find that in various outlets; one of those being our teachers and educators. Damien Chazelle's sophomore feature Whiplash begins with Andrew (Miles Teller) coming to think he has found that person in the demanding, hot-tempered and never-satisfied force-of-nature that is enigmatic Jazz Band Conductor Terrance Fletcher (J.K Simmons). There is the old introspective exercise of listing the most difficult teachers to get through their classes, then listing the teachers you got the most out of when you were their student, most of the time with those lists coinciding with one another one-to-one. It speaks to the things that push our limits actually in fact come to define who we are.",

A great film is one which still leaves you thinking about it after it is over, and that is exactly what this film did for me. The film is about a student (Miles Teller) in a musical boarding school who gets a chance to play in the school's best conductor's (J.K. Simmons) band. The problem though lies with the instructor as he is very abusive towards his students. How the student plays in the band is what forms the plot of the film. Miles Teller is great as Andrew, the student who gets a chance to play in the band. He showcases in this movie why he is one actor we should pay attention to in the future as he has the potential to be one of the best actors of his time. The director Chazelle has done a fantastic job in keeping the audience glued to their seats and keeps us guessing what the next move by one of the character's will be. But at the end of the day, the film belongs to one person and one person only: J.K. Simmons. Simmons plays Terrence Fletcher, the abusive music conductor in the band. His intense performance leaves you in awe just by the intensity of his character. It is no surprise he got the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It almost seemed he was destined to play this role. In the end of the day, Whiplash is an excellent movie and one in which no one should ignore. Watch it for the story as well as the performances.",
614,2 April 2018,user-164-801886,10, Not as far wrong as people seem to think,"Minor spoilers
I know there are already plenty of reviews for this film, but a lot of the low scores are from people who say they don't believe the very premise of the story.
I have also studied music. In fact, I am also a drummer. Music school wasn't like this for me, but high school really was. I was never physically struck, but the threat of it was real enough, and the humiliation suffered in front of the other musicians was traumatic and the memory is painful enough more than 30 years later now that this was a hard movie to watch and yet I couldn't look away. This was so close to what I went through in high school that I would easily believe it if someone were to tell me that my high school band career was the source material.
J.K. Simmons, amazing in everything, was easily as good here and I could only wish that I could have had the strength of character and self confidence that Miles Teller's character demonstrates in this film. I loved the relationship he has with his father (pleasant surprise performance by Paul Reiser), but the general lack of support from a family that mostly doesn't understand his dream is also totally believable and is pretty common for musicians from a non-musical family. This was one of my favorite movies in a while. I just kept yelling at the screen, ""I KNOW!! Right???"" See this movie, and BELIEVE it.",

J.K Simmons as the teacher is amazing. Harsh, but you can see where is coming from. That anger, and desire to help students succeed.

620,28 January 2015,CleveMan66,7," ""Whiplash"" is exceptional filmmaking, but is just about one minute too long.","What price success? That's basically the question asked in ""Whiplash"" (R, 1:47). Is there such a thing as being TOO focused on a goal? How about pushing someone too hard to reach his potential? When does motivation become abuse? We've probably all either had a goal for which we were willing to sacrifice nearly everything, or had a parent, a coach, a teacher or a boss push us to the point where we wondered if it was all worth it. Well, what happens when those last two conditions are present in the same situation? Can we expect the result to be excellence – or tragedy – or both? Miles Teller plays Andrew Neimann, a freshman at an extremely prestigious (but fictional) music school in New York City, called the Shaffer Conservatory. Miles is a jazz drummer who is determined not just to BE great, but to be one of THE greats. His only friend is the single father (Paul Reiser) who raised him. He doesn't have friends or girlfriends. He needs to be free to focus on his music. He practices obsessively and things only get worse when he comes to the attention of Shaffer's most demanding professor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who picks Andrew for the school's very exclusive Studio Band. Fletcher makes the drill sergeant in 1987's ""Full Metal Jacket"" look like a purring kitten. Andrew literally gives Fletcher his blood, sweat and tears, but he never seems to be able to fully please his mentor. Fletcher regularly abuses all his students – emotionally and even physically – especially Andrew. It's Fletcher's idea of motivation. He sees it as necessary to bring out greatness, and greatness is what Andrew covets, but this relationship is not exactly mutually beneficial. It's toxic. And combustible. As the tension builds, Andrew even seems on the path to becoming as rude and cruel as Fletcher – if Fletcher doesn't destroy him in the process. It seems just a matter of time before someone snaps. Inevitable.",

626,19 November 2016,cdjh-81125,9, A Powerful Film That Anyone Can Relate To,"First thing to know before reading this review: I am not a fan of music, I have never seen the appeal of it and have never been a musician, but despite that I loved this movie, mainly because it's not just a movie about music, it's a movie about a man trying to find his place in life and everything that gets in his way. The way in which this film explore, dreams and ambitions is what makes this movie relatable because we've all had passions in our lives, things we've wanted to achieve and the way this film addresses that is beautiful and allows us to get behind the main character more. Miles Teller as Andrew in this movie gives the greatest performance of his entire career, not only is he excellent in the drumming scenes but he was also great at portraying his characters drive to be the best and his inner demons and struggles. But really JK Simmons performance stole this movie. Simmons won The Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for this film and I've seen few performances more deserving of such an Honor, he's absolutely terrifying in this movie, but he doesn't just rely on some quick dialogue and one liners to carry his performance, the character is also a deep one, while you never agree with his actions you understand why he goes to such extreme lengths to motivate his students. I also was surprised at how much I loved the romance in this movie, the love story is a way for us to see how much drumming is effecting Tellers character and I also thought Melissa Beniost was really good in this film. You wouldn't think it but this movie is incredibly intense mainly because of Simmons amazing performance but because you understand the stakes of getting every note and key right. Few movies have had a more perfect ending than this one, the stakes are high but thanks to the perfectly developed characters and everything coming full circle the physiological warfare that goes on between these two characters comes to a perfect and satisfying end that left me in amazement. I only have a few flaws with this film and is mainly some of the minor characters they're just horrible people for no reason and tear Andrew down just for the sake of it and they could have been given more depth.

Simmons and Myles Teller because I feel they did great and surely the final movie wouldn't be so good without them. In general the entire cast was good but the movie is heavy centred around the two actors previously mentioned. But the real ""x-factor"" is Damien Chazelle who wrote a great screenplay and then thanks to an energetic and electric direction he involves the wathcers into this story. This is about the psychological fight between a drum student (Teller) and his professor (Simmons) and it isn't something intricated or difficult. Indeed is simple but it is executed so well, with a great characterisation of the protagonists, that this semplicity becomes a plus. And finally since this film is about music the score and the jazz songs present in the movie are really important and even in this aspect the quality is really high.

In Whiplash, an ambitious, driven young man thinks he has found the mentor to take him to the top, but the teacher's methods become increasingly unhinged. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons give outstanding performances that fuel this high-octane piece. Standards of sanity are never relevant here; it is all about how far you can go, how much you can take. Two strong personalities knock hard against each other with no give expected, till a conciliation, or symbiosis, emerges in the end. For me, the only plothole was the fact that Fletcher's violence came as a surprise. In every school there is a teacher who is fearsome and that earns them a reputation. Fletcher's 'methods' would have been the talk of the campus - for Andrew to finally gain entry to that classroom having heard nothing of Fletcher's violence and vitriol was a beat that badly deflated the narrative.

Regardless of any complaints I might have, to finally witness a film again that makes good on the promise of all those remarks about how 'astounding,' 'exhilarating' and 'electrifying' it is, is a breath of fresh air. Whiplash reminds me of Black Swan. Both films deal with an (unhealthy) desire to achieve artistic perfection. There's a key difference in the way both films handle this theme, however, which I think is crucial to understand why Whiplash is ultimately the superior filmbut more on that later.",

In the real world someone who would conduct themselves in such a manner would have been arrested and charged for emotional and physical abuse.

It is a fictional story with a well-written script, played by high caliber actors. Although Whiplash is not Best Picture material, it is worth seeing for the outstanding performances by the main two actors. JK Simmons absolutely deserved Best Supporting Actor for his role. I've been a Simmons fan for a long time, although many people are probably just now learning who he is. But in my opinion, the story is not really about him. In life, we all run into toxic people from time to time. How you deal with them says a lot about who you are.

The performances are beyond incredible with J. K. Simmons being a clear standout. The complexity of his character is beautifully matched with the flair of a performance he gives, making it a passionately human portrayal. The editing immerses the audiences into the stress and tension of the setting making each note of an instrument played have the equivalence of a rapid heartbeat. The story invokes the feeling of originality, exploring the ideas of obsession and what that can do to a person. Although for the majority of the film much of it is executed in an artistic and brilliant manner, the romance between the protagonist and the love interest fell flat in its depiction. The drama between them was not fully explored, leading to a break-up that lacks an emotional response from its audience. Besides that, the artistic exploration of the film's themes, the performances that illustrate it and the structure of the overall project, ultimately will leave a high emotional feeling of tension and stress for any audience member.",

The performance by J.K. Simmons is terrifying, easily the best supporting role of the year. The amount of passion he brings to the movie is incredible, even during his 'lighter' moments, his persona is none the less intimidating and frightening at all moments of the movie. He is without a doubt the heart and soul of the movie, take that with a grain of salt. It's pretty crazy to see a movie about music and instruments pack so much energy and passion, when most action movies can't deliver this kind of tension. ",

Despite everything Fletcher puts him through during the film, he still chases his dream right until the end, and it's that drive that keeps the film engaging and keeps the stakes high. JK Simmons is obviously phenomenal in what is probably one of my all time favourite performances, but Miles Teller also kills it in his role aswell. I've had the song Whiplash stuck in my head since this rewatch, but the actual score is also really great and sticks in the head well. The dialogue is probably the strongest element - every line hits so hard, from simple conversations to the larger concert scenes.

The performances were very good but the best part about it was that it got me to thinking. First, the student, played by Miles Teller, and the teacher, played by J.K.

If he didn't work hard before that, how could he think of it. In this way we grow, thorns and bumps everywhere. Maybe something that is important to you is very important to others.

There's no soul in the main character's musical drive--he doesn't do it for his love of music, but more for his desire for fame. When he gets rejected, he goes home and takes down all the posters of his drumming idols and disassembles his drum kit. Now, I might just be a novice drummer, but if I got let go from this asshole teacher's band, I would be much happier for it and continue drumming for fun, on my own accord. The kid doesn't seem to listen to much except the technical side of drumming (Buddy Rich), and focuses more on how fast he can hit the drum rather than how to incorporate the drums into the rest of the music. This movie makes it seem like the drummer is supposed to hog the show, or at least it celebrates it at the end.

I still enjoyed it nonetheless. But upon watching it again, with a little more maturity and understanding of musical drive under my belt, I can call this movie a great movie without a shadow of a doubt in my mind. As a musician myself, I understand the desire to want to be ""one of the greats"", and this movie acts out on that feeling in a way I never knew describable. I loved Miles Teller's character's drive to be one of the greats. He's put down a legendary performance and became someone every musician wants to be. And J. K. Simmons rocked his part in pushing his students to be the best they could be. And while his methods were intense and what most would would consider wrong and evil (and rightly so, don't get me wrong), I think he put down the perfect balance of antagonist and teacher. Every moment in the movie made for a suspenseful movie, but that ending is something out of this world. It's perfect, and I understand that better now thankfully. It's amazing to see every second of the movie come together and show off just how each character made that moment come to life.

696,2 April 2016,guilhermejunior,8, J. K. Simmons,"""Whiplash"" is no more nor less than a movie worthy of at least one Oscar award. If not for best Sound Mixing, than at least (and especially this one) for best actor in a supporting role. I rate the movie as a ""8 out of 10"", and no, it's not because of its argument, that is not (AT ALL) original, or even the great role Miles Teller plays. It's definitely because of the great, the one and only, J.K. Simmons. The whole point of the movie, and the reason why it is getting such good ratings, is the adrenaline that it makes the audience feel. The viewers feel what the main character feels, and are excited about his musical journey with his teacher, and that only happens, due to the role of Simmons. He makes us fear him, and that is a great thing in a movie like this. After seeing this masterpiece I looked for information on this actor, and it surprised me a lot, seeing that the ""monster"" he has shown to us in ""Whiplash"", is in fact a very nice and interesting person. Congratulations to the production, and to all the present actors, but the merit this movie deserves is due to him. It is also to mention the great sound mixing and absolutely outstanding role played by Teller. The only weak aspect is the ending.

It also takes some unexpected and fascinating turns that add to the story and help keep our interest. The characters are greatly crafted, particularly Andrew and Fletcher. This leads to us really empathizing with Andrew and understanding his obsession but his feelings as well. In my case, I could feel what Andrew was feeling, due to the great job done scriptwise. The climax is intense. My only, very small complain is one of Andrew's supposed flaws: he can't have friends since e doesn't see the point of it. We comments on that with Nicole and then again with his family at diner. However, we don't really see him refuse to make a friend. He certainly doesn't have friends, but not because he refuses to, but because the other people are jerks. Anyway, that is a very small thing and doesn't really affect the greatness of this movie.",

Mentally they challenge you beyond your limits, but when is it enough. How far can you be pushed before you reach your breaking point? How much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve your dreams? Is there a point where it becomes too much, Whiplash is the perfect explorer of the previous points, it gives you examples, but not a concrete answer, that's up to you to decide.",

I had put off watching this movie for a few years already because I didn't think I would like it too much, I was wrong. The movie had me on the edge of my seat, which is an interesting win for a movie that's about the struggle of instrument players in the music industry. Such strong performances too from J. K.

711,11 July 2020,loukauf,8, The camera movement!THE EDITING!THE MUSIC!!!,"Wow, stressful, thrilling, captivating and ultimately satisfying. From the very moment Whiplash begins I was instantly both terrified and gripped by that opening drum solo. Within five minutes of the film I felt I knew everything about Andrew. Unlike Sergio Leone this film uses up every second of its runtime to tell its story. I won't go through the whole plot but musical numbers play a big part in the story , and while people often say ""a picture paints a thousand words"" I believe a song tells a million. There are many sequences in the film where songs are used to tell the story and I honestly felt I understood what was happening more than if the characters were talking.And nearly as impressive I never noticed when the dialogue stopped and the song begun , it was that seem less. In the final 10 minute crescendo of the film the camera and the editing reach their peak the the camera moved and cut to other shots was nearly as gripping as the music in a way reminiscent of Wes Anderson. This film exceeded my (very high) expectations , as I'm watching it in my challenge to watch the top 50 films on IMDb.",

Those three body fluids essentially represent this entire masterclass of cinematography. The fact of the matter is that we can all relate to having a strict teacher.

Fletcher is an eccentric, charismatic, harsh, indifferent asshole. He is the best teacher and the worst person the same time, so it's always intense to be in the same room with him.

But I have to admit that Fletcher's methods are effective and also very terrible, because it is difficult for everyone to guarantee that they will not be abandoned halfway. Fletcher didn't believe in the warm encouragement, he said: There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job. What he pursues is to force the musicians beyond their own limits with absolutely necessary brutal means, and they will never be discouraged by pressure. All the wonderful and amazing appearances come from long-term preparation and unremitting efforts. Therefore, without paying hard work and persevering with perspiration, tears, or even blood, how can you achieve a remarkable life?",

Call it a drama, and be done with it. But, so original, and so brilliant, that it's a must see. JK Simmons is outstanding, as always. The support cast is passable, to be honest. But, the story and the presentation are just beautiful. An aspiring drummer is pushed to his limits by the jazz orchestra director, Simmons. All in all, the story raises some important questions that are rarely explored. What makes greatness? It is certainly not talent alone. As director and teacher, Fletcher (Simmons) knows that greatness comes form within, and from an abiding and fearless place that is fueled only by desire. Anyone who doesn't have the drive and the confidence will never achieve anything beyond the space he is assigned. And, so, with out protagonist.",

737,6 May 2019,gufi-04429,8, what a tension!,"All the way through the whole movie I felt so intense, my stomach was in knots. But the tension is one of the many great things this movie can offer. It's original and the performances are so good that they make the atmosphere kind of painful to watch but in the same time everything is just somehow inspirational. That's what surprised me the most. You see the tears, you see the blood. You see that madness for success. And you tell yourself ""That's crazy. He's sick."" but in the same time it motivates you to be better in the things you do, to follow your dreams even if it's hard. But then, maybe I will sound hypocritical, we have only one life and sometimes a person has to think about his priorities in life. I mean, do you really want to suffer and be humiliated for the award to be great? If you are ready to do that then that's okay. But if you don't want that that's okay too. That's what I get from the movie. I feel like Whiplash showed what it takes to be the best - how you have to sacrifice everything and be completely dedicated to your task, but in the same time it showed the ugly side too - how because of success you can't really enjoy anything else, how you limit yourself from so many great things. So with so much truth and amazing acting, I can't say anything else than that this movie deserves to be watched.",

739,3 October 2021,kwb-94477,10, Whiplash Review,"In Whiplash, Andrew Nieman is a young drummer entering his first year of college. Andrew is enrolled at Shaffer Conservatory, the nations leading music college. Andrew enrolls at this school because he wants to be one of, if not the best drummers in the world. He looks up to some of the most famous drummers, specifically Buddy Rich. Andrew comes across Terrance Fletcher, the conductor of Shaffer's studio band. This is a huge honor as only the best musicians at Shaffer play in the studio band. Andrew learns shortly after practicing with the studio band of Fletcher's extremely harsh, and at times, violent manner of instruction. While many of the musicians at Shaffer see this as very negative, Fletcher has his own viewpoint. Terrance Fletcher not only wants his students to play good music, but when they do something wrong, he wants them to know and easily gets under the skin of many of the musicians he is teaching. His goal is to make everyone succeed and does not truly have a line drawn to stop him from completing that goal. Throughout many practices and concerts, Andrew struggles to keep his composure with the strict mentoring from Fletcher. Andrew also starts to change many of normal habits due to his drive to become the best. In the end Andrew will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, and reach the heights of his inspiration, Buddy Rich.",

Well, first of all what decade was this supposed to take place in, because abusing students kind of became unacceptable by the 1990s and they're using cell phones. Secondly, I was expecting a comeuppance. Wasn't that the meaning of the title? There is a kind of a one-uppance, but basically by the end the hero has totally bought into the torturer's worldview. I didn't think that was believable either. He left, ratted out the creep and then goes on to play in his band? No one would do that. In real life he would have just transferred to Berklee.

Someone of them we admired and resented at the same time. Sharing my personal story, I use to have been a professional ballet dancer and had teachers who mentally and physically assaulted me and put me through some of the worst experiences of my life. My first female ballet teacher from age 10 till 13 use to, on a daily bases, would break a wooden ruler on my body or if I was lucky on bodies of someone else in the class. From age 13 till 17 we had psychopathic male teacher who apart from constant psychological abuse, would actually be assaulting us physically, which eventually got him suspended from the school many years later when he unleashed his rage on someone from the younger students who eventually got concussions. Now, those memories of my early ballet training with people that should have never been allowed around children created in me sense of willingness to work hard and succeed in this difficult artistic profession. After 12 years of professional career dancing in some of the best companies in the world, I am able now to forgive the horrors of my youth and try to look for positive spin on the training I had with people that in it's core were full of resentment and pain. They simply found position of power in their relationship with pupils and ultimate power corrupts, specially if they themselves did not had fulfilled careers in the first place.

The film depicts Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young drumming student at the fictional, yet very prestigious Schaffer Conservatory. A teacher at the school, Terrence Fletcher, finds Andrew and adopts him into his band where he proceeds to harass, verbally as well as physically abuse and push Andrew to his absolute limit. The dynamic of the two characters is riveting: A young, yet highly ambitious (he dumps Melissa Benoist to pursue drumming. I mean, you have to be ambitious to dump Melissa Benoist) student attempting to impress his seemingly unimpressible teacher who pushes and pushes Andrew inevitably to his breaking point. Damien Chazelle crafts Andrew's practice scenes exquisitely, often tuning cuts between shots to drum beats hammered out by the sweaty, bloody, and often exhausted Andrew as he wrenches his face and pounds away (once even punching a hole in snare drum out of sheer frustration) at a dilapidated old drum set. Andrew becomes cold, reckless, and violent in his pursuit of ""greatness"" while all this is encouraged by his teacher, pulling him deeper and deeper into an inescapable, sinister, and hopeless rabbit hole.",

I heard about it and thought ""This is gonna be an Oscar caliber film"", Well was I ever more right. This was the most powerful and riveting film I've seen in awhile and I loved it from beginning to end. I have been wanting to see Miles Teller give charged dramatic performance ever since I saw him in 21 and Over because he looked like he had that raw emotional energy. J.K Simmons kills it in this movie and he is absolutely going to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Simmons gives the performance of a life time and he is so powerful and he convinces you he'll push any body to their limits and beyond. The script is fantastic and powerful, Damien Chazelle is just a great young director and he knows how to capture intense powerful moments and he does so with this masterpiece.

The whole story is Andrew being broken down by Fletcher until they realize they're both the key to the other persons' success. But there's really not a concrete beginning, middle, and end. The last scene is the most epic moment in film history, and should be watched 100 times, but then the movie just ends.

The directorial work is also topnotch and technically outstanding. Captivating long shots and masterfully executed camera work draws the audience into this brilliant study into obsession.

I found the story very well entangled with a constant tension that captivates the audience. Although I have to recognize that this tension led sometimes to moments of overstatement (like the moment when Andrew started bleeding while drumming) and this is why I gave it 8 stars and not 9. The movie transmites a very strong message that I think everyone who saw (or will see) this movie, without taking into account whether liked or not, received and thought about it for a couple days. When the movie ended it was almost 3 am and I was very tired but this didn't stopped me from search for the original ""Whiplash"" song by Hank Levy.

The amazing script keeps you engaged from start to finish. The dialogue is so sharp, that I couldn't wait to hear the next words to come out of the characters . Whiplash is one of the most exciting, nonstop dramas I've ever seen. The performances are incredible, with J.k Simmons winning the Oscar for best supporting actor. This film also received an Oscar for its editing, by Tom Cross. The editing in this movie is some of the best ever. At times it is so fast paced and exciting that it almost turns orchestra performances into action scenes. Seriously this movie is all about music and jazz, but the intensity, thrill and unpredictable nature, keeps you on edge the entire runtime. The music by Justin Hurwitz as well as a few other composers, really creates a fast paced jazz feel, as well as elevates moments of sadness and depression experienced by the main character. This movie shows that big budgets don't always mean great films. This movie relies on pure talent and great writing to keep the audience engaged, as opposed to explosions and CGI. Whiplash is one of my favourite movies of all time so there for I give it a 10.",

I honestly don't understand why it's so good. Like it actually boggles my mind. Like I think about it almost everyday. And the one thing that really pops out to me the most is probably the cinematography and lighting. I never thought that the color orange would be such an amazing color in a movie. But it really captures the drama, and hardship of both these characters. And the way they filmed it is just hecking amazing. And we can't forget the acting. I had always loved Jk Simmons before this movie came out, I remember watching him in the Spider-Man movies and he would make me just laugh my butt off. But in this movie, oh my god is it just astounding on how good one person can act. And also miles teller gives the best performance of his career and he doesn't get enough credit, I think he definitely deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his work. And this is coming from an 18 year old, yes I did see this movie when I was 12, but even then I knew that they were doing something right.

798,4 February 2020,Andy_MJD,10, Whiplash: A jazzy masterpiece,"An absolutely incredible movie about a jazz drummer determined to become one of the greats. While not accurately representing how jazz musicians train (nobody goes until their hand bleeds, that is counter-productive, in fact, but as said by Adam Neely, real practice is really boring and hard to romanticize (e.g. practicing scales for 5 hours, like Adam Neely did). I refer to (can you guess who?) Adam Neely's video on this movie, as I found it to be much more educated than any of my thoughts could've been. Cinematographically, the movie is absolutely incredible (lots of depth of field and interesting camera angles), and the color palettes are fantastic. The main character is difficult to only root for or hate for: he's quite nuanced, and can be a dick, and makes decisions most people would never agree with (dumping his girl because he needs more time), but we also understand his desire, and we respect his determination and drive to become one of legend. J.K Simmons' performance as the abusive teacher that pushes for greatness and perfection, nothing less, is one of the most powerful in cinema history and one of my favorites.

810,23 February 2021,judemcrobbie,9," Lots of floors, but I don't care!","The colour correction through the movie is magical. Changes from almost matrix green to a warm yellow all depending on the setting and how the characters are feeling and interacting with the setting.
The way the movie is shot has this air of improvisation. This is clearly reflective of the jazz they're playing. It's truly a delight to watch as it takes risks having these constant movie shots but boy does it work out.
The writing may not have the snarky genius of pulp fiction or the departed but every line has double, triple meanings packed with subtext and means something to further the plot.
The editing with the little jumps is scary despite just showing music it scares you because of the editing and also because of the fear and angst you gave towards the conductor.
The plot is the only thing letting this movie down. By that I mean it's all over the place. There's not enough foreshadowing or anything to set up some of the plot points.
There is supposedly a romantic subplot, which is clearly alluded to at the start of the film but they spend no more than 3 scenes on it. This pisses me off as it tried to show what an obsession can do to those around you, but it did not develop it enough and so it took away from the movie rather than adding onto it.
None of the acting in the movie is particularly stand out. JK Simmons is the best of the two it centred around but he really just played himself. Miles Teller is fine, nothing special but he either can play the drums or did a really good job of faking it. The scenes Melissa Benoit is in, she takes over the scene entirely with little to no dialogue. This further supports my point of the romantic subplot needing to be fullfilled. The movie is targeted to 15 and above so you can do over 2 hours, which this movie really could have used to fill all the plot points. The family plot and everything. Also the ending is brilliant but then he shouldn't have included the scene where he calls Nicole if it wasn't going to play out.
Like I said the ending feels deep and meaningful, bringing a whole arc to Andrew and basically summing up the movie of how music can make a difference in the lives of others.
The plot holes don't annoy you too much as the movie is more a love letter to jazz than a whole movie about the protagonist, him just being a medium we see it through.
Obviously the music is majestic.
It's filled with holes, the plot must be just all out of whack, but the rest of it is so special and magical that you do not care.",

Don't get me wrong, I think Birdman is a 10/10, but this was more of a 10/10 I suppose, with Birdman I well definitely give credit where credit is due, like the acting and cinematography were top notch, it's amazing how it was done in one shot (i know it actually wasn't, you don't have to tell me) But I feel like Whiplash will accompany my thoughts long after seeing it, just cause of how complex it is, maybe I didn't understand Birdman, and when I do I'll change my mind, right now this is not the case.

And we are talking about a movie focused on playing the drums. No murder plots, explosions, sex scenes, etc... simply a tight, well-told story. Fast cuts help move the plot along and it never drags. Surprises and twists make this a phenomenal movie that forces you to go back and analyze everything that happened. The music is great. I think that is really important because the sound becomes a character that helps tell the story. The greatest part is this movie is not a niche movie, it's not limited to ""band geeks"". I'd say it is identifiable to anyone who has worked in any way to be the best at something. Whiplash tells the story of a man who wants to be the best and shows the cost and torture he will endure to seek that goal. The language is vulgar, but even this serves a purpose; is our teacher abusive or tough with good intentions?",

Thanks! With all the music in the movie it was hard to sit still. The movie was built like the song whiplash itself. It started out nicely with miles being a drum-student at a fortunate music school. On the way it got more and more intense. The real 'forte' started with him putting his drumming way above his relationship, but came to an ultra height when he got hit by the truck. Still keep on trying to make it he forced himself. Then prepping for the final hits he came back stronger and more deliberate than anything I've ever seen before. With an outstanding performance at the end I am sure he will make it at the top. The movie showed the two sides of success as kids have to fight these days to compete. A study in medicine, music, business, to make it to the top there is no taking it easy. But is it worth it?? That question is portrayed quite well in the movie to my opinion.",

Almost forgot there's a short before this movie with same name, filmed in 2013, the director took it to the sundance festival after that he was able to make this one with a bigger budget.",
823,29 July 2018,wijajo-72563,10, All Round Good Film With An Amazing J.K. Simmons,The characters were believable and the set up unique. J. K. Simmons was amazing in in his portrayal of the relentless Terrence Fletcher.,
824,13 February 2015,cerca-sonia,10, One of the best films I've ever seen!,"Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film with lot to teach: never give up, pursue your dream, no matter what. Damien Chazelle, young and talented, becomes part of the history of cinema with this thrilling, exciting masterpiece. The constant drumming that stays with us for almost the entire film is amazing. There are many good film at the Oscar this year, but this is one of the few that moved me: at some point, I started crying and I couldn't stop and that doesn't happen to me very often. Miles Teller is surprisingly good, actually he is fantastic and this is his best performance so far. J.K. Simmons delivers a flawless and astonishing performance, which got him a Golden Globe for best supporting actor, and an Oscar nomination, which surely will turn into a win.",
825,27 November 2021,billymcclean,6, Nothing special,"This film has been on my list forever and I finally got a chance to watch it. It works. Frankly, it is a little overrated and the ending plays out in a way to almost nullify the whole film but yeah, I can see why people hold it in such high regards but I don't.",
826,12 April 2020,wangzhaodeyu-27083,9, Represses,A strong sense of rhythm and almost distorted spatial force. It's a great movie.,
827,26 August 2017,lesdroits,9," A real emotional ride, superbly done.","One of the most surprisingly simple yet incredibly intense movies I can recall, with incredible acting, incredible cinematography (no wasted visual moment, just cut right to where you are meant to be for the next development, and snappy, non-typical focus). It leaves the viewer with deep questions, especially for driven people such as artists, if not everyone. It very much catches you up from the first scene, and carries you through to an ending which is emotionally satisfying yet philosophically questionable. ",
828,20 May 2021,frxbecker,10, Incredible! One of my favorite movies of all time,This movie is so good I was sitting in silence for 10 minutes after finishing it.,
829,14 August 2020,abbi_1997,10, Simply the best,If you love jazz and movies this film would be the closest you'd ever get to perfection. J.K. Simmons delivers his best acting performance throughout his career.,
830,6 December 2014,daniell san,9, exceeded my expectations,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and I have to say, it did not disappoint! I have seen a lot of movies this year, but this is the best I've seen so far. The actors all do a great job. Teller is great as an aspiring drummer. His drumming is amazing. J.K. Simmons really steals the show. He is absolutely great in this movie. It won't surprise me if he takes home an Oscar for his performance. The music is great as well, if you like jazz. The movie builds up to a climax and it delivers. The final scene of this movie is the best ending I've seen in a long time. Most of the times movies don't live up to your expectations. I'm glad to say that this one did more than meet my expectations. I recommend it to anyone, even if you don't like jazz.",
831,30 May 2020,ines_fr,9, Intense and realistic,"As someone that wanted to persue art as a career and worked beyond my limits for long years, this movie is really close to my heart.",
832,16 December 2018,The_Sonuverse,9," If you're passionate about something, you'll achieve it",Very emotional and compelling story-line with amazing actor portraying astounding characters. Its a shame to say anything against it!,
833,25 February 2015,roygray42,6, It's a 2 character movie. And they ain't buddies...,"There are only 2 type of people who will enjoy WHIPLASH. Real Drummers and folk close to them, and masochists. How does a musician - any musician, actually - become the best that he can be? Practice, right? Obvious stuff. Well, that's kind of the theme of this movie. J. K. Simmons is a perfectionists band teacher dedicated to getting the best he can out of his college age jazz students. He 'is a DI' in the real sense of the term - totally reminded me of Drill Instructor I suffered under in the Marine Corps. His chosen student, Miles Teller, will become 'the greatest' jazz drummer ever or die trying. And that is JK's mission and the story. Add lots of foul language and physical abuse and way too much solo drumming and you've got this movie. Not fun too watch, not fun too listen too. Not much of an Academy Award worthy movie, really. And, the ending is not believable either...",
834,4 March 2023,Cichy77,9, A suspenseful movie,"An amazing and intense film that attracts with its plot that focuses on Neyman who is a young ambitious drummer who is capable of anything to achieve perfection. In the film, we see the famous jazz instructor Fletcher, who is strict and merciless, pushes his students to their limits by humiliating them. The key to the film is the music which, combined with emotional scenes and effects, is able to create an immersive experience. In short, the film is brilliant and keeps you in suspense from the beginning to the very end, and goes straight to the heart, I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.",
835,29 March 2015,bill-gentile,10, Simply the best I've seen in a long time!,"WOW...this was an awesome movie. Excellent story and acting as well. This drew me in from the first scene and it got better all the way to the end. Who knew that the pivotal scene in the movie would be the extraordinary performance on the drum solo!! I'm not sure why it didn't get Best Picture, but it certainly earned an Oscar from me.",
836,20 January 2021,aharon-izraeli,10, One of the best movies I've ever seen.,"Just watch it. You don't have to know anything about jazz or drumming. If you enjoy superb acting in a well written movie this is the one to watch. Amazing performance by the young lead and his mentor, with Paul Reizer giving a great performance as the father. I can't recommend this movie highly enough.",
837,8 March 2020,binhosan,10, One of the Best of All Time,"This film contains all we need in high level: directing, writing, sound, editing, movement, twists, drama, tension, energy, hero, antihero, characters...we go with the wave/vibe.
Man, this is wonderful. Thanks for the class. This is PHd.",
838,12 January 2015,vix_sponge,9," Magnetic, radical and profound.","This is not a film about music. It is a film about pure ambition, hard work, perseverance and raw determination. It is magnetic, radical and profound. And thousands of people are delirious about it. I don't blame them. ",

841,19 April 2015,rugby-is-awsome,9, Brilliant for lovers of drama.,"Absolutely amazing film. Expect no pandering to the audience with run of the mill scenes of joyfulness and positive reinforcement which is so common in the modern film. Instead expect real grit and emotive acting in this dramatic, real and slightly psychotic film. Very good performances by the two main actors, portraying the student and teacher respectively, by Miles Teller and J.K Simmons. Even though this film is about playing an instrument essentially, you will be both eyes glued to the screen in anticipation of what happens next as it could be a great thing or a negative thing, acknowledging that not everything in real life is sunshine and lollipops if you're not willing to work at it. But there is also the opposite end of the spectrum...",
842,5 November 2019,Hasan_m9620,9, best movie from chazelle,It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs. chazelle is the best new director and knows how to makes strong drama.,
843,21 November 2018,Marthian80,9, A must see with strong character performances,"I went in this movie thinking it would be a 'feel good' movie about a young drummer getting to make a career. This movie does tell that story, but there is not much to feel good about after the credits roll..",
844,22 February 2017,ShadowRomeo1784,8, An Superb Film About A Teenager And His Passion,"My Personal Rating - 7.8/10 - My Second Best Film of 2014 After Interstellar. another film that has good cinematography, good character development, the story is alright but that is not what makes this movie good. the acting and the character development cinematography are what make's this film great. if you are a musician then i'm pretty sure you will like this film, hell i'm not even a musician but i like the film. so it's a good movie and it worth's your time.",
845,9 August 2015,pupupupmf,10, Remember that teacher you where terrified of that you used to love?,"When I first saw the trailer of Whiplash and all the praising reviews it was getting, I knew we were onto something really good and something different. I'm even more so excited when it's an awards season movie that was written, directed and based on a short film of the same name and concept by a fresh young director (Damien Chazelle, 29 yrs old when he was directing it), one of the youngest best picture nominee director for a matter of fact, which shows that he's a keeper with loads of potential and that this movie is very personal to him so he won't let the Producer's Hollywood edit process cliché ruin his vision.",
846,11 January 2015,mrshev,10, Mesmerising journey of a young drummer.,Drumming! Really! Who knew it could be so exciting. This is a superb film with standout performances at every stage and the script fizzes off the screen continually self referencing and catching the arcs as you spot them and they come to fruition - this is a masterclass in how to pen a screenplay.,
847,26 January 2015,Matt-144-792009,9," Painfully Inspiring Masterpiece, Whiplash will leave its mark on you.","In Whiplash, Miles Teller plays Andrew, a freshman at a very prestigious and exclusive music program in New York. His talent and work ethic gets him noticed by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) who invites him to be part of the schools award winning jazz band. Although once a part of the band Andrew learns how extreme Fletcher's teaching methods are in getting the great performances he demands. Don't call it a comeback J.K Simmons has been here for years. J.K. Simmons has been the unsung hero of movies for years. It's great to see the man get his day in the sun. From Juno (2007), Extract (2009), Up in the Air (2009) to the Spiderman franchise J.K. never disappoints. He plays grumpy sarcastic to an art form. In Whiplash we get the J.K. we love at fever pitch. He is the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket (1987) and a little of Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka (1971) without the whimsy and all the sadism. J.K.s is a phenomenal stand out performance that transcends the movie and creates this force of nature character that is unforgettable. Not to take anything away from Miles Teller. His drive and determination are similar to Rocky (1976) or Rudy (1993). This film is inspirational on par with them. Relative new comer director Damien Chazelle nails this film. His tempo is right on key, this film does not drag or lead. It is air tight storytelling at its finest. It's also great to see Paul Reiser getting some work. He is great as Andrew's father Jim. I also think that after watching this movie, I have a new found respect for drumming. Gone are the days of me using the drum solo at concerts to go use the restroom. This film really inspired me. Have you ever had a boss, mentor, coach or teacher who pushed you to the edge? Someone you grew to despise because of how hard they were on you. If so, you must see this movie. There is a line in the film where J.K. Simmons says, the worst thing you can tell a person is ""that's good."" We live in a society that gives way too much credit to mediocrity. This film is a harsh commentary on America's, everyone gets a trophy policy. To sharpen a knife you need a hard surface to sharpen it against. Some may say J.K. Simmons character Fletcher is a bully in this film. I say we need more positive bullies. Now I'm not taking about jerks who pick on the handicapped or beat up small kids for their lunch money. We need mentors who will push people to their limit to get greatness. To steal and alter a quote from Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas) in Wall Street (1987) ""The point is, ladies and gentleman, that Bullying, for lack of a better word, is good. Bullying is right, bullying works. Bullying clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.And bullying, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA."" Now it's amusing to transpose bulling and greed for the sake of a point here, but that is the overall message of this film. The minute we think we have it all we come complacent, that can be linked to the decline of all greatness in the world. You have to stay hungry and competitive. Another great quote comes from Orson Wells in The Third Man (1949) that I think illustrates this point perfectly. ""Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."" Push hard to greatness dear friends. Our great country desperately needs more of it. ",
