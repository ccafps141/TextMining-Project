0,11 December 2016,jacobs-greenwood,10," Pure cinematic magic, won Best Picture of the Year and rightfully so!","Capitalizing on two ""hot"" properties of the early sixties, director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews, this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since, especially the sequences which feature the songs ""Do Re Mi"" (#88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time) through the streets of Salzburg and ""The Lonely Goatherd"", performed with puppets.",/
1,26 October 2017,davispittman,10, Fantastic family friendly musical classic,"The Sound of Music (1965) is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music.",r

She's wonderful!,"Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing ""Few Favorite Things"" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.",v
4,12 April 2017,duffjerroldorg,10, We are alive with The Sound Of Music,"Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: ""It makes you feel alive"" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.",i

6,2 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, How do you solve a problem like Maria?,"I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox",w

13,2 February 2002,gerry-russell-139,10, It just gains more and more fans every year,"""The Happiest sound in all the world""? Quite possibly and easily the most famous musical film in Hollywood history. Most of us grown-ups still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year anymore). Julie Andrews takes her MARY POPPINS success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin originated on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could. In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, Martin was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage version and Andrews was 30 when the transition came to film came around--a perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented: Christopher Plummer in the role he will be forever remembered for (even though he hated the part) is an achingly true Cap. Von Trapp with those ""hidden talents"" making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a comical and yet sincere ""Uncle"" Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our perrenial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as well (esp. the opening scenes which is probably the most beautiful aerial shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public Austrian gardens during the DO-RE-MI sequence). So let's all keep watching this most cherished of all musical films each year and never forget it's universal sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'.",1

OK, go ahead.  Shoot me at twenty paces.  But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure.

My mom laughs at me, since I seem surprised that it's such a good movie. When I was a kid, however, I didn't like it that much, which is why I am always surprised by how wonderful it is when I watch it all grown-up.

20,11 August 2005,silverscreen888,8, Tuneful Score; Honest Emotions; Great Fun and a Flawless Production,"The ""Sound of Music"" is set in the mountainous hills and the city of Salzburg, Austria. There is to my eye at least, something about its spacious alpine countryside which dominates and informs the entire production. The air, the light, the music, the styles of dress, the activities--everything is ""elevated"", with hardly anything being sea-level about it. And the film has a very good ""engagement sequence"" at the opening, when we learn about the central ethical character and experience her leaving the abbey where she has served along with her, and begin to care about her purposes. The story-line is simple and relatively direct: A young nun, unsuited to the profession, takes a job as a governess to the children of a difficult client--a captain in the Austrian navy who runs the household like a ship's company of sailors, complete with a bosun's whistle and a lineup of the children in matching uniforms. The body of the piece is then concerned with Maria, the governess, subverting the household and winning over the Captain until he gives up his present lady friend, a Baroness; then when Maria, who has been falling in love with him, goes away and comes back, he has to tell her he is in love with her also. They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple ""Eidelweiss"" ballad to ""How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria"" , ""Do Re Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""I Have Confidence"", ""The Lonely Goatherd"", ""Something Good"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" and the voice-challenging ""Climb Every Mountain"". Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway ""book"" by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max. Ben Wright was the Nazu gauleiter, Peggy Wood the Mother Superior, and among the nuns were Anna Lee, voice-dubbing soprano Marni Nixon, Evadne Baker and Portia Nelson., In the cast also were Daniel Truhitte, Norma Varden, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, with the children Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Angela Cartwright, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath. It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience. There is much to be admired in the simplicity and the beautiful imagery of this film; if it is not an artistic masterpiece, it is frequently absorbing, moving and unaffected all at the same time.",e
21,28 March 2021,auuwws,10, The Sound of Music,"The best musical movie I watched, and I really enjoyed watching it and I liked all the main characters in the film, although the film was 3 hours long, but I felt some scenes very quickly in events, and the songs in the film were very beautiful, when I watched the film I was watching it with high expectations, but the film was able To exceed my expectations of its level.",f
22,17 September 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,8," I had low expectations but this was just wonderful, especially Julie Andrews.","The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness.",_

It feels, to me at least, kind of redundant trying to even write a review of it now. So really I just want to say that as a mid-forties cinema loving man I revisited the film recently for the first time in about 15 years and found it still had a magical kind of hold over me.

26,1 January 2018,jeremychan-63517,10, New era of musical film,"In thinking of The Sound of Music, one of the first things that comes to your mind might be soundtracks like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss, ""So Long, Farewell"". The Sound Of Music did not only win the best original score, but along another nine academy awards. Best Picture, Best director, Best film editing, Best sound mixing, Best actress, Best supporting actress, Best cinematography, Best costume design, Best production design. 
The Sound of Music might be the most perceptible work of Robert Rise, Time Magazine described it as 'most popular attraction in the first half-century of the Hollywood feature film'. The justification is considerable. This movie does not forms part of this generation's childhood memories, but also brings fond memories for older generations. ",_
27,25 February 2015,ironhorse_iv,8, The Hills are still alive with the Sound of Music! This movie is amazing!,"The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which in return is based off, the memoir of Maria von Trapp, 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers' in which two previous movies were made. 1956's the Von Trapp-Family & 1958's Von Trapp in America. This movie is very loosely based on true events, but it didn't stop from this beloved musical directed and written by Robert Wise to become a huge hit. The film tells the fictionalized love story of Maria Kutschera (Julie Andrews), a young Austrian postulant turn governess whom job is it, to tend to the seven children of the stern widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The children are uncooperative and the captain isn't much help, until Maria wins them over, sharing her love of music, but soon Nazi sympathizers, became to undermine her work, by moving into her beloved Austria and preparing to take over. Can the Von Trapp's family escape or will the Nazis destroy everything, she has work for? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film. The movie seem like it was trying really hard to mirror, the same success as Julie Andrew's previous film, 1964's Mary Poppins by having a similar plot-line. Both movies have a stern disciplinarian father figure that was turned around by a musician gifted nanny. In my opinion, I don't felt like it was a rip-off, because Mary Poppins goes into a more magical journey; while the Sound of Music is a bit more grounded and realistic. While, I like both films, I think the Sound of Music is way better than Poppins. While, the movie is set in the 1930s, Julie Andrew's character is an example of the ever changing woman of the 1960s. She's more open in challenging the standards gender expectations of a woman and how mother should acted. While she's acts like a mother figure, unharness, liberate mindsets and attitudes of the emotionally neglected children. Unlike Julie Andrew's character in Mary Poppins, Maria is more careless and youthful in her actions. She means well, but she tend to become troublesome, due to her challenging the brooding, dignified lifestyle of the times. She willing to challenge the narrow-thinking parenting approach on how the children, should be raise and be more fun-like when doing it. Julie Andrews's character holds this film together. She's convincing, as both the free spirited wild child and semi-authority figure in this film. It's easy to see why so many moviegoers find her as a good mother figure, lover or friend all rolled into one. Meanwhile, Christopher Plummer is spectacular as Captain von Trapp. He played the character who proves to be the film's hard rock. He keeps it solid and grounded between saccharine romance and compelling drama. While, he dislike making the film, his riveting performance feels so believable that you can see him, turn the hardened captain to loving husband and father. He was never too mean, that you couldn't find him likable. While, the movie makes him, mean. Georg von Trapp in real life was pretty outgoing and was the one whom taught the children music. Both parents depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living and why both really got married. Despite that, it kinda work. The children were pretty good in their acting and very cute, but there were too many of them to remember. The only one that had a sub-plot story, was Liesl (Charmian Carr). I enjoys the romantic duet ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" about her. Without spoiling it, her love affect with the post-boy was very shocking and heart breaking. The music in the film are some of the best ever from a musical. The movie is filled with memorable glorious songs like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Climb Every Mountain"", ""Maria"", ""Lonely Goatherd"", ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss, ""So Long, Farewell"" and others. I love the way, each song was reused in different ways in reprises. Other songs like ""Something Good,"" needed some more work. Glad, they eliminated, the not so good songs, ""How Can Love Survive"" and ""No Way to Stop It. The way, the movie is shot is beautiful to watch. The opening shot of the movie of the ALPS mountain range is breath-taking. The movie makes great use of the locations in Austria. It's really hard to find faults in this film. Some critics say the movie is a bit off putting cheery and dated, even in its darkness moments, but in my opinion, I think it does a good job bringing heavy realism. A lot of people might hate its pacing. After all, it's nearly 3 hours. Did we really need the 3rd act? Controversy surrounded the film's release in Germany & Austria, where the film's Nazi overtones brought about the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act due to the laws. The American studio forced the third act to be restored to the German release, which kinda anger people. In my opinion, the whole 3rd act with the Nazis wasn't needed. It really didn't play out like that in real life, nor did it had much music. Most of it was there to offset the general joviality of the first 2 acts. I don't mind, that it's there, but I can see why some people think it's seem out of place, even with the foreshadowing in the first two acts. After all, if you take it, away, you still have a pretty good film. Despite that, I really didn't see much to hate about the film. After all, the film went on to win Academy Awards. It even got selected for film preservation in the National Film Registry. It's also nice to see the movie get newly restored DVDs every ten years. Overall: It's engaging, inspirational and cute. It's a must watch. The ultimate family movie.",u

33,10 April 2012,inkblot11,10," My parents let me see this great movie five times, when I was a child, there were no DVDs","Maria (Julie Andrews) lives in Austria. She grew up in the mountains but now lives at a convent in Salzburg, where she is in study to become a nun. Yet, she is a ""problem"", as the older sisters say, for she sings at the wrong times, is often tardy and runs off to the mountains when she should be studying. Therefore, the Mother Superior decides that Maria should leave the convent for a short time and become the governess for a widower, the Naval Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). He has SEVEN energetic children! This opportunity will give Maria a chance to contemplate whether a life in the abbey is really suited for her. So, off she goes. The children, many times ignored by their grieving father, are brats and try to drive Maria away by putting a frog in her pocket and making her sit on a pine cone. But, they have underestimated their new governess. She points out their misbehavior in a subtle way and wins them over with her kindness. Soon, though, the father goes to visit Vienna, where he may be courting a baroness (Eleanor Parker). While he is gone, Maria makes the kids some play clothes, takes them on picnics and teaches them to sing, things their father has not done. The Captain returns with this new love interest and gives a grand ball in her honor. The kids love it. But, during the event, the Captain and Maria accidentally share a dance and look into each other's eyes. Scared of her feelings, Maria goes back to the convent on the sly. Both the children and their father are heartbroken, for she has become very important to them. Will she return? Will Maria admit her feelings for the gentleman and abandon plans to become a nun? With Hitler in power in Germany, too, will Austria be able to avoid the Nazi sweep across Europe? This beloved film was my childhood favorite. I adored the music, the photography, the cast and everything else about it. My parents even let me go the theater five times to see it, knowing how much I was entranced with the movie. My thanks go out to them. In such a light, its pretty much a given that viewers everywhere, from 4 to 90, will also delight in the flick. As stated, all aspects from the music to the acting to the direction and more, are of superior quality, making it a rare movie indeed.

In 1965's The Sound of Music, the film is practically running with sentimental/saccharine feelings.....and I love the movie every bit for that. This movie is viewed as the best musical of all time, and I can agree to that statement. The word that can describe the movie is joy. From the moment Julie Andrews popped on screen, waving her arms in the air against the beautiful mountain background and beginning the title song, a smile creeped upon my face and it stayed there for two hours and fifty-two minutes. The joy is infectious and each character has a sense of happiness despite the Nazis lurking in the background. This is the type of musical you'll remember forever. I saw this movie once as a child and twenty years later, was able to sing along to such joyful songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss"", ""So Long, Farewell,"" and of course, ""The Sound of Music.""

She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp. Richard Haydn plays an uncle arranging a play, and Peggy Wood plays the head nun. Theme demonstrates the ability to prevail through harsh times when the sound of music conquers opposing factors. Score: 9 / 10",

Having seen at a young age the wonderful Broadway production starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, the movie version that followed greatly enhanced a work, that in its own merit, didn't need any improvement. As directed by Robert Wise, right after his triumphant ""West Side Story"", we were stunned to see how the director had opened up the film by placing the action just where it was supposed to have been taken place, the cinematic and gorgeous Salzburg.",

44,1 February 2021,Bored_Dragon,9, Mary Poppins II,"In 1964, Julie Andrews played the role of the magical governess Mary in the cult musical ""Mary Poppins"", for which she won an Oscar. The following, 1965, she starred in ""The Sound of Music"", also a musical, and again in the role of a governess, Maria, but this time she remained on the nomination. Although ""Mary Poppins"" is a fairy tale, and ""The Sound of Music"" is realistic, the stories essentially have many similarities. The same goes for the characters, especially for the main role, which is why I decided on this title. Both films have excellent cinematography and directing and cheerful, upbeat music full of life. However, as much as they are similar, they won't bore you even if you watch them one after the other. The streets of London and the imaginary landscapes here have been replaced by the endless pastures of the Eastern Alps and the stone of old Salzburg, over which the threat of the Third Reich looms. But don't worry, this is still a feel-good musical and love conquers all, so if you embark on this adventure, expect three hours of positive emotions and pure children's joy captured on film just for your enjoyment.",
45,27 March 2006,evanston_dad,8," ""Springtime for Hitler"" Ain't the Only Show with Singing Nazis","""The Sound of Music"" is easy to ridicule. It's sappy, corny and sentimental to the extreme. It hopelessly simplifies horrible world events, and makes it seem like all anyone needed to do to escape the iron fist of Hitler's regime was to schlep over some hills on a bright, sunny morning and say ""hello"" to Switzerland. But I'm still recommending this movie, because it is one of the most accomplished movie musicals ever made.",
46,17 April 2022,estherwalker-34710,10, Kudos to the last and greatest of the Rogers and Hammerstein incomparable series of musicals for stage and screen.,"Amazingly, perhaps the two best musicals ever with no or minimal stage dancing were released in successive years, 1964 & '65, each winning the Oscar for best picture. Both were essentially yet another take on the classic Cinderella fairy tale, the lead female starting out as a 'nobody', taken under the wing of a domineering bachelor, who either makes a conscious effort to mold her into his ideal woman(""My Fair Lady) or allows himself to fall in love with what she makes of herself and her beauty(this film). Judging by their comparative mean ratings at IMDB and the much greater number of raters for the present film, I have to conclude that the present film is the more popular of the two. Not surprising to me, as it clearly has a more fun screenplay, which includes a variety of children, lacking in the other film.. Captain von Trapp clearly is a much nicer man than the megalomaniacal Henry Higgins, who seems to fall in love with his creation, but doesn't consumate his attraction to her in the film. Captain von Trapp is a changed man, for the better, thanks to Maria's personality. In contrast, Henry Higgins is still the egotistical misanthrope at the end, gloating over his 'impossible' creation.",

I have to say I had forgotten this picture's brilliance. Its story and music are simply timeless, full of captivating plot developments and unforgettable melodies. There were a few moments where the music brought me to tear up. I could hardly stay dry with the divine harmonies sung. There is also not a bad performance in the film. Julie Andrews steals the show of course, but all the kids and Christopher Plummer are splendid as well. The restoration of the original film was beautiful to behold on the silver screen. It looked like a brand new movie. The colors popped and the motion was all very smooth without any visible grain. I was able to experience what an intermission was meant to accomplish in the theaters of old, a chance to purchase concessions and stretch the legs.
This film will always be so dear to my heart and something I could never forget. My 90 year old grandmother recounted her love of this classic as we left the theater.

Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"" and ""Climb Every Mountain.""

I remember at the Academy Theater in downtown Minneapolis, it was the only movie that showed for over a year. People would come back to the small town I lived in and rave about. Because I was a kid with little money and no chance to tool around the big city, I didn't get to see it until it finished its initial run and made it out into the hinterlands. It was breathtaking on wide screen. That opening scene is really impressive. Everybody knows every song. Julie Andrews has always defined perkiness and energy and she carries it off magnificently. There is something missing somewhere. Despite all the great songs, the threat that was Naziism never quite comes through. They are there and they are the worst of the worst, but we never quite feel their power. Even the scene at the Abbey is a little hokey. Watching ""Cabaret"" which is certainly a totally different take, you see what these monsters could be. It is a musical with a little more depth, though not as mainstream. Still, how can you pass on the wonderful songs, the awesome production numbers, the visions of Austria, parading before us. It's a really good movie. I never quite got to the ""great"" part.",

So it was with my class at Armada High School in Michigan. We had to see it on the big screen, and when Julie Andrews twirled into view singing the title song it changed our lives. I don't think anybody could have predicted that more than 50 years later we'd still be humming tunes for this marvelous score by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II. From the opening song to the improbable escape from the Nazis with the assistance of the nuns from the abbey, we are enthralled, viewing after viewing, and I can say with certainty that it has everything to do with the songs. ""My Favorite Things,"" for example, has withstood numerous interpretations, including saxophonist John Coltrane's classic jazz rendition. Yes, the children are cute, Christopher Plummer is handsome, and Julie Andrews enchanting, but it is the songs that make this show: ""Climb Every Mountain,"" ""The Lonely Goatherd,"" ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen,"" ""Something Good,"" ""Do Re Mi,"" ""So Long, Farewell,"" and ""Eidelweiss"" are all memorable and make you want to hear them sung again and again. See if you can spot dubber extraordinaire Marni Nixon as one of the singing nuns.

The lines were witty and well thought out, bringing a dry humor to the film. I loved how it slowly showed how Maria won the hearts of the kids, letting them be kids. Not over rushed or over done, the romantic story of Marie and the Captain was slowly and perfectly done with witty lines as Maria stood up to him without over doing it.

64,6 June 2006,jboothmillard,10, The Sound of Music,"It has often been hailed as the greatest musical movie of all time, it has been on TV every year, especially at Christmas, and it remains one of the most seen films in cinema. Based on the memoir of real by Maria von Trapp, the story became a hit Broadway musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein (composer by Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II), and then this highly entertaining film, from Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Haunting). Basically, set in 1938, it opens in the hills of Austria with free-spirited young Austrian woman Maria (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Julie Andrews) singing (""The Sound of Music""). Maria is a studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg. The other nuns are concerned by her constant lateness (apart from meals) and lack of discipline ((""How Do You Solve a Problem Like) ""Maria""). The Mother Abbess (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Peggy Wood) sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to be governess to his seven children. Maria is nervous on her journey to the Captain's home, but she tries to find her confidence (""I Have Confidence""). The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. The seven children are: 16-year-old Liesl (Charmian Carr), 14-year-old Friedrich (Nicholas Hammond), 13-year-old Louisa (Heather Menzies-Urich), 10-year-old Kurt (Duane Chase), 9-year-old Brigitta (Angela Cartwright), 7-year-old Marta (Debbie Turner), and 6-year-old Gretl (Kym Karath). Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl is at the beginning of her womanhood, and has feelings for Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte), one year older, who delivers messages to the Captain, they spend the evening together in the garden (""Sixteen Going on Seventeen""). That night, the children are scared by the thunder and lightning during a storm, Maria sings a song to make them feel better (""My Favourite Things""). While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and she teaches them how to sing (""Do-Re-Mi""). The Captain returns to the villa with wealthy socialite Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker), and their mutual friend, ""Uncle"" Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). They are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when they fall into the water. The Captain is displeased by his children's clothes and activities. Maria makes an impassioned appeal that he should get closer to his children, but in anger he orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologises to Maria and asks her to stay. Maria and the children next perform a puppet show for their father, the Baroness and Max (""The Lonely Goatherd""). Max is impressed by the children's singing and suggests entering them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain will not allow his children to sing in public. He does agree, however, to organise a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while formally dressed guests and dancing the waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt to dance, he cuts in and partners with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Before they go to bed, the children perform for the guests (""So Long, Farewell""). Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. The children travel to the abbey and try to see Maria to convince her to come back. Mother Abbess learns that Maria has secluded herself and been silent to avoid her feelings for the Captain. She encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life (""Climb Ev'ry Mountain""). After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until a replacement governess can be found. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed. The Baroness realises that his true feelings are for Maria, and she also knows that she does not feel for him as she may have before, so they break off their engagement. The Captain finds Maria in the garden, tells her that the engagement is off, and they finally express their feelings (""Something Good"") and embrace. The Captain and Maria are soon married. While they are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria is in the grip of the Nazis, the couple return to their home. Rolfe, who has been brainwashed by the Nazi movement, delivers a telegram to the Captain, informing him that he must report to serve in the Third Reich's navy. Strongly opposed to the Nazis, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. As the von Trapp family try to leave that night, they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts waiting outside the villa. When questioned by Gauleiter Hans Zeller (Ben Wright), the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them there, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night the family perform (including ""Edelweiss"") for the large audience. During their final number and after being announced as the winners, the von Trapp family slip away. They seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts arrive to search for them, and Rolfe momentarily lets his conscience get the better of him, allowing the family to escape. The family get away using the caretaker's car, and the soldiers are unable to follow them as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. Also starring Anna Lee as Sister Margaretta, Portia Nelson as Sister Berthe, Norma Varden as Frau Schmidt the housekeeper, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, Marni Nixon as Sister Sophia, and Evadne Baker as Sister Bernice. Andrews give a magnificent performance as the reluctant nun who finds her true calling, and Plummer is likeable as the initially stern but slowly enlightened father. This is a film that will has enthralled audiences from every generation, with its wonderful use of colours, its marvellous Austrian mountainous and village locations, and its magical selection of show tunes that have become singalong favourites. The last quarter of the film, with all the Nazis and the hunt for the family, is perhaps questionable and unnecessary, but apart from that, it is a perfectly pleasant, charming, and brilliantly heart-warming musical drama.

The Sound Of Music is a wonderful (kind of) true story: a nun, Maria, wins the hearts of a sad, strict widower and his seven children who she is sent to mind as governess. It's a classic look back at the sadness of exile and oppression, the triumph of goodness over evil and the joy that just one woman, Maria, makes in people's lives. As Maria, Julie Andrews has great chemistry with Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The child actors are great. The choreography and the script are both a bit regimented - probably because this was a polished stage show before the movie.

It is, very loosely, based on the story of the real Von Trapp family, although it takes many liberties with historical fact. In reality, Georg and Maria von Trapp fell in love in the twenties, not the thirties, were married in 1927 and had two children of their own by 1938. Maria was actually heavily pregnant at the time of her wedding, something tactfully omitted from the film. The family actually left Austria for America before, not after, the Anschluss. The film also differs somewhat, both in its plot line and its music, from the original Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical; when I first saw it in the theatre I was surprised to hear unfamiliar songs which do not feature in the film. One song, ""Something Good"", which was specially written for the film is now normally sung in stage productions, even though it was not included in the original.",
81,7 September 2000,yenlo,5, Syrup!,A good film but beware it's loaded with a very heavy dose of syrup. The characters are plastic and somewhat on the non-believable side. The scenery is perhaps the best part of the film. Based on a true story it wavers much from the actual true tale of the Von Trapp family. Yet to be a musical it would have to.,

The camera moves in closer to reveal that the figure is of course Julie Andrews who does a little twirl, spreads her arms and bursts into that oh so famous song. And immediately you get the sense that this movie is going to be something rather special. Critics will say that The Sound of Music is overly sweet and sugary. Well, what's so bad about that? We can use a little sugar now and again. This may well be the ultimate feel-good movie. There are so many reasons why this film is, for so many people, absolutely one of their favorite things.",

But as many as 10+ songs in a Western movie was something new for me, and it was unique. But I loved it. I showed the movie to my mother. She doesn't understand English very well, I had to keep interpreting the lines for her. But she too loved the movie. I had read somewhere, this is one movie, a copy of which should be there in every home on Earth. And i agree. It is an experience I wont ever forget. however, I wonder, why are musicals so rare in the west? we watch almost 100 Hollywood movies every year, and I have watched just two with songs.

Julie Andrews is back as another nanny (or, governess) to rambunctious children (this time 7), but her magical powers are confined to a guitar and a lilting soprano. The romance between she and Christopher Plummer doesn't work because his haughty decadence seems more in tune with Eleanor Parker's ice-poison beauty than with Andrews' overeager tomboy. Cast as Maria, a novice hired away from the convent, Julie isn't always the jovial Mary Poppins here; she's rather stern and overly precise, and when she returns as Plummer's wife, there's an awkward chasm between she and the family, as if they're asking, ""Who is this new person?""

91,23 April 2015,moviemattb,10," For 50 years, the hills are still alive","I have never saw this movie, when it first came out back in the mid- 60s but I know my mother has a VHS copy of the movie as its part of the ""Family Feature"" release. Did I watch it as a kid? No. I didn't bother to watch it, and wouldn't think if this was a good movie. Of course as I became a teenager, I saw that Vin Diesel movie ""The Pacifier"" from Disney as Diesel's character has to direct ""The Sound of Music"" play as he still keeping eyes out on the children. Also, I didn't know that ""Family Guy"" was making fun of the movie as I now realize as an adult that Seth Macfarlane is fan of it. Of course, the movie does have fans. So I pop in the old VHS into the VCR as I was looking at some old movies as I was into filmmaking, and after watching it I personally fell in love with this movie from beginning to end. During Christmas, my mother now has a copy of the movie for the first time on DVD for its 40th anniversary with the picture quality being upgraded. Never have the 45th anniversary edition as it was release on Blu-Ray for the first time, because I wonder if 20th Century Fox was ever going to release this movie again on Blu-Ray for its 50th anniversary, and what do you know it, they did. I got it as a birthday present, but I only watch the special features first. Haven't watch the movie yet. However, I did see the movie being reissue on the big screen by Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events with Robert Osborne being the host for the introduction and its closure. It was my first time seeing it at a movie theater, and had an amazing experience. The opening scene Maria sings the first opening musical number brought a smile to my face, and as the movie ended I was the first one to clap as the other audiences joined in. It wasn't a huge crowd, but it was nice for others to see it. The movie is about a young Austrian woman name Maria as she is wanting to be a nun in Salzburg at the abbey. So the Reverend Mother gives her a task to be a governess as she is suppose to take care of Captain Von Trapp's seven children. While she takes care of the children by teaching them how to sing, she also brings love to the family as the Captain fells in love in Maria as they got marry and leave their home behind as the Nazis take over Austria. The movie is based on not only the musical Broadway, but it is also based on a German movie ""Die Trapp-Familie"" and the true story of Maria and her family. There are not much words to say about this movie, because everyone has already love this movie and already know what is so great about it. I really love the story as it is told brilliantly. The direction by Robert Wise is outstanding as he knows how to tell a good story, and bringing characters to life. The cast in this movie are wonderful. The children all did well on their own as Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews are both wonderful for their performances as well as the chemistry they made. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are a whole lot of fun to listen to as well as Irwin Kostal's take on the score. The movie does have its beautiful cinematography as I indeed love the look of Salzburg, Austria. The movie does have its funny moments, while its other moments are touching and heartwarming. The movie is almost three hour long, but I never got bored with it as the pacing of the movie keeps me going. Lastly, it does have great message as the movie tells where you have the Reverend Mother tell Maria not to be afraid, but must face her own destiny by faith and courage. That is what the spirit is for the movie as like myself, I must face my own choice of destiny by courage as well as my faith in God. I know anyone may identify for where the message of the movie comes from. So that is how much I love this movie, and I am glad that for 50 years, the hills are still alive. ""The Sound of Music"" continues to be a beloved classic, and it will always be a beloved classic. I give it a perfect powerhouse 10 out of 10.",
92,30 September 1999,DB-55,7, Classic musical.,"A movie made in a time when directors like Robert Wise who knew how to craft a musical were still around. Suffers terribly when viewed on a small screen since the brilliant cinematography is such an integral factor of the movie. Get the newer THX widescreen video version and you will see a glimpse of what the film would be like on a big screen. The movie still holds up well to nineties standards but may be a little sugary for hardened modern moviegoers, used to a diet of violence and profanity. Wise manages to make Julie Andrews look both virginal and alluring at the same time, which is essential for the plot to work. It is hard to imagine the movie with any other actress than Andrews playing Maria's part. Some may criticize Roger and Hammerstein as not being in the same league as other noted movie composers, but here the combination of composers/director/actors all comes together in a way seldom matched.",

When along comes ""innocent nun wash out"" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.",

98,3 December 2004,Paddy-49,7, Strong on songs and location and charm; weak on passion!,That 'The Sound of Music' (SOM) is a greatly changed version of the true story of the Trapp Family Singers doesn't really matter much. It does not claim to be an accurate documentary  what it is is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's (R&H) finest musicals and like most of their work it has more to it than just the songs. From Oklahoma onwards R&H created a series of musical plays all of which had semi-hidden dark undercurrents. So whilst SOM is at times rather over sweet there is enough substance to the story to make it rather more than a good couple of hours of jolly escapism. Robert Wise's film version moves at a cracking pace until the rather long drawn out denouement after the Salzburg concert. The Nazis search for the family in the Abbey just goes on and on! ,
99,7 June 2020,Uriah43,9, An Excellent Musical,"This film begins with a young woman named ""Maria"" (Julie Andrews) who has recently joined a local abbey in her hometown of Salzburg, Austria with the intention of one day becoming a nun. Yet even though her desire is sincere enough the problem she has is that she is so energetic and full of life that it inhibits her ability to fit in to a monastic lifestyle. After much consideration the ""Mother Abbess"" (Peggy Wood) decides to temporarily send her to fulfill the position of governess at a large estate owned by a retired naval officer by the name of ""Captain Georg von Trapp"" (Christopher Plummer) who has recently lost his wife and has seven children to raise all by himself. Not knowing any better he has tried to install a great degree of military discipline to his children without realizing their ability to fully absorb that particular lifestyle. As a result, the previous governesses have all tried and failed to achieve any sort of balance to the equation which the Captain or the children can accept. To that end Maria-who has absolutely no experience for that particular position-finds herself in the middle of situation in which nobody has successfully handled before. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent musical which captured the environment of Austria prior to the Anschluss remarkably well. It won several Academy Awards including Best Picture along with Julie Andrews being nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as well. In short, those viewers who are interested in a nice family film of this type should certainly give it some consideration and I have rated it accordingly.",

There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever.

Dame Julie Andrews is brilliant as the postulate aspiring nun, Sister Maria, who is sent to help a local military man, Captain Von Trap, played by the brilliant Christopher Plummer to raise his seven children. At first, the children are resistant to Maria's unconventional ways. She makes an attempt to become the friend despite the oldest daughter who doesn't need a mother but does after all. Maria eases her way with the Von Trap children by teaching them how to sing and be children again. She gives them the play clothes made out of curtains or drapes from her bedroom quarters. They sing, play, and have picnics in the beautiful Salzburg mountains. Of course, Maria causes discourse in the Von Trapp family household but she manages to stay on and wins over the Captain Von Trap who was seeing a very beautiful Fraulein Schraeder from Vienna who is not crazy about children. Of course, this story takes place before the rise of Hitler and World War II. When Maria and the Captain come back from their honeymoon, they must face separation with Captain being ordered to serve the Third Reich despite his obvious disdain. The scenes at the Convent are also memorable especially with the late and wonderful Anna Lee MBE as one of the nuns.

119,28 January 2023,GusherPop,10, A classic and a perfect Musical and drama loved for over 50 years,"Who says you can't buy happiness? As long as Robert Wise's The Sound of Music is playing, you can. And that's going to be for a good long time. Don't, however, wait. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure a moment longer than necessary. Run, do not walk, to the nearest box office. The 20th-Fox release will be one of the movies' all-time hits, one of the all-time great pictures. It restores your faith in movies. If you sit quietly and let it take, it may also restore your faith in humanity. It does this with infectious wit, with consistent gaiety, with simple and realistic spirituality, with romance of heartbreak and heartmend. This is set against the most beautiful scenery you have seen in your life. The Sound of Music is quite a picture. There are many reasons why this musical, from the lilting intelligence of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, is such an enthralling success. Credit producer-director Robert Wise, first of all, for his consummate skill in organizing and guiding it. But the talent that gives it the final lift is unquestionably that of Julie Andrews. This lady is not just a great star, she is a whole whirling, dazzling constellation. She is not just an ordinary movie personality, she is a phenomenon. Once there was Mary Pickford, then there was Garbo, now there is Julie. She is very likely going to be the object of one of the most intense and sustained love affairs between moviegoers and a star in the history of motion pictures. Various song numbers have been without exception expertly staged. ""My Favorite Things,"" sung by Miss Andrews and the children, is perhaps the most warmly presented, while ""Do-Re-Mi,"" showing femme and the moppets picnic-bound through the streets of Salzburg, the most spritely. Miss Andrews' opening title song atop mountain marks an effective start of the picture which is prologued by aerial views through the mountains, and ""Lonely Goathered,"" a puppet number backed by. Hers and children's voices. Provides a light note. Moppets' ""So Long, Farewell"" is charming, and various reprises throughout the film lend additional interest. It has been common to say that this score by Rodgers and Hammerstein is not one of their great ones. So it seemed when the show opened in New York. The show had a curious rising curve, though. Despite the patronizing tone of the critics, it enjoyed a substantial Broadway success. Its enduring values have been seen elsewhere. It has turned out to be one of the most popular shows in new musical theaters now dotting the land. Maria, a postulant at a convent near Salzburg, Austria, is detached from her duties to be governess to the seven motherless children of Baron Von Trapp. The Baron, formerly a captain and hero in the Austrian navy, runs his home on military lines. His five girls and two boys exercise their rebellion by tormenting a string of governesses. Maria is the first to defeat them. She does it with spunkiness and charm, teaching them to live and love. She also makes a conquest of the captain and ends up herself Baroness Von Trapp. Wise shot all the exteriors of The Sound of Music, and some of the interiors, at the locale, the Austrian city of Salzburg. He justifies that location in the first few minutes. It is a daring opening, with no music, no sound, just clouds floating across the screen, clouds that thin to disclose the Alps, and then Miss Andrews singing the title song. It is some kind of irony that this incomparable scenery has been the paint-and-canvas background for a dozen operettas. This is the first time it has been used ""live.""The Sound of Music is what it says, almost continuously musical in sound. Wise and company have used music to cover two bad gaps in the stage version. There is a new song, ""Confidence in Me,"" sung by Miss Andrews with bounce and verve, on her journey from the Abbey to the Von Trapp villa. The final big scene, where the Von Trapps must confuse the Nazis in making a getaway, has been set in a Salzburg concert hall. There is a good, exciting scene following this where the Von Trapps elude their pursuers with the help of Maria's nuns. This leads naturally into the final scene of the Von Trapps walking over the mountains to freedom.",

I can't remember how many times I have watched it but still I'm not tired of it. In fact the more I watch the more I like it. It is a classic film in all aspects. Not only is the storyline a classic topic but also many of its songs have become household memories well into the present time, Do-Re-Mi, Edelweiss and So Long, Farewell, just time name a few. It is classic also in terms of the cast, many of whom have become symbols of classic actors and actresses, Julie Andrews for example.
So let's delve into the storyline first. People might have to ask: what has softened an outwardly tough captain's heart? I believe we all know it's a little simple word - love. And the medium? Music. To me music connects all of us. It transcends borders. It surpasses languages. It bridges gaps. And it brings healings. It is truly transnational, cross-cultural and inter-generational. This cannot be more vividly expressed in the scene where Captain von Trapp argued with the governess along the lakeside over the way the children are taught when a song by the children levitates into their ears and finally breaks this quarrel and turns things around. It is music that brings joy and happiness, fun and laugher back to a once rigidly trained and militarily managed family.
This movie is also very touching in that the remarriage brings love back to children who once lost their mother. It is also encouraging and inspiring when the von Trapp family leaves everything they love behind to flee Nazi German ruling and pursue freedom in another country, which somehow reminds me of many current Hong Kongers.
One thing that makes me so obsessed with this fils is its art form - musical. I find myself relentlessly fond of musical movies. Many of the songs in this film have been classic. Take Do-Re-Mi for example. It comes into being in the backdrop of teaching music beginners how to sing. The words and the tone are so cute and pretty. Just visualize those little things, doe, ray, me, far, sew and tea. Which one if them doesn't sound instructional?
Edelweiss is another highlight which expresses a mature man like Captain von Trapp's deep love for his country. And Sixteen Going on Seventeen sings out a teenage girl's longing for her first love. Last but not least let's not forget about the mind-soothing So Long, Farewell for bedtime. Little Gretl is just such an adorable baby.
As for cast and crew Dame Julie Andrews she is indeed a landmark actress who is dearly loved and remembered by all people for her tremendous talent for singing, acting and even writing. She's got the look, she's got the class and she's got the stamina to be a classic figure. And she's so British. I always think U.K. exceeds in history, culture and literature over the US although the latter enjoys far greater political influence and technological supremacy.
And anecdotally I was asking people some time ago to name three of their best loved movies and my answer was
1. Sound of Music (1965)
2. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)
3. Mary Poppins Returns (2018)
Well done The Sound of Music (1965). I have every reason to believe that you will continue to be a classic film for many years and decades to come. May the world be filled with the sound of music instead of infighting.
The hills are alive with the sound of music. So are we.",
122,19 November 2015,Honeybee-ct,10, The use of Imagery,"The beginning of the movie shows beautiful scenery of lakes, hills and greenery, which creates a sense of peace and tranquility. The panoramic views of mountains and hills are done on purpose for the author to set a scene. The blues lead to feelings of tranquility and peace, whilst the greens give an enriching feeling of life. The opening scenes create such beauty, and the styles of houses that are shown clearly dictate the wealth of the area. This is quite a contrast to the modest girl, singing with such an angelic voice, whose clothing does not show wealth, but modesty and simplicity. She is on her own in these beautiful hills, leading the viewers to believe she may want to escape and that she may be a solitary person...this movie is an absolute must to watch, rich with history, emotion and social privilege.",

A beautiful cast, pleasant music, and fabulous scenery in the Austrian alps. Oh, sure, the camera is mostly very static, not much better than the Italian 1913 version of THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. Perhaps the Todd AO process camera was unwieldy,or perhaps the director just liked it that way. As for Julie Andrews, what other actress can all at the same time project vulnerability, strength, and emotional fire? There cannot be too many such. Eleanor Parker has a thankless role as a possible wife for the von Trapp paterfamilias, but we know from the start that she hasn't a prayer up against Maria, the postulant sent out from a nearby convent as governess for the von Trapp family seven kids. Just the same, Eleanor displays her usual talent and is an ornament to the film. At the end, as the family flees the Nazi anschluss into Austria, we finally get some action and a little camera movement, with tracking shots. Whatever cavils one may rake up, this is Julie Andrews' film, no question.",

126,18 June 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,10, Masterpiece. Beautiful film.,"This film surpassed all my expectations. I'm not a fan of musical genre, but this movie proved that even musical movie can be a masterwork. To start with, the film has a very beautiful cinematography - the hills, the city, the beauty of nature. It also uses a great, colourful, very bright colour pallete. This film also has a fantastic story, it's a 3 hours long epic about love, war, faith, family and many more values. The actors are phenomenal, their performances are very natural. Most important thing - the songs. Most musicals have songs sung at random which usually has nothing to do with the film. In this film majority of the songs are sung in the right time which feels realistic and the lyrics are very important to the storyline too. Sometimes the songs are sung while in real life they would not, but I don't mind it at all since their lyrics are important to storyline. And the songs themselves are so great, they sound beautiful, cachy and very memorable. The dance choreography is very good, it feels natural and cute. The music score is beautiful. The characters are interesting and unique. This film features some great comedy too. The dialogues in this film are so deep and meaningful. It's a very inspiring movie.

167,15 October 2018,andy_kohung,8, A Peak of Hollywood: The Sound of Music,"The Sound of Music is a legendary while heartwarming movie about story of a governess(nun), Maria, living in Captain von Trapp's house with seven children. This movie is based on a Broadway musical also called The Sound of Music of 1959. Because of the success and fame from the memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria Augusta von Trapp and the Tony awarded musical by Richard Rodgers, director Robert Wise and his team started the staging and filming of the movie version of The Sound of Music in 1960. The movie starred actors like Julie Andrews, who plays Maria, Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain, Richard Haydn, Eleanor Parker and so many more. The film released on the second of March in 1965 in the U.S. Because of the fantastic production and music, the movie became the highest grossing film of 1965 and one of the highest grossing film of all time. As of today, the film has grossed almost 1.3 billion dollars. 
 The Sound of Music is considered one of the best family movie of the 1900s. It is remembered by many people from different decades, countries and ages. The story starts with Maria, casted by Julie, signing on the hill about how she really likes the nature and life in the countryside of Austria. This scene is one of the prettiest scene in the movie. With the calm and relaxing background, it captures the energy of the actors and the film itself from the beginning. Maria is called to take care of Captain von Trapp's seven children. Captain, casted by Christopher, tells Maria all about the rules that she has to comply living with his children, such as marching around the house and going to bed on time(almost like military practices). This part of the movie captures the rigid routine and education of the 1940s. This also briefly brings out the setting of World War II. When the Captain is away to Vienna, Maria starts secretly taking the children to play and to sing. During this part of the movie, songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"" has born and ingrained on decades of people. Apart from just being relevant to the Broadway and Hollywood's community, schools has begun teaching children the songs from the movie for so many years too. In a party, Maria finds out that they might be in love with each other. Therefore, she flees back to abbey without telling the von Trapp family. The chemistry between Maria and Captain is very magical in the movie. The way Julie acts as a shy but adventurous girl in that love relationship could win her any awards for a leading actress. After a while of confessing their loves, Maria and Captain get married. Unfortunately, in the same time, Nazi Germany has taken over Austria and Captain is forced to serve in the navy under the Nazi. This part of the movie is very much tied to the history. It also conveys a conflict to the story which leads to a lovely singing scene by the von Trapp family. Because Captain is loyal to his country Austria, he plans on fleeing away. From playing in the Austrian show as the of the ""von Trapp Family Singers,"" they somehow find an escape. The story ends with the family climbing the mountain to escape the country. Even though it is not a particularly happy ending, the family is still able to stay together in the end. To me, this is the best way to end the movie because it ends with an open ending which gives audience an opportunity to think about both the ending and the movie in general.
 The Sound of Music is a multi-nominated and awarded movie. They received several Academy Award nominations while winning five of them: including the Best Picture and the Best Director. The story plot is wonderful because it is a lovely family story. The actors in the movie are really phenomenal too. Most of the actors are little kids but they show the talents and potentials of being good actors. Not only they have to sing, they also have to act in the same time. My favorite part of the movie is when the children sing the song ""Farewell"" in the party because they show both the fun and professional part of being actors. I also really admire how the youngest actress shows the shyness but also the stubborn part of her character throughout the movie. The leading, Golden Globe awarded actress Julie Andrews is fantastic in the movie from the start to the end. She shows the openness and happiness of Maria with her acting flawlessly. Besides, with the support of tunes like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen,"" and ""My Favorite Things,"" the movie soundtrack also was ranked as number one album of the year in Billboard 200. The Sound of Music is also listed as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie according to American Film Institute. I would highly recommend this movie because of the production, artistry and chemistry among the actors. As the Library of Congress had once commented, ""The Sound of Music is culturally, historically and aesthetically significant;"" it is a movie that everyone must watch no matter what their ages are.",

The movie starred actors like Julie Andrews, who plays Maria, Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain, Richard Haydn, Eleanor Parker and so many more. The film released on the second of March in 1965 in the U.S. Because of the fantastic production and music, the movie became the highest grossing film of 1965 and one of the highest grossing film of all time. As of today, the film has grossed almost 1.3 billion dollars. 
 The Sound of Music is considered one of the best family movie of the 1900s. It is remembered by many people from different decades, countries and ages. The story starts with Maria, casted by Julie, signing on the hill about how she really likes the nature and life in the countryside of Austria. This scene is one of the prettiest scene in the movie. With the calm and relaxing background, it captures the energy of the actors and the film itself from the beginning. Maria is called to take care of Captain von Trapp's seven children. Captain, casted by Christopher, tells Maria all about the rules that she has to comply living with his children, such as marching around the house and going to bed on time(almost like military practices). This part of the movie captures the rigid routine and education of the 1940s. This also briefly brings out the setting of World War II. When the Captain is away to Vienna, Maria starts secretly taking the children to play and to sing. During this part of the movie, songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"" has born and ingrained on decades of people. Apart from just being relevant to the Broadway and Hollywood's community, schools has begun teaching children the songs from the movie for so many years too. In a party, Maria finds out that they might be in love with each other. Therefore, she flees back to abbey without telling the von Trapp family. The chemistry between Maria and Captain is very magical in the movie. The way Julie acts as a shy but adventurous girl in that love relationship could win her any awards for a leading actress. After a while of confessing their loves, Maria and Captain get married. Unfortunately, in the same time, Nazi Germany has taken over Austria and Captain is forced to serve in the navy under the Nazi. This part of the movie is very much tied to the history. It also conveys a conflict to the story which leads to a lovely singing scene by the von Trapp family. Because Captain is loyal to his country Austria, he plans on fleeing away. From playing in the Austrian show as the of the ""von Trapp Family Singers,"" they somehow find an escape. The story ends with the family climbing the mountain to escape the country. Even though it is not a particularly happy ending, the family is still able to stay together in the end. To me, this is the best way to end the movie because it ends with an open ending which gives audience an opportunity to think about both the ending and the movie in general.
 The Sound of Music is a multi-nominated and awarded movie. They received several Academy Award while winning five of them: including the Best Picture and the Best Director. The story plot is wonderful because it is a lovely family story. The actors in the movie are really phenomenal too. Most of the actors are little kids but they show the talents and potentials of being good actors. Not only they have to sing, they also have to act in the same time. My favorite part of the movie is when the children sing the song ""Farewell"" in the party because they show both the fun and professional part of being actors. I also really admire how the youngest actress shows the shyness but also the stubborn part of her character throughout the movie. The leading, Golden Globe awarded actress Julie Andrews is fantastic in the movie from the start to the end. She shows the openness and happiness of Maria with her acting flawlessly. Besides, with the support of tunes like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen,"" and ""My Favorite Things,"" the movie soundtrack also was ranked as number one album of the year in Billboard 200. The Sound of Music is also listed as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie according to American Film Institute. I would highly recommend this movie because of the production, artistry and chemistry among the actors. As the Library of Congress had once commented, ""The Sound of Music is culturally, historically and aesthetically significant;"" it is a movie that everyone must watch no matter what their ages are.",

172,14 December 2005,Jvbway,9, A vast improvement over the stage show,"Whether or not ""The Sound of Music"" is in fact a good musical has been something of an ongoing debate. It did in fact open to mixed reviews in it's original Broadway run and was panned in it's original London run. When it comes down to it, the score is mostly excellent, even if the songs don't flow in quite as naturally as they do in other R&H shows. But where the show ultimately fails is by not joining together the three stories that go on in the show; Maria winning over the children; Maria and the Captain falling in love; and the Von Trapps Escaping from the Nazi takeover of Austria. The three stories pretty much just happen, rather than flow in.",

We ended up singing the entire score, it was so fun! I got so into it I ended up standing on the table and there are some really embarrassing photos of me, but it was worth if because everyone had a great time.

It strikes a triumphant opening chord as a marriage of form to content, as we are being granted witness to a person's burgeoning awareness of the world around her. How can she and the camera help but sing? Her first moments and interactions with the Von Trapp family seem staid by comparison, but Wise's typically astute craftsmanship and the contrasting approaches of Andrews and Plummer to their roles proves quite fascinating. And I must mention the subplot of encroaching Nazism, which yields some brilliantly executed suspense sequencesit doesn't get much more nerve-wracking than squatting behind a tombstone with the Von Trapp family as they're being tracked by the dogs and searchlights.",

199,14 September 2006,ericolsen1953,10, Background story more compelling than the musical comedy,"Sound of Music is an almost universal favorite, even with he-men or liberal sophisticates who ""don't like musicals."" I'm not wild about musicals either, especially since popular culture began a whispering campaign that said all guys who like musicals are gay. The splashy, funny story about a postulate Catholic nun who leaves her convent for a trial-run at being a regular adult, and then finds love with a suitable leading man who happens to have 8 very talented children is a good adaptation of boy meets girl, and there's lots of hilarious lines and situations to carry a lesser story to box-office success. What really makes this movie compelling is the background drama showing a definite conflict between good and evil. The anti-nazi stand that Capt. Von Trapp takes against the forces arrayed against Christian decency in 1930's Europe is both admirable and dangerous. The Capt. has lots to lose: he's very rich, socially prominent and he's courting a sexy Countess who's wealthy too. His friends council to be politically-correct, go with the flow and just bend a little to the new National Socialist overlords who've just seized control of his country; ""compromise and be wise."" Von Trapp is outraged that his inner-circle is both so greedy and so cowardly. The background plot is serious like West Side Story is serious, but has enough of a frivo- lous front story in it that you may not notice the moral that Sound of Music teaches.",

For example the kids go from hating her to liking her in an extremely short time. Strangely enough, this movie is long & yes even some of the musical numbers drag it out longer than it needs to be. There is a lot of fun to be had especially for children & big fans of musicals. If you are willing to forget some of the weaker story-lines (I get it it's a G movie) but the Nazi's hardly play any significant or actually scary bad guys even compared to other G-Rated films.

Anyway, I first saw this movie with my aging mom in 1965, and as the theater was almost sold out we had to sit in the front row. Imagine my feelings as the camera zoomed in on the top of the hill and Maria started singing. I was spellbound. Not until Les Miserables have I had such an experience! In most movies there are both strong and weak characters. In Sound of Music I found every actor and actress believable. Julie Andrews as Maria was marvelous, but the best performance in my view was Christopher Plummer as the Captain. How he changed from the stiff formal unforgiving and aloof parent to a warm and caring father in a few brief scenes was great. I have seen the stage productions many times and no one else has pulled it off believably.

Julie Andrews is Maria, appearing on film again after her Oscar-winning triumph as Mary Poppins and her stage successes as Guinivere in Camelot and Eliza in My Fair Lady. Maria on stage had been the peerless Mary Martin, not quite as sugary as Andrews, but who could argue with this sweet-voiced screen version? Maria is in a convent but she isn't suitable material for a bride of Christ. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood, here I think dubbed for her rendition of 'Climb Every Mountain', considering her pure soprano years earlier) sends Maria out into the world to take charge of the Von Trapp children.

213,6 May 2006,chrisbishop5000,10, the best musical I've ever seen - and it always will be,"When I first saw this movie I was truly enchanted. It was a musical unlike any other I had ever seen. My Nanny Varnish and my Grandad Varnish, my mum's parents, bought it for me in 2001 and it really does remind me of them and it also reminds me of that very year. I was quite unhappy in that time but I also liked it and I did have some good times as well. It tells the story of Maria (Julie Andrews), a bright young woman who doesn't fit in at the abbey where she is supposed to be working like all the other nuns. Mother Superior tells her that it would be respectful to god to leave the abbey and the very thing that'd be useful for her is going to become the governess of seven children - who she finds are all very naughty. Their behaviour improves with Maria's lighthearted passion for music after all they all are very unhappy underneath it all. Maria and the seven children get to know each other better while their father Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) is away seeing his girlfriend who is slightly older than he is, I think. Their friendship grows and it is decided he'd bring her back to the Von Trapp villa and her close friend, Uncle Max played by (Richard Haydn). The Baroness wants to get to know the people of Salzberg and so a party is planned. When Maria and the captain dance and start to fall in love the Baroness secretly gets jealous and is determined to win back her man - and does. What Maria must accept is that he really loves the baroness and only likes her as a friend - but will he change his mind? The best way is to watch this fantastic movie and find out then. There is absolutely everything you would want to see in a great film; there's wonderful songs you would want to listen to again and again, romance, sentiment, beautiful real-life Austrian scenery, lavishly rich sets, outstanding performances from every actor and actress, perfectly cast and even scenes about the Nazis and just how the Von Trapp Family Singers manage to set a plan to become free of their evil reign. Well, there you have it! A film of every glorious wonder you could possibly think of. I hope that'll still remain in at least the next hundred years from now because every generation should experience the golden qualities of ""The Sound of Music"" - it's a film I am proud to give the full-star vote and I'll love it forever.",
214,18 June 2006,EdgarST,10, The Sound of Music,"There was a time when saying you had enjoyed ""The Sound of Music"" was considered un-hip. It is still considered corny by many, but at least, compared to the stage version, it is a masterpiece. I finally saw a theater production, and could not believe how poor the text by Russel Crouse and Howard Lindsay is. Ernest Lehman really did a genial screen adaptation, eliminating songs (can you imagine Baroness Elsa singing about a marriage proposal?), relocating ""My Favorite Things"" to the storm scene, turning ""The Lonely Goatherd"" into a puppet show, or taking ""Do Re Mi"" out to the Alps and the streets of Salzburg. Not much was added concerning the social and political aspects of Austria during the years of the Nazi regime (which probably would have given a greater resonance to this tale of personal struggle against totalitarianism), and very little was taken from the real Georg von Trapp, a ruined aristocrat, or Maria, who was the real stern, rigid parent that turned the family into a musical act for survival. Nevertheless, other aspects of the production augmented its entertainment value. After making the horror classic ""The Haunting"", director Robert Wise surpassed his talent for transferring musicals to film, making the Rodgers & Hammerstein play less stage-bound than his work on ""West Side Story"". Both are industrial films, done under Hollywood's zero-degree style of film-making, but Wise did give a fresh visual treatment to the musical, airing an old property, and guiding Julie Andrews to give the best performance of her career. Finally, what I find more interesting about ""The Sound of Music"" is its sociological value. When it was released, it had a sedative effect on the hearts and minds of almost the entire world population, who was witnessing new cracks in the U.S. empire: the questionable presence of American troops in Vietnam with a generation of young Americans killed for expansionism and not democracy, the violent deaths of major figures of its political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the raise of violence and death on the streets... Solidarity, love, basic family values, and especially music, were sort of rediscovered in ""The Sound of Music"", turning it into a mega hit, and its soundtrack into a best seller.",

The opening when the camera pans over the glorious scenery and we see Maria singing the title song must be one of the great moments in film. It is up there with the shower sequence of Psycho. The whole cast is great. One performance that just get better and better each time I see it and lets face it we have all seen it dozens of times, is Eleanour Parker as the Baroness. She is wonderful. It was great to see Marni Nixon, the great voice but unseen in many a movie. It is a pity a few grumpy old critics could not see through their bias and take the film for what it is, a joyful celebration. It gets a ten from me and it always will. I read once that Christopher Plummer was not happy with his performance in the movie but in actual fact he gave a nicely restrained gentle performance. It is indeed the role he will be remembered for.",
216,22 September 2015,Seraphion,7, Worthy of a classic status,"This movie is indeed worthy to be called a classic. Yet it's in fact very much thanking the songs that are sung within it. The story feels flat and uninteresting for the first part, and predictable for the second part. Yet this is probably due to me watching this movie in 2015, fifty years after its original release, when everything had already developed, rendering the story within it to be quite obsolete. Thus when I imagine the conditions of the time when this movie was released, then this movie would've scored very high in terms of story background, development and flow. The thing is this movie has at least two of the most memorable songs in history; the very first song and the one about the musical notes (I didn't bother googling their titles). The acting overall feels flat for the standard of nowadays, but then again it must've been good at the time when it was released. Julie Andrews did quite well in maintaining her role's character. Christopher Plummer did also well in keeping the character's strictness.",
217,19 May 2008,jdkraus,10, The mother of all Musicals!,"Ever since I was a kid, I saw ""The Sound of Music"" and considered as the best musical and one of my favorite movies. Now as a young adult, it still remains as one of my favorites. First of all, it has Julia Andrews's best performance. I enjoyed her role as Mary Poppins, but she flourishes and illuminates the screen as Maria, the cheerful, witty, and funny want-to-be nun. She brings to life some of the most memorable songs that drown out all others such as: ""Do-Rei-Mei"" and ""The Sound of Music."" Second, the magnificent score of Irwin Kostal adds to beauty of the music. It uplifts my soul to levels that hardly any other music can surpass. Third, the wonderful shots of the landscape (on location) add to the authenticity to the film's story that not even Terrence Malick could dream up. Fourth, the supporting casts (particularly the seven children) make believable performances. Even the serious Christopher Plummer shines a new light on his character as the widower Captain.",
218,28 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,1," Not just bad, but painfully bad","The Sound of Music is one of the most beloved musical films of all time and a multiple Academy Award Winner, which features on both versions of the American Film Institute's list of the best American films ever made. In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit that I don't especially like musicals, but even with that caveat the most surprising thing about The Sound of Music is not just that it's a bad film but that it's so bad it's painful to watch.
Rogers and Hammerstein have a huge following, so clearly their twee, populist compositions with their facile lyrics clearly appeal to lots of people, but I'm not one of them. Leaving that aside however, the use of the musical numbers here has a sloppiness to it that smacks of laziness or bad script-editing. Thus, most of the songs are sung in context, as Maria - who by her own confession can't resist bursting into song - sings them either for her own pleasure or to teach the Von Trapp children to sing or the Von Trapp family performs them for them an audience. What makes no sense however are the two musical numbers performed by nuns, especially since the first is performed immediately after the script informs us that singing isn't permitted inside the abbey.
The biggest problem with The Sound of Music however is that once you take away the songs, there's isn't much else left to recommend the film. Ted D. McCord's cinematography at least is impressive, from the famous aerial opening shot, which shows off the film's breathtaking locations and then closes in on Julie Andrews. He also makes extensive use of wide-angle and deep-focus shots, which effectively gives the actors a broad stage on which to perform, and the technical accomplishments of scenes such as the camera tracking the children and Maria cycling or riding on a carriage shouldn't be overlooked. The puppet show also boasts excellent sets, camerawork and choreography and the wedding of Maria and Georg is shot with a certain grandiosity. But on the other hand, the competent camerawork only serves to enhance the shallow artifice of director Robert Wise's gaudy mise-en-scéne.
The story is based on the real life of the Von Trapp family, but the screenplay - adapted from Ernest Lehman from the stage play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse - simplifies this to the point of stupefying predictability and tedium, as misbehaving would-be nun Maria is sent to be governess of the Von Trapp children, wins them over and thaws the heart of their stern patrician father Georg Von Trapp, eventually marrying him. Naturally, the course of true love doesn't run smoothly and about a third of the way into the film, Eleanor Parker's Baroness Elsa von Schrader is introduced as a rival for Georg's affections, but even that produces little drama, since she is eventually prompted to nobly step aside in favour of Maria. In fact, the least predictable aspect of the story for those not already familiar with it is that the final third of the film shows the Von Trapp family fleeing the Nazis as their take over Austria, which on the one hand is not as tense or exciting as it sounds and yet on the other sits awkwardly with the rest of the film (although mercifully, in the face of Nazi oppression, the singing more or less stops).
As if all of this were not bad enough, the acting isn't up to much either. Julie Andrews is the best thing in it, although the songs require her to sing at a pitch that is ear-piercing. The actors playing the seven Von Trapp children are variously wooden and stilted, whilst Christopher Plummer - who reportedly had to be talking into playing Georg and seems to have regretted it since - gives a performance that suggests he's as bored with the film as I was.
Quite why The Sound of Music is so enduringly popular remains a mystery to me: it's saccharine, shallow, at least an hour too long and quite badly made. I would say that it couldn't be worse, but the sing-along version proves me wrong.",

Julie Andrews is Maria Von Trapp, and because she's just so adorable and optimistic, I won't say anything about her. Now, to the film.",
220,16 December 2019,mike48128,10, A perfect Musical Film that is practically a work of fiction!,"The cinematography, set design, costumes , choreography, vocal performances are almost perfection! Critics said that Christopher Plummer's ""Capt. Von Trapp"" was a weak performance, but he was given a very difficult character role to portray, from a heartsick, callus, widower to a loving father in a short period of time. As history, it is very poor indeed. He actually was a very good father who loved his children dearly. The major events (marriage, romance, escape) are out-of-order and highly fictionalized. However, they did perform in several wartime-concerts and won awards. Also, the Captain was ""drafted"" for Hitler's submarine fleet. All the children's real names were different. Alas, the true events would not have made an enjoyable musical. Postulate Maria was originally given the task to tutor one child recovering from the scarlet fever, that killed her mother. The character ""Max"" did not exist. Instead, there was a musically-talented Catholic Priest that came with them. Then, a U.S. talent agency almost drove them into bankruptcy. I do agree with one thing that the critics ""said"": the portrayal of The Nazis was far too nice. No distributor caps were removed by the nuns at the Abby. All that was ""made up"". The Von Trapp family just took the train (that passed behind their house) to Italy and never hiked up the Swiss Alps, which were nowhere near them. Eventually, they took a steamship to America. The musical score is also a vast improvement with the deletion of two terrible songs from the Broadway version, and the addition of 2 wonderful new songs entirely written by Rogers for the movie: ""I Have Confidence"" and ""Something Good"". It may be the most successfully-produced musical of all time, with numerous audio, visual, TV, film and Broadway versions and revivals internationally! If you can ever see this on a big screen, the Oscar-winning cinematography is breathtaking.",

223,13 December 2015,bradleyja,10, An Uplifting Movie,"The Sound Of Music is a classic of the musical genre and is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The plot concerns a young Austrian woman called Maria (Julie Andrews) who is studying to be a nun in a convent and is sent to be a governess of the Von Trapp family by the Mother Abbess who feels that Maria would be more happy if she left the convent. During her stay, the Von Trapp family's lives begin to change forever. The dialogue is brilliant as every sentence suits each character and really brings them to life making you identify with them. The musical numbers are well-written and are some of the catchiest I've ever heard in a musical with songs such as ""Favourite Things"" and ""So Long, Farewell"" staying in my head for days and a beautiful score along with it. I also have to point out the engaging cinematography of Robert Wise who provides us with magnificent views of landscapes of the hills and mountains which really is the icing on the cake.

I don't know if its the story, the magnificent photography, the high quality of the acting, the first class production values, or the songs{all of them are excellent}that do it for me. Prehaps I'm just a sucker for it, or prehaps it contains something that is lacking from today's hard sell high concept films. It takes me back to a more innocent age when the so-called family films were made with heart, class and intelligence. This one can make me feel good when I'm down and no matter how many times I've seen it, it always works.After all, isn't that what movie-going is supposed to be about? Highly recommended on all levels, they will never make 'em like this anymore.

About a nun name Maria, who is sent to become a governess to 7 kids of the Von Trapp family who only has a father who has lost his wife. This is one movie I can still remember watching in my young days. Watching it over again with the family, you will remember those old tunes you might have sung back when you were still a young boy/girl. The Sound of Music is a really enjoyable movie which I highly recommend to watch with family or friends. I think young adults who have watched The Sound of Music before in their young days, and now have kids and family, they will watch the movie and will remember all the lovely and wonderful songs they use to listen or sing along to. Julie Andrews was just really perfect for the role of Maria, especially Christopher Plummers as Captain Von. Trapp, and also the children. This movie has family, music and love. Even though the movie has been around ever since 1965, the movie is still really popular and well known and its nearly 50 years ago when it was made. The movie gets known every year as young kids watch it while growing up and then they show it to their kids when they have a family, which makes the movie more popular. Overall the Best movie of all time, which will never get old and will never be forgotten.",

When I graduated high school I left home to go to college and a good 20 years passed before i saw it again. I was surprised upon seeing it as an adult and 30+ years after it's original release just how wonderful it is. It's definitely a polarizing film, and for those many critics the main and singular complaint seems to be that its too sweet, saccharin, unrealistic. I don't completely disagree with them, in many ways those charges can be levelled against most movie musicals. Frankly, that doesn't hold up for me. Sure, there's a little bit of fantasy here, but I do think its very well done. The sets, direction, story, are all excellent and make for a memorable and thoughtful viewing experience.

One thing I can objectively say is that this movie was for me the most 'rewatchable'. I could watch it over and over again without being tired of it (my sister could actually recite the whole movie word for word). After that article in the men's mag ( and the fact that no movie, no matter how highly rated on the IMDb, is without a negative comment), I am forced to say again that I don't know what makes a movie good.

Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace.

Capt. von Trapp is a very stern man, and will not allow his children to have any fun of any kind. That is, until Maria shows up.

Mr. von Trapp is a retired captain of the navy, his wife died many years ago leaving him with seven kids and a bad attitude. Because of his lack of interest & nurturing, the children try to win his attention by annoying the hell out of every governess he hires. The movie opens famously, with a camera descending upon the majestic austrian mountainside, capturing a gorgeous view, as Julie runs in the grass singing. Her character, Maria, is somewhat lost, she grew up wanting to be a nun but her mentors seem to think that the quiet life is not for her. They gather together in the abbey and sing about it of course, because this is a musical. The reverend mother tells Maria that she should first go out into the world and get a job so that she would have time to rethink things. So Maria winds up as the Von Trapps' governess. Inexperienced and awkward in her new position, she tries her best and eventually wins the hearts of the children and their trust. They learn to sing and go on many jolly holidays in the hills...until daddy finds out and has a hissy fit one day, when his snobby baronesss girlfriend is over with her plans to marry him and get rich. But soon (almost three minutes later in fact) Mr. Von Trapp's stone heart breaks when he walks in hearing his kids crooning. They hug and he makes up to them in a very memorable Kodak moment.

Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are perfect as the leading roles, they undergo such character development. The first half is mostly comedy, but the 2nd half takes a more dramatic turn, with scenes like the first kiss between Maria and Georg, the wedding (brings tears to my eyes - I WANT that dress!) and the symbolic mountain climbing. I agree with the person who said Maria and Georg's first kiss is very erotic. The way they kind of nuzzle is filled with sexual tension - they just want to jump each other's bones there and then!

247,22 May 2020,TheHonestCritic,10, Does this movie bring me to life with the sound of music? Check out my review below to find out!,"""The Sound of Music"" (1965), this movie is quite simply a musical masterpiece. It's one of my top 10 all-time favorite musical films, and also one of my top 10 all-time favorite family films! This film is based off a memoir written by Maria von Trapp, who also happens to be a main character in this movie. She wrote a memoir back in 1949, and it was eventually adapted into a stage play. After over 1,000 performances of the play, it was set to be adapted into a feature film. Usually, taking a stage play and transferring it onto the big screen is hit or miss. However, this movie does the original play justice, and then some. In fact, it's even better than the stage play! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, great special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. At first glance, the story may seem simple. But, the way that it's executed makes it so much more than your traditional family and love story. It keeps you hooked from beginning to end, yes, a nearly three hour film that truly keeps you interested all the way through, that's incredible. This movie goes by in a flash. If a long film goes by really fast, then you know it's good! The acting is fantastic from all the actors and actresses. But, the ones that steal the show are Julie Andrews as Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp. As always, Julie Andrews is such a joy to watch in any movie she's in. This film is no exception to that! Christopher Plummer always gives it his all in any movie or show he's in, and he takes the role of Captain von Trapp to a whole new level. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they all put on outstanding performances and truly bring this movie to life! All of the sets/locations are spectacular, especially the scenes in the Alps. It really gives the movie a breathtaking atmosphere and really sets the tone perfectly! All of the special effects are extremely well-done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack of this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. What can I say that hasn't been said before? Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein III wrote the original music and lyrics for the stage play, and movie. All I have to say is, they have given us some of the most iconic songs in any musical! ""The Sound of Music"" is a cinematic achievement, and always will be. Is it my favorite musical? No, there are a few that I personally like better. But, I can assure you all, that it's definitely on my top 10 all-time favorite musical and family films list! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Sound of Music"", go see it today. I guarantee you will love it! If you have children, be sure to show them this movie. You'll be glad you did, and they'll be happy too. But, this movie can be always be enjoyed by people of all ages. This film will definitely bring you to life, with the sound of music!",

It's hard to know where to start when a film simply has so many great elements to it. These are some of the best musical songs ever written, some of my favorites being ""My Favorite Things"" and the one in which she teaches the children how to sing. The musical is based on the touching and amazing true story that has managed to inspire so many. Julie Andrews is perfectly cast (being one of my favorite actresses) and was robbed not to receive an Oscar for this role, in addition to the one she earned the previous year for ""Mary Poppins."" Christopher Plummer is also an excellent choice as the tough military father in the film. I love the tiny humorous moments, such as Plummer seeing his children in the tree or all the children falling out of the boat after seeing their father. Excellent from beginning to end.

This one absolutely does.,"I think it's safe to say that most people are vaguely aware of this movie in bits and pieces well before they actually see it, or truly know anything concrete of it. ""My favorite things"" and ""Do-re-mi"" are practically childhood staples; the first two lines of the title song have been immortalized in various capacities. Beyond these and possibly other numbers, I don't think it's unfair to say that most folks are only nominally aware of 'The sound of music' for a long time before they actually see it, perhaps unknowing even of the fact that it's loosely based on a true story; I readily admit it's taken me more than thirty-seven years to actually check it out for the first time. And I can't say I had any specific notion of what to expect, so one way or another I was in for quite the experience. I don't know that I'd say it's entirely perfect, yet whatever subjective nits one may pick are by all means far outweighed by the tremendous value the feature represents; at length it really is a fabulous, entertaining classic - and frankly, a must-see.",

Director Robert Wise, Music And Lyrics By Richard Rodgers The fist half of the 60's saw a great number of cinematic musicals, usually because the stage musicals had garnered immense popularity and because film directors and producers noted that film versions of the musicals would already have a target audience. Richard Roger's The Sound Of Music, together with ""My Fair Lady"", represent the height of that period in 60's cinema. The Sound Of Music is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family singers, who escaped Nazi Austria and made a living entertaining Americans and Europeans with their musical style. Naturally, the real story was fictionalized for the musical. Novitiate nun Fraulein Maria (Julie Andrews in her signature role) learns that she is not cut out for the life of a nun and her Mother Superior (Peggy Wood) quickly sends her away to work as a governess for the many children of Captain Georg Von Trapp, a retired and widowed naval captain. After the death of his first wife, he became bitter and shut out happiness, music and laughter in his home, which he runs like a ship. He is engaged to the glamorous but haughty, self-centered and un-motherly Baroness Schreider (Eleanor Parker). Maria provides the children with music lessons and liberates them from the repressive environment they've grown up with and soon they become attached to her. One thing leads to another, the Captain dumps the Baroness and marries Maria. Hitler takes over Germany and Austria and establishes his Third Reich, and the Nazis demand the Captain return to his post. But the Captain is anti-Nazi, making it clear he wants nothing to do with them, which sets off a chase. His life on the line, he escapes with Maria and the children to neutral Switzerland. This musical is bubbly and heart-warming, overly sentimental by today's standards(what family puts on puppet shows and sings acapella together along with a guitar ?) but represents a long-ago time when life was sweet and simple, and one in which family values was prioritized. This is a film the whole family can enjoy, and makes a regular appearance on ABC 7 around Christmas. British Broadway star Julie Andrews as Maria is in her element, providing the character with sweetness and girlish charm and truly this is her greatest role and one she will always be remembered for. The music is catchy, and the movie even manages to move us especially toward the end, when we sense the danger these people face when threatened by the Nazis. A good film, with strong performances, beautiful music and songs and a certain kind of nostalgic magic.",

Can Maria find a way to let them play and be free? ",

It is set in Austria, where the views are breath taking, and from the moment Julie Andrews comes waltzing into view, singing about the hills, to the very end, the film has the audience entranced. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great in their roles as the novice nun and sea captain, and whoever said Andrews couldn't act obviously hadn't seen this film. The songs are great and you find yourself singing about deers and yodeling for days to come, and although the film is quite lenghty at nearly three hours, you barely realise, as the film never loses its pace for a minute.

Did they consider the story and the film's style more suitable to girls and women than to boys and men? Did they fear that a situation or two might upset me?

After winning the hearts of the children through song and freedom from the oppressive life their autocratic widower father (Christopher Plummer) has made them lead, she proceeds to win the heart of the Captain himself. The love story in this masterpiece is probably one of the best in cinematic history~ there are several moments when you feel that ripping each other's clothes off would be less romantic than the raw sexual tension that charges the air, particularly during their fight right after the Captain comes home and the incredibly romantic Laendler.

I first saw it when I was about twelve, and developed an immediate (and huge) crush on Christopher Plummer, who is still one of my favorite actors. The film is great, if taken for what it is: a sweet, heartwarming family musical. Julie Andrews is wonderful (what I wouldn't give for a voice like that!) as Maria von Trapp, and the kids do a good job, although some of their dialogue seems a bit forced. Charmain Carr, as Liesl, was perhaps my least favorite part of the film. Surely a more talented actress could have been found for the role. All in all, though, the acting is good. The songs are pleasantly hummable; no, this isn't the most brillant music in the world, but not everything has to be a masterpiece to be enjoyable. ""Edelweiss"" is my personal favorite. The love story is believable and touching; the ending is suitably suspenseful. You genuinely care about the family making it safely to Switzerland.

296,23 April 2006,joseph952001,10, The Sound Of Cash In The Bank,"After ""Cleopatra"" with Liz and Dicky Boy hit the movie theaters, the film almost drove 20th Century Fox into Bankruptcy and even their law suits against one another just added fuel to the bankruptcy fiasco of all time. So, in the meantime, while figuring out what to do to save Fox, Walt Disney had seen Julie Andrews in the stage version of ""Camelot"" on Broadway and decided that she was his ""Mary Poppins"" and the rest is movie history. Back at Fox, looking through their unfilmed scripts they came across ""The sound of Music""; so, William Wyler, the original director who was casting the film, asked Julie Andrews to play Maria Von Trapp, and she said, ""Of course! But what can you do with a Nun, a Captain, 7 children, and a bunch of Nuns?"" So, Wyler cast the film, but he preferred to do something else, and Robert Wise took over. Wyler stated that he knew that the film would be a hit, but he didn't think that it would be THAT big a hit! In the meantime, at the Acamady Awards, Julie Anderews, the original Eliza Doolittle in ""My Fair Lady"" wins the Oscar for best actress in Mary Popp;ins, and Rex Harrision, the original 'Enry 'Iggins, wins an Oscar for ""My Fair Lady"", and Audrey Hepburn is overlooked for her excellent performance with too many excuses for why she didn't win! So, what made ""The Sound of Music"" such a hit? Good question! Not an easy answer! All the critics hated it; said it wouldn't last, but something happened, and not only did it last but became one of the great money makers of all time to the point that it played in reserved seat first run theaters for at least 3 years, and no movie had done that up to that time, but I think I have the answer: It was just right timing. There was a lot of violence on the movie screen, no musicals, no good-feel movies to leave the theater with your toes tapping with a song in your heart! Today, it would have probably flopped on its nose! So, when Julie Andrews won the Oscar for ""Mary Poppins"" she stated, ""I've heard that you Americans are known for your hospitality, but this is ridiculous!"" Next year when she was nominated for ""Soound of Music"", the rumor is that the Acadamy was told not to vote for her because it was unheard of for an actress to win the years in running for a musical! So, be the powers of Hollywood in those days! And in case you aren't aware of this, Marni Nixon, who dubbed singing for Deborah Kerr in ""An Affair To Remember"" and ""The King and I"", and who also dubbed partial-singing for Audrey Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady"" can, for once, not only be heard, but can be seen as well singing for herself as Sister Sophia as one of the Nuns in the number ""How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?"" So, the cash flow saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy; but it took many years for the movie public to get over that their virginal Julie Andrews was human beings, and it too many years for Jack Warner to wipe the egg off his face for making such a boo-boo about the possibility of becoming a movie star, and Julie Anderews never, but never, worked on a film for Jack Warner! But, many have made the same mistake. There were those who said that Liza Minelli would never make it in the big-time because she was the daughter of Judy Garland! Boy! Did those know-it-alls, like Jack Warner, eat crow for many years to come!",

Significant scenes have been cut and significant lines of dialog have been removed from many scenes that they did include.  At least three of these cuts actually changed the plot of the movie.

I thought Christopher Plummer did a great job, especially in the beginning when he was still unhappy. I could really laugh at those grimaces he made. The parts of the story I like most are from when Maria (Julie Andrews) starts working at the von Trapp house until she leaves (mostly though the scenes with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer) and the part from the return of Capt. von Trapp returns from his honeymoon until the end.

That, of course, is a matter of taste. The film itself, is flawless. Every aspect of the Broadway show has been improved upon for the film version. Julie Andrews, who was was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, and should have won, is more than the foundation for the film's perfection. She is simply without peer. There isn't anyone who could have played the role better. Her performance is so overwhelming, that during its initial theatrical run, she became an international obsession. Of course, the film doesn't end with Julie. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, orchestrations, scenic design and the entire cast, are excellent. This film was meant to be seen in a theater, on a super wide screen (that most cities don't even have anymore). As it is, on home video, you must see it in its widescreen (letterbox) version. The current DVD edition is about as good as you can hope to see it. A 40th Anniversary Edition DVD is soon to be released. Avoid the sing-a-long theatrical version, at all costs!

319,18 October 2021,iwilson-99700,9, The Sound of Music,"The Sound of Music is a movie adaptation of a musical based on the true story of the von Trapp family. Maria is a young wannabe nun who is hired by Captain von Trapp to be the governess for his 7 children. Eventually they fall in love and are married. When the Nazis try to forcefully enlist Captain von Trapp to their navy, he and his family are forced to flee Austria. The movie has stunning footage of the Austrian Alps and catchy songs, but I feel that it is too outdated to receive a higher review. My main issue is that von Trapp is old enough to be Maria's dad. The culture and time in the movie is just too different from today to be relatable. In addition, the 3 hour movie felt too slow and could sometimes be quite tedious. It is the sort of movie you watch once just for the sake of watching it.",
320,22 October 2008,Marisol33,6, Wonderful Musical,"I resisted watching ""The Sound of Music"" for many years. The plot sounded too sickly sweet to me. Once I finally broke down and watched this movie from beginning to end, I realized that the movie was sickly sweet, but it was also so compelling and the songs were so catchy that it was impossible to resist this movie. I know you just can not wait to hear me tell you whether you should have this movie in your collection, so I will tell you now that you should. This movie initially centers on Maria, played by Julie Andrews in one of her first film roles. Maria is a novitiate at an Abbey in Austria. Though Maria is earnest, being a nun seems a poor fit with Maria's outgoing and gregarious personality. The Mother Abbess, played by Peggy Wood in one of the final roles of her career, wisely decides that Maria needs a different perspective on life before facing the decision to take her vows. The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the Von Trapp family to be the children's governess. We quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian. We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world. However, before we get to the excitement that happens later in the movie, Maria needs to remind Captain Von Trapp that families are not armies, and that children need love, not marching and saluting. In the background of the main story is Nazi Germany's ambition of empire that led to the Anschluss or annexation of Austria into Greater Germany. Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss. World events and Nazi Germany's insistence that Captain Von Trapp become a part of the German navy soon overshadow the honeymoon of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe-inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical. Every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat. Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards. Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs. The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy. Among these songs are ""Edelweiss,"" ""The Lonely Goatherd,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi"" and the title song. Though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents. Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste. The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting. Some of the children have gone on to extensive acting careers, others left acting after only this movie or a few roles to other activities. Eleanor Parker was awesome as Baroness Schraeder, the woman we all loved to hate because she came between Maria and the Children and the Captain. I will provide a brief word about the sound and the picture. I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50"" television with stereo speakers. I do not have surround sound connected. The sound was very good though I have some issues with lower frequency reproduction (I guess I need a subwoofer). I have a bigger issue with picture quality. The color keeps shifting between scenes. In some scenes the color is excellent. In other scenes, the color seems off. At first I thought something was wrong with my television, but I checked the quality of the picture against other inputs and realized that the problem was the DVD itself. The color shifts are often subtle, but in a few places they are annoying. I hope future releases have this problem fixed. This movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should. This movie may fall short of being a perfect movie, but I am unable to suggest how it could have been any better. I have watched multiple releases of this movie multiple times and regardless of the quality of the release, I watch each time almost as though I had never seen the movie before. You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family. Enjoy!",

And the kids who shine especially with their scenes with Maria and towards the end of the film they act like a real family when the nazi's are ready to escort Captain Von Trapp to the navy.

326,23 September 2002,mpofarrell,10, The Hills Are Still Alive,"In the Oscar race for Best Picture of 1965 two of the year's biggest productions ran neck and neck to vie for the prized gold-plated statuette. In the end, both films won 5 Academy Awards but Robert Wise's family oriented songfest THE SOUND OF MUSIC triumphed over David Lean's somber Russian epic DOCTOR ZHIVAGO to pick up the top picture prize. The odds makers in Hollywood had predicted a certain win for MUSIC , and it did seem that the Hollywood establishment preferred the joyous strains of Maria Von Trapp's guitar to Yuri Zhivago's plaintive balalaika. There were some disgruntled movie fans who felt that the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical was an awfully lightweight choice for such a prestigious honor. Surely ZHIVAGO had more dramatic heft (granted the Trapp family had to deal with the Nazis but the song and dance element diminished the reality quotient). The only other serious contender for the year's best was John Schlesinger's contemporary British comedy of manners DARLING starring the stunning (Best Actress) Julie Christie as an amoral model living among the jet set. The less popular SHIP OF FOOLS ( a rather ugly soap opera aboard a cruise liner ) and A THOUSAND CLOWNS ( a cute, at times acerbic little comedy) were pretty much ""also-rans"" from the start. With the passage of nearly 40 years the reputations of both 1965's big Oscar winners have grown in stature. ZHIVAGO is the model of panoramic, epic storytelling ; as for THE SOUND OF MUSIC , it is by far the most technically proficient of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein film adaptations.",

I always thought it was great-it made me fall in love with Julie Andrews' talents and taught me about chemistry between romantic leads.  (""Mommy, the Baroness and the Captain don't GO together-he goes better with Maria."")  My roommate was in the chorus of the play at her hometown civic theater over the summer, and we watched the video of one of her performances.  Their play, taken almost directly from the original Broadway version, was obviously different than the film, including a few different songs and a totally different way of Maria and George falling in love.  Seeing the play, aside from giving me new ways to lovingly torture my roommie (""1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3 step together! now step-hop...""), has only made me appreciate the movie even more.  I never gave Ernest Lehman, the film's screenwriter, enough credit.  The play dialogue really wasn't that good-VERY schmaltzy (if you think the movie's bad, you haven't heard anything yet).  The love scene came across very differently-not as playful or subtle as the movie.  It just wasn't as good, let's just put it that way.  The movie has great actors and a fantastic writer doing what they do best, and though the score helps, I now see that a great score doesn't a great musical make.  That and the scenary-thank you to whoever made that cast and crew go to Austria-brilliant move on your part. This movie will remain my favorite, and my mother's, for years to come.",

It has great songs and great scenery (and awesome reviews!) and a great cast. Julie Andrews is an awesome actress (my personal favorite) and she did an awesome job. Some of my friends don't like it because they say it's too sappy or too sing-songy or too young, but it's got a wonderful plot and it's not too sappy at all, and I don't think that two people falling in love makes for a young movie at all. Some people I know don't like My Fair Lady for the same reason (did you know that Sister Sophia, the nun with the cute face, is the singing voice for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady?) but I adore My Fair Lady, too, though not as much as Sound of Music. Henry Higgins and Eliza fall in love but neither one really wants to admit it, because Henry Higgins said he'd never fall in love and is too proud to take back his words, and Eliza is understandably exasperated with his complacency and rudeness. Almost the same, the captain and Maria fall in love, but neither wants to admit it, Maria because she is training to be a nun and if she becomes one she can't have him and is a bit confused by her feelings, and the captain because he's engaged to the Baroness.

Nor are they the most exciting voices: the Mother Superior exhorts,somewhat out of place, the ""Climbing of every Mountain"", the Baron (or Count),if he does at all, sings in an uninteresting bland voice; Julie Andrews is no Lily Pons or Kathryn Grayson, or even Jeanette MacDonald,but vocalizing in ""Pediatric"".walks us through her favorite places where ""the dog bites"" or ""the bee stings"". ""When you're sixteen"" etc. is rather insipid, and the nuns' chorus is on the juvenile side.

It is the movie that i can watch everyday without getting bored. My kids love it too, my 12yr old son can play the backing music of all the songs on the piano! I always make him play them so I can sing along with them. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, ""The Sound of Music"", ""Do-Re-Mi"" or ""Edelweiss""(which is my favorite) . Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken nun turned governess. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen.

It's sad that she cannot sing anymore because of her throat surgery but she is still a great actress. The movie has it all with a great soundtrack that I will never forget the words to. Every song on this movie is a song that is full of life and is enjoyable to listen to. So take time from your busy lives to stop what you're doing, close your eyes and listen, I mean REALLY LISTEN.

The real-life story of the Von Trapp family was portrayed through the phenomenal acting by many iconic names in Hollywood. The main character, Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is introduced to her audience as a postulant at an Austrian abbey. Maria realizes the abbey is not a good fit for her as her overseer Mother Abbess, Peggy Wood, decides to send her to work as a governess for Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp, Christopher Plummer, and his seven rambunctious children.

I don't like musicals, but this one is something different:music doesn't seem to enter by force or ""by mistake"" in this story!

398,15 October 2005,Miag_div,9, A journey into the musical world,"I luckily was brought up in a family which is quite broad minded and my parents inculcated the love of music in my mind at a very early age.The Sound Of Music has been an all time favorite film for me. I grew up listening to Do-re-mi and You are sixteen going on seventeen. It was simply great. The reason why we like this movie is basically because it is simple. The storyline , the script are all very ordinary and so they appeal to us.The music has become famous the world over. Why ? Definitely because it is melodious and the other reason is - Because it is that kind of music which appeals to all. Sound of Music is a story which deals with the life of Maria a woman to be made a nun. But the others discover that she is very much unlike them and so she is sent to become a governess to the seven children of an officer . Later it is shown how Maria changes the lives of the children who live a spartan life by teaching them to dance and sing and play . And along with that changes the life of their father by showing him that life is beautiful and lovely. They unknowingly fall for each other and get married . The further part deals with their journey - how they escape from the clutches of the Nazis and then live a quiet life , but a musical one, in the mountains. It indirectly teaches us something. Life is not just living and then dying , but doing something remarkable that will make you be remembered forever. And the love of Maria for music and nature also makes us come close to nature. Her understanding of children makes her seem to be a very beautiful person. And it shows us that children are not brats who do not know anything but if taught with patience can do wonders. The music of this film is still heard by all the world over.And in this genre too. The photography is wonderful. It fills me with wonder to see a movie which can make an impact on people's mind. This film is not just an ordinary one or a one which deals with some issue. It is special because it delivers many messages to us as I already told. A movie to be viewed by one and all !!!",

But the second half of the film kind of drops the musical fantasy element, and it suddenly becomes a story about the main character falling in love and then having the escape from being killed by Nazis. This sounds awesome but its actually really boring.",

415,14 December 2022,josiegrimes-65646,10, Deserving of its rating.,"This movie is very deserving to be many childhood favorites. It uses a real life issue, and gives us lovable and relatable characters to heighten the affect of the story telling. This story takes place during Germany's invasion of Austria. It show cases the discrimination shown towards Austrians by Hitler/ German advocates. But, at the same time it also shows us an enjoyable story and story line to follow along with making it much easier for younger generations of viewers to fully grasp what is going on. I fell in love with all the characters and would 10/10 recommend to anyone with a love for music or a love for history!",

(Even tho,"This is, without question, one of the best movies ever made.  OK, it's sweet and simple, but what's wrong with that, anyway?  I'll take that over the mindless, loud, trashy, computer-generated drivel being made today.  The Sound of Music never fails to lift and inspire the best that is in me and I believe that is a large part of its tremendous appeal.  It speaks to our noblest ambitions and most dearly-held beliefs--freedom, family, God, country, love and the beauties of the world--the things that no one can ever really take away; the things that matter most.  Combine that with how beautifully crafted every element of the film is and you've got a classic, worthy of repeated viewings and of passing on to successive generations as an example of a well-made film that is truly a credit to all who participated in its production.  Beautiful music, outstanding performances, exquisite scenery, strong themes, humor, adventure and romance--it's got it all.  If I knew I was going to be stranded on a desert island with my VCR and only one movie, this is the one I would choose.  We need a little more innocence today and a whole lot of cheering up.  Thank heaven for the Sound of Music--long may it endure!!!",

Who couldn't fall in love with everything about this movie. Julie Andrews has an incredible voice, all the songs are not only great but have meaning behind them too. I am the same age as the daughter ""Marta"" so I grew up with this movie and have seen it at least 50 times and could watch it again and again. Its one of those movies that makes you forget all your troubles and just an all around feel good movie. How many of us don't know practically all the words to the songs? I bet we can all sing them.

Some might think it's the most boring movie because it has cheesy lines and corny jokes, but I think it doesn't because I think it doesn't have cheesy lines, but I think some of the jokes are corny. If I thought it was boring, I wouldn't have watched it countless times already. You might be thinking, ""She's obsessed with this movie,"" but I'm not. If you aren't thinking that, good for you!

It was a pity that Christopher Plumber was not allowed to do his own singing but instead had a voice over. Julie Andrews acting certainly deserved the Oscar that it was denied. My favorite scene was of Julie Andrews leaning against the wall in that beautiful blue dress, watching as The Captain sang to the children in the lounge. What more can I say, I have seen it so many times and never tire of it, each time I see it I realize that I have missed something before, each time is a new revelation to me.

441,26 June 2003,Sweetiepie,10, I am Sixteen Going on Seventeen...,"Where to start?! This is my favorite movie of all time.  The acting and directing is sensational.  The music and scenery is beautiful.  Movies are truly not made like this anymore! I first saw this movie in 1990 when it was re-released on video for the 25th anniversary.  I was 6 years old and I immediately fell in love with it when my parents bought it.  My favorite character was Marta, the second youngest, because I looked exactly like her as a child.  Plus she was my age! My favorites of the children were Marta, Gretl, Liesl, and Brigitta.  My favorite scenes are 16 going on 17, Do-Re-Mi, when the Captain finds the children singing to the Baroness, Liesl and the Captain singing Edelweiss, The party for the Baroness, singing at the festival, hiding in the abbey, and finally climbing over the mountain to freedom.  Christopher Plummer does a fantastic job of playing the Captain.  He is handsome and very charismatic.  Julie Andrews, of course, was the star of the movie and also was fantastic...but we already knew that!  I think that Eleanor Parker's acting as Baroness Elsa Schraeder was underrated.  She played her character perfectly.  I actually liked her character, although she was called the ""villianess.""  Richard Haydn was very good as Uncle Max, he made me laugh. I only wish that Charmian Carr, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath had done more acting as they got older.  With the exception of Angela, the other three stopped acting to raise a family.",
442,15 June 2006,guptavis,10, Great Classic Musical ! ! Must watch for all.,"This musical movie is simply great.I watched it as a kid first and have loved it ever since.The movie has a playful theme to it all along.There are some really nice songs like 'Do re me', 'raindrops on roses', 'the hills are alive', etc. The movie begins with beautiful Austrian hills.there are scenic mountains all around where Julie Andrews comes as a happy young girl who happens to be a nun and stays in a convent. She is rather mischievous and playful. The sisters at the convent get tired of her childish behavior and send her as a governess to the children of an ex-naval officer. The children are very naughty and they keep on playing pranks on everyone. Their father is a very strict person and likes the children to be disciplined. He is does not like light and playful behavior with the children. So the children become adamant and rebellious. Maria interacts with children as their friend. she plays with them , teaches them new things like music and dancing. she helps them with their problems and even covers up their mistakes from their father. She then brings them close to him for which he is grateful to her. This results in a bond between them. and during the war they flee together.",

445,27 March 2004,heavenhall,10, my fair lady v.s. the sound of music,"Though both of them are my favourite movies, i don't think there will be some connections between them, besides Julie Andrews was supposed to be Eliza but wasn't and Audrey Hepburn might become Maria but actually not. However when I find that footman at the embassy ball to call each one of the guest's name such as ""Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering. Professor Higgins"" is ""Herr Zeller"",I am shocked. And the Hungarian ""Karpathy"" is Theodore Bikel, who acts Captain von Trapp at the stage in 1959 or so. This make me feel........ Well, His figure is quite different from Christopher Plummer and when i hear his actually singing Edelweiss in CD i am nearly dizzy. Of course Mr Plummer's was dubbed and I am quite used to Bill Lee's. I don't know whether Mr Plummer's real voice is better than Bill Lee, but actually I don't like Theodore Bikel's singing, and, his flat figure.",

However, she becomes a friend,a teacher, and even....nope, you'll have to see the movie to find out for yourself. Maria brings the children a joy which many of them had never known, the joy of Music. Will uplifting songs, breathtaking scenery, and hilarious memories to last a lifetime, ""The Sound Of Music"" is truly a must-see for every generation.",
449,25 June 2022,shannonbixler,9, Great musical with Julie Andrews,"Great musical with Julie Andrews. Set in 1938 with the Nazis closing in on Austria, the story centres on free spirited Maria whom the nuns fear doesn't quite fit in. She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp.",
450,30 April 2005,shevan_silva2004,10, Could watch over and over again,"This movie has something magical in the sense that you could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored. Its powerful and compelling from beginning to end. The best thing about this movie is of course the songs; they have so much meaning and are perfect to the atmosphere in the movie at the time they are heard. The highlight is no doubt when Mother Superior sings 'Climb Every Mountain'. There is so much poignancy involved in that song that you begin to cry, laugh and just be stunned by the song at the same time. The only low point of this movie comes from Christopher Plummer's acting and especially his singing which lacks the quality of the other singers in the movie. If anyone's ever told you that this is an amazing movie, they couldn't be more right about it. Be prepared to experience many emotions in one movie.",
451,27 November 2001,cschultz,10, The Sound of Music is the greatest musical of all time and a great history lesson.,"The Sound of Music is not only the greatest musical of all time, but is also a history lesson.  In a span of almost three hours, you get to see a short tour of Austria and learn a great deal about the Von Trapp Family.  The songs are so unforgettable, that you will find yourself singing along throughout the entire film.  The Sound Of Music is a musical that will, probably, never be matched.  I highly recommend The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins.  As with The Sound Of Music, you will find yourself singing all the way through.",

I've been told that when I was less than 1 year old, I watched The Sound of Music almost every day for about a year straight. I still watch it all the time. Julie Andrews has an amazing voice and stage presence. Plus, she can act. I recently saw some clips from some Broadway shows she was in and she's amazing in that too. She plays the roles so well that I almost forget it's Julie Andrews playing a character, because she is such a skilled actress. Christopher Plumber is also great. My favorite song from the movie is probably Something Good, but I also really like Edelweiss. I'll continue to watch Sound of Music until I die.",

455,9 July 2011,rochellemiller,10, Sound of Music is great,The Sound of Music is an absolutely wonderful movie. It is great for both adults and children. I have watched this movie over and over again. One of my favourite scenes is actually the dinner table scene when all the children and the Captain are sitting at the table and Maria sits on the pine cone. I thought the food in this scene looked absolutely delicious. It took me a while to figure out but after looking and looking I realized that the food in my favorite dinner scene is actually just mashed potatoes with stuffed ham rolls and lettuce with dishes of croissants on the table and glasses of water. It still looks very tasty. Overall this is an excellent movie to stay at home any night alone or with others and watch. It is extremely entertaining and the songs are really great.,

I auditioned for The Sound Of Music at the local theater. I rate it a 10, I rate it a 10, I rate it a 10, I rate it a 10, Scale 1-100 I rate it 99.99%.

It's just a wonderful escapist film with no offensive language, no violence and no prejudice. It is a light hearted and lovely film set in beautiful surroundings with songs to fill your heart. People berate it everywhere and that is because they have not bothered to watch it and understand it. It's not realistic in the sense that people don't burst into song in the streets no, but it is quite lovely to watch with your family.It is no coincidence that this film has transcended all generations and boundaries and will never die. Long may it go on and my daughter already loves it too :-)I would urge all families to show it to their children. You can take from it whatever you wish. those who berate it are usually the ones who would rather watch Terminator or get pleasure from watching people having their heads mashed to a pulp by a tattooed Neanderthal in a string vest...",

459,1 June 2023,iehdhfjdrhdj,9, love Maria,"The classic late observation was also completed in stages. Except that three hours is indeed too long, it is important to note that this is a film with outstanding advantages and disadvantages. The excellent part is so excellent. Dorami Edelweiss is a lonely shepherd, densely packed between 60 and 90 minutes. Just recall how many popular songs have been left behind in classic musical films in history? What is the second famous song in the rain? The Sound of Music has dedicated enough works to compete with the top three in only 30 minutes, which is great. On the other hand, the story process used to produce famous songs is, to be honest, somewhat tedious. The anti Nazi theme frames certain emotional expressions on one hand. In addition, at the character level, the Colonel's personality is too hard and reserved, while Plummer is tall and handsome but not attractive enough; Maria only shows her charm when singing with her children (Andrews' love for the play is ordinary), and the couple's emotional spark is not enough. In addition, her competitor, the Marquis, is deliberately defeated everywhere, even if the love path is winding, it cannot make the audience more empathetic and expectant. Seven children have shown a sense of difference, but are limited to age and form, personality or emotional likes and dislikes, or are they biased towards monotony - why must they all love Maria?",
