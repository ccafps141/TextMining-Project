1,18 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," A brilliant postmodern film noir that is grim, intelligent and disturbing","From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox",r
2,30 April 2004,Boba_Fett1138,10, Dark and disturbing thriller that will stay with you for ever.,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10",e
3,1 March 2014,tomgillespie2002,10, Still manages to astound after 20 years of repeat viewings,"After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.",v

9,21 August 2005,johnmbale,10, Stand out Thriller thanks to Fine Cast.,"A stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer, ""Se7en"" (along with ""Silence of the Lambs""), is something of a milestone in this genre. An intelligent script, and admirable actors including the excellent Morgan Freeman, Prad Pitt, Gwenth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, with a cinema noir style, and very grisly murders representing the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the performances however that lifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older world wise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick, Poltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spacey does his usual brilliant psycho routine. There is a pivotal scene with Freeman and Paltrow in a café which shows the depth of performances here. They are believable characters in a dark disturbing world wherein it always seems to be raining. An effective thriller with tight direction and atmospheric photography.",w

1. The score is beautifully ominous which only deepens the thrilling and unsettling atmosphere.
2. Brad Pitt (Mills), Morgan Freeman (Somerset), and Kevin Spacey (John Doe) give amazing performances.
3. The colour palette being dark and monotone helps to cement the gloomy and grim tone.
4. The gore and practical effects are immense and they still stand up 25 years later. The sloth, lust, and gluttony murders, in particular, stick in mind.
5. The great cinematography knows when to pull the camera back, as well as to draw it close for great effect.
6. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have great chemistry together.
7. The back-and-forth between Somerset, Mills, and John Doe in the police car is one of the most intense and captivating scenes in the history of cinema.
8. The movie presents the interesting and complex moral quandary of: is it immoral to kill the immoral? Even if those immoral people adversely affect other people? And who gets to decide who is immoral, and what punishment should be meted out to them?
9. Despite the underdeveloped character of Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), the conclusion is still one of the hardest hitting and iconic endings ever created.",6
14,14 January 2008,Howlin Wolf,10, Se7en gruesome chapters of a killer's manifesto...,"""Se7en"" is unique because of the extraordinary sympathy it manages to foster for its two main characters; it's unique because of its bleak, hopeless environment that serves as a symptom of civilization's general decline. It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.",0

Fincher's mid-90's crime drama SE7EN got a whole bunch of hype when it first came out, and deservedly so. Pitt was still on the upswing of his career, ""Gwyn"" was still not yet a household name (which was a good thing for this role), and of course Freeman was at the top of his game (see SHAWSHANK, UNFORGIVEN, OUTBREAK, etc.) once again playing the voice of reason to perfection.

I have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'Se7en' to be such a film, with director David Fincher  after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'Alien³'  firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. It's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since I'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that I managed to get my hands on a DVD copy. And so, without further ado, I invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'Se7en' didn't disappoint.",?

These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath.

In lesser hands the concept (two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing stylized murders based on the Seven Deadly Sins) could've been nothing more than a gimmick, but here it's a deftly crafted game of cat and mouse that pulls you in, even as it makes you want to turn away. But that said, it's not what I'd call an exceptionally graphic film. More is implied than is shown, and we fill in the blank spots in our mind's eye. A far more effective technique than the cheap gross-out route.",u

Made an exceptional story. Idea was employed The Seven Sins is very distinctive and fits the genre of the movie and the crime atmosphere. The balance between the dramatic and action scenes in the movie was second to none, and the film was more acceptable and more enjoyable - the acting was also excellent. In the beginning and middle of the movie it was a bit of a movie Is conservative in terms of acting. But in the last quarter Brad Pitt gave a very beautiful acting performance. As for Morgan Freeman, as usual. Convinces you to perform without exaggeration Or trying to prove himself and always prove himself, with his calmness and expressions he follows explaining many things the end was terrible I liked how the aspect of Brad Pitt and his wife's life was linked to the main story. After the film ended, I sensed how intelligent the director was and how over the course of the events he was building Brad's character on a quiet fire to make the ending events logical, but at the same time unexpected - the film did not see any flaw in honesty Except that it was possible to shorten many scenes. The rest of the movie is very, very beautiful and worth seeing",v

It's a film that's almost 20 years old and one that I frequently miss usually on purpose when it's shown on television . I've always thought David Fincher was painfully over rated . "" Best director of his generation "" claim many people which is patently untrue if you've seen a film by Danny Boyle or Darren Aronfsky or Ang Lee . The premise itself doesn't inspire optimism being a couple of mismatched police partners trying to track down a serial killer who is motivated by the seven deadly sins .

36,23 March 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6, Good film with a great ending,"""Seven"" or ""Se7en"" is an American movie from over 20 years ago already that features four Academy Award winners playing the main characters: Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, even if none of them had an Oscar when this film was made. Spacey won the very same year though and it was an amazing 1995 for him. Fittingly, these over 2 hours here are at their best in the last half hour when he visibly enters the picture. I am fairly certain that the greatness of these last 30 minutes clouds many people's judgments about this movie. Lets be honest. The first 1.5 hours are really solid, but not great. The idea of letting a killer commit his murder in style of the seven deadly sins is a nice one, but the execution in detail left me wanting for more of course. I am not the greatest Pitt or Paltrow fan, but they play their characters well here. And Morgan Freeman is a delight as always for sure.",

I picked Se7en to rent because I've always wanted to see it since I saw David Fincher's masterpiece, Fight Club and his well made thriller, Panic Room. People have always said this movie was good so I wanted to see it if they were right and they were sure right. Seven is an insanely brilliant film from start to finish. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and especially Brad Pitt are all phenomenal in this chiller. The movie was just plain out suspenseful and left my heart beating fast til the movie was done. The twist at the end was very intense and you never knew it was coming. Totally unpredictable. Overall, a fantastic film and David Fincher is a pure genius when it comes to smart films and Se7en deserves to be one of the greatest thrillers that has ever been made. I highly recommend it.",

The only interesting thing here is that the killer uses the seven deadly sins but even this premise could've been better used, the plot twist is kinda shocking but isn't one of the best ones, ain't one of those jaw dropping ones, at least not for me.

41,3 October 2005,moonspinner55,6," It cuts and slices away, but still follows police-movie formula...","Is Morgan Freeman our greatest living actor? He may in fact be, and his mere presence here (solid, noble, and pure) is reassuring, but even Freeman can't overcome the usual cat-&-mouse/killer-toying-with-detectives stew that ""Se7en"" serves up. There's a serial killer loose in rainy New York City, and as he mounts his seven grisly crime scenes--modeled after the Seven Deadly Sins--he quickly becomes aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and is enamored of their drive and determination. Most of this is left vague and unexplained; we learn precious little about the psychopath involved except that he's highly literate, educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives: the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. The film mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of deja vu (I thought mostly of ""The Silence of the Lambs""). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The grimy, lust-and-death soaked atmosphere is wallowed in (it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell), and certainly it is palpable and captured successfully, but completely off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like real-life crime scenes, and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker isn't clever enough to distract us or cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible--it's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger sick-making scale. The film is predictably gruesome, less predictably formula-bound. **1/2 from ****",

While I don't think I'd put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn't a film for me. So why did I watch it?

Basing the film around the seven deadly sins is an concept that everyone can relate too. We have all sinned meaning we can be put ourselves in the shoes of the victims ( not all victims mind you ) .

51,9 March 2010,Hitchcoc,8, Almost Too Much to Bear,"I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it.

52,2 March 2008,BaronBl00d,9," Gritty, Disturbing Thriller - One of its Kind","Incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key performances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New York police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R. Lee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David Fincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. The film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. But behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. The journey they take us on is one scary ride.",

Not 5min into the movie and we're introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He's obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don't know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don't really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy's acting, whom I praise for his role.

Morgan Freeman plays an old wizened detective on his last week of duty before retirement. Alongside him comes Brad Pitt, as a young detective new to the precinct, eager to take his place. That's when the murders start to appear, starting with a fat man dead face first in a plate of spaghetti. From there, the bodies start to appear, with the theme of the Bible's Seven Deadly Sins. Each body is killed by their sin, and the detectives have to race to find this John Doe as he continues to tease them. This movie takes you on a ride, and gives plenty of clues along the way, but you never seem to know more than the protagonists do. The characters are written well, they develop over the story, and no one ends where they started. Kevin Spacey as John Doe was a brilliant casting choice, as he played the character with such conviction that any viewer would believe the actor actually believed in what his character did throughout the film. The team of Brad Pitt's young gun and Morgan Freeman's wise old man played excellently off of each other as well.

David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker did a stellar job developing detectives Somerset and Mills, who Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt bring to life flawlessly, their relationship is a complicated one that becomes more layered as the film continues. However, the highlight was Kevin Spacey, who steals the show as the man we were waiting to see from the very beginning, and is not one bit disappointing, he is sinister, absurd and a straight up creep, he chilled me to the core, I do not think any other actor could have portrayed this psychopath better.

The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie.

Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""Hollywood"" style ending. ""Seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.",

The acting was stellar, directing was spot on and the use of the city and rain added so much atmosphere that it was almost another character in the film. I did see the end coming even though I was hoping that I was wrong.(I think I knew what was coming not because this movie was predictable, more so that after this movie lots of movies and TV shows have stolen from it, so it kind of easy to see where it was going, I am sure if I had seen this when it was first out I would have been surprised) This is a five star movie that I think will still be great 50 years from now. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review. http://youtu.be/WCVDBOziSrM",

76,24 October 2016,jrarichards,9, Uncomfortably convention-defying psychological thriller,"This high-class thriller from David Fincher is well done, tense and rather gory; and achieves a great deal with its high-quality camera-work, primarily (though not quite solely) in hammering home the overriding message over a great chunk of the film that New York is the New Sodom and Gomorrah and possibly even Hell on Earth. It rains there and is grey all the time, plenty of sin is committed, and even formerly-good people are ground down by it, turned to evil or at best becoming apathetic as the only other possible defence. This kind of apathy is also at least to some extent afflicting our key character, William Somerset, a detective on the verge of retiring played by Morgan Freeman. Nevertheless, this character is not especially popular among fellow cops, given that he asks more questions than they do, is more thoughtful (and far better-read), and he still tries that bit harder.",
77,11 November 2004,gardenwriter,10, Superbly done,I love psychological thrillers and this is one of the best I've seen. Morgan Freeman was elegant and convincing as a burnt out cop who wanted to retire but found the fascination of the job tough to let go of. Brad Pitt made the transition from cocky new guy to serious cop vry convincingly. And what can I say about Kevin Spacey who is always excellent. (Except to wonder why his name doesn't appear in the opening credits - I looked three times.) And Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife was as fresh and charming as ever. I truly enjoyed the performances of all the main cast members.,

80,23 March 2022,jdring2007,10, detective thriller masterpiece,"Let's start with the basics. Which, in this movie, aren't as simple as the term implies. There is mystery to be had, thrills to experience, chills down your spine, the wrinkling of your nose in disgust, the unease in your gut, and oh yes, even a handful of chuckles. Mostly thanks to the dark humor and sarcastic manner of Brad Pitt's character, while Morgan Freeman's is the much more solemn, except that one scene where he's laughing more than I've ever seen him laugh in any other movie. Their polar opposites help engage different parts of your brain, and emotions, as the movie progresses. It's a rollercoaster of sorts, but mostly stays in the ballpark of disturbing this after disturbing that, yet all the while you're immersed in the bleak atmosphere, you're simultaneously glued to the screen. The score is haunting, the cinematography just - I don't know the word, I just love it - and the performances superb from one character to the other. Aside from the main two stars, all the supporting roles throughout execute so naturally that half the time it feels like a sordid documentary. Then of course there's Kevin Spacey, in a notorious role that was a shocker to people watching it for the first time. Given that I only write spoilerless reviews, I won't touch on the details of what I consider one of if not my favorite movie ending of all time. Back to the beginning, I love that the movie opens with a scene, and then runs the credit sequence, which is unnervingly perfect in itself, and from there the movie proceeds. Sure, it has some slow moments, but to be expected, and ultimately I am still too enrapt to have any of that detract from my rating. Even though the movie strictly follows the detective side of things versus the actual murders, the riddles and intrigue suffice to keep you far from bored.",

Having watched this film earlier today, I can say that I am disappointed.

McGinley: Utterly terrifying yet intelligent thriller about the seven deadly sins, which are methods used by the killer. Morgan Freeman plays a detective on the verge of retirement and Brad Pitt plays a young cop transferred to the district. Throughout the film they are forced to deal with the sight of grisly murders involving gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, etc. Compelling, unsettling and powerful with directing by David Fincher who previously made Alien 3. He presents the gloom and rain that affects the mood. Freeman is flawless as a detective who delays his retirement out of curiosity and maintains a blatant disposition that his partner cannot endure. Pitt is effective as the younger yet skilled cop who learns fatal lessons by the film's conclusion. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife who confesses that she dislikes the transfer. It is her that will likely generate the most sympathy from viewers during sad realizations. Kevin Spacey is featured is a scene stealing cameo that dominates the moment he first appears. This is where the revelations surface and the deadly sins increase their meaning. Outside the principal actors, other roles are fairly standard issue. Disturbing and sometimes graphic film that reaches into the depths of our mind in a message of control and other sins that God will have us not commit. Score: 8 ½ / 10",

89,7 February 2009,The-Kissable-Writer,9," Ambiguous, shocking, brilliant.","At one point in ""Seven"", Detective Somerset points out that if the serial killer turns out to be the devil, that might live up to their expectations. But who precisely is the man named John Doe? He might as well be called 'the man in black'. He's a dark angel on a shoulder, mine and yours, whispering truths we never care to learn. He's that little voice inside ourselves we smother by apathy. He's the anti-conscience unable to relativize the evil forces in this world. Or maybe relativizing is just a term often used to mask the fear of facing horrors we're unable to understand and overcome. So we don't even try at all. Se7en is as much a thrilling puzzle as an ambiguous morality piece. It present us with a vile world of unpunished sinners where even the biggest heroes lose the fighting courage (Somerset), and even the most driven good do-er minds are corrupted (Mills). Sound familiar? While Noir cinema clearly influences Fincher's work, ""Seven"" plays in present America, and by doing so becomes even more original and relevant.",

But this film already revealed his sensitive instinct for threatening scenarios. With ""Se7en"" he made one of the best thrillers of all time, an archetypal film for the word 'genre-defining'. So many films copied the style of it in the following years until now, that this style ultimately became nerve-racking for me in every new film. This is the one problem I felt while re-watching it. New audiences may not even be able to really understand what made this movie so great when it first came out. But its qualities are still visible today. The character of John Doe is a masterpiece of evil man-characterization.

No person can possibly describe how awful and vicious it is, what the murderer has done to these people. Some scenes are likely to make you squirm. To avoid spoiling the movie, I won't write about them, but if you watch the movie, you'll probably recognize them.

The anxiety and apprehension grows along the film for having such a captivating story, even if some scenes are very disturbing to watch, you can't take your eyes off. Another big contributor to make it more hypnotic is the soundtrack, when it's needed does an incredible work to elevate even more the breathtaking feeling.

There were about 10 copies of the normal version, and abut 2 of the special edition ones that look like notebooks. I went on a limb and bought the special edition for $5. I had no idea what this movie was like nor what it was about. But I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. This movie turned out to be a personal favorite. Morgan Freeman was excellent, not just because he's a great actor, but because in this movie he was different than the ""optimistic, nature-loving"" characters he usually plays. In this movie he plays the close-to-retirement Detective William Somerset, who dislikes the world and what it has become. Brad Pitt gave a great performance as the loud-mouthed, over-jumpy Detective David Mills. Usually I don't like Brad Pitt and I think hes obnoxious and a lousy actor, but in this movie I'll make an exception. He was obnoxious in some ways in this movie, but it fit his character perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow gave a decent performance as the stressed Tracy Mills. R. Lee Ermey was great as the Police Captain, I always enjoy his performances no matter what the circumstances. Even the bad guy (Will not give the actor's name to prevent spoilers) was Grade A in his part. The weather was rainy for most of the movie, and scenes were always lighted in small doses, meaning it was dark and gloomy for most of the film. THis really set the tone.

113,16 June 2020,richardtownsley-19550,10," ""What's in the box?""","Se7en remains one of the most disturbing movies I have ever watched. Unlike many other movies made during and since its release, Se7en refrains from gore and somehow becomes even more appalling because of it. Over time, general audiences have been desensitized to violence and gore. What may have been considered absolutely horrifying back in the 50s is nothing nowadays. So instead of showing the results of the crime, director David Fincher uses a somewhat Hitchcockian technique; by refraining to show the results of the horrible acts committed, and instead of revealing it through dialogue and acting, notably in the 'LUST' scene and 'SLOTH' scene, Fincher lets our brain do the heavy lifting and figure out what happened, and what it must have felt like. Fincher also goes out of his way to come up with the most disgusting ways a person can die, although some are admittedly tame. ('PRIDE' had it easy) The acting is incredible, featuring one of Morgan Freeman's best performances as an old, broken-down police detective, and Brad Pitt in one of his finest roles, and his acting skills are on display in his explosive acting during the finale. However, the best actor in this movie is the actor who plays John Doe. Observe his acting. Smug, self-satisfied, intelligent, analytical. His composure and fearlessness. The movie rests on this one actor to say every line perfectly. He does. His performance is just as affecting as Anthony Hopkin's in Silence of the Lambs. But the most impressive feat of all, David Fincher does something impossible: he makes the villain seem like a hero. It is hard to explain, but there are some villains that give us a glimpse into our deepest, subconscious desires. And that's terrifying. We all have parts of ourselves that we try to hide and pretend don't exist. These types of villains hold up a mirror and say, look. This is you. It's like watching a perverted car wreck that you can't look away from that hits you somewhere deep and hidden.",

123,23 May 2005,moonwio,9, Who's right and who's wrong?,"This is an outstanding movie. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are pitch-perfect, and Brad Pitt is solid. Pitt actually had a lot to do with this movie's success outside of his acting. He forced the studio to keep the original ending, and he forced them to shell out the money to get Spacey. It is fortunate that he did, as those two elements are central to the movie's greatness. Spacey played the killer so chillingly that it makes his message seem all the more unnerving and, perhaps, correct. The uncompromising ending leaves the viewer shocked and reeling. This movie could not have worked without it. Outside of those obvious elements, another key to the film is Freeman's character. His outlook on life is and how it is affected by the murders and by his new partner is a key subplot the film. It brings more weight to the picture. Also, David Fincher's dark, dreary direction adds to the film, somewhat similar to the way Ridley Scott's dark vision adds to Blade Runner. The constant rain is a nice touch, especially when it ironically recedes after the killer shows up. I was never a Nine Inch Nails fan, but their dark brand of music fits this film well, as evidenced in the opening credits. Overall, I think this is one of the great films of all time. Watch it if you can handle grisly images and if you like unnerving endings.",

140,1 March 2021,zardoz-13,5, Fair But Far from Excellent,"Despite its great cast and stellar director, ""Se7en"" is not a very good movie. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play police partners who are constantly at each other's throats as they search for a maniac who has orchestrated some horrific deaths according to the Seven Deadly Sins. Pitt's character David is an obnoxious lout of a person with little culture and little restraint or patience. Morgan Freeman is the level-headed one of the pair. I wish these characters had been developed different without playing the characters they paid. I got sick of David's constant whining and complaining as well as his impetuous nature. When he defies Detective Somerset and kicks in John Doe's apartment door, this represents an instance of foreshadowing of his decision to shoot Doe in the head when he sees his wife's head in a box. The victims of the Seven Deadly Sins are grotesque, as I sure David Fincher wanted them to be and they do look loathsome, too. The Gluttony victim with hands and feet tied with his shoulders slumped forward and his face buried in a bowl of spaghetti is enough to make one grimace. Similarly, the man under the sheet in the apartment building that the SWAT team burst into is another example of grotesque, too. Mind you, the cinematography, set designs, art direction are impeccable, but the story is just objectionable. I'm sure Fincher wanted to gross moviegoers out. Another thing that I didn't care for was the so-called humor in the scene when Somerset has supper with them, and the passage of a subway train vibrates their apartment so much that they have to grab them drinks to keep them from slipping. I didn't think it was funny, as I did in ""For A Few Dollars More,"" but here it just seemed out of place. They should have left the subway out. I haven't seen so much rain in a movie since the original ""Blade Runner."" The film grew tiresome toward the end, too.",
141,2 May 2016,isaiahwilson15,9, Se7en: One hell of a creepy movie,"Se7evn once again proves David Fincher is the master of composing a story that perfectly balances drama with suspense, and it then finished off with an excellent twist ending. Major credit also goes to Andrew Kevin Walker who creates a story that is creepy, compelling and above all original. The progression of Se7en is significant as it starts out with an insignificant investigation that evolves into an extremely intense encounter. The movie keeps a good pace whether it's giving the reader time think through what's happened or forcing them to predict what's going to happen. The constant chase makes for a great movie pace, which is further enhanced by the detective duo. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfectly cast as Detectives Somerset and Mills. The progression of the relationship between the two characters is done perfectly as the viewer sees the ups and downs both characters go through. The introduction of Tracy then introduces a huge wild card, which has a huge impact on the mentality of both characters as well as the ending. Se7en's villain John Doe is what ultimately makes this movie. The brutality, as well as the meaning behind each of his murders, is both fascinating and disgusting at the same time. The scene where Mill and Somerset question Doe as they drive to the location of the final two victims is the best scene of the film. Doe finally reveals his motives behind his murders that while they are rather disturbing, do actually make sense. The creep factor of Se7en is comparable to that of a scary movie. It's frightening visuals, themes, and the villain makes the movie much more suspenseful and frightening than many would expect. However, its the relatable characters and setting keep the movie grounded. Top that all off with one of the best twist ending that leaves the viewer jaw dropped throughout the credits, and you get one of the best thrillers of all time.",

The duo face a witty killer who kills based on the seven deadly sins. The real stars of this movie are the writer, director and set designers for presenting incredibly intricate and graphic murder scenes and making all the characters likable. The writing is deep and you have to pay attention to every detail. As the bodies mount you find yourself counting down each deadly sin to the incredible climax and shocking but truly awesome ending.

It's a good crime/mystery story delivered by exceptionally good acting, very good directing and a flawless screenplay.

With this film Fincher ranked himself among the most wanted directors and gained a reputation of true heir of Hitchcock, which was confirmed by his later movies ""Play"" and ""Panic Room"". The assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize Brad Pitt's acting (as in ""Fight Club"") which proved that he is not just a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but also showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a veteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of the killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely. The atmosphere of the film is so dark and depressing that the bizarre and terrible murders make it even more stressful. I was particularly impressed by the way murders were described, which are quite original and leave a big impression on the viewer. (Something like that was attempted in ""Resurrection"" with C.Lambert but not very successfully, and ""Saw"" - interesting, but not on a par with ""Se7en"").

157,29 February 2000,NEFARlOUS,1," Derivative, disgusting and downbeat","Seven is the sort of film that takes several formulaic concepts,  dresses them up with something trendy (title screens beginning and end,  making me wonder if the guy from Homicide got paid), uses stock  characterisations, piles on the repulsiveness on the excuse of realism,  and then watches the money come in.  What we have here is the age-old veteran approaching retirement teamed  with a young, aggressive rookie. The parts played somewhat predictably  by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.  The killer in this movie plans to murder six people (seven dead in  total) according to the seven deadly sins, hence the title.  The ways in which this is accomplished in five of these seems to be  calculated to be incredibly disgusting, repulsive and downright  offensive. The scriptwriters here certainly are no fan of Hitchcock,  but rather King. The result of which was to basically make me feel  slightly ill and disinterested in the film as a whole.  Now if they had bothered to put as much effort into the  characterisation of messrs Freeman and Pitt, this would have been a far  better movie. As it stands, you care very little for either of them as  they just do not seem like real people at all. (I get to put a second  reference to Homicide:LOTS as a reference point as to how it should be  done)  Cinematographally speaking, the majority of the film seems intent on  portraying the city as a ""Bladerunner by day"", muting most things in  dull, washed out colours together with lots and lots of Rain. Gritty?  Yes. Depressing? Yes. Boring? Eventually.

It's a classic detective/crime/mystery/thriller that was movie everyone was going to Blockbuster to rent out when it first came out on video. It's also David Fincher's breakout film that really made him stand out as a director. The cinematography, the visuals and the eerie atmospheric environment plays a key role when showing the plot unfold. Mainly because the grisly and nasty environment that gives off the aroma of sweat and decay really plays a key part in the story. It's one of the key elements that makes this film stand out. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman makes a excellent duo that actually compliment each other, not really verbally but it works throughout this film. One is the brash and hot blooded detective with the mouth, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the other is a wise and yet ignorant detective Somerset Played by Morgan Freeman. Brad Pitt was on his rising to super stardom stage and his role in this really helped him with the boost. The plot is about the duo detective going after and track down the serial killer that is on a pattern when it comes to the 7 deadly sins. This film is simply intriguing from start to finish, especially when this movie came out. Cause there wasn't a film like this before, as far as I know. And many films to come will copy or emulate certain elements from this film. Even video games like ""Silent Hill"" was probably inspired by this film, especially when it comes to the environment. This is a raw film that is detailed and focused. Just about every scene has a point and has connections when it comes to the core of the story one way or another. The way it delves into the psychological aspects and perspectives is Watching this film is like watching a great detective graphic novel come to life on screen with superb execution.

I thought the plot was interesting, but it quickly became see-through as the movie continued. This is certainly not as good as people believe it to be, and I found it to be dark and disturbing, and without any real ""mission"" to speak of. Usually, a great movie is the kind of movie you can view over and over again, and it consistently gets better with subsequent viewings. However, this movie can hardly stand with those. As I said before, it was fairly predictable from the start (I knew about 45 minutes early that his wife would be dying at the end) and it doesn't get any better every time you see it. For instance, check out 'Chinatown'; this is a legitimate film-noir thriller that does get better with age; it features outstanding performances and a dense plot, whereas this movie has a fairly methodical plot and some good but not great acting. I just don't see the appeal that this movie holds with people (similarly to Sixth Sense, which I figured out in about 25 minutes.) You may like it, but it just doesn't do it for me.",

From top to bottom, SEVEN delivered. I happened to be working at a video store (which, for lack of a more appropriate name, I'll call Lackluster) and I heartily recommended SEVEN to those browsing for a weekend's diversion. Alongside me at Lackluster worked a beautiful young blonde who eventually came to like me (naturally). She asked me one evening what I wanted for my upcoming birthday. Being a bit of a wise-ass, I replied that what I really wanted, more than anything, was a human skull to display on my mantle (which I didn't even have). The next thing I knew, she brought a battered cardboard box into Lackluster and laid it before me. ""Happy birthday,"" she said, and walked away. I looked at the box, which was fairly heavy (I hefted it), and I noticed that there were dead WEEDS sticking out of it. I stuck my courage to the sticking place and opened the box. Inside was a human skull. A hole in the top of the skull revealed an empty brain cavity; the INSIDE of the brain cavity was lined with criss-crossing red and blue veins. I politely thanked the girl for such a thoughtful gift and declined it. She left with the box that night and I never saw it again- but, the very next day, a news item caught my attention: a local graveyard had been ""vandalized"" the night before and ""one of the graves had been desecrated.""

You go into Seven, thinking it's just another serial killer movie, you come out, somewhat disturbed, jarred by it's none more shock ending, you'll never see coming, and it's great twenty minute lead up, which for some people who are easily disturbed, should steer away from. Freeman is solid here, where in many familiar start scenarios, here, he's just retiring from the department, when who should walk in, but cocky, arrogant, anger charged Pitt, in one of his best ever performances, where these two great actors were praised, warranted some acting stature. We have light hearted moments, ""meet the family"" scenes that worked well, amidst the mostly heavy and intense material, the John Doe chaser scene is awesome.

The buddy-cop chemistry that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share is built over several scenes in between the procedurals. Fincher, working off Andrew Kevin Walker's script, adds neo-noir visual flourishes (the use of climate, be it sun or rain, is superbly effective) and crafts elaborate scenes that allow emotions to sink in. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't as prominent a presence as the other two, but she adds the much needed sensitive heft. The crimes (or the crime scenes) themselves are gruesomely portrayed, not toning down their visceral nature one bit. Se7en isn't throwing these barbaric ideas at you just for the sake of cheap shocks - it gives the antagonist (played by Kevin Spacey) an arc of his own, and also lets viewers in on his ideologies in that intriguing pre-climactic car scene.",

David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a rookie detective on the rise. He's teamed up with Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who's not far away from retirement. They end up on a case investigating murders that follow a pattern and are inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins from Dante's ""The Devine Comedy"". Somerset is an expert in hunting down criminals and does things the old-fashioned way through years of working hard, due to looming retirement and a desire to stay alive he doesn't want to get involved too heavily - his years and the weariness they have brought him suggest that there is more going on than just another killer on the loose. Mills on the other hand wants to make a name for himself and pushes the case and his involvement. They fall out a little, it takes a meeting with Tracy Mill (Gwyneth Paltrow - Pitt's film wife) to convince Somerset that he has to be involved, if nothing else than to guide and protect Mills. Thus they pursue the murder, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) who has planned a shock for the detectives. ",

The pace is somewhat slow, in fact I felt some scenes were disposable. There is also a weird design choice where every so often the frame rate decreases, I felt that this detracts from the film rather than helps it (it might just be my friend's DVD, who knows). Besides those two flaws, Se7en is a classic, and a must see for all fans of mystery and suspense. The first gun shot, in my view, was one of the scariest things I've seen in a movie besides the horror genre. The ending is gut wrenching and has a sense of irony where I'd normally laugh, if I wasn't mentally pulverized. While its flaws are apparent, its not to deny that Se7en's great acting (Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman) pitch perfect direction (David Fincher) and relentless psychological tension makes it an excellent movie. A must see!",

While the whopper of an ending has stuck with me, I recalled little else other than that I wasn't super impressed by this back then and I think a lot of that had to do with my then not very high opinion of Brad Pitt. It's a well made, unusual, sometimes gruesome serial killer crime story about with a solid performance from Morgan Freeman. I always had a problem with Pitt when he was young in that I didn't think he was all that great of an actor. I still have some issues with him here, but he's better than I remembered and has some moments that are interesting. This was a big year for Kevin Spacey with this and The Usual Suspects, but it's hard to look at him now in this creepy role that he plays so perfectly. Seems a lot of people on here love this good movie.",

I thought his Alien 3 film was much more powerful than other people I know and here Fincher shows he has talent. The mood is set from the very beginning, especially the credit sequence. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt become their characters and the film pulls you into its universe. It makes you feel scared, it makes you think.

Se7en is, in my mind, the best detective movie ever made and here's why. This is one twisted, messed-up and depressing movie, but it's not unwatchable. It's actually hugely entertaining, it's got two amazing set-pieces and it's a compelling, unpredictable story. Many other movies which feature such a terrifying antagonist are often really hard to watch, but here the film works as a blockbuster still. David Fincher's direction is flawless, the cinematography is amazing and the city in which the film takes place is a truly disturbing environment. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are outstanding (Even Gwyneth Paltrow is quite good here) and their characters feel like humans, not just like actors. This is first and foremost a study of evil, but it doesn't shove its themes down our throats. This explores its nihilistic concepts with art and subtlety, so that the relentlessly harrowing subject matter doesn't get in the way of characters and action. Best of all, this has one of the greatest movie endings in the history of cinema, and for that alone it's worth watching. A truly great movie, which holds up very well on a re-watch, and is one of my favourite films of the 90s.",

This movie is one of the most satisfying but at the same time disturbing movies in recent times, which has been highly appreciated by most. It's a very well written screenplay, great dialogues and captivating narrative. It's well balanced movie with right references to humor, psychology, philosophy, and life in general. Must say one of David's best work, if not the best. Morgan and Brad were a great combo team, both equally charming in their roles. Kevin landed a great role, and worked on his favor for a long time. The movie had a fantastic finale, and as the movie said, will be remembered for years to come and researched. I think as we watch the movie multiple times, as I did, we learn something new, something about self and something about the society, that at first movie movie viewing might not have made sense.
What did not work:
Although it's a very finely written piece of work, some
more focus on minute details would have reduced the loopholes to very few.

Seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. The whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. When you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. Morgan Freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while Brad Pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. The movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, R.

212,21 February 2005,tjb103,9, An Eulogy of 'Seven': The modern Shakespearean tragedy,"When audiences went to see the latest production of a tragedy by William Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre, there was a universal reaction by the spectators to what they were seeing on the stage. It was one of sadness, anger, sympathy and relief. The sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as Desdemona in 'Othello'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have Iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature ('Othello' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (Horatio perhaps in 'Hamlet', or maybe Father Laurence in 'Romeo and Juliet'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play's violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel. Now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this. I believe that Fincher's 'Seven' is the modern Shakespearean tragedy, the modern 'Titus Andronicus', if you will. The feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in Seven (which are damn good credits I might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great Shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why I think that films such as Seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense. Not only that, but the film even introduces the audience to legendary texts such as Dante's 'Inferno' and Geoffrey Chaucer's 'The Canterbury Tales' - so I would be inclined to try and influence more English professors to watch this film.

The intense downpour of rain present throughout (most of) the movie adds so much to the noir atmosphere the film evokes. The lighting is quite minimal throughout the movie.

221,20 May 2016,Icarus_prime,8," A grisly, visceral hard-boiled thriller with a superb ending","This is a perfect example where a movie is good and/or got better due to its ending. Three-quarters of the whole film is pretty much stock standard crime, mystery thriller and the ""senior-rookie"" relationship between the characters that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt portray is straightforward but not generic and narrow-minded since their chemistry is so natural. The reason for the latter is that the character, Mills while impulsive, his short-tempered and foul-mouth personality doesn't detract his presence and overall viewing experience of the movie. He's kept in check by William; the archetypal ""calm and collected veteran"" but during moments like these, they actually have interesting, contrasting discussions in how they see the world, the people and the crimes within a detective's perspective. The film sets up so they avoid Mills' emotional outcries as the focus of the scene which I appreciate. It makes Mills a more multi-dimensional character because we can clearly see him and William are presented as different people on the surface. But the film takes an effort to establish how they're different. ",

Morgan Freeman as the smart older and on the verge of retiring cop but is pulled back in for this one last case.. is excellent. Its a shame this didn't receive more Oscar attention. It really found its groove later on I suppose as a classic. Not recommended as a family film has a lot of violence as its a take on the 7 deadly sins.

They think that this is going to be a hard case, but not scarring. They keep their heads high and don't think much of it.

The studios know that Americans and lots of foreign markets like southeast Asia LOVE violence for its own sake and so they dish it up because it sells. It sells better than sex. Religious zealots will let their kids watch violence while insisting that they avoid sex. So these kinds of movies get elevated to Academy stature. It's symptomatic of the American psyche. We would rather let our kids kill someone than have too much sex. Okay, that's overstated but you get the point. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous violence porn producers.

He stated that he would rather have brain cancer than make another film at the time. But thank God he continued. He was a born master with his signature perfectionist filmmaking. The performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptional. They played off each other so well. Especially during the scene where they talk about apathy.

Alien3 was far too dreary and bleak, while The Game seemed to be a hollow,if stylish, exercise in manipulation. Having said that, I must register my admiration for Se7en. It was both absolutely terrifying and  thought -provoking. The cinematography, the acting,and script were all superb. Morgan Freeman is indeed one of the world's greatest actors, while Brad Pitt does a great job  as the slow-witted, dogged, arrogant young cop. (Perhaps because his own personality in real life is so similar.) However, the revelation is the performance by the actor playing ""John Doe"" . I will not give his name, as that would help give away the plot Having sung se7ens praises, why do I call it ""nihilistic""? For one thing, the overall tone of the film is one of dread and despair.

An unpredictable serial killer plot, the great storytelling of ace director David Fincher, performed by always reliable Morgan Freeman, star actor Brad Pitt and if it was not enough Kevin Spacey who does not how to do bad acting, all these give you one of the darkest and chilling thriller of all time. From the word go, you find yourself solving the case with two detectives played by Morgan and Brad. At one moment, they are very near to solve the case and then everything is turned upside down with a heartbreaking climax. Another movie that comes this close to perfection in serial killer plots is another David Fincher classic Zodiac. Gwyneth Paltrow as Brad's wide does well in her small part and provides lightness to otherwise heavy setup. Se7en although questioning the morality still maintains the good side of morality. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Se7en. You will enjoy it best when seen in total silence or undisturbed environment. If you love to be thrilled, then don't miss it!!",

There was a lot of pushback from the studio, from actors who turned down the lead roles, deeming the script 'too dark'; and from the marketers at New Line, who understandably didn't know how to sell such a horrific enterprise to the masses. The reality is that this film is no more or less violent than a zillion schlock horror movies that preceded it - it's just that it is so well done, so effective in its narrative, and so psychologically devastating that the resulting film is more horrific in scope than most anything ever made before it, or since.",

I don't recall having any major complaints and can't recall many minor complaints. To me this film just didn't have a 10 out of 10 script which is why I give it 8 stars. For me, the story is the most important part of just about every film. This movie's story was very good for the most part. However I had 2 big complaints. 1: for the first murder, they mention receipts for the food he bought. They mention that there was food bought twice the same day. Why didn't the cops investigate the store on the receipt and see if there was any video footage from either/both purchases? 2: I was able to predict the end right before it happened, which really is less than ideal when it was clearly meant to be a shock. I might have ranked the film higher if I hadn't just watched: Witness for the Prosecution. And that film pulls off the surprise ending better and more dramatically than just about any other film. So I had a high bar of expectation prior to seeing the film and I had really high hopes for 7, seeing how it has an 8.6 ranking. I think following my viewing i won't leave as a fan or hater of the film. I managed to see a lot of impressive components in the piece, and it's still well worth a viewing if you can handle the disturbing content. And maybe I was a rare case in predicting the end.",

What else, let me see, hmmm what about the great Kevin Spacey (come on Spacey of Americna Beauty, L.A. Confidential, Usual Suspect, 21 and his first and best Seven). Now, add to all that 7 sins which means 7 murders and not only that you need to guess what are the 7 sins because many people have watched it, loved it, praised it but when I asked them who was the 7th victim, they simply didn't know the answer. Count the people murdered in the movie once more and you will know what I am talking about. This movie is, simply and in one word, just amazing.",

249,11 January 2021,Morejambo54,9, The most tense movie I've ever seen!,"I'll start with my negatives about this movie which there are few of : I didn't like how the two main characters had a sort of hatred at the start but after one scene it was all forgotten about, it's not a big deal just a little glitch in the system. Some of the dialogue was a bit flat, it had me bored but it was necessary to follow the plot and give subtle hints/clues. The ending was a bit predictable as well but didn't change my reaction to the ending. That's it now onto the positives. The obvious one is how incredibly tense the movie is throughout, after every murder you wait with suspense for the next one wondering what will happen, the story really pushes that feel of anxiousness as it is very well written, every small detail leads to the bigger picture at the end... now the ending, although I predicted what was going to happen it didn't take away how impactful it was, I was clutching onto my seat after the big reveal, and the acting by Brad Pitt is amazing, his emotions made me sad, angry and nervous all at the same time! The main antagonist as mysterious as he was I found to be a bit disappointing, I didn't enjoy his small reveal when being chased, although I loved how he showed up at the start without me even noticing. When he was finally revealed though I was kind of underwhelmed, he wasn't scary and obviously no longer mysterious besides the fact we don't know his name, albeit he still was incredibly smart and well written into the plot. Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend it to many people unless they are a bit squeamish, because there are a few vile scenes, I give it 8.6/10 which rounds up to 9/10",

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt--apparently representing Reason and Passion, respectively--are cops on the trail of a serial killer. Kevin Spacey plays the killer as a Hannibal Lecter wannabe with a vengeful-angry-God complex: he bumps his victims off in ways that reflect the Seven Deadly Sins.  Not a new idea; Vincent Price made two similarly-constructed movies in the '70s: ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" in which the inspiration is the ten curses of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus; and ""Theater of Blood,"" in which Shakespeare's plays provide the motifs.

The film telegraphs it's ending from the moment in the middle of the film when Pitt, the detective, shouts after the killer: ""My name is Mills. That's spelled, M-I-L-L-S !"" It's a wonder he didn't add: ""And I live with my much loved wife at 18 Ceder Street, Apartment 3b"". (In how many of these films does the killer eventually wind up going after the hero's beloved wife or child as part of the movie's climax? It's so much of a cliche of the genre that it's become a standard closing plot element.) The most depressing part of this film experience is not that the good guys' lose and that the Jeffrey Dahlmer wannabe triumphs, it is that Hollywood will do anything for a buck - and that has to be another catagory of deadly sin not originally contemplated by Dante. I don't care how good the special effects are. If the movie sets out to use them to deliberately sicken the viewer; then it is an unimaginative misuse of the technology.

Shrewd little killer that he is, he has a 'nice' surprise in store for one of the cops. This picture was too complex to be completely entertaining. I feel the writer was trying to show the twisted working of a warped mind, but it just came off confusing and boring. As usual, Brad Pitt performs unconvincingly. He needs to switch acting coaches as he has yet to give anything more than a lackluster, phoney performance. I was particularly offended by his use of the handgun.

Se7en is a shocking, disturbing, cold, sinful thriller which takes hold of the audience for the entire length of the movie. The story is about two police cops, one about to retire and one a very young new entry played by Freeman and Pitt respectively. Just before Detective Somerset (Freeman) is about to retire, a strange case of murder comes into picture which introduces the police department to a cold-blooded, patient and deranged serial killer who kills people one after the other on the basis of seven deadly sins mentioned by religion which are subjected to death of the sinner. Thus the serial killer aims at killing 7 people, one for each sin respectively. Detectives Somerset and Mills (Pitt) are given this case and they both try their different methods to uncover this mystery and catch the killer.

Se7en is not an especially bad movie; it creates and maintains a particular atmosphere most of the way through; it is deliberately grungy, nasty, and brutal.

275,19 July 2018,muons,10, A dark psyco-thriller at its best,"A veteran detective counting his days to retirement and a rookie officer hungry for success and glory team up to hunt down a serial killer who refers to seven deadly sins in his gruesome murders. There's not a specific setting for the city where the drama unfolds except that it's a metropol area. The movie is perfect in directing, editing, acting and cinematography. Dark indoor scenes and narrow gloomy alleys shot under overcast and rainy skies fit very well with the brooding theme of the movie. Despite some intensive chase scenes and violence, Seven is not an action packed movie. Although it's technically classified as a crime thriller the psychological aspects of the main characters are emphasized. Some reviewers describe it as a slow paced movie but it is not. The scenes involving character development are as captivating as those with gun fights and rooftop chases. The tempo is successfully balanced in subplots but the tension is never lost and the movie never gets boring. While horrid murder scenes aren't for fainthearted they can't be compared to cartoonish blood and gore extravaganza in Tarantino's movie caricatures. Like all other scenes, the director D. Fincher uses them in moderation to instill terror in the audience. Some reviewers' comparison of the serial killer John Doe to Hannibal Lecture is ridiculous. With his unrealistic superhuman physical strength, H. Lecture's silly cartoon character looks more funny than frightening in scenes where he bites off ears and noses in a straight jacket and finds his way out from a locked iron cage. John Doe, on the other hand, is an average person who can be easily taken down in a fistfight but his psychopathic ramblings give him a much more real and menacing look.",

288,26 February 2005,smithcorey,8, Good Movie! worthy of #49? No.,"My opinion: This was a terrificly written and acted film. I especially liked the ending and how Pitt dealt with the contrasting emotions, especially when he first tried to shoot Doe, how his face cringed up. The lighting was good and the editing was tight. I was especially glad to see that the director didn't jump for the opportunity to show Brad Pitt as all sexy when he didn't' need to be. However, it just doesn't seem to me that Se7en should be the #49 movie of all time as ranked by movie goers. In the top 250? Yes, sure. But #49? I think that the star cast and good story overall are having a little too much influence in the votes. I can't really put my finger on it; part of it was that the last few deaths sped up really fast, like the beauty queen, and then the fact that they only drove one hour out of the city and they were in a desert took the sparkle of the film away from me. The plot's original, I'll give it that, but when you think about it, it seems a little cliché. A guy kills people when they commit one of the 7 deadly sins. death 1....death 2....death 3.... death 4....death 5....now a little twist is death 6...then the finale is death 7...(I'm thinking of why it didn't' strike me as worthy as #49 as i go) And John Doe's 6th murder that will supposedly make people ponder it for years wasn't all that crazy...he killed someone close to Pitt's character. eh...good script. good cast. Better than stuff like ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Reservior Dogs"", ""Being John Malkovich""? I don't agree. Again, it's my opinion. Maybe others would like to agree and add to why I believe it's not #49, maybe others will defend what I've said, I'd like to hear both sides. It's a good movie, nonetheless.",

Upon release people already knew that this movie was going to be a classic and would be seen for decades to come. With the two Oscar-winning actors Morgan freeman as detective Someset and Brad Pitt as detective Mills in the lead this movie provides a energetic and true acting. Se7en is about a reckless serial killer killing ""innocent"" people related to the seven deadly sins of Christianity. Detective Somerset and Mills are put to on the case, but they're soon to know that the serial killer has a plan for them both. This movie is without a doubt a cult classic film. Because of its unique camera angels and editing as well as its quite absurd ending. It does make you think about the lifestyle that we are living in. Therefore i give this movie a solid 9/10!",

The movie was sooo bad that it made my other rental film Urban Legend look like an exciting horror classic---and that was only an OK film. Seven is a horrible experience,   little gore,   little action,  mild absurdities,   basically a very gloomy unentertaining tone.  Even Gweneth Paltrow was stupid and frankly had--no interesting lines and they didn't even show the way she looked at the end--so upsetting.  Just like the Baby with Rosemary's baby,   the director denied a crucial element,  it is just that unlike Rosemary's Baby,  I didn't care an inch about the way Seven looked at that point. Thrillers like Fatal Attraction,  The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,  and The Tie That Binds are movies that at least have an entertaining and lighter deranged glow.  Seven is just dark,  boring,  and so uninvolving.  The actors good but the story stunk.",
319,21 September 2016,heatsilver,10, Man vs. Society,"Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic naïve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film.",

I have sympathy for Seven naysayers in that the movie nihilism feels very arrested development and Walker script is a serviceble one blowup for too lofty ambitions (by him and Fincher), but there's no deny conviction and Fincher really put a lot of effort into his urban hell (Taxi Driver made by people who saw it at the right impressionable age) and Freeman sells the grim determinism for all its worth. It is an overlabored movie that very much needs all the heavy hand to make its effect convincing. It also has a lot of good old fashioned craft to sustain itself. It is predicted in the opposition between the cops investigative grunt work (which intentionally goes nowhere) and Spacey's grand design (which as smarter people than me have point out Fincher keeps equating with his own). The Hollywood machinery parts work very well starting with Freeman/Pitt stock pairing, a great collection of faces filling the background and Fincher and his main collaborators (Khondji, Francis-Bruce, Shore, the Max/Wissner/Griffith trio) do put together some impressive big scenes around the investigative work. I remember seeing Seven with my dad during the original release and the ending was the greatest thing ever, but now I think the movie mostly loses me after Spacey big theatrical entrance, part is his very mannered performance meeting Walker script going into overdrive, part is feeling the strings too much, anyone who reads me knows I don't care about plausible logic, but the extense that the movie effect depends on equating Spacey to God/Fincher means the flimsiness of the whole thing does feels wrong, far too reverse engineered to make the payoff really work. Still, there's some one hour of great stuff delivered by some very skilled people doing top tier work and it was very important for me once upon a time, but I can't deny it works better now as occasional 20 minutes chunks on cable.",

I wonder if perhaps it might look a little less but it really is wonderful. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and all great as well as Gwyneth Paltrow and, of course Kevin Spacey.

Brad Piit & Morgan Freeman as Detectives Mills and Sommerset are after a devious, grisly killer who murders his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins (Sloth, Greed, Envy, etcetera, etc..), in this extremely well crafted, gripping, suspenseful thriller, that never falls into the one tap that these thrillers too often fall into, which is letting the audience get ahead of the plot. ALL of the actors in this film are superb in their respective parts, including Kevin Spacey who gives his best performance of his career, just slightly edging out his part in ""The Usual Suspects"" in my mind. It also features one of the greatest endings that I've ever witnessed. Moreso, the entire film has a kind of poetic beauty and sense of grace that comes off it that is simply mesmerizing and makes this film one that is simply a sheer joy to come back to again and again. A must see modern day classic, no matter how you slice it, this movie comes with my highest recommendations.",

What did she do to deserve to die? She wasn't a ""sin committer"" and what did Mills even do to deserve that? He wasn't a ""sin committer"" either. But John ends his murdering spree by saying that he is Envy and Mills will become Wrath??? Mills and his wife did nothing to deserve being a part of the 7 deadly sins, according to Johns logic. It doesn't make any sense. And then Morgan Freeman just walks off apathetically, ready to continue his life. Just cold, man. Might have liked the movie better if the ending was different.",

However this film has one big problem, and that's that it's overly repetitive, The whole film is just the two main heroes finding clues, and the victims of the main villain John Doe, because all of his victims are sinners, and he possibly is doing good deeds for God. Also, the people that are calling this disturbing, obviously don't know what a disturbing movie is, if you want a disturbing movie that actually can move you sick, and feels horrible, go watch Martyrs, Cannibal Holocaust or Faces of Death, and Serbian film. Or if you want good exploitation crime films watch Machete, Hobo with a Shotgun, Feed or Murder Set Pieces. This was nowhere near shocking. There's nothing exploitative or shocking about it. Yes the subject matter the stories said in this film is disturbing, but the problem is, the film is overly repetitive that it gets really boring.",
382,4 October 2019,ronakkotian,10," Bleak, thrilling and crafted to perfection",David Fincher's Se7en isn't just your ordinary detective investigating murders and trying to catch the killer film.

383,3 May 2017,stoneoliver,9, The killer had to be more present in movie,The only reason I am giving 9 out of 10 for this masterpiece is the fact that Kevin Spacey doesn't have more screen time.

384,15 April 2015,maxwell-364,8, Genius in concept and execution,"Se7en's concept is inherently interesting: a serial killer who bases his murders off of the seven deadly sins is notable enough (and certainly opens the door for social commentary), while the characters of Somerset and Mills are both clashing and easy to relate with in their respective passion and persnickety meticulousness. There was no doubt that following the two detectives hunt down John Does was going to be a treat. But what Fincher does so beautifully here is surpass the intrigue caused by the film's writing with pacing that escalates the film's events from noteworthy on a base level to thrilling. ",

After the inevitable whining between the new partners, they start to actually do some good work together. The murder themes are the seven deadly sins and each murder is executed according to one of the sins. Some good special effects and really disgusting scenes make this film not one for the kids. I've watched this film several times because each time you pick up more visual effects. They finally capture the calm and cool killer who plays on the younger detectives frailties very well pushing all his buttons while the old guy tries to keep things from escalating. The twist at the end is well worth the rest of the film. If you don't like sick and disgusting mutilations, stay away from this film.",

395,19 September 2005,jboothmillard,9, Se7en,"From director David Fincher (Alien³, Fight Club, Panic Room), I had heard about the film, seen one or two clips, and heard about things go on and the concept, so I was really when I finally watched it. Basically two homicide detectives are partnered to investigate a series of homicides. They are soon-to-retire Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and short-tempered but enthusiastic replacement Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). The murders are inspired by the seven deadly sins: Gluttony (overindulgence and overconsumption), Greed (or Avarice, the desire and pursuit of material possessions), Sloth (habitual disinclination to exertion, or laziness), Pride (or Vanity, the irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments), Lust (or Lechery, intense longing), Envy (jealousy for another person's good fortune) and Wrath (or Anger, uncontrolled feelings of rage, even hatred). A man was forced to eat until his stomach ruptured, representing Gluttony, and a defence attorney was killed after a pound of flesh was taken from him, representing Greed. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find the third victim, a child molester and drug dealer, strapped to bed and starved to death, representing Sloth. Photographs of the third victim were taken over a year ago, showing that the crimes were planned far in advance. Somerset and Mills use various literal sources to identify anything related to the seven deadly sins, including John Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno, and through library records they identify a man called Jonathan ""John"" Doe, and track him to his apartment. Does flees as they arrive, Mills gives chase, Doe holds him at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. After breaking into the apartment, Mills and Somerset find it contains hundreds of notebooks revealing the psychotic nature of Doe, as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made bladed strap-on, representing Lust. The following day the fifth victim, a female model is found dead with her face mutilated, Doe gave her the choice of calling for help and living disfigured, or committing suicide by taking pills, representing Pride. As Somerset and Mills return to the station, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim, he cannot be properly identified, as he has removed his own fingerprints, meaning he literally is ""John Doe"" (anonymous). Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims, but only under specific terms, or he will plead insanity, Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees. The detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location, while a helicopter follows them. Soon after their arrival, a delivery van approaches, Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset stops the van, the driver has been instructed to deliver a box to them. Doe taunts Mills by telling him how he admires and is jealous of his life with Tracy, he himself is representing Envy. Somerset opens the box, he is shocked by its contents and warns Mills to stay back, Doe states that he killed Tracy, her head is in the box, and he reveals that she was pregnant. Despite warning Mills that Doe will win if he kills him, Mills shoots Doe, fulfilling the final murder, and himself representing Wrath, in the end the devastated Mills is taken away. Also starring Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Police Captain, Scrubs' John C. McGinley as the California SWAT team leader, Richard Roundtree as District Attorney Martin Talbot, Richard Schiff as Mark Swarr, Mark Boone Junior as Greasy FBI Man, Reg E. Cathey as Dr. Santiago and Speed's Hawthorne James as George the Night Guard at the Library. Freeman is great as the dignified and credible detective on the brink of retirement, and he is equally matched by the raw but idealistic Pitt, Paltrow is alright in her short time, and Spacey steals the last few scenes as the psychopathic killer. This is a really clever and sophisticated postmodern movie, the script and narrative is daring, the murders and violence are disturbing, you follow the mystery unfolding, there is a jump or two along the way (the man strapped to the bed thought to be dead suddenly waking is a good one), the use of dark colouring and underlighting adds to the bleakness, and the twist ending is fantastic, it is just a marvellous must see crime thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Brad Pitt was number 15, Morgan Freeman number 27, and Kevin Spacey number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pitt was also number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 30 The World's Greatest Actors, and the film was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

I did not feel that sense of mystery I was promised, no new chords were struck. Those last scenes which were supposed to be the climax, was the worst part. I mean did Brad Pitt only have the choice to shoot or not shoot Spacey? Could he not have just about hurt him real bad?....which in my opinion is a far more exciting form of vengeance and makes a hell of a lot more sense than killing, because death is the end to pain. And Spacey's character demanded that of him, so he triumphed. Morgan Freeman had warned him that he he was not fit for the job. Anyway finally I would like to know why we don't see Paltrow's head in the box in the end, its not like that would be any more gory than what we had already witnessed.",
399,26 December 2015,Kausality_,8, Dour.,"David Fincher's ""Se7en"" is one such movie that blurs the line between a giallo horror and a psychological thriller. ""Se7en"" sets a mood which is chilling, dark and puzzling. A mood that is present all through the entire movie. The mood set is the excellent work of director David Fincher, who wanted to give dark and gloomy atmosphere to the movie just to expose a world which is rough, bleak and gritty. The effect it makes is astounding and is does so by good camera work and lighting, or the lack of it. The cameras used in this film was specially changed film stock to make the visuals look as dark as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score. The ominous music that is added keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. If it wasn't for disturbing message that ""Se7en"" puts across, and astonishing dark scenes, I would have not given the rating I gave.",

Here you get to see the most moronic individual ever to wear a detective's badge (well played by Brad Pitt, but it may come naturally to him) team up with the standard wise, fatherly old cop (Freeman) to trade cop talk lifted from some TV series for about an hour and a half. Interspersed with this insipid dialogue are (1) some gross scenes which are meant to be shocking; and (2) random scenes featuring Gwyneth Paltrow which have absolutely nothing to do with what passes for a plot up to that point, making it pretty clear that either (a) something's gonna happen to her in the end; (b) the script was written by a moron; or (c) both of the above. Nothing of any interest at all happens until Kevin Spacey finally shows up, but even he has trouble making anything out of this silly, predictable wanna-be thriller. While I'm at listing things, here are the top two most annoying things about this movie (apart from Brad Pitt's non-character): (1) almost every outdoor scene features pouring rain (how utterly noir!); (2) almost every indoor scene takes place in an apartment which for some inexplicable reason has no lights, or whose occupants use exclusively 5-watt lightbulbs (so noir, it hurts).",

Andrew Kevin Walker wrote a doozy of a script and the acting by a stellar cast is superb. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt match each other scene for scene and Kevin Spacey's performance is nothing short of outstanding. He is chillingly believable as the morally ambiguous serial killer. The only one who disappoints is Gwyneth Paltrow, her character not given much time to develop due to not receiving much screen time. The final scene between the three male leads is electrifying. The cinematography is bleak, raining in almost every scene except the last. The denouement is shattering and leaves one feeling very unsettled. Despite there being little to no violence on- screen, it is extremely dark and chilling. This is a movie that will leave you questioning the morals of the world around you. David Fincher directed a movie that is nothing short of a masterpiece. One that demands multiple viewings.",
422,14 January 2019,schatzkilla,2, Not quite sure about all the hype...,"Don't get me wrong it was suspenseful at times (insert suspenseful music here) and was supported by an outstanding cast.. though it is just very predictable. From the start we see that Mills is a weak rookie detective who makes the most simple of mistakes even when being pleaded not to. So we know he will be victimized at the conclusion of the film.. How hard was it for me to take a wild guess and say that the press guy attempting to take photos at the scene of the crime was in fact our serial killer ""John Doe""...... not very hard I must admit. The fact that the director had to bring to our attention that Mill's wife Tracy is pregnant and hiding it from Mills tells us that something gruesome is going to happen to her or the baby in the end... and all it's doing is creating a little more suspense.. but yet still easily predictable.. The only reason I finished the film was the slightest hope of something unpredictable happening. And unfortunately I never got that.. so I wasted about two hours.",
423,25 March 2013,musicallyrt,1, Trash,"I only ever take the trouble to review movies that I truly despise, and Se7en is one of them. The film is a trite, cliché and asinine piece - whilst possessing some virtues, is composed primarily of sins. A quick note - other reviews seem to be criticising the ""excessive"" violence and gore in this film - what do you expect from a film about a serial killer? Firstly - the acting is good, for the most part. Freeman is good as the Dashiell Hammet/Raymond Chandler inspired cynical old cop. Brad Pitt overacts every time he is on screen, making his unbearable character even more unbearable. Kevin Spacey does a suitably creepy (albeit cliché) job of portraying a sadistic, masochistic serial killer.",

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are a pairing couple or opposite personalities and Kevin Spacey is the villain we all love and hate, such a great performance. Intelligent writing with no clichés and the imagery of the grotesque never descends into thoughts unnecessary gore or sensationalism. Brilliant cinematography with a bleak tone, the film has a sense of dread and some moments are climax. Se7en sticks with you in your and it's really unforgettable. The plot keeps you hooked until the most terrifying final moments you will ever see. It is scary because it uses your imagination against you in a deep, deeper level. A classic crime thriller that remains uncompromising no matter how many times you watch it.",

If ""Fight Club"" was the ultimate theme park ride for repressed white collar slaves, ""Se7en"" is the haunted house.

The characters, mainly the trio of detective william somerset (morgan freeman), detective david mills (brad pitt), and john doe (kevin spacey). But john doe really stand out for me. David fincher brilliantly used the ""less is more"" logic when writing john doe's character, with very few scenes he still was one the best villians in movies. Every sentence he said says a lot about his personality. And the twist while being kind of predictable was nevertheless a shock. Tracey's head wasn't even shown to the screen but freeman's reaction was more than enough to tell us how horrifying it was. The cinematography in this movie is so goddman pretty. The leap of the relaxing scene of the library with the classical music and police officers playing poker in the background to the tense hotel shootout scene to the very stressful and depressing scene of the ""box"" was ONE HELLUVA LEAP.

Ernest Hemingway once said, ""The world is a beautiful place, and it's worth fighting for."" Well, I only agree with the second part; With these words, the ending scene of one of Hollywood's greatest crime and mystery films was drawn. Se7en is a drama and suspense movie that was shown in 1995, which managed to make a wonderful mixture of several components, including the dark presentation style that harmonizes with the events of the film, the intense and focused plot and its development from beginning to end and the polished acting, all of these factors were in response to the wishes of the genius director David Fincher, who is considered This movie is a bright spot for everyone working on it.",
437,3 March 2022,kelboy10,9, Deadly sins,"The seven deadly sins, where do I start? This methodical killer is precise leaving hellacious destruction in his path with sick twisted mind games for the detectives to unfold. Each victim has a sin placed beside him/her with reasoning unclear at first sight. Each death more sick any twisted by the minute. My reasoning for finally giving this a viewing and rating not only because it was on my to do list however daunting it seemed, was because tomorrow I am viewing Matt Reeves's The Batman whom took influence from se7en. This is my first viewing of se7en which deploys a gritty noir tone whilst maintaining style and letting off a disturbing nature of inhuman intellect. What I would say is once the killer is uncovered there isn't really much of a twist just a fine line between insanity and sanity. This antagonist asks the questions on what makes one so innocent? What makes you so different from me? Of course in any homicidal maniac eyes he is never the villain, he believes himself to be doing gods will, a saviour if you like. So let's get to the film, Brad Pitt was a stand out performance for me as Mills reaching a variety of emotions throughout the film. Mills feels incapable of giving up on this case and sees the killer John Doe as insane, he has no admiration of any action taken by the killer. (Morgan Freeman) plays Somerset who is equally keen to bring John Doe down but is wise enough and been in the game long enough to know this isn't gonna end well. Why couldn't he have just god damn retire already? I can feel him thinking this in his approach and acting. The world is a dark place for Somerset whilst in addition to almost retiring he can see the intellect of the killer and the methods to his madness. Somerset knows the killer isn't mentally insane just strategic and evil. Morgan does a splendid job alongside Pitt as a polar opposite, he is the more composed of the two, the more experienced and logical thinker. Kevin Spacey brings a very eerie performance of the highest magnitude, he has memorable moments leaving you stunned with mesmerisingly compelling believable acting. (Gwyneth Paltrow) Tracy is Mills love interest however she feels alienated in a new city whilst her man is tracking down the killer. Tracy feels like she is a burden and can't open up to Mills about this whilst he is so busy on duty. I felt her performance too, it really added layers to the script with themes of isolation and loneliness. Overall the film as a whole has stylish backdrops and locations with a very noir feel, fantastic acting and deep psychological thinking. Different views are explored through a variety of characters.",

From the get-go, with its use of imagery and atmosphere, you are thrown into this grimy realistic world. The film never lets go of this razor-sharp tone and doubles-down on its dark themes. The use of rain and dirty city life perpetuates its message to the audience about the world. All of these points are a testament to the immersion of this film.",

440,21 May 2016,Horror-yo,7, Highly overrated Fincher Crime/Drama,"This film serves as a stage for a nice thriller's premise, a serial killer who commits his crimes with the theme of the 'seven deadly sins', the ever popular biblical concept. Throw in Brad Pitt, the young hard-nose copper and his associate, the more seasoned, gathered Morgan Freeman who serves as a token of maturity and intellectual analysis, Gwyneth Paltrow as the always worried lovely blonde, and the villain, portrayed by an excellent actor who, quite honestly, makes the ending into anything good at all. The movie is too long, too bloody/gory for no good reason, the off-plot filler dialog is awful and irrelevant, why with such a theme for the film they couldn't think up anything compelling for their protagonists to say ?? The ending revolves heavily around certain characters, and besides the fact it's terribly acted out by Brad Pitt particularly, it is an escalated climax to something that hasn't gained enough momentum to really be dramatic. We get what the film-makers were trying to do, but considering everything that could've been achieved, this is but a pale, over-long, hollow and quite unprofessional rendering of what it could've/should've been. Solid film still; still a solid premise and relevant enough to warrant a viewing.",

442,10 July 2022,Joshumms,8, Overrated,"While this is a great movie, I think it is a little bit overrated and definitely not Fincher's best work. The first hour and a half is a somewhat basic cop drama with some interesting thinks sprinkled within. It is still a good cop drama in that respect but it is made quite a bit better with a pretty good mystery and some interesting philosophical ideas between the characters.

443,19 October 2022,raj-bhullar,6, Not as good as people think it is,"I got bored watching this movie many times. BUT it also has some good moments. I'll breakdown both good and bad. Firstly, It's predictable. I predicted long before that Brad Pitt actors wife was gonna die. And when the box came I already knew the wife's head was in it. I just deduced it from the number of actors in the movie. Not many faces so it wasn't hard to deduce. So the ending was not a big shocking moment for me. There are many scenes in the movie which bore me. Like the dinner scene where the whole house starts shaking because of the subway. Totally useless scene. They start laughing crazily too and I didnt find that scene funny at all. There were many useless scenes like this. Where I felt bored. Felt like nothing was happening. There are some thriller scenes here and there. There were a couple of good scenes which I enjoyed. The scene where they try to enter the apartment and the killer starts shooting was amazing. Also the scene in the end when they are talking in the car with the killer, it has some amazing dialogue. That's the only part I liked about the movie. Overall I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Slightly disappointed. If you are into mystery then you should watch Prisoners. It's a way better movie than this.",

This movie really messes with your mind and really makes ya think, and it's no date flick that's for sure. This made me squirm in my seat couple of times. The ending is especially chilling and trust me you won't see it coming, it's very unpredictable and will make you feel uncomfortable (in a good way. there is plenty of shocking blood and violence. We get a corpse with a huge pool of blood around it , blood on a window, plenty of bloody disturbing imagery, LOTS of nasty looking corpses, nasty stitched up corpse, corpse without a stomach (nasty) gory photos, corpse with no arm, severed hand in a jar, bloody beatings and more!. The acting is Oscar worthy (in my humble opinion). Morgan Freeman is absolutely stunning here and there is no doubt his performance was Oscar worthy he and Brad Pitt had AMAZING chemistry together and was EXTREMELY likable. Brad Pitt is AWESOME here and did a VERY good job and his character was really likable and was great in the emotional scenes. Gyneth Paltrow is GORGEOUS and does excellent as David's wife.

(Spoiler warning) There is a moment towards the end of the film which refers to G.P.'s character . . . it slows down the scene that is happening at the time, it is horribly timed and out of place, and there is simply no reason for it . . . except for one thing : to hint that something is going to happen to G.P's character. Only, it is so out of place that it is not a hint, it is a misplaced scream, and considering everything that has already taken place and the sins that are left, you have a definite idea of what is going to happen. The movie would have been better by leaving this moment out. The only surprise for me (BIG Spoiler warning) was it seeming to be the head as opposed to the baby/fetus in the box. Personally, I think the idea of it being the baby is better than the head because it emphasizes both their deaths more so and it is sicker. And ""sick"" seems to be what they were going for for most of the film. Anyhow, overall, it's an okay movie. But the ending to me just doesn't come anywhere at all close to living up to the hype.

Scenarist Andrew Kevin Walker builds a script that hooks and never exhausts itself during the full two hours that the movie lasts.

The viewer soon begins to empathise with Brad Pitt's seemingly over- confident character. This is similar for Morgan Freeman's cool, calm and collected camera. This turns out to be significant towards the end of the movie. This movie is no murder mystery like any other, and perhaps not much of a murder mystery at all. This is due to the difficulty that the detectives have when attempting to solve the case. With any other actors, the movie may have been unbearable as it is often slow paced.

I always give up watching it during the movie 'cause it bores me. I don't find it exciting at all. Just two policemen chasing a guy. I've seen similar movies that are way thrilling than this. And the reason why the guy is killing are stupid. It's just not inspiring enough for me to make me sit down and watch the whole thing. I always end up zapping on another channel or pick up a book to read. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor. He's the reason why I'm trying to see the movie every time it goes on TV. But not even him can make me interested to make it through to the end. And Brad Pitt. I can't stand that guy. He's not that good as he think he is.",

479,15 April 2012,mikes-movie-review-onlin,9," ""An exercise in storytelling, visual style and suspense""","David Fincher's dark, gruesome and intelligent thriller Se7en remains one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It's dark visual tone and use of pathetic fallacy coupled with the harrowing story of a killer attempting to teach humanity a lesson is both disturbing and brilliant. Fincher shows audiences his true capabilities as a director, and Se7en is an exercise in storytelling, visual style, and suspense, making it one of the definitive crime thrillers of the 20th century.",
480,22 December 1999,jmcody,3," an ugly, abusive assault on the audience","I can point to se7en as an indicator as to what is wrong with American Film today. It is ultimately the work of cynics who, despite possessing a remarkble skill for handling the technological wonders that make up film craft, have absolutely no respect or affection for the audience.Se7en celebrates the destructive power of evil in its purest form.  Although the film contains fantastic cinematography and expert performances from the cast (especially Freeman), I sincerely wonder at the motivations behind Fincher and the rest of the creators of this ugly, pretentious and abusive picture. It absolutely wallows in filth, grime and blood. To director Fincher's credit, he has probably come the closest to capturing Bosch on film. If they (the filmmakers) are out to expose the sinful nature of the human being well guess what, most of us already know that- Fincher has us at hello if that is his focus. Much has been written about the twist at the ending. I'm sorry, this ending shows no respect for the audience and their sensiblities what so ever. It makes the two hours one has spent watching this film utterly wasted. Because the most articulate character in the film is the hidden killer (played by an absolutly incredible actor), I wonder if the film makers see themselves as spiritual blood brothers with the pyschopath. The film is dark, unrelenting and completely devoid of any joy, hope or resurrection. Pessimistic films can be extremely effective note The Seven Samurai, The Sergio Leone films, Dr. Strangelove and others, but those films had senses of  humour and balance to their pessimism. Again, I ask the motivations of the makers of this film: If you want me to feel dirty, raped and corrupted by the ""real"" world, I already am, I don't need to raped in the ""reel"" world by cynical opportunists wanting to make a buck off of the audience's already jaded spirits.",
481,7 October 2022,mcjensen-05924,1, Very Poor Film Making,Here you can see excellent actors giving terrible performances. Brad Pitt was so wooden in this role it was painful. His dialogue delivery was unendurable. Morgan Freeman was not much better. This was such an exercise in putting out such a pile of steaming rubbish it's almost laughable. Almost. As for the story itself it wasn't too bad. The execution of it is where everything falls apart. No adherence to basic police procedure. I know it's just a movie but still credibility has to enter into the proceedings at some point. This just gets worse and worse until the big finale which is such a disappointing flop it's incredible. Paltrow turns in yet another mundane forgettable performance. Nothing but stink on stink here.,

The suspense, the atmosphere, the gruesome theme and basic idea of a serial killer killing people by the seven deadly sins is fascinating. The plot is great, you never lose interest, and it keeps evolving for every passing minute. The pacing is great. The acting is great, the actors all do their job perfectly. The characters are believable and their actions are understandable. The whole movie is a cinematic masterpiece, and it truly deserves the praise it is getting. The ending alone has become history in modern film-making; never has an ending been more perfect, more intense or more genius. The whole movie is extremely well-thought out, but the ending alone is a masterpiece. It should be used as an example(and probably is) in film schools, to teach film students how to master true cinematic power. I recommend this to anyone who has just a little interest in thrillers, and who can take the violence. Truly a masterpiece. 10/10",

Without a doubt it has a plot interesting of the beginning until the final. I'd like to watch more film of this style.

However, the rest of the film is just all about finding an excuse to put more blood and violence onto the screen.  They never explained why the killer is obsessed with the Seven sins.  And the way they found the killer was 100% laughable (going through a city's public library system and find who borrows a book.  first of all, wouldn't you buy the book instead of borrowing it from the stupid library? secondly, do they realize how many people use that library and borrow books of the same title?"").

""It is one of the best and most intelligent serial killer films ever made.""","It's powerfully directed by David Fincher, and Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances. The filmmakers stick to their vision with such dedication and persistence that something indelible comes across something ethically and artistically superior to The Silence of the Lambs that refuses to exploit suffering for fun or entertainment. The reason to see Seven, which is decidedly not for the faint of stomach, is not for the punishment of sin, but the many virtues of Freeman's contribution. Seven is a work of extraordinary style, upsetting power and narrative daring. The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. The film is quite involving. David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in film history, far more interesting than Silence of the Lambs. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give great performances in this film.The pace is fast and the shocks build beautifully. The actors within it all reel with convincing horror.",

The ending is blood-tingling and overwhelmingly exciting and the casting of the serial killer could not have been better suited. The ultimate reveal (which happened over the phone for those who recognise their voice) for me, was a very exciting moment, if not, the most exciting moment in the film and this is where the pace picks up.

The open question as the movie came to its end was how the murders depicting envy and wrath were going to be committed. That's done in a quite shocking and horrific way. I can't say it was a surprise - I guessed what was in the box addressed to Mills as soon as the box was introduced - but still it was a grand finale (if one can call it that) to a pretty decent movie.",

But there is something unique about this homicide, a fat man was forced to eat spaghetti continuously day and night without stopping for a second. He died because his stomach bursts out. It was disgusting, but interesting part was that ""Gluttony"" word was written on the walls of the apartment. Now another murder occurs this time a lawyer and ""Greed"" was written near the body with blood. Intense. Now Somerset reports that both murder are interlinked and the serial killer are murdering people on the basis of the seven deadly sins - Gluttony, greed, pride, lust, sloth, envy and rage. So both detectives start their search for the killer and finds more heinous murders. At last the villain wins and lose also but how that's the thing to watch.

It is a film that was created intrinsically to haunt you for years after you've seen it. I've seen it a handful of times and in watching it again just now I realized how brilliantly it was built. It might be one of the finest handcrafted films ever made. It was like each and every shot and moment and scene was made to let you see something different each and every time or unpack the film for years to come. If you look at fan theories and things you think is true that have nothing to do with the actual film you'll understand how deep the movie goes. It is definitely a cinephile's dream in that you can find so much about the film to explore. But even at a base level, the tension is unbelievable. With each character and moment you can't help but feel like the next moment will be someone's last. The dark, brooding city they create (unnamed and always raining) is haunting. The film holds this true film noire feel and the style of the characters and the office is something from a 1940's Detective film and yet the film clearly is modern times.

The story is told in excellent suspense technique, and the dark, rainy atmosphere provides the emotional setting that is a proper visual for the screenplay. This film about the dark side of humanity is well-made and a winner. But, that being said; there really doesn't seem to be a lot of socially redeeming value to the content of the film.

Today's post-post-modernist, post-truth and, a post-whatever-cynical era we live now, 'Se7en' feels as fresh as the newest release.

A cruel, gritty and sadistically realistic serial killer movie that's message and motives are as meticulously crafted as the crimes depicted in the movie. David Fincher's visual style was perfect to bring such a disturbing story to life. You might not like it what you see on the screen, but you will not be left untouched by it. Appalling and disgusting, yet intelligent. The layered screenplay leaves the viewer in doubt about the morality of humans in general, and what is most frightening, doubt in their own morality. Because with our deepest and darkest thoughts we agree with everything that John Doe says in the end. And we really don't know who to despise - ourselves or, that monster. The two detectives on the case, young and enthusiastic Mills, and old stoic Somerset (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman respectively) form a perfect pair.

With an incredible cast (Morgan Freeman, Brad Pit, Kevin Spacey, Gweneth Paltrow, and R. Lee Emery), a sometimes overly slick but competent director (David Fincher of Fight Club fame), and a smart script by Andrew Kevin Walker (8mm) this movie was a much needed shot in the arm for the genre.",

And it left a lasting impact. This crime thriller, this gothic neo-noir masterpiece where people are brutally murdered according to the Seven Deathly Sins as recognized by the Catholic Church. Down the line it led me to Hellblazer, Neil Gaiman, the whole Vertigo Universe, film noir, Gotham, Edgar Allan Poe, et cetera. But I think it all started with this film.",

Two cops, one young and aggressive, one old and weary, try to catch a serial killer, whose murders are frankly a bit too gruesome to really exist. And yet, because of the pure acting talent and because of the storytelling ability of the director, it manages to become one of those films that I will remember until the day I die. It's full of shots and scenes that are just so perfect, so fitting, that they instantly touch something within you. There honestly isn't a single scene that doesn't immediately catch your interest.",

As the film begins, we meet Somerset, a painstaking veteran cop who lives a lonesome bachelor's life in what seems like a furnished room. Then he meets Mills, an impetuous young cop who indeed requested to be transferred to Somerset's district. The two men probe an exceptionally grisly murder, an obese man having been hog-tied and force-fed to death.",

539,23 July 2007,uroskin,9, Noir horror,"Watched that noir horror movie Se7en on the weekend because I was stuck in a household without many commercial-free alternatives. I normally don't go for grisly films, especially those with Brad Pitt, but since it had such a good write up on rottentomatoes, and I am such a bad movie theater goer these days, I couldn't really pass it up - even if it meant sitting through almost 30 minutes of commercials as is wont on New Zealand TV. I thought it was rather wonderfully done, despite the grisliness. It's not often that you get Dante and Chaucer as major plot references in Hollywood films these days. (If you don't want to watch the film, there is a highly readable film script). You can't but admire the tenacity and the complete obsession of John Doe with his project. I had him down as an Asperger's Syndrome guy right away but I was unsure about his priorities. I mean, we can all empathize with getting a pound of flesh back out of a greedy lawyer, but why did the prostitute have to die? She wasn't the one guilty of lust, her johns are and they got away with only a knife dildo strapped to their groin. And why did he think sloth the worst of all the deadly sins? The victim took a whole year to die a particularly slow and nasty death - much worse than Jesus in The Passion - while the others were dispatched relatively quickly. I still can't take Brad Pitt seriously, but Kevin Spacey has surely deserved his place among the screen's worst baddies.",

542,16 June 2020,aidanratesmovies,9," Not Fincher's best work, but quite good","A tight, sophisticated, and often grim thriller- Seven may not always work at times, but it is more impressive than not, and as it goes on, truly proves itself to be a worthy mystery to follow. The film is very well acted, most notably by Kevin Spacey who gives another great performance in the film as John Doe. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt also truly embrace their characters to surreal effects, and you begin to think of them as people rather than simply actors playing a character. The beginning of the film can be a bit cliche, especially in terms of set up in the situations at hand, and the execution for the film can be a bit slow at times- especially towards the beginning. Besides these flaws and the slight predictability of the film, it is very tightly bound, and for the most part, very smart. David Fincher provides excellent work as the director, proving himself to be one of my favorite directors in the film business today. The atmosphere and tone of the film is also very well executed, as well as the cinematography to go with it, and make for its awfully grim, but darkly beautiful nature. In the end, Seven is not a great detective film, nor is it Fincher's best, but it is quite an impressive one at that, and one that shines greater than it may begin to lead on.
My Rating: 9/10",
543,11 June 2019,frankde-jong,8, The seven sins of a serial killer,"""Seven"" features a psychopath who is at least as convinced of his moral superiority and his mission to combat moral decay as Travis Bickle is in ""Taxi driver"" (1976, Martin Scorsese). On top of that he structures his murders along the Biblical lines of the seven sins from the Apocalyps. In doing that he is not entirely consistent. In some cases the sinner is his victim (gluttony), in other cases he forces the sinner to be the murderer (lust).",

545,6 January 2020,Tanbalarai,2, only too boring.,"First of all, as a criminal thing, there was no such thing as a sense of danger such as ""This is serious"" or ""I wish stopping the next crime"". There were no mystery elements, no tricks, no puzzles. Or rather, it was not made that way. So for me who was not interested in Christianity, it could only be boring.
It has an incredible reputation in the United States. Probably, the Christian part is great. But it may a huge Christian organization is investing for propaganda.
Either way, the Japanese who will be highly regarded in view of this will be children who are likely to be danced by large capitals, people who will turn right if Hollywood turns right, or devout Christians otherwise.",

David Fincher's work is a detective thriller that certainly enters the group of the best in the genre,"Written by Andrew Kevin Walker (who comes on the scene quickly as the first corpse we see in the film), Se7en is set in an oppressive, gray and harrowing world that seems determined to constantly remind its occupants that life is cruel, unfair and without sense. It is in this context that we are introduced to Detective Somerset (Freeman), who, a week before retirement, faces yet another murder scene with resignation and exhaustion, leading his day with melancholy until he can return to the solitude of his empty apartment at night, when, to get to sleep, he activates a metronome whose oscillating tick gradually drowns out the chaos of urban noises that invaded his room.",

But I purchased Se7en because this is the one movie I can watch over again. Me purchasing a movie is the highest assessment I can give. So watch Se7en for yourself; it is suspenseful, a thriller, has a great cast of actors who all perform outstandingly, and most important of all an ending no one could have guessed. I just wish that other writers, directors, etc., could produce more movies of this quality and genre.",

As they try to find the killer there develops between them a nice chemistry that helps to make this an engrossing movie.

574,28 August 2007,gurkpeter,3, Excellent craft work but not art,"Watching how the two detectives (a beginner and an experienced one) are pursuing a very intelligent serial killer is extremely well played and directed. Alone their interactions during the investigation is worth seeing the movie. The whole film is very much a male-type story except the character of the wife of the young detective. The appearance of the feminine character gives a human flavor to the work of the detectives transforming their male-like competition into elderly-young cooperation. Why I rate only 3 out of 10? Because the authors do not seem to understand the fundamental concept of the film, the 7 cardinal sins. The 7 cardinal sins are not actually sins themselves but are the source of other sins. Example: a married man seeing a pretty woman can feel desire to have her, but this is because men are biologically designed like this. If he acts to have the woman despite being married then he commits sins, but this sin is called adultery. So, in fact, there is one voluntary sinner in the film: the serial killer. The others - as the senior detective explains - just fail to work towards a balanced life, towards being able to love. The conclusion, that ""life is ugly but let's work to make it better"" is therefore flawed and makes the film a technically excellent work without the spirit that distinguishes craft work from true art.",

What I mean is this movie could have easily fell into the realm of normality, just another run-of-the-mill movie, but it didn't. It far surpasses the common film, and I am telling you the truth when I say it is the greatest murder-mystery of all-time. It is. Some might disagree because Se7en is so savage, and even a little vile, well, it's vile. But it is so beautifully crafted; it is so powerful. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give phenomenal performances, not to mention Kevin Spacey. And the story has such a good theme and identity to it. You really feel what's going on. You really feel for the characters. The subject matter is obviously very dark, but that does not mean that it's not a gorgeous film. It's very touching, very beautiful. Se7en offers a full range of emotions for the viewer. I really love this movie. I give it a pure 10 out of 10. Se7en is a masterpiece for the ages!",

Se7en doesn't suffer this conclusion and thank god Fincher refused to change the ending of the movie.,
599,12 January 2009,macpet49-1,5, The Little Film Noir That Couldn't,"I had to give it 5 for the excellent performances given by everyone but Brad Pitt. At first, I gave Mr. Pitt benefit of the doubt that he was aware of some flaws that I was not privy to in the character he was playing. Then I realized he just wasn't giving it his all. The fact that so many other reviewers gave him kudos tells me that intellectually Americans have fallen way behind in what they look for in a film. We truly are just about 'action, action, action' as Marlene Dietrich once said. Maybe that is why foreign film is so much ahead of us. Too many Americans have been raised on 'TV Movie of the Week' and 'Murder She Wrote' as their mother's milk. They simply don't look for nuances in character and personality. Underplaying is much more difficult that overplaying. Mr. Pitt does a ham actor's job of it. This isn't the first time I've witnessed his gross inability to reel in his own personality. He keeps playing Brad Pitt, bad boy of film as if flip dialog and pouting and shouting can make him the next Brando. It's a shame, but the ending fails enormously and I think was predictable. Hitchcock has nothing to worry about even from the grave. Mr. Pitt would make a much better scandal rag subject or part-time male model.",
600,14 January 2012,itamarscomix,8, A good thriller,"David Fincher's now-classic neo-noir isn't as shocking as it was 15 years ago, neither in its levels of violence nor in its twisting plot. As serial killer films go, I believe Fincher outdid the achievements of Se7en with the underrated Zodiac - Zodiac's cynical indifference was to me more original and more poignant than Se7en's ominous manipulation. Zodiac's main point was lack of consequence; Se7en pretends to have more consequence than it actually does.",
601,13 January 2021,garethcrook,10, Still packs a punch!,"I don't think I've seen this more than twice. Once when it was released and once when I bought the DVD, back when I bought DVDs. It's been over 20 years. Se7en was always great, right from the get go. Watching it now, it instantly feels like a classic. Now time will do that, but only if it's truly worthy. Freeman is at the top of his game. Pitt rides his coattails admirably. Even Paltrow can't undo it or the oh so 90s industrial grunge titles with NIN & Bowie. Spacey too absolutely nails the deranged creep role... not that that's surprising now I guess. Fincher wastes no time in getting to it. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are homicide cops in the rainiest town in America. Somerset is the soon to retire meticulous expert. Mills, the young buck full of energy and enthusiasm. This film works, as much for the string of crimes they're about to get embroiled in as for their relationship with one another. Details are fun, gripping, but it's people, characters that make stories and films tick. Don't get me wrong though. Details are important here. We're invited to the investigation alongside S&M and the joy in Se7en, if that's the right word, is the slow methodical release of those details, to the cops and to us. I suppose what makes Se7en so widely loved though is it's easy. Somerset holds our hand through it all. He's the brain cracking the leads, reading the books on the seven deadly sins. Despite his weariness, this invigorates him and us. There's an understood structure here. We know there'll be seven murders. We know we won't be done until that happens. Even with a flurry of hope right before Sloth, our detective buddies are casting doubt. They've studied this guy, they know they're being lead, as we are, step by step, murder by murder. Now I don't usually like gore and make no mistake Se7en has it in spades. It's one grotesque scene after another. It works because of the strength of the narrative, but damn I struggle with Sloth. Probably because he's still alive. I remember watching that DVD commentary about the casting of Michael Reid MacKay as the body for Sloth, chosen in part because he was skinny. When it came to filming though, he turned up having lost even more weight feeling it would be more convincing. That somehow makes it feel even more terrifying. Sloth is of course our first glimpse of the killer. A little tease that alludes the first time viewer. Although not for long, Se7en doesn't really make you work that hard. It's the perfect creepy crime thriller, but I think I'd forgotten how brutal it is. Sloth, Lust, all I can say is thank goodness for Somerset and Mills' theological conversations, they're the respite from this dark, cold and wet, dirty dangerous world. The pacing is perfect, the tone rides the slick production with the gritty visuals well. Pitt is a little cartoony, but 25 years on it still packs a punch... and it's got a killer finale.",
602,23 April 2020,jamesjustice-92,9, Near perfection of a crime thriller,"Maybe it took me way too long to get to this movie but at least I was well prepared for what was about to come, not fully though. Se7en is a story of two detectives, played stupendously by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, who lead the investigation of serial murders based on seven deadly sins. For me personally there were never any certain things that are unlawful or forbidden - it is a matter of personal beliefs and values that each individual defines for himself - but this movie has made me look at those from a different point of view. In any case a murder, no matter what its nature and motive are, should not be tolerated and Se7en gives you plenty of grains of wisdom to think about while you try and figure out the murderer's nature and motive. Although at times very depressive and hard to comprehend the movie showcases a vast variety of emotions the main characters are going through - I'd like to especially point out Brad Pitt's character who you vouch for and empathize the most - at times it also shows signs of predictability and lazy writing but despite all that Se7en is no doubt one of the greatest movies of all times in its genre.",

From writer Andrew Kevin Walker, the writer of the disgustingly terrible 8MM and SLEEPY HOLLOW. This film was much like 8MM as the murderer (whose name is not featured in the opening credits so as to surprise you) seems to have no remorse for what it is that he has done. Andrew Kevin Walker has created a more likable thriller with SE7EN, a film that still shows killing in a very graphic nature, but is not as vulgar or sickening. But, the film is far more violent. The killings are very horrific and disturbing.",

This movie is based on a man's (played by Kevin Spacey) obsession with punishing people who he believes are partaking in one of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play the detectives after him. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the wife to Brad Pitt's character, and while it may seem that she doesn't play a crucial role in the movie, her character turns out to be pivotal in how the end of this movie plays out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about serial killers and those who distort the Bible to their own beliefs. If you have a weak stomach, though, then this movies might not be for you. There are a lot of disturbing images and swearing throughout so I would not recommend it for children.

619,12 April 2007,Kurt08,9," Woah, that hit me hard, OUTSTANDING","I just watched Se7en, which stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey and I was gob smacked at how well crafted the storyline and ending are. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are searching for a man only known as 'John Doe,' he is killing and preaching at the same time by killing people based on the Seven Deadly sins, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Greed, Lust, Wrath and Pride as his motive. Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset. The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind. I won't tell anymore but there's not many dull moments and the ending is like no other I've ever seen. From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over. Very Highly recommended and I would give it 9/10.",

It's an unflattering depiction of our society, a picture of the world which happens to be the point of view of a serial killer. His world is dark, but made so by the so-called human beings infesting it - all the banality, the apathy, the self-interest of our species is on full display here. The city in this film is in a state of perpetual decay; all we seem to see are rotting walls and buildings on the verge of crumbling. But this is just a surface corrosion, a reflection of what really ails all of us, which is the corruption of our souls. The serial killer is just a natural extension of society here.

629,21 April 2020,ivanmessimilos,10, One of my favorites and one od the greatest od all time,"Seven is a movie that made Fincher break into the Hollywood elite and become a top director. But it was not easy to come by.
Before that, he only recorded music videos and then got the dream opportunity, to shoot Alien 3, continuing the great franchise and succeeding two legendary directors: Ridley Scott and James Cameron. However, he did not get his hands free for the movie, his studio got too involved in his work and failed to make the movie as he had imagined it.
Fortunately for him, but also for us movie lovers, the movie Seven shot the way he envisioned it and as a result we got one of the best thrillers of the 90s.
In this film, we see the director's clear signature, and he uses it in almost every subsequent movie, which is an atmosphere and an unexpected twist.
The shop takes place in a nameless city, the atmosphere is gloomy, pessimistic, dark, the rain is constantly falling and the sun is not visible at all. The city is a complete replica of this kind of weather, this is a city where a woman is taught to shout a fire not help, where a robber stabs a victim in both eyes after a robbery, as we learn from the conversation of the protagonist. The lead roles are interpreted by the brilliant duo Freeman and Pitt as two detectives who are complete opposites. The first is an experienced elderly detective with no family, just before he retires and wants to leave this city. The other is a younger detective, married, confident and just moving out of a smaller town. What is one last case before retirement, the other is the first case in a new city. This is a very difficult, complicated and brutal case. We have a serial killer who tortures and kills a new victim every day who is associated with one of the 7 deadly sins. The killings are extremely bloody and brutal, in addition to the visual imagery, also later when describing their torture.
The only breath of positive or optimism in the entire film is in the character of a younger detective's wife.
Fincher does one brilliant thing, there is no actor in the opening credits who plays the main villain, and we only get to know him after a good hour and a half of film time.
In my humble and subjective opinion, all three actors have achieved one of the best roles in their film oeuvre, and given that all three top actors say so much.",
630,4 July 1999,PIST-OFF,9, What would you do?,"Seven is the most deeply disturbing ever made. The horrific brutality of the murders in various scenes stays with you longer then you might like. Great writing, directing, cinematography, special effects, and acting highlight this film and make it one of the 10 best movies in the 90's. The seven brutal murders are either under filmed or filmed in dark unlit places so as to leave the viewer's imagination running in overdrive. Each murder is brutal enough to jolt you and make you not forget it. My personal favorit are lust, and sloth. The man tied to the bed and tortured for a year is sick and twisted as anything I've ever seen. The special effects of this and the gluttony murder are perfect. The writing is flawless in assembling this perfect crime with a purpose. The screenplay makes sure to be as descriptive in the details of each death so as to further the viewer's imagination as though reading a book instead of watching a movie. The creepy dark atmosphere of the movie can be credited to perfect directing. And great performances by the four central characters: Morgan Freeman (who is always great and gives any movie a certain nobility), Kevin Spacey who is perfect as the sick lunatic who's crimes go way beyond that of Keyser Soze, Brad Pitt (in his 2nd best role), and Gwyenth Paltrow who does a maximum job with her minimal screen time. But the sickest question in the movie remains the horric and disturbing end. >",

SUMMARY: This film is about a serial killer who kills people based on the Seven Deadly Sins and Detective Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) and Detective Mills (played by Brad Pitt) must investigate to catch the killer.
Se7en is a very gloomy film, so gloomy that I consider the ending of this film as one of the most tragic ending ever in cinematic history and also one of the greatest ending in history. But this film is not really about a serial killer on a killing spree and the protagonists trying to catch them, it's about how this ""city"" is affecting the characters in this film. This is one great example of exploiting the settings to affect the characters. There are small moments in this film that shows that they are in fact humans and not just some random film character. Speaking of characters, all actors/actresses in this film is great especially by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. This is still one of my most favorite film ever.",

A film of this genre should have an atmosphere, make you excited, cause you to try to guess what the next move is going to be, and most of all - provide a surprising end. None of those exist in this creation of Hollywood movie industry. If the only way to keep the viewer focused and somewhat interested is by presenting more and more gruesome ways of murder - something is very wrong here. Any R-rated movie from the shelves marked ""Horrow"" in your local video-store can provide such an entertaiment. Yet there are much more expectations from the cast involved in this project.

637,28 June 1999,Perini,7," Successful for genre, but then again...","My approach to Seven was one of low expectations.  Based on the stylistic opening credits, I was expecting to be assaulted with low-angle extreme closeup murky cinematography designed to capitalize on human reflex. American film has been thwarted with bad technique in the suspense/mystery genre.  Instead of style and creativity, many directors have opted for the ole standby of loud unexpected noises/music followed by the alerting appearance of the villain.  Snore...However, such is not the case with David Fincher's Seven.  The style of Seven is fairly straightforward for the first seventy minutes of the film:  What you see is what you get. Unapologetically grotesque images from the crime scenes of a serial murder and a flood of rain in a dingy, dirty-textured metropolitan city.  The plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it was plenty enough to keep you interested in learning about the murderer.  However, the main characters could not have been more contrived.  Morgan Freeman's character, Detective Summerset, was catatonic to the point of being convincingly dull.  The writer went for the starkest contrast with the character Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) by giving him the playground mentality of hockey player turned homicide detective.  The results were destructive to the film's effect. In the end, Mills and Summerset do their best to ruin the audience's interest in their involvement.  Gwynneth Paltrow would receive mention if her character weren't a mere fixture within a plot.  The characters just didn't help this film at all.  It was one of those all too often cases where the actors look the part but the part is badly written =(  However, much to the credit of the production designer and cinematographer, the mood of this film was still very effective.  There was however one other regrettable inconsistency:  For the first seventy minutes or so of the film, the audience forcably endures the foul, wet and lonely darkness of the city environment only to have the rug pulled out in the closing moments when the setting changes to a sun-bleached desert scape.  Hmmm...7 out of 10?",

I think the movie went on far too long - they could have wrapped it up after the first 2 hours, but instead go on and on...

They will also tell you that Seven was and still is a great film from that era. Although Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a terrific pair in this buddy cop neo-noir psychological thriller, this film has one of the most intense, nail-biting, suspense driven final moments ever written for screen. And then, if that weren't enough, there is that unbelievable twist ending that no one saw coming. The secret weapon in this film is not only the serial killer who is always one step ahead of these cops, but the fact that this character remains hidden throughout of the story. You won't even find him in the official movie trailer and for good reason.",

The film as a whole is very depressing. The rainy city and the streets with sewage, the whole city seems to be covered by industrial exhaust gas, dirty, dark, noisy, JohnDoe carried out a series of ingeniously surprised murders in this background The case completed his self-considered martyrdom. Even if you do n't understand the religious part, you can interpret JohnDoe 's disappointment and anger at the evil of human nature. In the movie, the city should be in the rapid development of industry. People continue to pursue material satisfaction while losing a lot of spiritual wealth. JohnDoe He thinks that he is entitled to punishment based on religious belief, but in fact no one has this power. On the one hand, the film shows the disappointment of the depravity of human nature, on the other hand, it also shows the powerlessness of saving the spiritual world.

I only saw the entire film on TV after a friend insisted it was good- all I can say is they lied to me. Too dark to see clearly, a rip-off of Theatre of Blood without the humour. Yet another unconvincing performance from Pitt who may be pretty but hasn't acted for years.",
662,14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,7, Great atmosphere,"David Fincher's direction always shines with thrillers, and ""Se7en"" is one of the most outstanding examples. Aesthetically one of the best thrillers of its generation, the cinematography is so slick and tasteful that it could pass as a recent film. I also liked the dark and gritty atmosphere of rainy Los Angeles, with old and dirty apartments and oppressively dim lights. In particular, the crime scenes are elegantly designed to reflect the poetic overtones of the killer's project. The screenplay is generally solid with the dialogues, the literary references and the way the relationship between the two leads develops, but the final twist and ending felt way too underwhelming if we consider the engaging premise. Brad Pitt's acting sometimes kills the mood, but Freeman and especially Spacey are at their best here and help to balance him off decently.",
663,20 April 2020,mchinni-42999,4, I hoped for better,"My expectations from this film were nil until I saw 'Directed by David Fincher' appear on screen. that's when my expectations skyrocketed. But did he live up to them? no, sir, I'm afraid not. You see, the minute I saw Gwyneth Paltrow I knew she'd die. Because what else is she doing in a film about two detectives trying to catch a serial killer. And I knew the writers of a David Fincher film would not place a female lead attached to the protagonist just to be his wife. And it didn't look like she was providing any moral support nor cause an epiphany in the male lead which would enable to solve the case. So she had to go. Also because, that's what happens in every single Tamil film on earth. I sorely hoped fincher would do better than that. But what does he do? He goes a step further and kills her while she's pregnant. because what's better than killing the hero's wife? Killing her while she was pregnant and him not even knowing that until after she's dead. Obviously. That's some below the belt stuff man. Not cool, man. In the last few minutes of the film, I was laughing at myself for how seriously I was taking something that would stop if I closed my phone. Well, thank god Fincher grew up and made some breathtaking stuff like Mindhunter, otherwise I would never forgive him.",

I wasn't really entertained until about half way, the acting was outstanding and it had an excellent plot. Loved seeing R Lee, freeman, pitt, spacey and pawltrol in one movie. It would honestly be a perfect 10 if it wasn't for the slow start.... Overall I give about 7.5 I know a lot probably wouldn't agree with me but it is my opinion but still a solid movie with brilliant acting. Maybe I'll watch it again and my score may change but idk I'm sticking with the 7.5 That ending though, very chilling and unexpected and I do like that in movie endings.",

668,7 June 2022,2Civ,8, Holds up well,"This film holds up very well and I credit a lot of that to David Fincher, who isn't afraid to let his characters talk and isn't afraid to leave the goriest parts offscreen. This relies on two things: actors and imagination. He trusts the actors to bring the dialogue to life (I never mind dialogue when written and delivered well) and get the material where it needs to be; and he trusts the audience's imaginations are stronger and more vivid than anything he could limit the scariest ideas to visually. I appreciate this is a film first and a thriller second and the casting and execution reflects that.",

Well let me tell you why I am comparing them. The theme of the movie is pretty much the same as the one in ""The silence of the lambs"". I also once saw on a box that it was written and I quote ""better than The silence of the lambs"".  Unfortunately, that isn't true. Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow can't give great performances like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins gave in ""The silence of the lambs"".  However, Morgan Freeman is a terrific actor and so is Kevin Spacey and so the two of them together can compensate for Pitt's and Paltrow's performance.",

Every time you see a new body you're both revolted and entranced, full of wonder in what foul way this person has been slaughtered. The film is based in reality and every murder feels like something that could have actually happened which just adds to the fear and tension that hardly ever leaves you during the whole 2 hour run time. Every member of the cast plays their part to perfection and the direction by Fincher is superb, once again showing his mastery over the art of film. All the technical parts of the film work well together and overall we as the audience are left with one of the best films in the genre, a gripping, tense thriller that hardly ever lets up. I'd love to go into more detail but as to avoid spoilers I'll end the review here, if you're okay with some pretty disgusting scenes and want to spend the next 2 hours holding onto the sides of your chair give Seven a go.

But, thankfully, you get a director like Fincher (and to be fair, Alien 3's problems were largely due to studio execs and whatnot) who is talented despite having worked on a bad film, to create a masterpiece such as Se7en and this is the film that saved Fincher's career possibly. Se7en (or Seven), was released in 1995 and was directed by David Fincher (The Panic Room, Fight Club, and Alien 3) and stars Brad Pitt (Ocean's 11, Fight Club, and Megamind), Morgan Freeman (The Sum Of All Fears, Kiss The Girls, and The Shawshank Redemption), Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Sliding Doors, and Emma), and John C.

682,17 May 2022,tindfoting,10, THE watercooler movie of the 90s,"This is the one. The movie which started my passion for the brilliant David Lynch. Back before social media destroyed every mystery in a movie. I rate this Fincher's best. It's so incredibly dark. The rain pouring. Everything greenlit and just horrible doomish. The pairing of Morgan Freeman as the tired, philosophical Sommerset, with Brad Pitt's impatient and somewhat angry Mills. The real difference is that we necer see any murders. Only the overwhelming aftermath from a very clever, deranged killer. Like the only ""jump scare"" in the movie, a guy kept alive long enough for SWATS to find him more than halfdead. Se7en is a grueling experience into deprevation, as both Sommerset and Mills gets frustrated, always two steps behind. Lets face it, they never ""catch the killer"". This is John Doe's movie, and he plays the detectives like a fiddle. Forever, into the last, horrible scene. I still remember the whole cinema went quit when the credits role, like all air was sucked out. And I know the producers demanded a voiceover from Freeman laid in to raise up the truly depressing ending. Fincher didn't want it, but I think it was the right call. I cant honestly think of a more depressing ending, aside from Requiem For a Dream. It's Fincher's masterpiece, a flawless crime noir. And a young starletts breaktrough; Gwyneth Peltrow. The one shining light. Ah, you just know that's not gonna last in Fincher's little nightmare.",

When I went to see this movie in the theatre, I was on the edge of my seat, not just out of tension, because I was straining to hear what everyone was saying. I know they didn't have the volume turned down to low, because the soundtrack, and all other sounds in the movie were LOUD, its just all the actors sounded like they were mumbling. OK, maybe it was just the accoustics of the theatre. I rented it once on VHS, and there was the same problem -- you could barely hear anything that anyone said. OK, I had a lousy VCR, I thought it would be different when I got in on DVD. I watched it again last weekend, and it was still the exact same problem. The sound editing on this movie is pretty bad, which is REALLY frustrating, because its an amazing movie.

The idea to base the murders on the 7 deadly sins is very interesting. The whole plot makes sense and is well-done. I read that some viewers found it disturbing, which is true, it is NOT a movie for kids. But I wouldn't call this movie particularly graphic or scary.

Morgan Freeman is a great actor and in this movie he plays the role of a police officer who is about to retire. I must say that the ending was very unpredictable.

TOP 10 LIST",
702,24 April 2010,Brawl_666,8, grim,"David Fincher's fiercely idolized Seven is certainly an interesting and well-made film. Finely acted, meticulously shot and composed. It very effectively portrays the greatest city on earth as dark and Gothic, rotting and falling to pieces, its citizens weary and confused. What prevents Seven from being a true masterpiece is that there is very little meaning or depth below the layers of supposed erudition. It doesn't help to allude to Dante and Chaucer when your film has nothing to do with their work ; it seems to me that these references were deliberately added just to create a false sense of meaning in the minds of viewers who don't know any better. Ah, Thomas Aquinas ! Hemingway !!! Deep stuff this must be......well, not really, though. The film is content to scratch the surface of difficult ideas, hinting at more interesting things but resolutely going for the cheap thrill nine times out of ten. John Doe is a grand and terrifying killer, but one that exists only in the imaginary world of movies.",
703,12 April 2020,willyortegav,10, No words can't describe it,"Simply put, a disturbing masterpiece. Everything was brilliant. From the acting to the screenplay and the cinematography. Wow, I'm still blown away by this incredible film. Kudos to director David Fincher, and of course to Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman for playing their roles so impeccably.",
704,24 July 2022,Dominic_25_,9, I completely understand why David Fincher has the reputation he does.,I have finally watched this film after years of hearing about how great it is. Unfortunately I did not entirely avoid the spoilers but I did go into it with very little knowledge of what was going to happen. I'm glad that it did not disappoint.,
705,16 January 2022,williamhollier1,8, Chilling,"With no prior knowledge of the film before watching, I was shocked by it's creative and grotesque nature. It is certainly anything but a forgettable movie.",
706,16 October 2006,freaky_dave,9, Depressing yet shockingly real,A depressing yet effective thriller with a completely shocking and disturbing ending that will have you thinking about it for a long time. Yes that is the simplest way to explain David Fincher's Seven.,
707,21 July 2020,riddhimaakaritu,7, Not exciting enough but still engaging throughout.,"Watched it just after Inferno (2016) so Dante was recently revised.
Maybe it's a 1995 movie that's why no twist felt too big to me.",
708,25 April 2008,ianls,3, I must whole heartidly disagree,"I remember sitting down to watch se7en in a jam packed cinema on its release day, I eagerly anticipated the movie and left, some two hours later, in a rage that has not subsided to this day. I have just completed my second viewing, curious as to whether I would hold the same view numerous years later, the disappointment, nae utter astonishment, at how flawed the film is, has not subsided.",
709,21 October 1998,Tauntaun13,10, A brilliant work,"About a week ago I watched ""Saving Private Ryan"". In the first thirty minutes of the film I felt like someone was punching me in the stomach. That is the same feeling I get every time I watch Se7en. When I first saw it, 3 years ago, I couldn't find the words to express the emotions I felt. I still can't. A brilliant work, by all aspects.",
710,22 December 2014,datorsiers2,8, Disappointed about the ending :/,"The movie had a high tension built up towards the grand ending and i thought it was gonna something extravagant and awesome, but it turned out to be quite plain, yes, John Doe was the ''envy'' and by killing Mills's wife and her unborn baby, he carried out his plan, hence Mills shot him as his punishment.",

712,13 July 2022,saikatsamanta,10, Your Humanity Erodes a Bit after this...,"A Postmodern film noir, about two police detectives in search of a Serial killer who punishes his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins. This is a Masterpiece in every sense. The writing by Andrew Kevin Walker is so good in every scene that the whole film gets etched in your memory. The direction is brilliant by David Fincher. Its a dark, dreary, hopeless City where evil resides. The murder scenes are gruesomely detailed & some are too mortifying to even be shown. Three top notch performances elevate the film to Greatness. Morgan Freeman's weary age-old veteran cop who has seen the filth for too long and just wants to leave, Brad Pitt's rash & impatient young cop who wants to prove his mettle & Kevin Spacey's Spine-chilling Killer whose words rattle your soul. The Scene with the three of them is the Stuff of Legends. A Crime Masterpiece of highest Calibre which just might erode your hope for humanity a bit.",
713,22 November 2018,dakuchonekobing,7, Why?,"THis movie has perfect script, perfect editing, directing...
In my opinion, there's only 1 problem with this movie: Why John Doe decided to choose Mills and her wife- those who's just come to this city for a few weeks, for the final victim (wrath) or his BIG plan, the plan he 's come with for a whole year???
This is not make sense if this man John Doe like we imagine, he has remarkable mind, intelligent acts, he can't end his plan (long term) by his envy of Mills's life (short term)",

717,23 March 2010,hemant_balz,9, Fast paced psycho thriller with a penultimate ending,Seven in itself is a very good psycho thriller movie.Well paced & terrific star-cast makes it very special.The seven sins will make you think.....that wow!!!what a fantastic concept.I never knew of these sins before i came to see this brilliant masterpiece.Fantastic performance from Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt.Here we see too different kind of detectives.One is sensible & mature whereas other wants action & is impatient.Terrific role from the psycho killer too.I don't want to disclose his name to anyone.You have to see for your self who he is.Dialog delivery is at its par.The seven sins & the psychotic murders will keep you occupied.And the ending its just penultimate.Fantastic & a great surprising ending.The only question is will the psycho killer win or will the detectives catch him before its too late for many.A movie must to be watched.Not to be missed.Unique & surprising in its own way.,

721,8 February 2023,gillmurphydogg,9, Hard watch but supreme crime thriller,"If you're a fan of Brad Pitt, Kevin, Spacey and Morgan Freeman, you'll love this. Paltrow serves more of a very supportive role, but does her bit never the less. The film tells of a serial killer who kills people who have committed one of the deadly sins. It's told from the perspective of police detectives on a quest for the murderer. The killer taunts the police back. It's a gripping drama with some gruesome scenes that are unforgettable as well as very dark moments you also can't forget.",

And when thry were in car, and all that talk of John Doe with all his insanity. I really admired the way he was talking in that car, that was just powerful thing. And that when Daivid killed John when he found out that he has killed his wife she was carrying a child. Damn..that scene was just totally heartbreaking.",

725,31 October 2019,stewartkaty,10, Brilliant storyline,"So this is advertised as a crime drama that looks like an action film with some mysterious developments.
However, it's just a beautifully sad story about a man who has fallen into a deep pit emotionally and physically. During the movie, the young detective makes mistake after mistake in his life choices. There are people that care about him but somehow they don't notice it. It's just how our modern society is. Everyone is watching you but nobody is actually looking.
We, the audience, also don't realize that his life is a sad misery. We are treated to so many films where the protagonist is flawed and unhappy. These flaws, however, do not prevent the hero from winning the day and delivering a happy end. This is not the case here. You just don't realize until the very end, alongside the characters themselves. It's just brilliantly done.",

But I must warn, some of the aftermaths are quite graphic and may not be suitable for the squeamish. 9 out of 10. Rated R for graphic aftermaths of murders, some violence, and strong language.",
727,19 February 2021,xaapaas,7, Another Fincher,"David Fincher knows his craft, but he doesn't have range. All his movies have the same look and feel.

Please, leave you brain turn off, you won't need it. There is no subtelty, no inference, no need to evoke imagination. It's all vomited up for the dummest of the dumb (clearly Americans need to be spoon fed). It's about a serial killer (boring been done to death). I found the music upsetting as it meant I had to have the volume low so I didn't jump out of my skin in the scenes where the sound suddenly was fortissimo; then it was hard to hear the dialogue, so turn the volume up. Yikes. David Fincher was supposed to have filmed the entire thing in ""dim light"". Um, ok ... yet another aspect of ""dinner is dished up..."" (turn off your imaginations). The acting is superb? Really (now I really love Morgan Freeman but not in this). Brad Pitt, he was acting? Hard to say. A big dump of s_h_i_t vomited up for the lowest common denominator.",

It's a great movie and I think it's definitely worth the watch.",
740,13 November 2021,michaelheiser-25099,3, Too gory for me sorry,"I didn't like how they twisted God's Word into a serial killer machine - they will stand before a real God someday for this film. Fear motivates people and could have brought about the changes that all the characters wanted to see take place. That would have been an interesting movie--people dedicated to maintaining order realizing that the order needs to be subverted to do actual good. That is an interesting conflict. Could the divorce really happen? The groundwork was there for such action to take place, but the result would have been too thought-provoking to be thrilling for the average viewer. Fear shapes people's behavior more than anything else, when present. Think about how many churches you see on your way to work. Inertia takes over when fear is absent. The killer was too calculating to suffer so many ineptitudes. Overall, I didn't like it. Sorry.",

742,12 September 2021,Luisvtw,9, Such a cool and dark thriller,After a long time I finally came to watch this classic. First of all Morgan Freeman in a crime movie? This alone makes this movie so cool and also Brad Pitt is amazing in his role. This movie's sheme was dark as hell and it is perfect for this type of movie. The actor wich I don't say the name because I don't want to spoil was amazing even though he wasn't much seen. Overall I can say this is the perfect movie for those who like this genre and even for other people.,

Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb.",
750,27 February 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,9, An excellent mystery thriller by a brilliant director,"I really like David Fincher. Each one of his films has a unique visual signature to them and are trademarked with an excellent story. I didn't hate Alien 3 at all. This is his second best film, Fight Club being the first. Everything in it is so well done, from the acting (Kevin Spacey!), directing, script, and visuals. The city this takes place in isn't named but its shown as dark and gritty, constantly raining. The mystery is intense, its something I have never heard of before but it is done so remarkably well. Its hard to find a film like Se7en around, it can only really be matched by Memento. The last twenty minutes of this film are extremly suspensful, possibly the best end twenty minutes of any film. The script is my only problem, because sometimes it gets sloppy and Brad Pitt just unevenly swears. Otherwise, its an excellent thriller that I didn't find shocking at all. 9.5/10",
751,21 January 2003,goatmango,10, Exceptional,"This is perhaps Fincher's best work to date. The story is flawless mainly because of the realism present in it. The writing is primarily what holds the story together. It goes within the killer's mind to the point where the viewer almost agrees or at least cannot deny, the validity of his arguments. Fincher also does an excellent job to convey the unpleasantness and claustrophobia of a crime scene to the point where the viewer can almost smell the acrid bodies. It takes the suspense genre and redefines the cinematic serial killer with outstanding performances by the whole cast. It is a film that can withstand time and can pertain to any future generation. Truly a classic.",

The film is very good, and the aftermath of the killings is also great. There is a killer killing people by the seven deadly sins. Greed, Glutony, Wrath, etc. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play detectives trying to find out who the killer is and why he is killing. Kevin Spacey's performance towards the end of the film is very, very good and would have been one of the best in the flick. Andrew kevin Walker script is excellent great directing, great acting great movie. Way better than other serial killer movies like The Bone Collector.",

It had a terrible plot, no excitement, and a under satisfying ending."" Well this movie will give you a complete opposite reaction. First off it is brilliant how the murderer in the film kills people. He works by referring to the 7 deadly sins. Second off, even at points of the film when things happen and you think that you might know how this movie will end, you are completely blown off your feet. I was so shocked about how this thriller ended, I couldn't help but spoil the ending to many off my friends. Even the acting in this film was terrific, specially by Brad Pitt. I hardly like any of the other films that Brad Pitt has been in, but this role was terrific. If there is one movie that you have not seen and want to pick up the next time you go to the rental store, i suggest se7en. *Caution get ready to pee your pants from the ending*",
755,20 April 1999,uffe-5,9, One of the best movies ever created.,"My expectation of Se7en wasn't that big. Maybe that's why i loved it that much. The actors are fantastic, the plot scary, and both the music and directing tops the best X- files episode. This one even gets on top of ''The silence of the lambs'' ( even though the copying from that movie is pretty obvious ). It got me in about the same way as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was dark and disgusting. I mean, just the idea of getting a big fat man eat himself to death makes anyone land on your knees and throw up. The city is as dark and rainy as in ''Blade Runner'' and ''The Crow'', the plot at least as good as in Silence of the lambs, and none of the actors have made a better performance than they did in this movie. The best of them was of course Kevin Spacey. This movie is going up to number 4 on my favorite movie-list. I don't think i can describe it any further. Go and watch Se7en now. If you dare that is.",

I loved this movie for it's creepy effect.  It is in the vain of such mentally challenging and scary features as Angel Heart and The Changeling.  What really makes this film is it's use of a mystifying story line.  Even though the killer is eventually found, the mystery doesn't stop there.  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and R. Lee Ermey among others round out a very good line-up.  Pitt is good as the foul-mouthed young detective Mills. Freeman is awesome as the aging and wisdom-filled detective Somerset.  The choice of villain is an especially nice touch but telling would break a great story.  Overall, David Fincher exceeded all expectations for this film and that is possibly the main reason it is a classic.",

758,18 September 2004,TheEtherWalk,9, Fincher does it again,"Seven is a movie about two detectives, played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who notice that their killer has been following a theme: the Seven Deadly Sins. Fincher turns an average premise into one of the best films of the nineties, an engrossing, fascinating and even apocalyptic thriller. There are some great ideas about human nature, and while it doesn't go as deep as Fight Club, the ending is a shocker. Kevin Spacey shows up during the last half hour to give another great performance, and even R. Lee Ermey features in some scenes. Highly recommended. 9/10",
759,31 May 2011,blazesnakes9,8," Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Pride, Lust and Envy","At the start of Se7en, we get to see a murder scene happening in the beginning of an investigation. The detectives are played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. What they don't know is that the next seven days are going to be a rude awakening by a series of unfortunate murders. Se7en has a great and smart idea and a great pacing of suspense. But, sometimes the movie is hard to watch because of the graphic violence being displaced. After the beginning of the movie, the detectives are assigned to solve the murder cases. They have a similar connection, all of the cases is marked with the seven deadly sins. Soon, they realize that a menacing serial killer is on the loose. The setting for Se7en really concentrates on a dark, quite scary atmosphere. We don't know where the story takes place, but that means anything big in the plot because this movie holds the full package. Se7en keeps a dark and grim tone to the murders. This is a full exceptional cast also including R. Lee Ermey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Se7en works at its best with all of the suspenseful scenes and it pulls off with a edge-of-your-seat climax. A great mystery thriller. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars",
760,23 November 2006,sibelian,7," Pretty good, but a bit over-rated...","It might be because I've seen a lot of films since it's release in 1995 that have borrowed heavily from its visual style, which was possibly very unusual at the time (I can't remember) but this didn't ring with me as strongly as it has with some people. It's very much a David Fincher with decay and desaturated colour tones everywhere, lots of grand, decaying buildings and a feeling of gloomy, low tech nostalgia sliding in at the sides, and that's very welcome, but it's not as gripping as some make out.",

This is one of those movies that will get under your skin, and stay with you for a long time. I appreciate this movie not because I am preoccupied with death, or horrific murder scenes...on the contrary, death and murder scare me, and so I would hope a film that portrays these things would do so in a very frightening way. Seven does. Indeed, this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. I only recommend this one to people who can stomach very dark, and painfully realistic movies. If you do want to see it, be warned that it does contain some of the most disturbing murder scenes I have ever witnessed on film, and the ending will haunt you long after the film is over. However, the realness...the idea that in life there aren't always happy endings, shines through in Seven.

They are on a mutual assignment to investigate and arrest a heinous serial killer involved in torturing and murdering people. The story is excellently written by Andrew Kevin Walker; depicts great home work on plot, might involve review after review by him before finalization, in depth psyche of all characters and order of happening of events in an ascending order of gravity. The psyche of the killer was greatly conceived. There are a number of films on torturing and serial killing but it was a unique idea that what paradoxical impact one can perceive from great writings of Dante! It's a genuine thinking of writer and super cinematography by the director. Acting of Morgan Freeman is splendid. He has the god given talent of absorbing into characters created for him. His dressing however resembles to ""Columbo"" somehow. Brad Pitt was great except in last scene when he was double minded; his hesitance was understandable but acing was not that great as it was in whole film. Viewers' interest, suspense and mystery of the film lasts until the last scene as nobody was suspecting what actually happened; again full marks to writer and director. This movie is up to the level of Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock and we have David Fincher; an Alfred Hitchcock in pipeline. This is the movie of the Director David Fincher. He is the captain of the ship and knows how to set sail, where to speed up, where to show emotions..... all is excellent. The choices of sets and locations are great. The direction is simply magnificent. Special effects and Sound is impressive. The music by Howard Shore is inspiring, striking and exciting. The music plays a very important role in the epic.",

Small wonder Somerset didn't want to bring his erstwhile partner's child into such a world. Few actors could carry across the moral burden and torment of such reasoning, yet Freeman (his name a dark history unto itself) achieves it without effort. His is not cheap cynicism, the easy quip that peppers so many movies that offer slick dialogues. The screenplay writer Walker seems almost to have tailored the script to Morgan's natural gravitas, and it fits the actor to a tee. The man he plays is weary, not cynical: ""I don't think I could continue to live in a place the nurtures apathy as if it were a virtue."" His slow-burning bromance with Mills is nicely handled (and ends in an oblique declaration of love). Meanwhile, Somerset and Doe are like two sides of the same coin, in sync with their analysis of the world's horrors, one believing he might stem the slaughter, the other intent on provoking an uprising against evil. Note that Somerset does not consider Doe deranged at all, just evil claiming to purge evil. He has a point: the bulk of that book held sacred by Christians is a catalogue of vengeance and spite, rape and pillage. In the closing scene out in the desert: ""What d'you got?"" barks Mills. ""Dead dog,"" replies Somerset calmly (flies buzzing). ""I didn't do that,"" is Doe's response, one of the most sublimely camp lines in American cinema.

Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset. The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind. I won't tell anymore but there's not many dull moments and the ending is like no other I've ever seen. From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over.

The way it shifts into high gear is masterful, and it´s refreshing to find a director nowadays who knows when and how to move the camera for maximum dramatic effect. Howard Shore´s fine score is unobtrusive and used only when needed. Photography, editing, acting- top notch, and I thought Brad Pitt was just a Hollywood pretty boy, how wrong was I? I understand the producers wanted a more upbeat ending, and that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deserves credit for helping Fincher convince them not to change anything.

The visuals were lavishly disturbing and the soundtrack worked wonderfully - however, the last death(s) was bloody obvious, and this was hell to watch for someone who thinks of herself as squeamish.

""Seven"" is completely of its time and somehow precludes it. There is a winking one-upsmanship in the gore and conventional plotting that brings into sharp focus the gaping plot holes and (even then) familiar tropes of the serial killer fetish. Moreover, thirty years later it seems like little more than a music video version of ""Silence of the Lambs"". Pitt, as a character, displays none of the intelligence his ambitious cop is supposed to contain, a problem made more glaring by the grating, doe-eyed plot device that is Paltrow. The role is practically the only feminine presence in the film - a theme more common to Fincher's work than anyone will admit - and is platformed as a prop with which the script can unload its perversities. And at its core, ""Seven"" is just a collection of perversities. One gathers from the busy logic of the English-major screenplay that Andrew Kevin Walker himself has only read the Cliff's Notes of Classic Literature. As the reluctant team becomes more enmeshed in the killer's kink, the crimes themselves become less interesting and more obvious, as if the writer and his bad-boy director decidedly front-loaded their queasiest material to ensure that the audience was casually shocked enough to not ask many questions...like where is this movie set (it rains in every scene) and why the FBI isn't involved the very second a high-ranking public official is ritualistically murdered? The film is so intent on sticking its landing that all of the plot just becomes a wash of cartoonish sadism and lots of blank stares from Morgan Freeman, who seems to be on autopilot here, mainly because once he delivers his grizzled cop lines he has little else to act out.",

I really tried to stay awake, but all attempts proved to be unsuccessful. I just couldn't stay interested. In order for a thriller to satisfy me, it has to have suspense and action. Se7en was lacking in both areas. I'll admit that the whole idea of incorporating the seven deadly sins into it was clever. However, the movie was not capable of holding my attention because it did not show any of the crimes as they were happening. When I watched the movie for the second time, I managed to stay awake. Once I got toward the end of the movie when ""John Doe"" was introduced, I finally understood what was so good about it. The end was definitely praiseworthy because it was the only intense part.

The only thing it lacks is a plausible story. The one thing which bothers me is the reason behind the killer's (John Doe)actions. He starts off by killing an obese man because he is gluttonous. Obesity is not caused just by being gluttonous. Second is greed. Yes, lawyers are greedy but that is their profession. In fact, in this very movie, John Doe also gets a lawyer who supports him also knowing that he is a serial killer. Is that not a sin? Next is sloth. What does a drug dealer got to do with being lazy? Behind his every murder, the reason is pretty silly. And the most important thing which really bothers me is John Doe killing Mills' wifey. Mills' wife does not commit any sin that catches his eye and yet he kills her just to unleash Mills' wrath on him. This makes John Doe the biggest sinner of all.

Morgan Freeman is the veteran cop somerset who is a week away from retirement and his replacement Mills a new detective played by Brad Pitt he moved here with is wife Tracy played by Gwyneth Paltrow and obviously the outstanding star of the movie was Kevin Spacey as John Doe the man who will use the seven deadly sins to kill people. we follow somerset and Mills as they investigate the murders and find out how to stop the killer and throughout the movie we are given moments which were tense and exciting and the ending was some world class film i have ever seen. overall i had never seen se7en and i have to say to watch it for the first time and i really enjoyed it and i would definitely watch it again and would definitely suggest it to you to watch.,

Detectives Somerset and Mills are the classic idealistic rookie and grizzled veteran pairing and work together to try and catch a serial killer loose on the city. The killer, never identified, and so-called John Doe, kills those he feels represent the spirit of each of the deadly sins, starting with gluttony, and working his way down the list. The murders are brutal and grotesque, and the detectives scramble to catch up to Doe before he claims another life. The dark gritty style and content are well conveyed with the deep shadows, isolated colors, and deeply angled face shots. The dialogue was nothing special or emotionally potent, but what portions were full of emotion worked well within the ambiance of the grim, gritty, horror-filled nature of reality. I felt that the religious themes, while not revolutionary, helped establish the zealotry of John Doe.",
830,14 January 2012,ddude1116,9," On the road to greatness, they pulled over at the last moment.","As soon as the film ended, and David Bowie began to play on the credits, I could only wonder why David Mills shot Kevin Spacey when he seemed so much like he was not going to. And then I realized it was a faulty seam at the end of a blanket, which would allow it to unravel and fall apart. Don't misunderstand this; I'm not complaining. The end seam may be insufficient, but it is still one of the warmest blankets you could have the pleasure of, and it only unravels once you aggravate it. No. I'm only reflecting, and wondering. I wonder how the ending could have changed to suit the grandeur that is the entire film prior to that fatal shot? What if Kevin Spacey lived, or they gave no indication whether or not Mills shot him or did not shoot him. I cannot honestly say, only that the ending is the reason why this film is one of the best of the year, and not all time. Perhaps, that only way to accurately describe such a thing is in its own words: ""There isn't going to be a happy ending. He's only human, and that will be disappointing."" Either way, Se7en is a phenomenal achievement in film, marred only by its own brilliance. It seems as if it burnt out at the two hour mark, and then faded away, fading from the annals of memory and grandeur.",

The rest of the cast are adequate including an individual who was considered one of the best at that time (alas, after what we learned about him I don't wish to mention his name).

I was not disappointed because for me it is a story which could be told in any time period. The three main characters for me were perfectly drawn and in some ways you could describe the film as the good the bad and the ugly 1995. These are the three characters you would probably see if the film was made fifty years ago or in fifty years from now. All three play their parts very well and the whole experience is an enjoyable tale. The film is only just over two hours but it seemed longer to me and although once you have seen the film you will know the ending it doesn't mean that you cant watch it again. If the film is quality like this one you can just enjoy it because it is that good. It holds your attention and anybody watching should just let it envelop them. I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone over 18 and once you have seen it you will know why.,

Almost every serial killer thriller since has tried to imitate sevens unique blend of darkness, mood, and ability to disturb. But none has and will ever come close to this. The build up of tension throughout the movie is like nothing else, and when it all finally snaps in the last few minutes, you're left with nothing but a sour taste in your dry mouth. Director fincher, knows how to pull an emotional punch, and he uses his actors like puppets. Masterfully crafting their performances to hyper realistic proportions. Every twist and turn in the story is done brilliantly, with the script being that rare thing of intelligence, wit, and both a good, and evil heart. Kevin Spacey comes across as almost sympathetic. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make a highly convincing pair of detectives, and the supporting cast are equally as brilliant.

A solid written mystery with an oscar caliber cast and the undeniable David Fincher at the helm.,"This enjoyable movie owes alot to its success to the acting. Brad Pitt as the brash, cocky, young and fearless Detective Mills who really got noticed in Hollywood after Se7en; and the amazing Morgan Freeman as seasoned veteran emotionally worn down by his years in the service Detective Somerset. Alot of the film plays off the interaction between these two completely different detectives who are forced to partner together to solve the recent killings of a serial killer who commits his murders directly relating to the seven deadly sins. Pitt as the new but not fresh young detective determined to solve the case by any means necessary and Freeman ready for retirement after this ""one last job"" just ready to focus on leaving it all behind and possibly look to settle down (he reveals he has no wife or children). They don't get along at all and their worldly views and perspectives completely clash with each other but they put differences aside to get to the bottom of one of the strangest cases they were ever assigned to.",

I have viewed this film several times since 1995 and every time I am pleasantly surprised by new information I missed the previous time. For example, when Morgan Freeman makes his own personal revelations, I would attribute it to a man set in his ways exiting the force and making things odd and difficult for other people involved. However, upon further review and paying close attention, all his anecdotes made perfect sense to the cases he was working, particularly the seven sins killer. This is an outstanding film.",
843,28 June 2006,scott-allin,2, Over-hyped rubbish.,"This film is a total triumph for style over substance. Characters that you don't care about get caught up in a fairly ludicrous set of circumstances and the ending is telegraphed from early on. The icing on the cake is when a potentially more interesting detective movie/police procedural is suddenly ruined by the confession of one of the minor characters in the film that he is the killer. His drawn out speeches about his reasons for committing the crimes come across as unnatural and forced and the whole movie descends into farce with the courier company (nice product placement) delivery of the severed head of a character so underwritten that her input to the scene remains the same as when her head was still attached. Why so many people like this superficially dark but ultimately very mainstream thriller is beyond me. Sure, Morgan Freeman delivers another solid performance and Spacey is good even if his performance (much like Jack Nicholson's turn as the Joker in Batman) belongs in a different movie to the drab, underplayed, naturalistic tone that all the other actors seem to be opting for. Pitt is guilty of phoning in his performance to a large extent and Paltrow wrestles manfully with a sketchy part but can't make any serious impression. A puff piece.",

The conversation that transpires in the car between the two main detective characters and the killer on the way to the final scene is absolutely mesmerizing. What's really fascinating is to watch Detective Somerset's (Morgan Freeman) face as he listens to John Doe explain his view of the state of the world as he realizes how much it resembles his own view as stated just the night before in the bar with his partner. Especially in regard to the apathy of the populace. Of course John Doe's solution to the problem is perverted and psychotic. John Doe is a very effective representation of twisted religious fundamentalism that sees every one that doesn't follow their particular moral code as infidels deserving of death, and carrying out their death is only doing God's work. This movie comes out of nowhere to be a piercing thought provoker. Added note: Great and fitting closing credits song ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" by David Bowie from his much underappreciated album, Outside.",

""Seven"" was not one of the good ones, despite the high rating. The main problem comes in the form of the villain. I just didn't buy it. By going down the list of the seven deadly sins, it seemed like he was trying to incite reform amongst the people. However, he did it in a way that kept it from being relevant to the general populace. The scale was completely warped just for the sake of the number seven. There needed to be more blood spilled in a less ordered way to scare people, and I would argue that such a killer would know that. Fear motivates people and could have brought about the changes that all the characters wanted to see take place. That would have been an interesting movie--people dedicated to maintaining order realizing that the order needs to be subverted to do actual good. That is an interesting conflict. Could the divorce really happen? The groundwork was there for such action to take place, but the result would have been too thought-provoking to be thrilling for the average viewer. Fear shapes people's behavior more than anything else, when present. Think about how many churches you see on your way to work. Inertia takes over when fear is absent. The killer was too calculating to suffer so many ineptitudes. And speaking of ineptitude--I am saddened that people seem so incapable of telling the difference between a good movie and a bad one.

I honestly had a very amazing experience watching this movie and viewed it like a Horror film which came off really close to that genre in my opinion, but the film's ending was so gut-wretchingly bad, that I was shook up on my perspective for this movie. I HATED the way it ended, and how it led down. This movie to me, had much more potential. But the thing is, it's a nitpick and I do understand the ending as to why it happened but... was that something really necessary? I don't believe so. I thought it was a cheap, bought-out ending that was made for shock and to me, it definitely got the shock value of it. However, the moral ambiguities that this film implies was just, depressing. To see your heroes lose like this, was just as bad as Avengers Infinity War, but that worked for that film. This one, I don't think so.

The story is about as perfect as any detective mystery can be as each twist and turn brings the audience closer in to the story. Each new clue hits harder than the last one to the point where it all builds up to what is likely one of the most suspenseful finales of all time. The dark tone also serves to up the tension as only a David Fincher film could. The personal more quiet moments also get one to feel for the characters so that the finale just hits even harder. Pitt and Freeman work magic together on screen and Spacey delivers one of his most impactful performances despite VERY limited screen time. Ultimately this all leads to a finale that is actually quite philosophical and leaves one thinking about the natural condition of man and where we may stand before God on our own power.,

So, why should someone like me who has just written so nicely about this movie rate it with just se7en stars? It is because of its ending. Surprisingly indeed, but... I think, a little too surprising. In the ending this movie seems to lack in logic. The characters Pitt and Freeman are playing make some progress in the story and they get to know each other better and better. Freeman's role is the one of a very intelligent cop who often has to calm down the hot-headed character Pitt is playing. But in the last minutes of the movie - I cannot imagine why - he doesn't calm him down and absolutely underestimates the danger. It seems to me that this movie just wanted to have a surprising, shocking ending (it really doesn't need to have!!!) and spoiled it a little bit to me.

It's easily the most gruesome, dark and skin-crawling movie I've seen.
It's an exhibition is wordless storytelling which is not only a credit to the director but also who play there're roles beautifully:
Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is an emotional hot-head. He plays the role so well that everything that unfolds in the final act seems almost logical.
Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a wise veteran, about to retire. He is a perfect juxtaposition to to Mills, as he is mainly detached from emotion and focuses on the crime rather than the man.
John Doe (Kevin Spacey) is a serial killer, the antagonist of the movie. Spacey embodies the psychopath persona perfectly and plays the role beautifully, helping us understand this incomprehensible character.
The movie creates a seriously disturbing environment. It presents the city as a character through the constant rain, crime and overall grim nature. It's also helped by how the characters talk about, almost how it's someone you don't like, but have to put up with.
The characters are brilliantly as each of the characters are so intertwined that you can clearly see each one rubbing off on each other.
The characters are also so well understood, making their arcs feel as if you have a personal stake in it.
Creates ominous fear and dread for the antagonist, even before we've met him.
The movies score is on par with joker for invoking fear.
Incredible ability to present how much they long to catch this guy through the facial expressions and how they're willing to go outside the law, despite being police.
Lots symbolism for the final act making us thinking we've won: The only sunshine through the whole movie, and the first laugh since the first murder.
Lots of great subtlety portraying the characters, from how mills runs into the building before Somerset, showing the youthful exuberance to how mills uses pop culture references, such as yoda, to Somerset's old dialect and going to a library.
Every plot point pays off and the brilliant religious imagery foreshadowing the final act.

The two detectives are fleshed out during their job as well as outside of work which really makes you connect with them throughout. The acting is incredible from all 4 leads, and I believe it is the strongest aspect of the film. This might be Brad Pitt's best performance I've seen so far. The ending is super creative in which you really do not know what to expect making it one of the best in film history some people say. Now for the negatives. The main focus of the story seems to meander a bit throughout the runtime with much of the time focused on the characters personal life which isn't always a bad thing but for this type of story, I would prefer a more focused plot. The film has a tough time picking up the pace until maybe 60% through when the famous parts of the movie are shown. The rest of the film before the third act just seems kinda forgettable. In fact, I have seen the film for the first time 2 years ago and when I saw it again today, I only remembered the ending which is kinda unfortunate.

942,4 May 2005,mcilhany,10, Excellent Movie. More than one of the best cop-thrillers ever.,"Ever seen hell on earth? Probably not. David Fincher shows the closest thing you shall ever see with his depiction of a story of a serial killer meting out punishments to the people committing the seven deadly sins within an anonymous American city with its perpetual silvery rain, the scantiness of light and the constant depressing atmosphere that lurks over your shoulder all the time with an air of melancholy all around. This movie makes for a gory, gloomy and an uncomfortable watch but mind you the mystery is ever so riveting that it keeps you glued to the edge of your seats till the very end. David Fincher, Andrew Walker and Darius Khondji have created such a masterpiece that this movie can rightly be called as the worthy successor to the ""Silence of the lambs"" in regards to the serial killer genre. The movie has a neo noir feel due to the scant usage of light and the constant rains in this unnamed anonymous city. The storyline goes into a realm of its own, where a serial killer is on a carefully planned elaborate spree that dwells into an analysis of a mad man's mind who is convinced that he has been sent on this earth to bring to the attention to the common people that all they have been doing on this earth is sins , and the way he chooses to catch the attention of the commoners is by punishing the sinners in ways he feels fit. Morgan Freeman plays William Somerset a veteran soon-to-retire detective with his partner David Mills being the idealistic but rash rookie played by Brad Pitt. They meet up on a site of a murder scene, a pictorial description of which may force many of us to throw up, and then from there on unfolds a saga consisting of crime unimaginable and so gory that to say it is savagery would be an understatement. The detectives get embroiled in the case and each day brings to them crimes of such barbarity that makes you think of the killer as an equivalent to Satan himself. First comes Gluttony with an obese man forced to feed until he bursts. Second is greed with a lawyer forced to exact a pound of flesh from his own body. Third is Sloth with a drug addict tied to his bed for over a year. Fourth in line is Lust with a hooker brutally murdered while being involved in the act. Fifth in the cycle is Pride with what seems to be an actress who has been horribly disfigured and is given a choice to call for help and live a life with the mutilation or to commit suicide thus saving grace. And the last two sins Envy and Wrath make up for the most exciting ending to a story I have seen in my life. The brutality of the punishments captured on screen, (dare I say) in my opinion could have only been done by Fincher and Tarantino, which each murder scene being exponentially more brutal than the previous. The background score is so perfect in maintaining the horrific atmosphere that it's a compliment to the work Howard Shore himself has done over the years , the diversity of work he has done made him the perfect choice for the composer of such a film. The acting by the leads Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey only consolidates the class in which they stand, amongst the greatest of our times. All in all, this movie is classic modern horror with a twist/finale to die for. The movie, from the sensory assaulting title sequence to the nerve wracking finale goes for your gut and makes you feed on it all the while constantly gnawing on your brain until you give up and starting believing that the place you live in is truly an infernal cesspool. This movie leaves you reeling, emotionally and mentally and you have a feeling of having been robbed of mental peace. I leave you with this advice - Try not to expect it to be a comfortable viewing.",

I came through this movie, after having watched a lot of movies of the genre of crime-mystery-thriller. I think such movies can be made far better, by adding some kind of twists at the ending. The one given in this movie was not essentially a twist; it was just something to add 2 more to the 5 sins to make it Seven. I'm not at all telling that its a bad movie.One can rate it 8/10 but obviously not 8.7. And you know there's quite a lot difference between 8 and 8.7, here at IMDb.

Brad Pitt plays a rookie detective called David Mills. He is assigned a job with William Somerset(Morgan Freeman). Here they go through a series of killings by a person known only as John Doe who uses the 7 deadly sins as his MO. After watching this film over 100 times shows that great films like this are dying.

I'd almost compare it to The Silence of the Lambs, because of it's dark events and shocking outcomes. This films also a psychological thriller and leaves you thinking once it's over.

This is a movie worth watching. I did so on the terms of a review for a school project and it actually was more meaningful than I was expecting. the writers may have not intended such a dramatic realization that if our actions are unkept then we would be ultimately subject to what was illustrated in this movie. a few suggestions to this movie would be to watch it with a sincerely open mind, thoughts to who we are, who we could be, what we have been, and how we should voyage into the future.",
964,9 November 2013,JTx13,7, Very good play on humanity,"A highly effective mix of brooding atmosphere, schlock parody and cop-movie that is given its thrills by its intriguing premise about a serial killer committing his crimes based on the seven deadly sins. The narrative moves efficiently along providing the necessary shock moments and the work of everyone involved shows a happy center, but it is Fincher's directorial touch that gives the film its sensational and memorable aspects. I cannot fail to point out, however, that the film has been strangely overrated over the years, even being compared to that other excursion into the schizo realms, ""Silence Of The Lambs"". It is not ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it can surely be appreciated for what it is: A graphic Lovecraft-like tale set in a gritty world.",

The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for ""perfect 10"" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact. There is a sense of victory that gets mixed in with the stew of other pleasing emotions that movies like this evoke. Victory over the variables. Se7en is definitely one of the survivors.

As the psychopath ""John Doe"" (Kevin Spacey) preaches to Detectives Somerset and Mills, one sin at a time, the film moves from the mangled remains of one victim to the next. In the dark and subdued tones typical of film noir, the sin of gluttony comes first and the murderer's dreadful potential is brutally illustrated. The seasoned, educated, but cynical Detective Somerset (Pitt) investigates the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to comprehend the killer's method of operation while the young, impetuous, but intelligent Detective Mills (Pitt) mocks his attempts to gain more information. As I watch more and more of David Fincher's work through fight club and the social network, I become more and more mesmerized by his elegance in his storytelling. I can say that I've fully fallen in love, from the casting of the actors, to the cinematography. His films are truly a piece of art.",
997,21 December 2022,FilmFinatic062817,10, A Detective Story That Will Stand The Test of Time,I like this film more with each viewing. Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman are both superb as a pair of detectives on the trail of serial killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey). The film is rich in imagery and graphic in its depiction of violence. The story is great and kept me guessing till the end. A must see work. 10/10,
998,31 January 2003,dogspit,10, Deliciously dark...,"Two homicide detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) are investigating the case of a serial killer, as one of them is about to retire (Morgan Freeman), whilst the other has just transferred to the precinct and is only starting out (Brad Pitt). This neo-noir, set in the gritty, grey-looking New York, begins with the character of Brad Pitt entering a crime scene to introduce himself to his new partner, Morgan Freeman, however their first interaction proves to be quite cold, as the 'old dog' does not warm up to the newbie. Furthermore, they are assigned a mysterious homicide case, in which the killings are linked to the Seven Deadly sins.
The film starts off with a series of Fincheresque shots, establishing the morning routine of the detective, then transitioning into a unique introduction title sequence of the film, which focuses our attention on minor details of the shots. It throws us into the action, the music straight away portrays the films as a tense crime thriller, in which the murder scenes send shivers down your spine and make you tense up, expecting a jump scare after every musical build up, keeping the viewer on edge during all times, grabbing our attention and not letting go throughout.
However, even though Fincher's masterpiece retains the status of a must-watch, the film is more of a stylistic piece, showing off the director's way of seeing things, it might have been better with more content and ironically 'suffers from the sin of self-consciousness' (Malcolm D.; The Guardian, Seven, 04/01/1996). By my opinion it is also one of Morgan Freeman's best performances in a film.",

For me to give a movie/TV show a ten star rating it has to have a happy ending. I'm not going to lie I was so upset the first time I watched it and told everyone the movie was horrible. However, I really liked the movie, I was just harping on about the ending. That being said, I think the movie itself was brilliant. It would not have been as good if it would have had a ""happy ending"". The part at the end that I hated made everything fit perfectly. Knowing the end results made me like it more when I watched it again. Great acting by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Also this movie is not scary at all. I do get scared easy in movies (that aren't even scary movies). I refuse to watch scary movies actually, so for me to say it's not scary means it's not scary. I was obviously surprised by the ending and that always makes a movie so much better to me is when I can't figure out the ending until the end.",

I say ""imagine"" because only about one in every three lines spoken in this movie are audible. When I went to see this movie in the theatre, I was on the edge of my seat, not just out of tension, because I was straining to hear what everyone was saying. I know they didn't have the volume turned down to low, because the soundtrack, and all other sounds in the movie were LOUD, its just all the actors sounded like they were mumbling. OK, maybe it was just the accoustics of the theatre. I rented it once on VHS, and there was the same problem -- you could barely hear anything that anyone said. OK, I had a lousy VCR, I thought it would be different when I got in on DVD. I watched it last weekend, and it was still the exact same problem. The sound editting on this movie is horrible, which is REALLY frustrating, because its an amazing movie.

Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), one week away from a well-deserved retirement, but must wait for one last case, for which he's teamed with a young new short-tempered David Mills (Brad Pitt). The duo investigate a particularly barbaric murder, in which a fat man was forced to eat to death. Soon they face equally unique murders involving death by blood loss from a cut of a pound of his own flesh, by shock after coming out of some kind of chemically induced bed that has kept him immobilized for one year. Soon they realize that the murders represent the 7 deadly sins, inspired by the Dante Alighieri's ""The Divine Comedy"". Somereset concludes that the killer ""John Doe""(Kevin Spacey), is killing people to deliver a sermon. Will John Doe succeed or the two detectives will be able to stop him? ",

Andrew Kevin Walker wrote an unbelievable plot. The director made the movie as good as the story. Watching the play of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey just makes the movie absolute masterpiece. Very strong, dynamic, brutal, bloody and mysterious thriller. Perhaps one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. A true classic and a masterpiece of the genre at all times, which was perhaps the best work of David Fincher.

1012,18 June 2014,justlex1313,10, Is murder justified?,"( Hesitated before committing the 777th comment! Shall make it snappy!) Se7en was shockingly overlooked by the Academy Awards ( but for a Best Editing nomination ). Still it had  some of the best assets a film can hope for: devilishly clever and faultless writing by Andrew Kevin Walker, magnificent photography by Darius Khondji which , with the  superb settings, created the haunting  atmosphere of the film, very good musical score (including an excerpt from a Bach piece aptly included ), and taut and gripping magnificent direction by David Fincher. So the film garnered many other rewards and met with considerable public success. The casting, though uneven, contributed thereto: Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow ( wonderful in ""Shakespeare in Love "" but otherwise overrated in most films ) are acceptable but have no real alchemy together ; Morgan Freeman is truly excellent, and Kevin Spacey simply superb ( his performance is said to have weighted  considerably on his  Oscar awarding for ""USUAL SUSPECTS ""); solid support in small parts is given by seasoned performers : R. Lee Ermey ( police captain ), Richard Roundtree ( D.A. ), Michael Massey ( man in massage  parlour booth ), and Richard Schiff ( John Doe's lawyer ); while John C. McGinley' s acting talents are just wasted; as to Charles Dutton, I just did not see him. A discovery ( at least for me ) : Leland Orser as the nerve-wrecked customer of the dead hooker, remarkably convincing in a most difficult if short part, and who now has  consistent roles in good movies.",
1013,10 February 2003,pnay75-1,10, Se7en rates ten !,"I had Just watched Se7ven recently, and it honestly was one of the most fascinating films i have watched in a while. Se7ven was on my Netflix watch list for quite a while and i kept holding it off for the appropriate time. When it comes to choosing a movie for me I like to get a sense if the movie is a unique/special film. Well let me be the first to say this film was special, during the movie you get a sense human nature and interaction. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey all play very fitting characters for each of their acting styles. Brad Pitt plays a rookie police detective new to a crime written city who's personality is very cavalier and inpatient. Where on the other hand Morgan Freemen plays a veteran detective that has worked in the city for years and whom is rational. Both detectives together take on a reoccurring homicide cases in which is m/o is discovered to be the Seven Deadly Sins. They come close to finding the killer after the first five deadly sins and run into the believed murderer, which turns into a chase-down/shootout. After the incident, while still trying to catch the murderer with no luck a twist of fate happens. Kevin Spacey/the murderer turns himself into the prescient confessing to the murders. Kevin Spacey plays a extremely intellectual and mysterious person. After questioning him, the detectives believe their is a reason why he turned himself in. After a brief conversation, the killer/John Doe agrees to confess to all murders and to lead the police to where the last victims are. But the killer has a stipulation which is that only the two detectives shall go with him directly to find the victims. After agreeing the detectives proceed, with a long integrating conversation on the ride there between the detectives and the killer. After arriving the killer keeps saying how it will arrive soon and asks for the time. Eventually a package comes sent by a delivery person with a box intended for Brad Pit's character, in the box is the detectives wife severed head whom was also pregnant. The killer does this to peruse the seven deadly sins, which in his cases would be envy because he is jealous of Brad Pitts life. After Brad Pit's character realizes this he is overwhelmed with emotion has an ultimatum to face, either kill the murderer and be committed of the last deadly sin which is wrath and jeopardize his life and career or let the murderer live and be dealt with thorough the Justice system. As Morgan Freeman,s character basically puts it ""if you kill him he will win the game and succeed in his mission"". Brad Pitt ignores this and unloads the pistol, killing the murderer.",
1014,27 November 2014,keithmannes-km,10, Sev7en,"Another masterpiece, Se7en delivers complete realistic drama along with psychological breakdowns. One of the main beauty of this film is, as the movie tends to become much more serious and tragic, it pulls you into the mood of the movie itself, rarely a great motion picture can do that but Se7en was able to. For those who think Brad Pitt is just some commercial pretty boy (I thought so myself) this movie indeed proved me ever so completely wrong, this is one his finest movies, Brad Pitt is defiantly one of the best actors lurking around Hollywood, along side with veteran and lovable actor Morgan Freeman who also delivered outstanding performance like he always does in his movies, all and all, Se7en is a great marvelous film, the reason I say it can be watched once in a lifetime is because the ending breaks you down psychologically and it's a one time experience, watching it again and again will give you pleasure of a great movie but not the ending feel.",

I myself am a fan of the gritty cop type movies as well as the suspenseful serial killer movies. this movie gives a nice look into the seven deadly sins and their viewpoint onto how everyone should look into their own lives and see where they fall in amongst the big 7. towards the end you start to see the mindset of Pitt when all the wants to do is catch this killer in his now damn the laws damn the rules thought process and just wanting this person caught. the end is messed up but the ideology and Pitt and the killer having a sort of symbiotic relationship makes it an interesting movie.",

Excellent cast and was hooked from the minute i started watching it. The story gets me every time, which allows me to re watch again and again, thats rare with a film.

1023,6 October 2001,Bilstein,9, This really is very good,I thought it was a pretty good movie until Brad Pitt opened the box at the end and gave the most God awful performance I have ever seen in a movie.

1024,18 August 2020,jsmjpc,3, Brad Pitts acting ruined this movie for me,"Intentionally gloomy and unintentionally drab, Seven can be a difficult movie to watch for many reasons. The murders are shown and described in their most gory form. However, for a crime thriller, the movie moves at a surprisingly slow pace and the plot (beyond the brilliant idea of using seven sins) is almost too basic. Understandably, this movie was also to serve as a tirade against society and a critique of crime-ridden cities. But what the film loses in thrill value in achieving this is hardly justifiable, especially when the whole premise of this movie screams a feverishly fast and an intricate battle of wits. The film owes a lot of the accolades it receives to the 'brilliant' twist in the end. However, this film came at a time when the idea of a twist was a fairly novel concept. So, if you have sat though most of Chris Nolan's and Shyamalan's work before seeing this, you could out-think twist in this movie , and perhaps even expect it. That though is not the film's fault. It is watchable for its intriguing premise, good performances and subtle commentary. However, don't be surprised if it fails to fulfil your appetite for a real crime thriller.",

The story revolves around two cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, one of whom is ready to retire and the other is just starting. Freeman and Pitt work great together and I was pleased to see Brad in a movie where he isn't some charming bad boy like in most of his movies. It's a nice change and I'd like to see him do more characters like that. Freeman of course does a spectacular job as well, but that goes without saying. Although the new cop/old cop pairing has been done jillions of times before, somehow Freeman and Pitt manage to make their characters different and captivating. The two, after a rough start, become friends and a good subplot involving Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife, emerges that is a nice respite from the grittier main story, which of course later ties in with the main plot later, as in every respectable movie.",

1072,30 June 2018,davidklein-06399,7," It has plot holes everywhere, but if you play along, its pretty fun (if not dark) ride","If ever a movie was completely represented in one of its characters, ""Se7en"" was it.  (possible spoilers) The two preachers of the film are John Doe, the character portrayed by Kevin Spacey, and the director, David Fincher. Fincher's film has a purpose just like that of John Doe's murders, to shock American into recognition of its major faults: its sins.  Unfortunately Fincher's point is lost in his bombastic and brazen style which dominates all of his films.  Fincher seems to be quite the cynic in his view of the world.  In ""Se7en"" there's not a person in the world, or at least NYC, that's not a sinner, and we're living on a veritable hell on earth.  ""The Game"" presents a paranoid world where no one's life and security are concrete and ""Fight Club"" shows us just how superficial of a culture we are. Unfortunately, Fincher also seems to be an optimist at heart, and this is where his films lose their potency.  At the end of each film he tries to give some glimpse of hope.  At the end of ""Se7en"" Morgan Freeman quotes Hemingway, saying ""'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.""   At the end of ""The Game"" it turns out the paranoia was only part of an intricate joke and ""Fight Club"" falls apart on itself when(among other things) it tries to present some sort of solution, which was, best as I could tell, love.  If only Fincher didn't try to provide some sort of happy ending(albeit minimal as in this film) his films could be much more powerful(like Neil Labute's ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors"".)  He makes his point and then unfortunately loses it in an overblown style and ludicrous attempts at happy endings. Compared to the rest of his work though, ""Se7en"" is his most effective film to date with fine performances by Freeman and Spacey.",

I thought Morgan Freeman (Somerset) and Brad Pitt (Mills) had a perfect dynamic of experienced and inexperienced. It showed how methodical a season veteran was an how a rookie was reckless and immediate. The killings were extremely gruesome and I was especially disturbed by the lust killing. I heard there was a the plot twist before I watched this movie, (thankfully didn't know what it was) and I was trying to figure out what it was the whole time- and it was difficult to predict. I kinda saw it coming but at the same time I didn't see it coming at all- I felt my heart pounding and my eyes glued to the screen almost the entire time.

However, he has since shown us that he can indeed compete with the likes of Cameron and other A-list directors. He is most widely known for the immense cult classic ""Fight Club"" and Oscar monster ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", but his first stand-alone film after Alien 3 was the brilliant and classy crime thriller ""Seven."" This film proves that right from the start Fincher was a force to be reckoned with. This of course isn't to underplay the excellence of the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, or the intense and spine-tingling score by Howard Shore, or the excellent performances by all actors, including the actor who plays the killer (as the actor was kept under wraps during the marketing for this film, and isn't in the credits until the very end, i won't reveal who it is but it's one of my person favorites).

This film is classic Fincher: dark, moody, thematically complex, tense, and a slow burn. From the opening shot, the yellow and green hues of the film draw you in to the mysterious and dark crime world of NYC. We follow Pitt and Freeman in this rainy setting as they slowly uncover the identity of a serial killer that uses a peculiar reason for his murders: the seven deadly sins. As the killer (Spacey) slowly begins to make his way through each sin, and punishing those sinners, both Freeman and Pitt's characters have to face their own demons.
This is NOT a movie to watch if you're looking for a fun, action packed, and uplifting time. Get ready to face a film with a BLEAK outlook on life and a devastatingly disturbing finale. Be prepared to engage yourself from start to finish; it's a movie that makes you think, and every word, every shot, and every moment matters. Critiques say that the first 2 thirds of this movie are ""dull and uneventful"". This is the case, yes, but only for the unfocused and distracted mind. Being fully immersed in the first part of this film, pays off when the final act finally comes around.

Moreover, the plot is phenomenal! At the face value, it might seem like a typical cat and mouse tale, but as you go along with its phenomenal storyline, things begin to sound odd and that's a sign of realization which tells you things are a bit a different here.

The first five kills were okay. And then you can predict he would kill detective Mills for Wrath, because he was too angry, all the time.
Didn't happen. Our intelligent killer killed a woman who'd done nothing, no deadly sin or anything. He did that just to make detective Mills more angry that he'd kill him because he'd sinned, he had felt envy. What a nonsense. What about his message? Was he telling that sinner's wives should die too? I mean, it's not that he can kill anybody he wants. He wouldn't be a Psycho then. He didn't even kill detective Mills.

But by far the best performance (though short) was Kevin Spacey as John Doe, who I would say is even comparable to Hannibal Lecter himself acting wise. He perfectly mastered the act of menace and intimidation in every one of his scenes, I was pulled in whenever he was on screen.

David Fincher focuses on the dark side of human nature and society, and the image style is powerful and shocking. First of all, from the perspective of the narrative structure of the film, the director did not shoot the seven cases and the seven SINS in stages. Instead, he started from the perspectives of the two detectives and gradually deepened them. Most of the film's plot is supported by the two leading actors.

Kevin Spacey, who I know is currently a shamed actor, performed outstandingly well in this film, with his sublte, slow, deliberate movements and menacing smiles.

Major credit for this film must be given to David Fincher, this film owes its success as much to his style and direction as it does anything else. This film has it all: a very good cast, great style, a good plot with some great twists, and a good dose of gore for flavour. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well cast as the leads, Freeman delivering yet another polished performance as the battle hardened mentor, and Pitt showing promise as the brash young detective. Undoubtedly a highlight for me was the chilling performance of Kevin Spacey, showing his immense talent in a brilliant cameo as John Doe, a villain on par with Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. A certain Ms Paltrow gives a solid performance as Pitt's beautiful young wife, but Spacey set the tone. The dark tones of most scenes are perfect in setting the mood of the film, and are used well by Fincher.

Each gruesome murder being represented as the seven deadly sins was creative and unsettling. The dynamic between Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) having little to no faith in the criminal justice system, and Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) having a clear vision of justice for the serial killer, was also a thought-provoking sub-plot. In the movie John Doe (Kevin Spacey), is a brilliantly written villain, who works hard to logically validate his murders, that he committed in the most sinister fashion.

1129,15 October 2005,Buskieboy,10, Se7en gets a t10n from me!,"The film ""Se7en"", directed by David Fincher (Fight Club), is a stylish thriller that pulls out all the stops to catch the audiences attention. The wily veteran detective, William Somerset, is played excellently by Morgan Freeman. He brings up the younger detective, David Mills, surprisingly well played by Brad Pitt, who is not known for his role in dramatic films. Later on, Pitt will work with Fincher in Fight Club,but that is a different story. The two detectives are chasing a serial killer who is committing murders according to the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Wrath, Envy, Pride, Lust, Greed, and Sloth). The deaths and murders in this film are not too extreme, but they get the point across. The plot and storyline is well planned and thought out. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife. This is Paltrow in a smaller role and she plays it well. But lets not forget how the title of my summary comes about. The killer,named appropriately John Doe, is played maniacally by Kevin Spacey, a sick and twisted Kevin Spacey who's in fine form after The Usual Suspects and before American Beauty, both of which he won Academy Awards for. Fincher shoots this movie flawlessly; the camera-work is excellent, cinematography is good. And the ending is one that is a predecessor for films such as Saw and The Bone Collector. 9/10",
1130,18 February 2005,LieutenantFrankDrebin,9, How Deliciously Evil,"First of all, the cast was great! Morgan Freeman (Somerset) and Brad Pitt (Mills) did a great job and help create just the right atmosphere for the movie. But one of the greatest villains of all time must be Jon Doe played by Kevin Spacey. The character was incredibly scary and completely out of his mind but still seemed quite intelligent and focused. Spacey did a superb job in portraying him. The story reminds me a lot of the book ""Illuminati"" by Dan Brown but without the ""happy end"". And that's what I really didn't like: Why did Mills Girlfriend have to die in the end? I get why the writers chose this Ending but did it have to be this cruel?

The plot, story, and acting are all executed adequately, but there is an excess of violence and gore that was not necessary.  I have gladly watched many violent action films including Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and war films like Saving Private Ryan, but this film combined with the movie Casino convinced me that there is a limit to the amount of gore that I am willing to sit through.  Also I think I find movies about serial killers to be somewhat disturbing.

It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much.

1138,12 April 2023,chiragrathod19,10, One of the best Noir Dark Thriller Movie.,"""Seven"" was one of the best detective thrillers I've seen in years. Fast paced, somewhat realistic despite Pitt's terrible acting ability in almost everything he does.  A notable scene comes to mind with that said.......where he's got the gun pointed at Spacey and screaming when he knows what's in the box........that has got to be some of the WORST acting I've ever seen.  I believe that Keanu Reeves might be able to do a better job, or maybe even Kathy Ireland would have done a better job as well. Anyway, despite all of that, the movie is STILL quite gripping.  And yes, just because someone is a bad actor/actress doesn't mean that the movie they play in can't be great! Seven is one of those examples!  Morgan Freeman, one of the greatest American actors today held that movie together along with Spacey as far as I'm concerned!   Definitely worth a look!",
1139,20 February 2003,dannyag,10," You GOTTA be kiddin' me, right?!?!?!","Without saying WHO the head is of, we were watching this the other night when a head in a box is delivered, and someone opens the box but we can't see inside it. My wife is yelling (honestly) ""SHOW US THE HEAD!!!"". She was so disappointed that we didn't see the head that 3 days later she's still talking about it, so I downgraded my better rating to account for me having to put up with a movie that didn't SHOW US THE HEAD!!!",
1140,27 April 2022,jstlucas,7, My wife wants to see the head!!!,"First of all, I would like to make a few comments about some of the other comments on the movie: First of all, it was actually intentional that Brad Pitt seem somewhat cocky & ne'er-do-well in his role; the point of his character was that he most likely came from a smallish town's precinct where the hardest crime was probably stealing from the collection plate, and his attitude was looked up to. In a small town. He, in their minds, had the attitude of ""those movie & TV cops"". In L.A., an attitude doesn't even get you a latte. So his bravado is supposed to be misplaced. But what does come through is the fact that he honestly does want to do the right thing his own way, and ""get the bad guys & teach them some manners"", usually with a lot of verbal & some physical abuse. Typical small-town, or rent-a-cop, mindset. Secondly, a lot of people claim that the gore was hard to take...WHAT gore? We only see the aftermath of the murders, not what they go through. And what they go through is only speculated upon, not hard-cold fact. The gore is in the mind of the audience. Frankly I am quite please that they took that approach, as it shows that the writers, producers, directors are giving the audience SOME credit for having minds & imaginations. Hollywood thinking their audience has a few brain cells--go figure... To sum up my feelings on the movie, I have to quote the artistic director, Rob Bottin, on this one--""This is a script that definitely gave me the butt-willies!"" From beginning almost to the end, I was impressed by not only the idea, but the approach to such an idea. And a haunting thought occurred to me...why hasn't this ever been done before in real life? Or has it, but was not clued in to? Not that I'm hoping this is so, of course!! I think that given the circumstances, the victims were actually handled with dignity. So many times in movies, the victims are exploited because most of Hollywood thinks that we only want shock and after-death scandals. Here, there was no dirty laundry airing, no contrite bloodletting...just the sad fact that they were everyday people in everyday lives (whether we want to admit it or not), and chosen to fit a specific killer's agenda. Much like most other serial killers. Morgan Freeman, as usual, does no wrong, and brings a quiet grandness to his role (and every role). Brad Pitt, with the aforementioned background character, holds his own and does a pretty impressive job to get most of us to forget that he's known for his looks alone. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't given much to do, but she does it amiably. And R. Lee Ermey, as always, is a comic-relief treat (ring...""This is not even my desk!"" slam!). Plus, how much fun was it for us to see ""Shaft"" as the governor?? One minor flaw I feel compelled to say, and this is just my opinion: Not the actor portraying him, but the character of John Doe, left me a little dry. When he first arrived in the station, his character seemed to fit with all that was discovered in his apartment. But once he started talking, he fell into the same old Hollywood Killer mode. Giving away all of his motives and intentions and thought processes right before the end. This contriteness is in EVERY killer movie, and was a sore disappointment. For me. Personally, I would have preferred not to have him speak at all, or very minimally. Case in point, at the very end when Mills has the gun on him and Somerset rushes up after receiving the box. Doe goes into saying what his role is in the 7 deadly sins, and what Mills' role will be as well...Hasn't that been implied already?? We KNOW who will be what sin, just by the set-up! And there's only two left--I think we can tell who is which! Sorry, but Hollywood--take note, please - we don't need every killer's life story, motives, and intentions spoon-fed to us. Besides, with everything only being implied in the rest of the film, having John Doe go into such a self-serving diatribe really goes against the grain, and gives the feel of the film a 180 turn...which makes it all the more sad when the first hour & 45 minutes have proved that the writers, et al, have the intelligence to not stoop to that level. However that is my only beef with the film. The rest; above par, superb, magnificent, and a must-see...that you will be seeing in your conscious and subconscious for a long while after the film ends. Guaranteed.",

1146,10 March 2023,akashpj-49118,10," Haunting, Disturbing, Intense, Thrilling , Masterful.","Se7en holds a place for being the gruesomest yet greatest crime masterpiece to hit the big screen. From the disturbing opening credits that laid turf for what this movie endorsed to the mind blowing finale that left audience members craving more, the David Fincher touch drooled off every beautifully composed composed shot and in combination with his immersively stunning set pieces, magnificently naturally lit scenes and an unnervingly gloomy colour palette; the atmosphere was consistently intimidating and unnerving yet angelic to even an untrained eye. Without doubt, Pitt and Freeman nailed their performances and thoroughly succeeded in portraying the clash between an exhausted soon to be ex-cop vs a fresh, energetic young detective as well as two men on the same path of different journeys. In addition, dialogue was clumsy which brought a naturalism that many movies fail to convey in that people don't talk perfectly. The scripting, direction and pacing were astonishing in that as the detectives uncovered evidence, building the case by every murder, the pacing grew faster as though the tunnel of apprehension was closing until the conclusion where everything simmered down. However, one small gripe was Paltrow's character; although her death shocking, it wasn't ultimately sorrowful due to her minimal appearances and one on one's with Pitt's character. Moreover, whilst only revealed towards the resolution, Kevin Spacey's character is one of the best murderer portrayals. Not only is he frightening to watch and threatening to listen to at every sentence, but the amazingly written car discussion revealed his actions weren't totally that of a lunatics and although immoral, his reasons were rational. Sadly, I found the soundtrack horrible and hard to grasp. Granted it resurfaced that 90's crime nostalgia and added tension, however it took more than it gave and possibly with a better equip composer, scenes could of shined rather than just have glowed.",
1147,2 May 2020,productionslykos,9, Se7en holds a place for being the gruesomest yet greatest crime masterpiece to hit the big screen,"I have always believed that a great movie only comes as a result of not only good performances plus good script plus entertainment plus novelty plus technical prowess. All this has to be complemented by what the movie is trying to say, and on that respect, Se7en is a winner all the way. I see this movie as a complete portrayal of maturation for Morgan Freeman's character. Somerset from the initial frames of this movie constantly mentions the notion of 'I've had enough of this city'. All these culminates to the scene in the bar between Freeman and Pitt where Freeman's Somerset talk about apathy and justifies his views of a trodden world. But the turning point arrives when Mills tells him that Somerset wants to believe in it so that it justifies his decision to retire. After that, we see a constant culmination of the dilemma that Freeman's character undergoes up till the final point, where he remains calm and doesn't lose his grip on the things that happen around him. It is a movie about self-realization as to how Freeman realizes for himself than he is capable to handle even the worst of situations, no matter how much they hurt him. Morgan Freeman easily delivers a performance of a lifetime, and David Fincher shows his touches of brilliance, even though its pretty apparent that a stellar star cast of Freeman, Pitt, Spacey and Gwyneth easily eluded his direction. The film would have been a normal fare had any other director taken this project, because the ending might not have been altered if not for Fincher. The alteration is beautiful to say the least, this new ending certainly separates this film from being just another well-made crime thriller to a meaningful fare with themes regarding humanity and strength.",

Ambient and just plain disturbing score by David Bowie, Brian Eno and Trent Reznor really set the mood of the film, brilliant editing for opening and ending credits(For full effect, get the Criterion disc!) and the film editing itself is visceral and creepy. The crime scenes scared the Bejesus out of me, Greed being the scariest, lumps of flesh on a scale to balance his wallet?! Really frickin' creepy, and the ending is still under debate on what really occurred, how creepy is that? Classic film, scary as hell, but worth the nightmares, Ten,",
1159,8 March 2005,Kurt_Cocaine,10," Really damn scary, but my fave movie anyway,","Writing a review for this movie seems to be almost as difficult as the exercise of watching it. No, please do not take it in the negative sense. But the adjectives that come to the mind when thinking about the movie are very mixed, ""Brilliant"", ""Grotesque"", ""Depressing"", ""Brutal"", ""Unique"". The story is that of a psychotic killer, whose each kill is a 'modern day' representation of the original Seven sins from the ancient texts. The sins are Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are the two homicide detectives that have been assigned this case. In fact, it is Morgan's last case, as he is due to retire soon. The case becomes more and more intriguing as each murder unfolds. Each murder is more gruesome and more gory than the previous one. (I must say at this point that it has been one of the most difficult movies to watch. Watching it alone at night ,as I did, is definitely not recommended.) By this time audience is certain that the killer is brilliant but a very twisted guy. A very clever technique employed by the director here is that he has not shown any crime being done in action, all are just the post murder shots of the dead. Just the level of detailing shown in the movie makes an amazing treat. Morgan Freeman is as usual very good. But it is Brad Pitt that really shows amazing acting abilities especially during the last part of the movie, the final confrontation scene between Brad, Morgan and the killer. Having said that movie belongs to the killer, who is the eventual winner (you will have to see the movie to find that out). Kevin Spacey as the killer has only around 15-20 minutes of the role during the end. But by Jove, he does carry it off amazingly well. While watching the movie, I was really wondering how would the director show the viciousness of the killer, which he has shown earlier during the murders. But Spacey carries it out with ease. He is a rare breed of an actor. A class apart. One had to just look in to his eyes and the expressions on his face, to become convinced that he is same person that performed all those murders. Also worth mentioning is how well the movie ends. The last sequence, the last two murders ( or should I say the Sins) are a treat to watch. What an ending. In the end, I would like to quote the brilliant director himself, Mr David Fincher, to understand why the movie is so dark, stark and gruesome. ",

The movie is not complex and actually walks you through so it feels predictable but in a strange and very rare way it is not. My advice is to relax, put the kids to bed and watch as this movie takes you on a little journey. In the end, if you have sat through this with minimal disruption, you will be left shaking your head in total disbelief... I'll watch it again in about 3 years.

There is nothing feel-good about this dark film. It is set in a rainy metropol challenged by brutality and violence. The themes of the film revolves around the worst aspects of humanity and whether it is worth keeping on fighting the good fight or we should just give up because of the meaninglessness of it all. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are portraying the two main characters William Somerset and David Mills. They are one of the best unlikely buddy cop pairs ever seen on the big screen. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect portraying the sympathetic and worried wife of Mills. Kevin Spacey is menacing as the everyday man John Doe with fanatic plans for society.

1222,8 February 2023,AnandBlaster,10, A mind-numbing experience,"A film about the desperate search of two homicide detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the ignorance of the world of the Seven Deadly Sins. The film takes us from tortured remains from one victim to another while sociopath ""John Doe"" (Kevin Spacey) lectures Detectives Somerset and Mills - one sin at a time. The sin of gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible ability is demonstrated graphically in the dark and soft tones characteristic of the film noir. The seasoned and cultured but tired Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi, while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get into the mind of an assassin.",

1224,29 May 2021,razvanmiculit,7, Disappointing,"Se7en is so interesting in a number of ways and for a number of reasons. The first is simply that murder stories have an interesting, visceral appeal which Se7en is able to put to use. To compound the powerful drawing force of murder mysteries, Se7en has easily one of the most interesting concepts in the history of murder mysteries, as the killer bases his murders on Dante's Seven Deadly Sins. Each new murder proves to be an interesting twist, since new details about the case as a whole are revealed, and since there's no telling in what gruesome fashion the murder will have been carried out. Indeed, the murders of Se7en are symbolic yet extremely grisly, meaning that the movie will both capture your attention and take a part of it for good.",

I loathe this film. It is horrifically violent and graphic. Truly disturbing, and I am not particularly squeamish. I like thrillers and the occasional horror flick, but this was over the top. I wish movies like this were never made - they can't be good for the public in general. If we keep ""advertising"" for extreme violence by making films like this, no one should be surprised when we get it. Exercising a little restraint and common sense for the good of society wouldn't hurt Hollywood, but they are much more interested in their profits than anything else.",

Seven is told entirely from to point of view of the detectives.  And there's no stupid ending where the killer is revealed to have been one of characters the whole time.  Deranged killers do not live among us in society.  They are severely disturbed individuals who distance themselves from the public. Seven accurately portrays this type of character.  The cinematography is beautiful and the chase scene is really cool.  Morgan Freeman is great as usual and Brad Pitt is hilarious as, what I think, the comic relief. Seven should be regarded as a classic crime drama.",

Brad Pitt was brash, and affectionate. Kevin Spacey was Kevin Spaceyily good.

On a side note, I'm not sure how a 7 looks like the letter V but we digress, I suppose. Moving on, this film is both terrifying and tragic, and offers a wonderful detective story with two great performances. Morgan Freeman plays Detective William Somerset, a patient and by-the-book officer, who makes decisions with care but is not afraid to act instinctively. Brad Pitt plays Detective David Mills, the antithesis to Freeman's deductive Somerset. Mills is rash and often acts impulsively.

The unbelievable tension is created in a seemingly static situation. Spacey and Freeman watch Pitt. Pitt knows he's being gamed, knows what he must not do, for everyone's sake, and yet, the provocation! Who could not respond to that provocation?

It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Seven tells the story of David Mills (Pitt), a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset (Freeman) to track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a motif in his murders. Seven grossed $327.3 million and currently holds a certified fresh score of 81% on Rotten Tomato's and 8.6/10 on IMDb.

1247,10 September 2019,mscandan,9, One of the best films in 90's.,I tend to believe that the golden era of movies was the 90's and I have no doubt that this was of the greatest at that time. Each of the trio leading actors had one of their best performances in the film. The plot left me speechless and held my breaths to the very end. It is a true example of how mystery movies can be made in a balanced way where the odds go back and forth between the protagonists and antagonist. I think the weakest link of this masterpiece was in the few first scenes. Those watching without prior hints may find it a little bit boring with the story moving in a slow pace in the beginning and the plot left unexplained for a while.,

1251,28 May 2021,vampiremmmm,10, My idea,"Critics often write or at least used to write that a movie was a triumph. If there has ever been a movie, worth this compliment, it's this one. Not only does John Doe triumph, but the triumph of this film is that it is as clear a case as if it had been worked on by William Somerset himself. It is a unreal world, raining constantly, in every direction only buildings, no nature visible. People live in constant din, dogs live in the living room. FBI-Agents are greasy and being paid off, as are junkies so that the police can hide their illegal methods. Somerset is one who is able to recognize the paradox of this world, but as he sympathizes with apathy he does not react, maybe because he doesn't know how. John Doe eventually starts wicked measures. He seems to combine Somerset's cognition and Mills' zest for action. David Fincher found impressing images for this complex plot and composed them together in a ingenious way. He achieves to tickle the best of the craftsmanship out of Pitt and Freeman. In it's whole appearance the film illustrates how it has been a landmark for the thriller genre, besides ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", being it's main reference.",

A great movie, well written and it shows in this movie. I plan on buying this on a CD so I can listen to the book and see if it follows the movie. When I first saw this movie, I was prepared to just see another crime/mystery, but as you get into the movie, you see it is more than that. Morgan does his best to not like his new young partner. He also wanted this new, young partner to know he could not count on him being around for long as he was getting ready to retire and just wanted his days to be nice and quiet. The new partner did teach Morgan that young, upcoming detectives can and does become a very good cover your butt type of detective.

In this one we witness the effects of what has already happened. We are not there at the killings (thank God!). This way it slowly creeps up on you to a much better effect than any visual violence can achieve. But it has a giveaway that keeps it from not being a 10. Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Brad Pitt's wife, isn't in the film very much. she only pops up four or five times in the movie. The scenes are also quite short. What usually happens with wives, girlfriends, sisters and son on who doesn't appear much in the usual Hollywood-movie?  Right! They die. So does Gwyneth. The only thing that differs from most films, is the way it's done. So what could have been a full 10 only becomes a 9 because of the formula treatment of the cops wife. But besides that; Terrific!!",

Brad Pitt has become an awesome actor, not content to rest on his prettyboy image, and you just can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman.  To top it off, you have Gwyneth Paltrow posing as Pitt's wife, and a cameo by one of my favorite actors, who I sadly cannot reveal. Se7en is the story of two detectives (Pitt & Freeman), trying to catch a patient and determined killer.  John Doe (played by someone whom I cannot name), bases his murders upon the writings of Dante and his idea of seven deadly sins; gluttony, greed, pride, sloth, lust, envy and wrath.  The detectives must catch Doe before he completes the 7 murders and disappears from the public eye. What can be said about this movie, other than ""SEE IT""?  It is dark, it doesn't pull any punches and unlike most movies it stays true to itself right through to the end credits.  Many movies for box-office success will sugar-coat their endings at the expense of the story.  That is not the case here.  Here, they go the whole nine yards and it pays off in every way. Pitt and Freeman are great opposite one another.  While Pitt is youthful and energetic, throwing caution to the wind, Freeman is experienced, calculated and thoughtful with each move.  They have a strong screen chemistry that only heightens the payoff in the final scene. Gwyneth Paltrow, while not carrying a lot of screen time, rings true in each scene she appears in.  She is not only beautiful, but has a presence that is very strong opposite greats like Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Se7en has set a new standard for movie thrillers.

1288,8 April 2021,pietrofortuna,10, Movie to add to your list,"This film is quite an experience. David Fincher creates such an unsettling atmosphere in practically every scene, it's unsettling to watch. Even back then, the Trent Reznor connection was there, setting the mood right at the start behind a disturbing opening sequence. It's starkly evident that Fincher simply didn't hold back, he had a vision of how this film would look and just went for it. The way the plot slowly unfolds is just pure genius, daring the audience to try to figure out what's going on. There's also the excellent dynamic of the two main characters, who are well played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, but even better written. Very few films pack such a punch on their first viewing",
1289,31 January 2020,jamesomullane,9, Disturbingly compelling,I finally watched this for the first time and I was slightly underwhelmed. Was too slow and there wasnt enough action for me. Morgan Freeman plays the serious detective to a tee and Kevin Spacey is perfectly cast in his role. Expected better but I gave it a 7 because it wasnt terriblem,
1290,17 February 2021,williamspratt-24312,7, Not as good as I expected,"Se7en effected me in a big way. It made me see that the people I look up to and admire are far from perfect and the human race is a quite disgusting breed of animal. There are so many issues in this movie, complex and truly frightening. A lot of the violence in the film goes unseen apart from split second shots of the victims, this improves suspense and the realism in this movie is amazing. Kevin Spacey is rapidly becoming my favourite actor and he plays as an unerringly vacant, incredibly intelligent man. They're always the quiet ones so they say, and that's what scares me the most.",

1292,10 May 2021,organfreight,10, Seven? You mean TEN,"This movie was incredible. It is one of those murder mystery types like ""Primal Fear"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" although, A LOT more gory. Actually, the real name of the killer in the movie was not included in the opening credits because if he was, it would have given away the entire surprise towards the end. I was shocked and amazed at who it was and guaranteed, you will be too! I highly recommend this movie",
1293,29 April 2001,sensei_mike,9, this movie blew my mind!!!,"John Doe left a vast space for thought, as ruthless as he was a butcher, he was also a paranoid individual about an idealistic society. In his eyes, the rule of his conduct was to punish evil and make good, and because the murderer had committed seven crimes, he acted in god's behalf. Of good and evil border upon du John is no longer so clear, this is an extremely complex inner character, David fincher through such a character, completely obscures the world clear judgment of good and evil, a desire to purdue beings, encouraging people to people ended up using the means of extreme intolerance,traditional morality under the lens of David fincher gradually lost the criterion.",
1294,14 March 2020,h-68478,9, John Doe,"Although extremely violent and disturbing, Se7en is absolutely amazing, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are very great together and incredibly acted. The villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey is fantastic,gives a unique twist to villains, he is very recognizable and very well written. This movie has twists that work such as John turning himself into the detectives in one of Se7en's most famous scenes. All of these factors plus the fantastic and creative production design set up an American city ruled by crime and murders. An awful city with cheap apartments and deteriorating buildings that any one with just about any taste would find appalling. The villains way of killing is based on the seven deadly sins, original. The film never holds up or stops the flow of the plot. Se7en has very good effects, however the effects are mostly used for the dead or near dead bodies of John Doe's victims. One of the best parts of the film is the very well acted scene of Brad, Morgan, and Kevin are in a police car going to the middle of no where in which Kevin instructed Brad and Morgan to go. In this scene, the characters, mainly Brad and Kevin, have a discussion of why John Doe does what he does, the conversation is very intense, well written, and interesting in John's thoughts on the murders and the victims themselves. Overall, Se7en is absolutely fantastic, some won't be able sit through its violence but its worth it. 10 stars easily.",
1295,26 May 2020,SteelVengeance,10, An Insane but Fantastic Experience,Se7en is an amazing film and creped it's way up to being one of my favourite movies. brad pitt and morgan freeman do an incredible job playing their characters and i really like the dynamic that they bring to the screen. David finchers work is a masterpiece.,
1296,4 March 2021,loladaniels-35712,10, WOW!,"The thriller is quite controversial. Brad Pitt's performance is unimpressive: he rushes to appear clever, in addition, he makes a number of blunders and eventually realizes that the latter should not be the case. For him, love exists solely as adoration for his wife, while for the maniac, it exists as hatred and an expression of world domination.",
1297,13 July 2021,vivienneaandreagffde,8, 12 Laps After the Devil,"This movie is easily one of my all time favorites. The movie revolves around two detectives who are trying to solve a series of murders. The murders all, some way or another, revolve around the seven deadly sins. In summarizing the plot I am reminded of countless B-movie slasher movies i have seen. The Killers in those movie always choose their victims based on some sort of imperfection (Sluts, Rick Kids, Jerks, etc.), as does the killer in this movie. But this is where this movie becomes great and what sets it apart from other horror movies. The way the killer eliminates his victims is both clever and haunting, and the directer shows very little violence on screen. He leaves the viewer with blurry and far away pictures depicting what happened at the scene of the crime, leaving the viewer to conjure up their own gory images. This is an especially effective technique in this day and age, where people are often desensitized to violence and can no longer be shocked by what they see on screen. This movie is truly a modern masterpiece,with one of the best, most shocking and disturbing endings i have ever seen.",

Saw 1 comes close as the plot line twist is also amazing but for me this film has started of an era of amazing films, just as Hendrix started the amazing guitar front, Se7en has started a great time in our lives for films. An excellent peace of acting from both main characters (Freeman and Pitt). So different as to what sort of roles Brad Pitt usually takes on. A classic usual weird and strange vibe from Mr Spacey as well. The way that the pot really does make sense in its bizard way. I would not change anything in this film at all.",
1302,24 January 2007,catchboy3,10, Se7en,"When it comes to genres being overdone in Hollywood, the Murder-Mystery is at the top of the list, and only a select few ""heavy hitters"" come to mind. The film most widely accepted as the best murder mystery is ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", which I would have to agree as well as ""Rear Window"" and a few others, but where ""Seven"" stands out in this genre compared to others is in the film's dark, innate ability to tell a gruesome murder story set in a crime addled side of New York City. The character interactions are incredibly played out as well as it's cinematography, but this film is so dark, grisly and shocking that you literally CAN'T look away from the screen for the two hours it plays out, it grabs your attention like a drill instructor at boot camp and doesn't let go until it's over. The cinematography was captured beautifully and reminded me slightly of ""The Dark Knight"". Take note though; this ISN'T your average murder mystery, at many parts it is VERY disturbing and is most definitely not for kids, but what makes it so good is the gritty unrelenting realism of crime in the big city. ""Seven"" is so well done and has so many twists and turns in it, that I constantly found myself at the mercy of the surprises. Even at the end when you expect the story to take on a lighter path and maybe show a little redemption, it gets even darker and more sinister. After Morgan Freemans' monologue at the end you get the overwhelming sense of the true realism this story has to offer over all others of it's kind. I have to say that when it comes to murder mysteries ""Seven"" is as good as they come.",
1303,22 July 2010,eric-cberg,10, As good as they come,"Premise of the film is woven around 7 punishable sins : Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust,Envy and Wrath. People who exhibit any one of the these sins are brutally murdered one by one.Detective Somerset (Freeman) and Mill (Pitt) join the dots to catch this serial killer. 
Acting,cinematography,direction,background score, editing in Se7en are brilliant except the climax.Film is convincing till 5th murder but goes haywire in climax. Last two sins Envy and Wrath are not convincing.
And it is also confusing that people exhibiting any of the deadly sins are murdered or killed but person exhibiting Wrath goes to jail.",
1304,15 March 2018,k-tnahsarp,7, Should have been titled Fiv5 not Se7en,"I think that the audience of the film ""Se7en"" is rather self-selective. If you don't mind an ultra-violent cop movie with lots of foul language, then you'll love it. If you are looking for something family or ""nice"", then you should not even think about watching this movie. While I don't think I would classify myself as one or the other, I don't really like spectacle, and while I can respect this movie, it really isn't for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with over 17,000 reviews and an overall IMDb rating that puts it at the top of all films, it's only natural that I'll get to it sooner or later.",

Gloomy, like Macbeth himself, and fundamental, like a painting by Bosch, with the same number of sins in the title. I wouldn't be surprised if it was this painting by a Dutch artist that served as a catalyst for the idea for the second (read first) film by David Fincher. Deconstruction of the noir genre in all its glory, eternal rain, neon signs, detective stories and, of course, a twisted plot. Now we know how deftly Fincher manages such introductory, but in the 95th, hardly anyone knew about it.",

1307,4 May 2004,treeroot,9, The devil had the upper hand,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that. ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting, or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere. Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive. Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police captain. The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene. Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see. 10/10.",

The atmosphere, the music, the acting, that gut-wrenching finale.....what a movie!!!!! The fact that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is considered a better movie by the critics than ""Se7en"" is a scandal. Kevin Spacey should have been at least nominated for his role as John Doe. Keyser Söse, my @$$. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay is also superb. So is Fincher's directing (""The Game"" kicks @$$. Can't wait for ""The Fight Club""). And Morgan Freeman. And Brad Pitt. And everyone else involved in the making of this movie. Plus, that title sequence made me consider that maybe the academy should add ""Best title sequence"" to the Academy Awards.

Brilliant story -that you do not expect from a thriller-, and an atmosphere that makes it a masterpiece, thanx to Mr. Fincher!  The library scene with the parallel editing and ""Air"" is just another masterpiece alone (as well as the beginning credits sequence).",

The answer to that question is rather simple because it was directed by David Fincher, who is known for being a perfectionist. Se7en is one of a kind. With its unrelenting dark and gritty visuals, David Fincher beautifully employs the use of rain, the twisted legal system and gore to create something which was both thrilling and well written. This film has a fantastic cast. From Freeman's controlled performance playing Somerset who loves books to Pitt's angry follows his gut who loves a chase. Yes, their partnership is pretty cliched, but it's forgivable because both Pitt and Freeman do such a remarkable job playing these characters. Not to mention that ending which will play in my mind for days after watching-something I adore in a film.",

1323,19 June 2022,maximiliandeisz,8, Great plot but,"Morgan Freeman has always been an extremely distinctive actor, be it his hair, his voice or even his general appearance. But he is also an excellent one, with this 1995 thriller being one of his finest roles to date. At first you think this film is just your bog-standard serial killer thriller, albeit an impressively shot one. However, as the film progresses, you realise that this film also deals with serious moral issues (witness the killer's denial that he has killed 'innocent' victims) and generally exudes such an overwhelming sense of depression it's hard to believe sometimes that you are watching the supposed real world. Throw in extremely brutal and sick killings, with the razor-edged dildo being a particularly gruesome standout, and excellent performances from Freeman, Paltrow and Pitt (who's arrogant, hot-headed Detective Mills is the template for his electrifying performance as Tyler Durden in the director's later film Fight Club.) But the real honours must go to Kevin Spacey. His serial killer 'John Doe' is a terrific role to play and he does so with admirable flair. The expression on his face when he is about to be shot by Mills makes your skin crawl and your flesh tingle. All in all, this is an extremely impressive film, which really needs to be seen on DVD in all its gory glory. Although perhaps not quite as brilliant as Fight Club, it is a journey into a place that you will never want to enter. Ever.",

But the thing that really strikes me about this film is how sympathetically John Doe is portrayed. This is rarely done (if ever) in mainstream cinema because it alienates a good portion of the audience. Se7en does it in a great way, however, because while the portrayal may be sympathetic, it doesn't make the mistake of making him an anti-hero. While the movie understands the reasons for his crimes, it still recognizes that he is a monster. Not for everyone, but deffinately a movie worth seeing.",

Yes, I can talk about the Gotham-like constant rain, the decaying buildings, the sound of the sirens from police cars in the background subtly serving you a city that's full of death and crime, the sick yellow color Fincher chose for some of the most important scenes, the incredible performances, the fact that ****** (wont spoil it although you probably already know) asked for his name to not be included in the intro credits for shocking reasons, the fitting and unsettling score and many many more that made Seven my favorite movie of all time BUT I'm gonna point out just one thing and finish the review. The reason that I can watch this movie every now and then again without feeling bored or need to skip scenes. The third Act and especially the last 20 minutes are some of the most shocking, dark, nihilistic and intense minutes ever directed.

This is Kevin Spacey's best role as an actor for sure, he plays the part, and fits the characters needs perfectly.  The only thing you can do to him in the movie is hate him to your fullest extent.

1347,27 April 2000,ag74,10, One of the best thrillers of the whole history!!!,"David Fincher lends his directing skills to help make Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay into one of the greatest serial killer movies ever made.  This movie has everything.  A cast of easily likeable characters.  A demented but creative nemesis.  A dreary setting.  Witty dialogue.  An original plot. One of the best endings in cinema history.  The film focuses on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's characters, William Somerset and David Mills, who are both police detectives.  Somerset is desperate to leave his job and Mills is excited to get in.  They make a great team when it comes to finding an elusive serial killer who preys on people using the seven deadly sins as his preaching tools.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a terrific performance as Mill's wife Tracy.  A superb acting job is done by the killer.  I won't mention the actor's name in case you haven't seen the movie yet.  This isn't one of those movies that you can guess the next scene before it comes.  ""Seven"" is packed with surprises.  This is a good movie for anyone with a strong stomach that enjoys fine acting and a great storyline.  I recommend watching ""Seven"" at night with no interruptions.  I wouldn't recommend eating during the film.",

You just see the crime scene or even only a photograph of the 'weapon' and then you reconstruct what happened in your mind. And this is what makes it so frightening because this way the horror is perfectly adapted to your very own fears. But this is just another genuine aspect of this truly outstanding thriller.

There is only one focus on this movie and that is Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman)'s journey to find a psychopath killer (Kevin Spacey) who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his guide. We see each murder as a crime scene as opposed to the murders happening; this I thought, added to the suspense of finding out who this killer is.

1413,19 November 2011,xkhushali,9," Excellent movie, Must see.","Overrated Masterpiece. I think thats an oxymoron, but its true. This film is a masterful look at a decomposing city and the unfortunate few who happen to live in it. It features great performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman along with Gwyneth Paltrow and R. Lee Earney. I guess I should summarise the plot since this is a review, but didn't you see the movie? Why else would you read an IMDb review? Are you a nerd, like me? But I digress...the film tells the story of two detectives, Mills and Sommerset, who are investigating a series of brutal murders in the form of the Seven Deadly Sins. There you go, ya perfectionist slob. There's my summary. Okay, I'm sorry about being mean so I'm going to describe everything else about the film just so that this will constitute the structures that are built in order to be a review. In fact, I'll indulge myself and create a little meta-review. As said before, Freeman and Pitt (and everyone else yadda yadda) are great in the film. In fact I think Pitts a little like the film: an overrated masterpiece. Seriously, he isn't that good. That is unless if you pair him up with David Fincher or let him star in Babel. Many have praised Fincher's direction post-Se7en as perfection at its best. Many contemporary reviewers, in other word internet nerds (like me!) have praised his direction here. But they seem to forget that they are praising him for praise-sake. His direction here is a little a sophomore in its presentation, lacking the punch of Fight Club (a personal favorite) or Zodiac. Though there is this one shot of the Killer pointing the gun at Pitt's temple. Its simple but I see the depth of the future cinematography of Fight Club. I did right spoiler at the top of this review so I shall spoil. Kevin Spacey is the killer and bloody good one at that. He delivers the part not ironically but with a knowing grimness that Ledger's Joker emulated. He knows what he is doing is bad and he knows that he shouldn't be enjoying what he's doing but he does. And in that comes a great villain. I wish IMDb gave out ""1/2's"" because a seven's undermining the film but an eight would be pushing it. The film itself is good but not as good as everyone says.

1414,6 July 2011,hatchet39,7, Overrated Masterpiece,"Perfect. The only word to describe the brilliance before my eyes. Brilliant directing, acting, writing, soundtrack... everything worked together to make a superb thriller about a serial killer following the Se7en deadly sins. Mills has requested transfer to homicide in New York, Somerset is retiring. Bodies start piling up, and the investigation starts. Somerset reluctantly teaches Mills what he can. The art direction in this film is breathtaking. Every scene will leave you wanting for more. Every time I watch the credits roll I want to start the movie over. While the ending was changed slightly from the original script, I think it is for the better. This one goes down in the books my friends, a must see, especially if you are a David Fincher fan.",

Alien 3 was good (I liked it. Many don't agree). Panic Room wasn't bad, but not good either. I really like Finchers gloomy and depressing pictures and style. Really refreshing in these ""happy-go-easy-times""! I am happy to see, that nearly all who rated this movie really liked it as well.

This film was before Kiss the Girls, Copycat, Along Came a Spider and Taking Lives, and each of these films have taken from Seven. The film has a dark mood(it's always raining) and a very gritty look to everything. The acting is perfect, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are a great team of cops and Kevin Spacey puts in a very good job.

The locations, production design, and cinematography work seamlessly to create such a perfect world, that's found in no other film.

A stomach is definitely needed for this movie. It has a lot of disturbing pictures and the story itself is disgusting. The characters are well written you know just the perfect amount of all of them. The only thing that was not perfect is that the plot twist at the end was a bit predictable - at least for me - and that killed the excitement a bit. Overall it is a masterpiece both from the perspective of the plot and the acting. If I could i would give it a 9.8 but it is not a 10 for me because of the predictability.,

Well, it certainly did that, but it also gave me a very enjoyable viewing experience of an outstanding movie. Pitt and Freeman both turn in outstanding performances as well as the maniacally sane Spacey who gives his second best performance after his amazing role in The Usual Suspects. To me, the movie had the feel of Bladerunner including the crowded feeling that is gave as well as the constant rain. It certainly was disturbing but more so it was frightening. Seven was definitely not as disturbing as Apocalypse Now or even Pulp Fiction. All in all, it is a great movie, and one of the best if a scare is what you're looking for.",

However my taste leans directly on this Neo-Gothicism that has been winning over people for about the last 20 years by using the dark-realism of Gothic architecture, acting, lighting,speech, all combined with this new sense of Evil that has been felt by nations seemingly since the 80's, when we supposedly sold our souls . Other selections much like 'The Crow','The Silence of the Lambs' , 'Dark City' and even to an extent 'the Devil's Advocate' remove the viewer from their safe-seats, and sits them on the rained-gritty street corner where a whispered conversation is taking place.  It removes that false sense of security that watching years of 'Happy Days' can give you.  For me, Seven was deeply philosophic (obviously), and I probably don't go a day without some reference to it.  However, the reason it digs so deep into us, is that it is absolutely possible.  Your average nutcase could copycat this movie, and claim insanity at the trial.  Enjoy!",

The way John Doe rationalizes his behavior makes me believe that there are such people out there and that is freaky. The movie is of course absolutely brilliant, true David Fincher style. Each of the murders is so grotesque , its almost a celebration in his camera. The most mortifying scene for me is the manner John Doe kills his 'LUST' victim. Most people miss out on the subtle humor in the movie when they see it the first time ; the conversations between Mills and Somerset crack me up. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie. For a movie that's 10 years old, it still beats other creepy movies like Ringu for its sheer reality.",

It has its own place in the thrilller genre for its dark visuals and plot development. Seven is an seat edge thriller and make us focused and tight from the start to the end. This story of serial killer hunt by two detectives is set a mark in 90s thriller and its psychologically violent. As a lead cast Morgan freeman and brad Pitt shines through the movie with their polished acting. And Kevin spacey as john doe played a villain role with perfection and subtly terrified the viewers, hes considered one of the best villains in 90s . Writing gives a upper hand to this movie credits to Andrew Kevin walker. This movie has an dark opening and unforgettable ending in history of cinema. Apart from writing , acting and visuals driving a plot is an art and fincher is an master of it when its comes to dark thrillers . he makes us completely engaged in the movie. Seven is an well produced and well directed thriller/ mystery till the end with outstanding performances from the cast and dark storyline. Its one of the must watch fro thriller/ mystery lovers

1457,29 December 2021,nicodino,8, the first thriller with such a powerful aesthetic,"Colour and lighting, Fincher emphasizes shadows and dimly lit scenes--the kind that lend more to the tone of the shot than to the ego of the star. You'd be hard pressed to find any light situation in any of his films that truly flatters the actors. Se7en is definitely Fincher's darkest movie--in mood and in lighting. The majority of Se7en contains very little light, the crime scenes being the most notable examples. In fact, most of Se7en's lighting is directional, meaning that it comes from an artificial source focused in one direction with a low falloff. The brightness of the desert setting during the climax is a dramatic shift from the rest of the movie and is perfect for the change in tone and action of the finale. The most interesting use of colour in Se7en comes when Mills and Somerset explore John Doe's apartment. Everything is, of course, red and dark. Camera work and editing, The chase scene with Mills and Doe is about as exciting as they come. The camera moves quickly with the characters, and the odd angles keep the audience from seeing everything--building paranoia and escalating the tension. The steady movement of the SWAT team as they descend upon the sloth victim is another well-choreographed sequence. All of Fincher's films feature some kind of chase scene, which is definitely a good thing, considering how effectively he pulls them off. Production and set design, A lot of the settings are buildings in decay; many of them were built from scratch and then made to look worn. I believe that Fincher often films on sets rather than scouting out interior locations because actual interiors rarely live up to his meticulous imagination. Rotting wood, rust, water stains and peeling paint all help to make each scene totally believable--more like moody still life's than movie sets.",
