0,28 August 2004,dee.reid,10, A powerful film that shows the true cost of war,"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.",/
1,4 September 2004,Lupercali,10," A masterpiece, whose beauty is often overlooked","When I watched this movie, I steeled myself for a traumatic experience, based on every review I'd ever read of it, which usually include phrases like ""don't watch this if you're suicidal."" Instead, if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw, it would probably be 'beautiful'.",r

3,3 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating","What an amazing film! Very rarely have I been moved this much by an animated film. Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and ""depressing"" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox",v

My friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. I hesitated at first, but then I said ""Oh well, I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out.

8,7 January 2005,The_Void,8, A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told,"Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.",r

12,9 February 2021,Hitchcoc,10, Soul Breaking,"This is a film about the sad reality of war. When war is waged, we often think of it as this army against that army. Lost in the mix are the civilians who die horrible deaths--not just from the weapons of war but from disease and starvation. We give great power to the power structure that makes the decision to wage conflict. Often their words sound good and we embrace those words. This film shows what happens to a small, seemingly insignificant pair of children, trying to get a roof over their heads and have a bit to eat. Their mother has been killed in a fire bombing and their father is in the Japanese navy. It shows the efforts to maintain dignity and the cruelty of those who could help but don't. Japan paid a huge price for trying to expand the Empire. The leadership convinced the populace that they were driven by a higher power that wanted them to crush their enemies at whatever cost. But here we see the price. Fire bombings, air raids, and, of course, eventually Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is the saddest of stories, shown in spotless animation. It is a story of hope and hopelessness. Outstanding.",0
13,8 August 2007,lost-in-limbo,10, One for the unknown victims.,"Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving, sincere, haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic, but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer, but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy, and because you know the outcome at the beginning, this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone, the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.",6

Not just an astonishingly great (and, at the risk of coming off as clich√©, perfect) work of art, this is a moving, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.",4
15,12 April 2008,Quinoa1984,10," a combination of Rome Open City and Wiesel's Night (and like both, an extreme, personally felt story)","In 1988 Grave of the Fireflies was placed on a double-bill alongside My Neighbor Totoro. Two of the most endearing films ever created- animated of otherwise- were paired alongside one another, more than likely to balance each other out; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film, there could be accepted such a bleak, heartbreaking story of survival. And both films, incidentally, were based on true experiences, and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life (his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital), Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child. It's basically about two siblings, an older brother and younger sister, who are left practically orphans in a Japan completely devastated by the constant barrage of bombs falling all around, and with very little hope in sight. This lays the groundwork for their relationship, a bond very fragile and incredibly endearing.",7

23,24 April 2012,classicsoncall,8," ""Why do fireflies have to die so soon?""","The movie took on an added poignancy for me as I kept thinking of my own granddaughter, who's age approaches that of the young Setsuko in the movie. How horrifying a prospect to be left homeless under any conditions, let alone to deal with the death of a mother with no place to turn. The plight of Setsuko and her older brother Seita is dealt perhaps an even more severe blow by the indifference and even hostility of their countrymen and fellow citizens. I was probably more disturbed by the idea that so little compassion was offered to these two troubled wanderers. I rarely watch animated films, and this is actually the very first anime feature I've ever seen, recommended by it's standing in the IMDb top film rankings. The picture is gorgeously rendered, and there's a lyrical quality to the quieter moments when the siblings take comfort in each other's presence against a backdrop of war and devastation. Be prepared for an emotional response to the heartbreak of loss and separation, exemplified by a brother and sister who mean the world to each other.",=
24,10 January 2013,lee_eisenberg,10, once upon a time in Japan,"Hiroshima may have been the most famous bombing of Japan, but the air raids were often just as destructive. One such firebombing is the setting of Isao Takahata's ""Hotaru no Haka"" (""Grave of the Fireflies"" in English). It looks at both the struggle for survival and loss of innocence that accompany war. I've never seen any other anime, but is one movie that should truly be required viewing for everyone. Not only in looking at how the brother and sister try to maintain their hope amid hardship, but two lines in particular stood out. One is where someone mentions that the war is eating up Japan's resources, making it harder and harder to feed the people. Another is when the brother learns that Japan has surrendered. Long taught that the Japanese Empire was invincible, he now has to realize the unpleasant truth. These are important reminders for everyone. The fact remains that the common people will suffer the most in any war, and the movie makes that very clear.",t
25,29 January 2006,Lady_Targaryen,10, A very sad yet powerful movie,"''Hotaru no Haka'' (Brazillian title : ''T√∫mulo dos Vagalumes'') is a very sad and moving film about the second war in Japan,focusing in the difficulties of a brother(Seita) and a sister(Setsuko).After their mother is killed in an air raid and their father was also killed working in Japan's navy army, Seita needs to be responsible for his little sister Setsuko,a very adorable and sweet little girl. They both go to their aunt's house to live, but after knowing that Setsuko and Seita are now orphans,their aunt changes her behavior and starts to be cruel and annoying with them. Seita stays tired of that, and decides that is best to him and Setsuko to live in a different place, that is a kind of an abandoned shelter. Having problems to find supplies and needing to steal to have something to he and Setsuko eat, Seita and Setsuko gradually starts to have many health problems. Setsuko even goes to the doctor, since she is with malnutrition and diarrhea, but in war times, everything gets even more difficult.",t
26,13 October 2010,toqtaqiya2,10, Grave Of The Fireflies is one of the very best anime films there is.,"Grave Of The Fireflies (directed by Isao Takahata) is one of the true classics of anime. Along with Spirited Away it's my favourite film by Studio Ghibli. Even though the film is an anime it's different from anything that's typically associated with the medium. There is no ""end of the world"" scenario here, or characters with big eyes and coloured hair, or plenty of slapstick humour. Instead, what Grave Of The Fireflies offers is a believable drama set during the second World War. Near the end of the war a boy named Seita and his five-year-old sister Setsuko have been made homeless because their mother was killed and their house was burned down during the firebombing in Kobe. Their father is in service to the Japanese Imperial Navy, but he was probably killed in action. Eventually the children find themselves in a grim situation. They have to live outside, and food is very hard to come by as a result of the widespread famine. Seita tries everything he can to acquire food for himself and his little sister. We get to see their struggle, and how they try to stay positive during this difficult time. The story is focused on the two children. There's hardly any discussion about Japan's war with America. In fact, I think the Americans aren't even mentioned in the dialogue. As is to be expected from a Ghibli film the animation in Grave Of The Fireflies is top rate. The music is effective. It helps make some scenes very moving. Some famous baroque and classical pieces by composers like Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Mozart and Boccherini were included too. Appropriately aged children were cast in the roles of Seita and Setsuko. Some anime reviewers have named Grave Of The Fireflies the greatest anime there is. Having seen the film I understand why they'd say that. Before watching the film I heard that it makes viewers cry because it's very moving. I didn't cry, but that's because I tried very hard not to. After that I still had to blow my nose. Film critic Roger Ebert considers Grave Of The Fireflies to be one of the most powerful anti-war movies ever made. He included the film in his Great Movies list. The AllMovie guide awarded the film a rating of 5 out of 5 stars. The only other anime films to earn the perfect rating are Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Akira. I don't really care about ratings, but this is one of the few anime films that deserves the hype.",_

28,12 November 2006,planktonrules,8," Super-depressing, but an exceptional film","Had I been able to see this film in Japanese subtitles, I might have scored it higher. The version shown on TCM was dubbed and I think the dubbing detracted from the film because the characters didn't seem the least bit Japanese. While this may not matter as much with some full-length Anime movies, this one was based on real people living through the final months of WWII with all its privations on the Japanese people. So, to me, it just didn't seem appropriate having the characters sounding like Americans--this seemed a bit tacky. This is all pretty sad, as the film itself is a marvelous film featuring some of the better animation I have ever seen and exceptional production values.",r
29,21 June 2001,michael saunders,10, Truly Heartbreaking,"**SPOILERS**I saw ""Hotaro no haka"" on german TV the other day and it has changed my life! Never have I been so moved by a film in my whole life. I cried and cried and cried. Since then I can¬¥t get this heartbreaking story out of my head.",v
30,7 January 2014,ironhorse_iv,9, It's one of the most depressing movies ever!,"I have to say this movie is really hard to get through. It's so heart breaking. Grave of the Fireflies is based on the semi-autobiographical short story by Akiyuki Nosaka. While the movie is well-made, there isn't much of a story arch. The opening minutes of the film, pretty much explains what happen to the characters of the film. There is little to no point of watching the film if you know it doesn't end well for them. People love watching Survival movies, because they know that the character will beat the odds and live. If you open the movie, knowing the characters are doom from the start. It put out that tribute of the human spirit out, quickly and you're just left in the dark. The movie by director Iaso Takahata (co-founder with Hayao Miyazaki's fame animation studio, Studio Ghibli) has this very dark overwhelming guilt trip hanging over it, like a black cloud. While, some people quoted the film, one of the most anti-war films of all time. The reason why Iaso Takahata made the film, is convey the image of the family living a failed life due to seclusion from society. While also, invoking sympathy in the 1980's youth of Japan, whom the director felt needed to straighten up and respect their elders for the pain and suffering they had experienced during World War 2. I found the movie trying really too hard to make sympathy for the two leads. Throughout the film, the movie had a lot of padding, only there for making us feel warm hearted to the characters. It could have easily been removed from the plot without affecting the story significantly. The film tells the story of two orphans trying to survive on their own, Seita (voice by Tsutomu Tatsumi in Japanese, J. Robert Spencer or Adam Gibbs in English version) & Setsuko (voice by Ayano Shiraishi in Japanese, Rhoda Chrosite or Emily Neves in English version) after their mother is killed in a firebombing raid by the Allies. Most of the English dubbing is mediocre, at best. The supporting cast pretty much read their lines without much emotion added to it. In my opinion, it's just better to watch the movie in Japanese with English sub-titles. The animation is pretty good at the time, but I did notice they did reused multiplies shots for the fire-bombing scenes. Also, in some scenes, the figures in the background tend to limited in animation. I would gladly want more. Like I said before, the whole story and characters are just one-dimension, and has no story arch to it. I think the 2005's life action version, delivers the characters arch even better. In that version, we see why the Aunt became crude and mean to them, due to the limit of food, rather than being told about it, in this film. She has selfish impulses as she singles Seita out and resents the fact that the kids get special treatment because their father is a Navy man. She accuses Seita of being lazy and not supporting the war effort, and praises those who do. Eventually, Seita grows tired of her criticisms and sets off on his own with his sister in tow, believing in his own capabilities to care for the two of them. In the end, he could had learn how to swallow his pride, but nothing is clarify here. All I know is his naivet√© and pride end up shutting him away from the rest of society and cause doom for himself and his sister. Blind patriotism is talk throughout the film, that masks selfish impulses during the war and, afterward, Japan's inability to confront this past. The movie does use great symbolism with the fireflies. Like human beings, firefly shine from the inside out, as if liberating its interior beauty. Only in facing darkness, does the fireflies stand out. Fireflies represent light, illumination and mysterious. Fireflies symbolize inspiration and hope. Another symbol of the fireflies represent is guidance. The natural instinct of a being is to follow the light instead of getting lost in the night. And it's true that when you're walking in the night and you suddenly see a firefly, your natural reflex is to follow it, because it is fascinating, and because it looks like it's guiding us towards the right path. The Sakuma fruit drops is another symbol, which becomes a recurrent icon throughout the film. The quick emptying box of fruit candies stands for disappearing hope, that get refill by ash. Ash represented sacrifice, sensitivity and higher awareness. In a way, while not explain, the box that Seita carry around, is indeed his mom's ashes. It's weird in a way, that this film was initially distributed with the 1988's My Neighbor Totoro because the different in the films. One is really happy, while this film lead audience saddened. In the end, My neighbor Totoro became the more popular of the two. Overall: Wonderful tear-jerker based on autobiographic novel. While, the film is market to children and their parent. I doubt many children would like this film. However, I think it's a film that children indeed need to see, when they mature enough.",

46,5 December 2011,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Beautiful, amazing, stunning","Set during WWII in Japan, 14-year-old Seika is the only one to take care of his 5-year-old sister, Setsuko, after their mother is killed in an aerial firebombing of their village, that also destroys their home. Their father is off fighting, and they have to go to live with their aunt, who scolds them at an increasing rate and level. After a while, they move out, into a shelter. This follows their struggle to survive, on dwindling food supplies and sudden plane raids. In the way of a classic tragedy, this hints at its inevitable conclusion from the very beginning. This doesn't make it ""predictable"", as the point is not to surprise; it renders it even more powerful, as we find ourselves losing the battle in trying to deceive ourselves of where it is headed. I have not read the novel and can draw no comparisons. Like the other Studio Ghibli pictures, this feels very true to life and natural. The astonishing attention to detail, the immense realism, the tiny little human aspects, these have you forgetting that you're not watching live-action(the mood is spot-on, and you're transported directly into the situation). And the animation is impeccable. This is deeply moving and engaging(and it is more focused on this than the plot). If it does not tug at your heartstrings, you are officially a robot. At the same time, it isn't manipulative, and your sympathy and empathy are awoken in an honest manner. The sound design is excellent(and it uses the absence thereof, silence, to fantastic effect), backing up the visuals in recreating something very close to the real world. While there is stylization, and not everything in this is what it appears, it doesn't betray this objective of credibility. This builds and maintains atmosphere extremely well. Whether it's the siblings having trouble getting by, them playing together, an explosive assault from above, it comes across as genuine. The pacing is perfect. At about 90 minutes, this is not in a rush, and it lets you absorb the individual parts of what's going on. The acting is phenomenal. I base this on the original version, not a dubbed one. There is a bit of highly disturbing, bloody, violent, gory and brutal content in this.

Basically fourteen year old Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi) is dead, but the narration continues to tell the story of what made him end up in that way. He and four year old Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi) are brother and sister living in Japan during World War II, and they witness a mass bombing in their home town. Coming out of the wreckage of the air raid, they find a temporary home with their Aunt (Akemi Yamaguchi), and Seita is devastated when he sees the body of their Mother (Yoshiko Shinohara) and obviously near death. Seita is the only one who knows that their mother has died, and he writes to their father over seas to try and get out of the danger zone, so they stay with the Aunt in the meantime. It is obvious that Seita and Setsuko are getting on the Aunt's nerves, so they leave and make their way to an abandoned shelter to live in. All they need to stay alive is the roof over the heads, to care for each other, and find any food they can, but they still have fun as well. It becomes apparent that Setsuko is sick with hideous rashes developing on her body, and the doctor concludes that it is because of the lack of food. With the low supply of food, they can only entertain themselves while looking gazing at the beautiful light of the fireflies. Eventually Seita finds that his fears about his father being killed over seas are right, and the sick Setsuko confesses that she already knew that their mother was dead also. Seita decides that because she is so sick, Setsuko needs a serious amount of food, so he takes out the money from the bank to get a good supply, and she does take one bite of watermelon, but it is not enough and she dies. The story is nice and simple, it may not be dubbed into English but it doesn't matter, the use of colours was well assorted, and it is quite harrowing viewing which makes it essential. But what I enjoyed most about this film was the beautiful music by Michio Mamiya, not many cartoon films compel you with just some images and the use of excellent music score, but this one definitely does, a most worthwhile animated Second World War drama. Very good!",

The Japanese ""anime"" method doesn't focus on the animation per se, which would be considered ""primitive"" by contemporary American standards, but the scenery and backgrounds themselves are dream-like watercolours, even if many of those dreams in this case would be nightmares. The story is set in Kobe during the Allied firebombing, but the message is transmitted obliquely through the plight of a young student and his little sister who are rendered homeless in the devastated city. In an interview, the creator remarked that it would never enter his mind to use adults for the children's voices, despite the arduous task of guiding a five-year-old girl through the multiple takes required in a full-length film. Always by indirection, this sincerity makes a great impact. Perhaps I'm just a softy old coot, but I'm choked up even writing this review. This is NOT just another movie about WWII.",

You forget that it's just drawings one after another, and then you see something so breathtaking and you realise why the creators decided to make this an anime. To be honest I was expecting nothing less from studio Ghibli. The story is haunting in its simplicity. They are right to say its one of the best anti-war movies of all time. The creators don't even try to present the then Japanese empire as something magnificent, on the contrary. They give us the raw nature of the human kind and most of all the unspoilt love that can only be found between siblings. I watched the subtitled version of the film. It's truly worth it.

Not only is the imagery gorgeous, but the scenes are composed and arranged with the same care as seen in the best of art-house movies; and the horror of the fire-bombing of Japanese cities (seen by some as sufficiently terrible to make the nuclear option a morally superior alternative) is fully conveyed. In fact, this is such a serious movie (in all senses of that word) that it begs the question: why was it made as an animation at all, and not as a conventional film? Perhaps the answer is that in the flesh, it might have been so sad as to be unwatchable; at the end of the day, this is simply a story about two people who starve to death. Indeed, the film even begins with a (strictly unnecessary) flash-forward, as if the director did not want to betray any hopes we might otherwise have mustered of a happy ending. Raymond Briggs's 'When the Wind Blows' obviously comes to mind, but this film is broader in scope: it's as much about social breakdown as the war itself.

93,6 June 2011,blackmamba99971,10, Heart Wrenching,"This had to be the most powerful movie I have ever seen. A young boy Seita who looks after his younger sister Setsuko during World War two. Set in the time where Japan allies with Germany to bring themselves fortune and fame through war. Yet in a small little village Seita and his family are raided by US and English bombers which sets back his town to the stone age. With both their mother gone from extremely serious injuries, Seita and Setsuko stays with a family friend who seems hell bent on making both of their lives as miserable as possible by making Seita feel guilty for not being more of a man and to aid their family. Seeing as they might becoming a burden, Seita and Setsuko then leave to live on their own, only to realize that finding food and medicine is even tougher than the war itself. This was one of the most tragic and beautiful stories I have watched in a long time. The music was top notch as was the characters who gave a really fine performance whether nasty or not. Setsuko was the real deal, seeing her dwindle to become a malnourished and diseased ridden little girl was more than I could bear, but I could not stop watching through tears. The idea of how war tear people apart is as true today as it was in history. Nobody should have to go through with what Seita and Setsuko went through. Determination was the mainstay for Seita, his ability to give his sister food by bartering or even stealing, is enough to show how far people go to save their own family. And to see others just dismiss or even shuck away the youths in the face of dying is enough to reach out and grab their throats. It's amazing how far people will go with excuses to protect their own interests. And with Seita and Setsuko in such dire straits, I was surprised the old farmer did not relent to sell some food to them. This movie held every aspect of the human mind under extreme circumstances. Wars kill all people, whether bombs drop or not. The children are the most important, and in this film it shows that even children succumb to the drastic red tape which the adults roll out without so much as a conscience. Great film, highly recommended to those who love war stories.",

This is the story of a brother and sister orphaned by the second world war in Japan, who end up having to fend for themselves. Everything here is achieved with excellence. I watched the subtitled version (which I always feel is best) and was really taken aback by the great little film. This film deals with the harsh realities of a civilization under siege and also with Japanese culture superbly and the director here must tack a huge amount of credit.

While it could be argued that the movie could have been live action, I doubt it would have been as good.  For one thing, in 1988, special effects were very expensive (and the pyrotechnics would have been dangerous to the young actors and their stunt doubles) and not as effective (especially if you consider that this is a rather low budget film from Japan).  Also, the two leads are dying slowly from starvation, and several scenes show them as being dangerously skinny.

I was utterly silent, deeply sad, ""devastated"" and brokenhearted when the final credits rolled. I felt both the actual and potential ugliness and beauty of being human all at once.

Though I usually prefer a good action flick to any kind of sentimental rubbish; that tends to be because most movies which try to be sentimental fall short of creating a reaction. This movie creates a reaction, a big reaction. One of the ways I test a movie's greatness is to re-watch it, a lot later. As time passes and the movie sinks in, it loses its power to effect you. I watched this movie in 1998; a month ago I tried to watch it again. I did not make it past the movies opening scene. I do not easily come to tears, but I could not watch this movie a second time, I could not bear that kind of pain. That is level of power this movie evokes, and that is the level of strength the story conveys. There is no way my words can properly express the feelings which this movie creates, do not be afraid because it is in a foreign language or because it is animated, what this movie touches transcends all that.

(ad lib),"Before setting out praising this movie, just a little message to those who (agAIn) ask themselves what the point is of making anime so realistic, since anime is supposed to be used for stuff that can't be done in real film. Well, two replies : a) then anime should be abandoned altogether, because they can pretty much do anything in film by now - ironically, often with special effects that are little more than computer generated anime! b) that remark testifies to, besides an extremely narrow view of what a particular art form can be, a profound lack of respect for anime as a medium equal to plain film. Since, what it's saying is basically ""in specific cases anime is better, but when both art forms can do it, film is always superior"". But there's more. Apparently, none of the folk who put forth that limited view on anime have ever heard of the idea that the more abstract a figure becomes, the easier it becomes to identify with it.

However, it is neither aggressive nor excessively bloody or judgemental in its pursuit to provide a glimpse into the lives of two children affected by the war. I do think it is sad and haunting, it truly is, and its message is powerful - but it doesn't showcase drama, it doesn't rely on brutality and gore, and despite its anti-war moral, it doesn't rub it in your face. The setting of bombs dropping form the sky, war sirens sounding every now and then, houses burning and corpses scattered around the rubbles of former homes creates a bleak and hopeless atmosphere, but the movie doesn't focus on it. It merely portrays the surroundings and doesn't linger on unnecessary violence or gratuitous depictions of gore.

This film was nothing like ""Spirited Away"" or ""Princess Mononoke"". For an animation film, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" surprised me in the style it was portrayed. The atmosphere of this movie was seemingly like the Italian neorealist films of the 1950s, like De Sica's ""Umberto D."", but it also had the precision and care of what was portrayed on the screen like Yasujiro Ozu and his ""Tokyo Story"", ""Floating Weeds"", and his other masterpieces.",

I purchased this movie not knowing anything about it 2 days ago, and sat down to watch it with my 20 year old daughter. I expected good things, but this was something else. The story line has been well documented on this site, so I won't dive into that. Needless to say, it will affect you for days after watching it, no kidding. We are both still sniffling. It's the attention to the subtle detail that makes you identify with the charecters. Everyone knows a toddler like Setsuko, and the quiet strength of Seito. There is a scene where Seito and Setsuko are watching the stars at night (after going to the toilet, no less) and he tells his younger sister about the days before the war. When he looks over, she is asleep. He goes to put his arm around her to cuddle up. I thought the would have panned out on that scene and left it at that for emotional impact. But no, what does the little girl do but throw his arms off her (much like my own toddler would do). The whole movie is like that. The ultimate message about the real casulties of war, the innocents, who suffer and endure events not of their own making, is heartbraking. Buy/rent this movie and be haunted forever.

Some parts literally smash your heart to sorrow. Graphically speaking the movie displays such a breathtaking look. Not just the sceneries and overall style, even minor details like the leaves and debris flying across the scenery in several shots truly resemble the paintings of Hokusai or Hiroshigue (which I happen to be very fond of). The artistic value of the visuals works perfectly in service of the powerful emotional substance explored in this movie, the combination is just perfect.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried a little before its main title even appeared on screen, and a lot after its credits had begun to roll. Frankly, it's one of the most affecting movies I've ever seen. It tells the tale of two orphaned siblings who must survive in extreme poverty following WWII air raids on Japan, primarily focusing on the relationship between the children and the older brother's attempts to properly look after his young sister. Make no mistake: though it's brought to life with stunning 2D animation, this isn't a happy film. It's bleak and harrowing and surprisingly unconcerned with traditional narrative closure. That doesn't mean it isn't brilliant, though. It's a compelling and powerful anti-war tale that's sure to move you on some level. Plus, it occasionally achieves an odd kind of almost ethereal beauty.

But it was definitely one of the most beautiful animated films I've seen also, a film typical of the late 80s anime films by Studio Ghibli. What I liked about this film was the fact that it wasn't fantasy like say, Spirited Away. This was real, based on a true story, based on events that were definitely not just limited to one pair of children during wartime Japan. That's what makes it so heartbreaking: the fact that this is based in reality and that life is cruel and does not always have a happy ending. But the story of Seita and Setsuko is beautifully told and Setsuko is one of the most heartwarming little children I have ever seen in an animated film, she's just that convincing. The music fit the mood perfectly and the voice acting was top-notch: if you get the chance to watch this, watch it in the original Japanese. On a side note, this film made me appreciate the things I have, the fact that I have food to eat everyday and the fact that I have a place to stay and am not caught in some war.

However, while it might not have won audiences over then due to the heavy subject matter, it did go on to be seen as a landmark in both Japanese cinema and filmmaking all together.

166,1 March 2021,EdwardtheBlackPrince,8, Heartwarming,"Grave of the Fireflies is the third studio Ghibli film The first one was directed by Isao Takahata. When people think of anime they usually think of over-the-top light-hearted family pictures. Grave of the fireflies is hands-down one of the most serious and realistic anime films out there. Almost all anime films have some sort of lighthearted fun and comedic charm to them this is a film that takes it so seriously as if you were watching a war film. It's grounded in reality set in the events of real-life firebombing events of Kobe of ww2. You see through the eyes of siblings a teenager named Seita and his little sister Setsuko seeing their final days of the war and all the struggles that they face. You also see the impact of the people of Kobe and the Horrid impact others suffer. You got people running to bomb shelters, there are people burnt by explosions, mass graveyards. People starving can't find resources like food and water. In the long run, you want to see these two be all right you want to see them survive you want them to be happy together. Grave of the fireflies is a classic and a must-see for anyone who not only loves anime but as well as war films. When people think of Studio Ghibli they usually always reference Hayao Miyazaki However this is one occasion where Isao Takahata made a more impactful film than Miyazaki.",

The story line is told with painstaking detail, and that's what makes this movie so poignant, you understand the characters, through the little details, so well, that you cannot help but feel that what you perceive is what these characters are feeling. I literally cried throughout 15 of the films' 90 minute runtime, not just a tear in the eye ""oh that's too bad,"" but sobbing ""OH MY GOD WHY, WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?!"" I remember a comment kept running through my head, ""this is not fair, it's not fair it had to happen to them, it's not their fault, dammit it's not their fault."" This film is a representation of how good dramatic anime can be, if used correctly. There are no kung fu fights, or mysterious dragons, only reality. Such horrible wonderful reality that one will find that they cannot think about war in the same way as they did before. I know that this was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It also might just be the greatest film ever. See it, don't walk, run, you must see this film.",
170,22 May 2020,TheHonestCritic,10," I've seen a lot of sad movies and shows in my life (MOST OF THEM NOT BY CHOICE). But, none of them have made me cry though. Does this film actually make me cry?","""Grave of the Fireflies"" (1988), I have never heard of this movie until I was in college. One day, when I had some free time, I was watching videos on YouTube and clicked on it accidentally. It was the original full-length Japanese version with English subtitles. When I watched it, I was hooked at the very first line of narration. ""September 21st, 1945, that was the night I died."" My jaw dropped, and I thought to myself: ""what?! How does that work?"" Then, a few seconds later, I realized that it was Seita's spirit talking. I knew right from the beginning that it was going to be a powerful and moving war film, but it was so much more than that. This movie looks at the aspect of war in such a unique way. You think that it's going to be depicted as showing the violence of war, and the fighting. It does show that, but on a much more personal level. Usually, when I watch sad scenes in movies or TV shows I don't cry, because I know that it's fictional. I usually get chills or goosebumps while watching sad things in movies and shows, sometimes I get choked up, but I have never cried though. But, I was amazed that when I first watched ""Grave of the Fireflies"" to find that I was moved very closely to the point of tears. That's really saying something, because it takes a lot to make me cry. Props to the writers of this movie! This is, without a doubt, the saddest movie I've seen in my life so far. After my first viewing, I was curious to see what other people thought of it. Turns out, everyone else cries watching it! I thought: ""whew, glad to know that everyone felt the same way as me!"" Now, I wasn't crying, but I came close though. I did feel my eyes water a little. I'm glad I was alone, I don't want anyone to see me almost cry! There are two versions of this film, the Japanese version and the English dubbed version. The voice acting in the original Japanese version is so much better. The English version is fine, but it doesn't leave the same impact as the Japanese version with English subtitles. This movie is beautifully animated, the backgrounds look like paintings and the animation style gives it a lot of realism. Finally, the soundtrack is well composed and definitely sets the tone for the film. ""Grave of the Fireflies"" should be required viewing for anyone taking War and Conflict classes in high school. It really shows you the reality of war and the results of war, which is certainly an achievement. But, make sure that you have some tissues on standby, because this film is really that sad and powerful. After you watch this movie, you will never be the same again. Ironically, it's the best movie that I never want to see again! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. This movie should be on the list of essential films to see, I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't already! Regardless of your age, it's definitely an important movie to check out. Remember to watch the original Japanese version with English subtitles. That one will leave a much stronger impact on you. As I've mentioned before, I've seen a lot of sad movies and shows and have not cried and most of them are live-action films. But, the irony is that this animated film shows more emotion than any live-action movie!",

It is a movie so powerful that it is hard not to get emotionally choked up at the end of the movie (speaking through experience). It tells the story of a teenage boy along with his five year old sister made homeless by the bombings during the World War. They become separated from their mother during an air raid only to find out her dead a few moments later. Their father is a naval officer serving for the country in hostile waters. With no other place to go Setsuko (5 year old girl) under the loving care of her brother Seita, settles in their aunt's house. As time passes their aunt complains about Seita not doing anything to earn food, and starts treating them cruelly. Eventually the two siblings find themselves a cave to reside despite its poor conditions. Here he does whatever he can to feed himself and his sister, while acting as a father figure to her. This desperation to live; fabulously brought to screen will move you beyond anything imaginable. One of the greatest gifts this film has is its ability to show the emotionally draining scenes in an effective manner. We first get to see the playful, cute and cuddly Sestuko having fun only to see her lying helplessly due to starvation. ",

184,12 June 2008,Galcian,3, A sure candidate for the most overrated animated work ever.,"The word ""masterpiece"" is thrown around quite a bit. That word should be reserved so that it has merit, but its consistent overuse has reduced the power of what the word once meant. The criterion for earning such a branding should be quite difficult to attain. In the world of anime, nothing has been called a masterpiece as fervently as Grave of the Fireflies. The usually war-torn world of critics is in almost unanimous agreement that the film is ""powerful"", ""tragic"", and a ""masterpiece"". Even Roger Ebert thinks so. All these people couldn't possibly be wrong, could they? I mean, Roger Ebert is famous! Grave of the Fireflies is the story of Seita and Setsuko, a pair of children who find themselves bewildered by the chaos of World War II. Fire bombings have claimed their mother and forced them out of their home, and now they must migrate from one place to another. For a time, they live with their aunt, who really isn't a half bad person, but is painted by the protagonist (through the writing, which feels as though it was written by a resentful teenager) to be a horrible, oppressive witch. Because Seita is so indolent and does nothing but eat, his aunt eventually gives him the choice to either start working or leave.",

It should be rated pg13 because it is much to sad for little kids. I watched Grave of the Fireflies about a year ago. My brother saw it on the internet, and after I did. I thought it was going to be violent, but that wasn't the case. It was beautiful and tear jerking. Before I saw Grave of the Fireflies I always thought A Walk to Remember or Titanic was the saddest movie. These movies are NOTHING compared to Grave of the Fireflies. Setsuko was so real. I have never seen any four year old in movies act like a real four year old like her. It brought me to tears to see her die. But then again, Grave of the Fireflies is also sort of happy. At the beginning and the end you see that both Seita and Setsuko are together again, and there is no more suffering. Grave of the Fireflies shows what a war could do to people.

This gem of a film taught him more than he ever learned in school about this piece of history, and it was probably told in a more accurate and heartfelt manner than any history book could have presented it. We watched it on the Turner Classic Movies Channel. I was dreading watching it with my son that evening (he is an anime fan), but Robert Osbourne (the host of TCM) said to stay tuned to this movie and really give it a chance even if you were not a Japanamation/anime fan. I was absolutely floored, as was my son. It really touched both of us, and it is difficult to reach teenagers in this day and age. It made tears come to our eyes, and we still talk about this movie rather often. This film is a masterpiece and could be used to teach the horrors of war and the innocent victims who have no political vote or voice at all.

The sytle of animation is like other beautifully Japanese animated films such as Tonari No Totoro, Mononoke Hime and Kurenai no buta (aka Porco Rosso). This style of anime was what drew me to watch it but I was totally unprepared for the 'Schindler's List'-type atmosphere that this movie portrays. The storyline of a brother taking care of his baby sister during the war drew me in so entirely that for many days afterwards I found myself lying wide awake thinking of the message that this movie is clearly trying to send - war destroys.

The way most of the kind of action you would expect in a war movie has been scaled of and replaced by plausible characters and beautiful and powerful scenery, always created so that it seems as if a painter were creating a new masterpiece in every cell, it makes the protagonists lives seem more real than just about any other war depiction I have seen this far. It is quite special in another aspect as well, as it depicts japanese civilians during the second world war I can honestly say that this is the first such film I have seen, a situation I think many can identify with. The fact that the film does not demonise any human beings, not even the enemy, which can only be seen as anonymous bombplanes high up in the sky, but just tells a tragic and timeless story about a boy and his sister and their struggle to survive in wartimes is actually what makes this film a true masterpiece.

208,4 October 2020,stefstars,10," War, what is it good for ? Absolutely nothing.","The meaning of the film can change depending on the viewer. However I think we can all agree that war is a horrible act where, really, at the end of the day, nobody wins. This movie takes place after the bombs have been dropped in Japan during WWII and the Japanese army surrenders. Despite the war coming to an end, people continue to suffer and toxic nationalism continues to exist. The movie shows how this nationalism brings out the worst in people, a prime example being the siblings' aunt. She's more concerned with their supporting the war effort rather than feeding them out of pure humanity. We see how the brother is forced to steal since no one is willing to help him and his sister as everyone's trying their hardest to get by. We see how both he and his sister's health decline due to lack of food, water and proper shelter. Everything that's happened to them is a result of toxic nationalism. I've read that some have interpreted the movie as pro-war, but I have a hard time understanding this point of view. Two children die because of something they had absolutely nothing to do with. They were two kids who just wanted to live their lives normally and played no part in executing the mess their country was in. Not sure how that says ""pro war.""",

248,4 August 2007,arthera09,7," great movie, but not hyped too much for me","Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this movie, but as a whole I just did not get the emotional impact that many other describe. Maybe because I am cold hearted robot or maybe because I was watching during an unbearable heat wave, but it just did not hit me that hard. There is no real criticism for the movie, but I am not going to go out and tell everyone about the movie. A large part of the emotional impact comes from being familiar with the culture and the whole idea of having to rebuild a life after it being destroyed, but it did not hit me. I would say Seita was an aggravating character and it seems as if there must have been plenty more options than just living in the caves. Other than that a few of my few favorite points is that they do not hide the fact that this was going to be a sad movie right from the beginning and the fact that it began the way it did made it tragic. It was very slow, but the slowness added to the slow decay of the children. One of my favorite parts was the most devastating thing for Seita was when he finds out that Japan ""the greatest empire in the world"" was defeated and surrendered unconditionally that he finally breaks down. Even when his sister dies he does not show the emotion which shows the Japanesse issue in having to rebuild what was once thought a superior society to conform to something that they must have hated. The fire bombings of Japan is one of the most tragic events of our world's history. The horror of it was lessened a bit, but it was still potent. A very well done movie, but because everyone had told me that this was a great movie it disappointed me a little bit (but it might also be because I am a robot).",

250,15 September 2006,MacBalthus,9, The frame for frame best anti-war-movie I've seen so far,"The Ghibli-studios truly deserve the reputation they have. ""Spirited Away"" won the Oscar, ""Princess Mononoke"" was the most successful Japanese picture (and possibly still is, I'm not sure) and the movie I comment here really is the best anti-war-movie I've seen. And I've seen not too few of them. The helplessly overrated ""Saving Private Ryan"", the excellent ""The big red One"" and of course ""Apocalypse Now Redux"", ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". But why is ""Hotaru no haka"" or ""The last fireflies"", who it's called here, the best in my view? I find it portraits a totally different attribute of war than for example ""the Deerhunter"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"", where the loss is humanity and the souls of the soldiers. This movie here shows with it's cartoon way of telling the horror war always brings to the civilians. It sure shows only the very top of the iceberg but in this context, I find this is an appropriate action. I personally got truly cured from every thought about joining any army and going to any war by this movie. The biggest quality of this excellent anime lays in it's rough and authentic tragedy. It's not even the death of the little girl, but the lack of sense in it, that manufactures most of the horror. I admit, I shed a few tears. And so did anyone I gave the DVD to watch.

It is one the single greatest movie I have ever seen, but it is just so emotional and depressing to the point that I never want to see it again. It is so incredibly well crafted. The characters are so well realized. This movie also brought me my least favorite person I have seen on screen, the aunt. This aunt is such a terrible person and wanted to punch her so badly. But she is still an amazing character. She is supposed to be this terrible guardian figure because she wants these children to be useful, which is completely in line with how most people probably thought back then. I have never cried watching a movie, this one is no different, but it was so close. I just don't cry a lot. But most people did which makes complete sense. Everything is so realistic, more realistic than almost all movies. The characters don't go through arcs, but the world simply attacks them and kills them. The message and portrayal of war is so realistic and depressing. I cannot stress how this movie has effected me.

256,27 February 2006,matchettja,9, Heartrending and poignant,"Just when I think I have seen the best of what Studio Ghibili has to offer, I find another gem that matches or exceeds all that I've seen before. This film about two war orphans in Japan at the end of WWII succeeds at many levels, not the least of which is the ability to make us care deeply about the two lovely main characters. It's a touching story, showing the reality of life in a war torn country. People are essentially kind, but when they must struggle just to find food to put on the table, it is difficult to think about the needs of others. Cracks in the system appear and some fall through. Like the fireflies of the title, a human life may shine brightly but all too briefly. It is a testament to the people of Japan that although they suffered much from the American bombing raids that took place regularly during the last days of the war, little resentment or bitterness lingers. But we shouldn't forget the suffering, and this beeautiful, heartrending film is a poignant reminder of that.",
257,9 February 2016,bscrivener-50810,10, The greatest film you wont want to watch twice!,"Grave of the Fireflies is a 1988 Japanese anime drama/war film directed by Isao Takahata and tells the story of Japan during WWII, focusing on the devastating effects that war leaves on the civilian populations. The story focuses on a brother and sister and the hardships they face throughout the war and their struggle to survive. Studio Ghibli is often known for there more mature and adult approach to animation movies-but nothing could prepare me for the heart-wrenching, emotional and truly tragic story of Seita and Setsuko. Grave of the Fireflies touched my heart in a way no other film has, with its gorgeous animation, astounding soundtrack and powerful narrative. Each scene is crafted to perfection and the characters (although many of them unlikable) really push the theme of tragedy, abandonment and ignorance towards the desperate and innocent people. We really feel and begin to connect with Seita and Setsuko right from the start and saddened for their state and the consequences war leaves on the innocents. The scenes featuring Seita and Setsuko are so beautiful, the moments they share together feel so real and loving, they almost feel like members of your own family. and while the film is extremely heart-breaking, the moments of joy feel so magic. Grave of the Fireflies is gripping, emotional, heart-breaking, tragic, beautiful,magical, astonishing and is the best anti-war film ever made. Grave of the Fireflies really is Ghibli's crowning gem and quite possibly the greatest film you wont want to watch twice. Never the less Grave of the Firelies absolutely deserves a 10/10- Quite possibly my favourite film of all time.",

Throughout the film they lose everything and it's up to the young boy to take care of his sister when their mother died and their aunt didn't want them to stay any longer.

The comparison to a film set post-apocalypse is somewhat fitting here, since Studio Ghibli's 1988 effort often has the feel that the world is coming to an end; that there isn't much hope left and what the central characters have is the best they'll get lest they be dead. What IS coming to an end, however, is not the world itself but The Second World War ‚Äì something which, if you're in the likes of Berlin; Paris; Hiroshima; Tokyo, or anywhere else synonymous with the conflict, is going to be a lot less pleasant than if you're situated in the United States, or even parts of Great Britain. As a result, towns are flattened; people are fending for themselves; food is hard to come by and to escape the threat of further dangers; one appears to have to flee to the countryside: this is a post-apocalyptic drama if ever I saw one.",

Although you can guess from the first few minutes how the film will end, you resist it and don't want to believe it until the last second. Since we know that the two will not survive, even the beautiful moments between Seita and Setsuko are extremely tragic. The soundtrack and the scenery perfectly support the sad atmosphere.

That is the simplicity and beauty of cel animation, I would even prefer this to Hayao Miyazaki's MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, released in the same year, not because of its technique, but of how Takahata leavens a lachrymose text with adroit considerations, especially those concerning Setsuko, her declining process is depicted with such insuperable felicity (a fruit drop can leave you feel pulverized), everything can be tactlessly fell into mawkishness or ickiness, but GRAVES OF THE FIREFLIES lends its feet victoriously in the end.""",

The story revolves around Seita and his younger sister Setsuko, as we see them trying to survive.
If this film proves anything it is that animation is no just suited to tell kids tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy. Japanse animation or ""anime"" is a style and sometimes you have to look past the style of a movie to appreciate a beautiful and heartbreaking story. 
But what this movie really excels at is showing the results of war and also the victims of war as we see our two main characters Seita and Setsuko dealing with the situation there in.

310,12 March 2021,anirguha-60-851453,9, An unparalleled surreal experience,"I came across the name of this movie while reading the book on Great Movies by Roger Ebert. When I watched the movie the experience was like a beautiful dream. Has there been any more lyrical with hard realism portrayed before? This can very easily claim its position amongst the greatest movies ever presented to the likes of All Quiet on the Western Front or Pather Panchali (Song of the Road). The fact that it has not really amazes me. Is it because it's an anime? Or perhaps it's from a country which has not been known beyond Kurosawa, Ozu or Mizoguchi or likes of them?
The beauty of Hora no haka does not lie in the fact that it shows realism. Nor in that it shows the effects of war on common man and thus humane in nature. Nor because it's simplicity as if viewing through the POV of two kids - one in his early teens and his sister who is barely perhaps 5 years old. It's about all of these told in a most poetic way.
The director Isao Takahata's masterstroke is to create an anime instead of a feature film. He perhaps couldn't have depicted the wide range of emotions of the characters, particularly the two children in a better way had it been anything else. The anime has provided the director the complete liberty to portray the feelings in a most telling way, stripped off completely from the physical presence of actors of sets or even the nature itself which can be sometimes distracting.
I have stopped short of giving it a perfect score perhaps because of this only. But through this I have been part of the director's and story teller's imagination, shared the emotions with its players, lamented at their losses, hardships and agony, enthralled by the beauty and openness of the nature; absorbed within the sweetness of its tune.
Few other films have achieved this and few will be able to provide such an immersive and beautiful experience.",

It's simply amazing how Seita tries his best to survive with his little sister during hard times, how happy he tried to be even though war was at hand, and how the heart-breaking ending made this film an emotional masterpiece.",

This is of course an anime by Studio Ghibli, but it is not by Hayao Miyazaki as many wrongfully think, but the writer and director here was Isao Takahata and he was slightly over 50 when he shot this film. He died in 2018 and with his final career effort from 2013, he still managed to get in at the Oscars, which was also a bit of a career tribute you can surely say. Good for him though. But even without such an achievement, his career and body of work would be far from forgotten. This film here is comfortably in the top100, top50 even at this point, highest-rated films on the biggest movie website imdb. I would not agree with such a gigantic amount of praise, but I will get to that a little later. The co-writer is Akiyuki Nosaka and he is also no longer with us. No huge surprise as he was already another five years older than Takahata when this got made. And in general of course too. I cannot really say too much about the voice cast here, to be frank I cannot say anything, but from what I heard and as far as I can be a judge there, they did a fine job. I watched the original-language version with German subtitles tonight as this film was shown at a movie theater again on the occasion of an Asian film series/retrospective. The room was really, really packed, way fuller than with other Asian film that were shown as part of this series, but it is no huge surprise. People adore anime right now and older films generally attract nice audiences still. I hope this encourages people to keep showing old films like this one here, old anime films in particular.",

357,27 December 2022,ericliuanish,1, Pretentious tear jerker,"After reading the review section I have to disagree with the majority opinion that this movie is a masterpiece. It is very hard for me to sympathize with the boy as almost every decision he makes is poor, even for a boy of his young age. He could've stayed with the aunt who can provide him with food and shelter but choose not to because he couldn't put up with her hassling. Sure she has a cruel mouth but it is the lives of him and his sister at stake here so he should've known better and put up with it. The aunt's distaste towards the boy is entirely justifiable yet the movie portrays her as a villain. She took two orphans in despite limited food supplies(which already shows kindness) and got angry when one of them is a clearly able-bodied teenager who decide to not work during these difficult times doing nothing but to play with his sister all day while taking the food&care she provides for granted. The boy's character also doesn't match with his actions. He seems to be very resilient and mature for his age despite coming from a well off family but his action suggests some heavy main character syndrome. He asks for the charity of strangers and when that doesn't work out he resorts to stealing, even laughing maniacally when the town nearby is bombed because that provided him with more opportunity to steal. Why didn't he even attempt to go out and look for work during his stay at the aunt's house? Why didn't he offer his labor to the farmer in exchange for food? It is not because he needs to take care of his sister because he clearly felt comfortable leaving her alone while he go out stealing. These are some of the questions that filmmakers failed to answer while they are too focused on trying to buy a cheap cry from their audience.",

I think it would be a mistake to call this an anti-war film. Certainly it will pluck some chords in you as to the stupidity and cruelty of war. However, I think this is a film mostly about love, selfless devotion and atonement. The elderly brother who himself is basically also a child, takes the care of his sister into his own hands. He makes some poor decisions. These decisions are very natural given that he is just a naive child, and moreover the proud, somewhat spoiled child of a war officer. The story unfolds very realistically, you just know that everything will spiral down for the lonely children in an unforgiving world, but that the love between them will last.",

And if it is close to the norm for that time period, why would I want to watch it. It just seems to trying to pile one horrible occurrence after another. The acting is adequate and the artwork and animation is fine. The main problem is the writing. I don't mind a dark ending, but when there is no hope anywhere in the story, there's no reason to continue watching.

Generally speaking, Japanese anime is a collection of boring violence and/or sex, with about as much intellectual content as a Tom and Jerry comic book. These two films, however, rise above the mainstream of the genre. Grave of the Fireflies has a more somber message than Spirited Away, but an important message, nevertheless. The effect of war on children is always a tragic subject for any film, and has been done several times in the past; mostly revealing life among the ruins in Germany, Italy and other countries affected by WW2. This time, we get to see the Japanese carnage among the civilian population; an area seldom explored by Hollywood producers. A good film for children to see as well.",

369,9 April 2020,krational66,3, disappointment,"Grave of the fireflies was such a disappointment to me.
At the beginning, I ran into a big question mark, the air raid alarm has sounded, other families are terrified like a dog to run to the shelter, how the mother of two children still so calmly command the child buried soft? It would make sense to say this was for the future, but why didn't she go to the shelter? Why didn't she take her daughter and make it easier for her son to run for his life? Yes, she's a sick woman, and she may not be able to carry a child, but that brings us back to the original question, why didn't she leave for the shelter earlier? Is it not safe, and easy to lead the daughter, so that the son more relaxed? I really want to break my head. Her death, caused by her unwise action, was the beginning of the tragedy.
The second question is, are the siblings cute? I saw nothing of their loveliness, only two unlikable children of a high officer's family, well-fed, unreasonable, and unsociable. Sister is still small, don't say what, brother? With a sister living in aunt home, it gave people a lot of trouble in itself - and, of course, their aunt seemed inclined to selling off their stuff, but I think this is excusable, after all, they are free to live, and wartime life is generally nervous - and he seems to be sleeping in addition to eat, is to accompany my sister to play, both don't want to go out to work to earn money, also not for aunt do household chores, and dissatisfaction with aunt in its sensitive, not much skill, also kill big temper. Someone said it was their aunt's fault. It was her fault. I don't think so. Admittedly, aunt let them drink soup, but to her husband and children eat rice, but we can't be ignored is that she also drink soup, eat rice crust and in brush pot, suggesting that their hard times, as not doing any work doesn't do housework, drink soup for granted, and when they cook, even not in time to wash dishes, or the aunt wash in the middle of the night, and it is important to note that the largest fire, aunt is happened after washing the dishes, it's understandable to angry words, or impulse. Not only that, but we still can push through some subtle aspects of thought, at the time of the brother and sister's mother is alive, that is to say, their life is very comfortable, they did not give any relatives to help, as can be seen from the two points, one is their aunt to see the boy in surprise after digging in the ruins of the items, the second is boy doesn't know any relatives address. That is to say, while they live a pampered life, there is no help or allowance for relatives, even close relatives like aunts.
The third is, does the brother really love his sister? The question was not directed at emotion, but at reason. He loved his sister, there was no doubt about it, but was he rational? In the aunt's home, although to look at the eyes, but after all can live with day, moreover, although there is a reaction to this kind of repression sister, but still only in the dislike level, after all, she is a child, so this grievance is basically borne by the brother, that is to say, he can endure, no problem. But he chose not to bear, resolutely left with his sister. There's nothing wrong with leaving, but what happens after? All we saw was that he kept changing his mother's things for food and drink, and never thought of doing anything to make a living. He waited until his sister was seriously ill, and then went up to the mountain to cut wood to sell. The boy, who looked like a man, was in fact quite useless, as could be seen from his reaction to the news of his father's death. Why he had never thought of earning his own living, and why he seemed to muddle along, because he had pinned his hopes on his father's return from the war! He had never thought of living on his own; it was the fault of the well-to-do, the proud. We should see that when they moved out, aunt is actually very contradictory, and more inclined to let them stay, which proves that she is not a completely ruthless person, if I, I would not like such a young gentleman and young lady living in my house. If the brother really for the sake of the sister, should suffer some injustice, stay in aunt's home, try to behave better, let aunt home satisfaction. We should see that this family is not exclusive to them, uncle seems to be indispensable, cousin or very sympathetic to them.
All in all, I don't think the film is very good, and it doesn't move me",

My friend suggest me to watch this animated film.It is the best animated film I have ever seen in my entire life .Grave of Fireflies is a powerful dramatic film that it forces a rethinking of animation. It is the most profoundly human animated film i have ever seen. It tells a simple survival story of two children named Seita and Setsuko from the port city Kobe. Their father is serving in the Japanese navy and their mother is a bomb victim. An aunt takes them in but she is cruel about the need to feed them. So Seita finds a hillside cave where they can live. He has some money and can buy food but soon there is no food to buy. Day by day his sister grows weaker. But there are some great moments when the children catch fireflies and use them to illuminate their cave. the next day Seita finds his little sister carefully burying the dead insects as she imagines her mother was buried and that was when I knew I was watching something special.The undeniable death of Setsuko would be enough to make anyone cry. At the end of the film the spirits of Seita and Setsuko are seen no longer raggedy and etiolated but healthy and well dressed happy as they sit together surrounding by fireflies together they look down on the modern day city of Kobe . Because it is animated and from Japan Grave of Fireflies ha been little seen. When anime fans say how good the film is, nobody takes them seriously . Though it is a cartoon and the kids have eyes saucers but it belongs on any list of The Greatest War Films ever made. Some movies are such singular achievements that they deserve to be seen at least once by everyone who consider himself or herself to be a lover of film. Grave of The Fireflies falls into the exclusive category. The production is so emotionally challenging that one time may be all that can be endured. Despite the artistry and care invested in the film's crafting. The result is as close to traumatic as a movie can claim to be watching it a second time is in some ways more difficult than the first.The power of Takahata's vision is such that the initial reaction never fades. Graves of The Fireflies does not need to be revisited to leave an indelible mark of memory. Actually this movie can not be described in 500 words .

Gut wrenching emotion. Beautiful animation. Just an overall amazing film and one of the best that I've seen from the 80's. This film follows two siblings, Seito and Setsuko, as they try to survive in the city of Kobe. Nonstop air raids and food shortages cloud the air which the two attempt to overcome. Relying solely on each other, the film shows us a harsh reality that many Japanese citizens faced during the final moments of World War II, and as such, provides us with one of the most powerfully made films of all time. Wow. 4.5 out of 5.",

It is a very nice story about brother and sister that have lost everything including their parents, considering war time it's hard for someone to judge the other but some of the actions are completely out of order, but they should have been better settled and taken care of because you should help other in trouble. Finally they move to aunt's and things just get worse, war is still on, she is just being too strong on them if you realize they lost everything and are trying to survive but such acts of hatred and judgment by your own kin is so frustrating and undeniably not appropriate. After all when they left it was also a bad thing to decide that they should live in some shelter and there is no doubt it also made a huge impact on their lives at the end. Great story telling and plot development with a very nice dialogue but some of the very actions done and partially decision are just bad and should not happen. 3/4",

I did find while watching the movie that the child's constant crying did become annoying after a while. Some people are more easily influenced by sentimentality than others, but the sob elements in Grave of the Fireflies seem too excessive to be realistic. The child behaves too much like a child, almost as if the maker wanted to emphasize that the victim was a child to artificially heighten emotions.

Let me say that as a spur of the moment purchase this is one of my best. After watching the movie it is hard to look at the boy and girl on the box without feeling for their tragic situation. This movie knows its purpose and sticks to it without any cheesy tear jerker shots of the atomic bomb.  It sticks right with the two children and lets you be apart of their world.

What I felt while I watch this movie was strong involvement itself. As many other Japanese movies, the pace of this one is seems to be controlled rather slow to make a kind of calm and meditating impression. That made me very relaxed, and I could sip the story scene by scene. The story ,supported by a classic plot of tragedy, was so touching I could see a male person keeping himself from weeping, and I was almost dropping tears. That sweet character Setsko ,who would remind anybody of their own little sister or daughter, was banging my heart to see a human being among all those -real- things in the war. And her guardian Seita would easily make an audience identify himself with him, I believe. That should be the cause of involvement and delivers the heart-breaking sorrow.",

427,25 April 2020,w-71474,8, Art should not be entangled by politics,"How could this film be moved around the world by one or two insults? Before you say that others are not, look at yourself first. Is there someone else's meticulous effort to make animation seriously? At present, domestic practitioners are either quick success or speculation, China 's original animation has not been well developed, similar to the classics such as ""Na Zao Nahai"", ""Da Nao Tian Gong"", ""Little Tadpole Finding Mom"", ""Huluwa"" Excellent animation works with rich Chinese cultural colors have long ceased to exist. Instead, they have been lost in the clumsy imitation of Europe, America, Japan and South Korea. There are too many ""folk politicians"" who like to talk about ideal ambitions and national sentiments in China. Abuse and unreasonable anger have already become synonymous with some blind ""radical ethnic xenophobia"". In doing so, they again demonstrated slogans on the streets of Tokyo. Is the difference between the Japanese right wing?
Besides, it is certainly guilty to launch aggression in Japan, but the people are innocent. If those who have no reason to be angry were also born on that island country and grew up in that environment and received such education, I do n't believe they will not become like Japan. Like people. Just like these two lovely and pitiful characters, there are people who say this, say that they are ""ghosts"", they really don't even have the minimum compassion of being human, how is it different from beasts?
Look at that box, both Jews and a group of German tourists visiting the Israel Jewish Holocaust Memorial Hall can have a good time. Why can't some people think peacefully? ! War is terrible, but the incomprehension between people is the biggest obstacle in the development of this world.",
428,5 September 2020,lordbaldrick,5, He's not really the hero he thinks he is,I find it incredibly hard to buy in the logic that this is anti-war because Setsuko died a horrible death. None of the other Japanese in the film including the brother himself were malnourished to the point of no return. Setsuko died because of her brothers foolishness and stubbornness. No amount of melodrama is going to change that reality.,

The fact that I am writing this itself speaks a lot. I haven't bawled so hard after losing my granny. The end was just tragically beautiful. Many scenes were tear jerkers but what got me completely invested was when Setsuko asks her brother holding the dead fireflies that why do good things have to die so soon. The metaphor was daunting and just could not be ignored.
I cried so much at 12am that I couldn't control myself.
Thank you for this brilliant masterpiece that I don't think I can dare to watch without crying. This has just become my favourite animated movie of all times.

The story was simplistic, it basically just follows one character's actions, and his irresponsibility - while understandable since he is a child - makes it a little difficult to empathize with him. It's not a big story about the devastation in Japan, it's mostly just a tale of a child who can't afford any food. There were nice elements as other people say but the story just didn't bite.",

However, they are just not deep enough to worth spending time on. Surprisingly, I watched this film twice. Just like Roger Ebert's review about how this movie was made, it leaves the room for the audience to process without telling everything out front. I always believe graphic scenes only applied necessarily to tell stories. A lot of films use them to exploit audience. This is definitely not the one. My parents grew up in Taiwan under Japanese ruling in WWII. I think the experiences of their childhood changed their views of lives profoundly. The scare and shortage of materials threatened their survival. So they are not all kind and nice to others. Competitions are common among people and even in families. I may say majorities of their generation are dysfunctional. Even when the environments present no threats to their livelihood anymore, they still could not abandon their intuitions. This movie contrived the impacts of wars truly. It should be seen by leaders in those aggression regimes. They might think twice to wage wars against others.",

Although it is a lesser known film from Studio Ghibli and is released as double feature in parallel with My Neighbor Totoro (1988), this film is undeniably beautiful and powerful. This film can be interpreted in various ways but it certainly is able to leave audiences speechless and/or tear their eyes out.

But it still got to me, which is a credit to the film. The depiction of the dead mother is unsettling, and the story of the brother and sister is heartbreaking. The scene that really got me was when Setsuko died, and the images of her life are shown. Particularly the part where it shows her playing by herself when her brother was out finding food. The movie is so effective is saddens me just writing this. I admit that this movie brought me to tears. The music and the images compliment each other beautifully. Unfortunately, the whole storyline seemed a bit rushed and unfinished, without much justification given for certain actions. For example, the story of the aunt isn't really told. The movie was still great, but could have been enhanced with a more detailed storyline.",

He comes from a background that I'm sure those from the Philippines will relate to and decides that life in the big city will give his family a change of pace. He instead finds that the city is full of betrayal and lies with the people he meets.

456,28 October 2013,MuatazAbulKhair,9, Tragedy,"Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli has churned out consistently high- quality 2D animation in the last few decades. Grave of the Fireflies is a lesser-known Studio Ghibli production. As per any Studio Ghibli film, the animation is top-notch 2D, lovingly hand-drawn and the story is simple but relevant. Fireflies tells the story of a brother and sister who are orphaned after their village is bombed during WW2. We follow them as they face their struggles; from living with an unsympathising relative to making a home for themselves in a couple of crevices on the river bank. As the days go by things get more and more desperate for the siblings, as food gets scarce and illnesses start to take their toll. What I like about Ghibli's movies is that they're astonishingly brave; there's no comfort zone here, nothing's sugar-coated. The final scene tugs at the heart- strings and will stay with you for a long long time.",

The lining colour and backdrop really made this movie great along with the storyline. Though I don't much like the Voice acting that much.

You will believe or not even now also my eyes are wet because I am re-watching the scenes and re-hearing the background scores.You may feel that ""this girl is overreacting!!"" But believe me if you watch this you too will feel the same I am. May be a little more or less.For the first time I rated a movie 10 in IMDb.

The story of a boy and his young sister trying to survive during Japan in second World War, with their parents gone and air raids constant.

465,7 October 2003,elu5iv3,10, Stunning masterpiece,"I really don't know how to preface my impressions of this movie and how it affected me. This is an animated feature, but with none of the kitsch that Hollywood has inundated the genre with. The story deals with the plight of a young boy and his little sister when they are orphaned in wartime Japan. It's a simple narrative with very clear-cut characters, no multiple layers or gray shades operating here. The clean hand-drawn animation, which eschews flashiness for a consistent simplicity, gives immaculate credibility to the story. The characters are rendered beautifully with gestures and expressions that articulate their emotions and reactions in the most consummate manner - this is flawless work. The voice-work especially for the little girl Setsuko is so believable it's heartbreaking. The story, if I'd heard it on a third-person basis, would have probably struck me as melodramatic, but seeing it unfold - I suppose it caught me in one of those fragile moods ¬ñ I was in uncontrollable tears at so many moments in the film. I don't want to go into explicit description for fear of spoiling it for those who haven't seen the movie, but suffice to say that the film-makers don't try to force happy circumstances. Even now, when I think of Setsuko and recall the tone of voice in her various moods, it wets my eyes and I have to keep my throat down.",

Good Animation is life exagerated and condensed into one great art form. And a film like Grave Of The Fireflies, is one example of animation doing what film could never ever do. Sure the scenes could easily have been shot as live action, this isn't Akira. In fact as a feature film, it would cost next to nothing to make, but it just wouldn't have the ability to even come close to capturing the dream-like beauty and utter emotion of it..",

But this turned out to be a boon as the original voice actors are possibly the only people who could do justice to the voices of the innocent children going through this tough period of time. The actors especially that of Setsuko is just amazing. The movie makes a lasting impression on the viewer which shows the Second World War from a perspective that is very rarely, if at all, shown in western movies. The animation is executed fantastically well, right down to the details. The movie makes you laugh and makes you cry with the protagonists. The characters are very endearing and show a great bond of love and affection. They not only love but understand each other. The young girl (Setsuko) understands their situation and behaves very maturely with some outbursts of childlike silliness that she is entitled to. This title made me realize the magnitude of civilian casualty that the war saw which most western movies fail to show because they either focus on the soldiers or the Jews in concentration camps in Germany. It makes it visually obvious that the life of an innocent human being was also not spared. The one line that Seita narrates near the end in which he states that his sister 'never woke up again' is very shocking and tear- jerking but the stone-faced emotion with which he says it adds a layer of despair into it, of a boy who has lost his entire family.",

Hostility matter from the beginning the animation up to final scenes shown in the first show make more complicated for the viewer.
So that the viewer is somewhat hopeful during the show, but finding a rescue point can be as likely as possible in the real battle.
Air strikes are arranged wildly, leaving nothing to the natural and human geography of people in that area except the ashes, and more interestingly, after the changing process, life continues with its full potential.
There are not very sharp reactions to the death of human beings, as if the reality of the war was accepted from the very beginning, even if it happened near it.
The show is based on the survival of sister and her brother, the bitter realities of a full fledged war cast a shadow over their fate and slowly drown them in the swamp, of simple life-threatening challenges.
Tragedy
Means the decline of these two in the face of the daily routine after the death of their mother and news of father death.
Question;
Are you ready to uphold your pride to continue living, living and livelihood?
If you are in a situation where you have to steal to save someone's life from starvation, do you do this?
Will your pride be challenged with a hard test (accepting the responsibility of a younger sister)?
Questions, though seem to be that grave of the fireflies animation give simple answers in the first place and tragic in the second place.

The sound mixing in this movie is incredible. You can truly sense the rumbling and where everything is coming from. It's like being in a IMAX cinema.
It was quite interesting to see the different culture. There was a lot of stuff in our culture that would be considered wrong or at least weird for a brother and his sister to do, but in the Japanese culture it's ok.
Also it's interesting to see that side of the war. ""History is through the eyes of the winner"" is a key theme so it pays off as we'd never see that from American or English studios except satire.
The movie had the the problem that nothing was developed enough and plot points just came out of nowhere.
Key themes are just abandoned and forgotten half way through and the emotional crux of the first act was quickly brushed aside for another idea.
The emotional peak of the film is hindered because of this exact reason. It tried to make you feel it despite having not developed it enough to have felt anything. Forest Gump is how this is done well, you cry because Jenny means so much to him and it's developed so well she means something to us.
The movie also held onto this crux for far too long, so it shoukd have ended 6 minutes earlier, after the montage of her running around.
Interesting from a cultural standpoint but not a great movie.",

It is unique in the sense that it is not an account of a soldier in the battlefield but how two kids are affected by the war when they lose their parents. Setsuko is my favourite part of this, her innocence is in complete constrast of her surroundings where there are food shortages, houses are burnt and most importantly her mother died. The moment she dies, tears came into my eyes. Her death is set pretty well and slowly paced to give the essential emotional feel of the scene. The animation was fantastic and beautiful.

Though not as well known as the Atomic events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the death and destruction caused by the incendiary devices against Japan's major cities was actually far greater.

It's a great movie so anyone who hasn't seen it whose a fan of anime or studio Ghibli I suggest you watch this amazing movie.,

It's the sadiest Japan animation movie I've ever seen, too sad to see it second time! I'd seen it in dormitory when I was a college student with my roommates, and many details I forgot. I remembered the little brother and sister were bullied by  their only relative, their selfish aunt, if the ending could include she'd got deserved something bad, it would be better. She's so wicked for she steal their only one property, her sister's valuable Kimono, then saying something to force them leave their house so she didn't need to raise her sister's children. Bad blood! Seita is too young to know he must endure her unfriendly attitude, just 13 year old,he didn't think of life became very hard after he try to stand on own two feet. Some of you mentioned he had 3000yen? Oh my god! 3000 yen not only to compare USD 3000, it can't even compare NTD 3000!",

Surprising for a cynical old misanthrope such as myself. The character of the little girl is incredibly endearing and believable. While I was watching it, I wondered why such a gifted film-maker would tug at the audience's heartstrings in such an unrelenting, manipulative way. Then it became obvious - beneath the surface is a fierce, white-hot hatred of the politicians and military leaders who are willing to destroy lives in the name of ideals or ""national interest"". The absurdity of Japanese goals during WWII is made clear by the final shot. There is also some interesting implied criticism of the brother, who I feel was a symbol for well-meaning leaders who may have sound tactics but misguided strategies. If the welfare of others is in your hands, you'd better be not only well-meaning and honest, but smart. Maybe listen to people who know what they're talking about once in a while, instead of just going it alone.",

It is based on the 1967 semi-autobiographical short story Hotaru no haka by Akiyuki Nosaka.The film stars Tsutomu Tatsumi, Ayano Shiraishi, Yoshiko Shinohara and Akemi Yamaguchi. Set in the city of Kobe, Japan, the film tells the story of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko, and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Second World War. The film was critically acclaimed. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times considered it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his ""Great Movies"" list. Two live-action remakes of Grave of the Fireflies were made, one in 2005 and one in 2008. It is commonly described as an anti-war film, but this interpretation has been denied by the director.",

At first, you yourself, still small, look forward to showing the long-awaited cartoon and hoping for a painted one - you like puppets less. But you, already an adult, watch cartoons familiar from childhood or modern - animated - with your child, and everyone also plunges into the world of fairy tales, where good will certainly overcome evil. Probably the worst cartoon in childhood was Prometheus, in which the main character was slandered by an eagle. I could not look at it and honestly closed my eyes with my hands.

And it could have been done that way with very few special effects. But it wasn't, and that's exactly what I find wrong with it. I feel that this was a horrible, horrible choice of material for an animated feature. Shouldn't an animated feature give us what can't be done in live action as movies like ""Spirted Away"", old Disney features, and anything by Pixar so incredibly do?

555,6 April 2022,disownx,9, I really enjoyed it,"It is impossible to watch GotF and not feel sad at the end. This film is so beautiful, and yet so heart-breaking, that it has to be one of the greatest animated movies in history. Disney is good and all, but the death of Mufasa & Bambi's mother and Snow White's funeral, while pretty saddening, are not as gut-wrenching and endearing as the masterpiece that is Grave. Set in Kobe, Japan at the end of World War II, the story tells of a teenage boy (Seita) and his 4 year-old sister (Setsuko) as they struggle to survive after their mother was killed in an air raid. A story such as this is undoubtedly going to ultimately turn out tragic, and it does. Not wishing to spoil anything, however, I shall not go into details, but to see Seita taking care of Setsuko, something which becomes increasingly difficult, does nothing more than make you feel for both of them. This is no typical Hollywood romantic love story; this is a story of love between a boy and his sister, which makes one feel for them even more. The animation, the music (notably the song ""Home Sweet Home""), everything is as it should be. Nothing more to be expected from the great director Isao Takahata. If you do not like tragic films, then maybe this isn't for you. If that is not the case, then watch it. The experience is nothing short of beautiful.",

Any movie that could bring about such a profound change in me will forever be in the upper echelons in my favorite movie collection. Kudos to every single person involved in making the movie.

Many war films inevitably depict the macabre account of three key aspects that are contradicted in the process of it's moral conclusion, those of course being survival, death and loss. This film's notion lucidly conveys the domino affect war causes and that the bullets go beyond the front line and pierce's the purity and innocence of youth. That being said Grave of the fireflies is a unique viewing, it's one of the few war films that observes the situation rather than criticize it.Rarely do you see soldiers or battles no the viewer is subjected to the darker spectrum of war such as famine and disease. The two protagonists Seita and Setsuko are a visage of the impact World War 2 has left on their society. In addition to this they are both characters you can sympathize with, Seita is very aware of his surroundings, however he remains optimistic and only periodically he is burdened with mental anguish, Setsuko on the other hand is a noble infant who's only catharsis is the death of their mother. The film is constructed similarly to a three point arc which brings me to my earlier statement the initiation being death, the median which is survival and the denouement being loss. A meticulously crafted film that equally measures the dream like qualities of humanity and the desecration of all things natural.",

It doesn't receive the publicity and recognition it deserves. This movie is very, very, depressing, and the storyline is more or less just a succession of events without any rising or falling action. The animation is simple with many still image shots (and no computer animation). The score is perfect for the tone of the movie. I could go on about what was great in this movie, but instead, i advise you to feel the effects yourself after watching it. I'll never forget the last scene where Seita holds his sleeping sister under the red glow and looks to the camera--reminding us that this story from the grave of the fireflies isn't just a movie to entertain us. It is just one example of the many TRUE tragedies that innocent families went through in Japan during WWII. This movie is the ""Schindler's List"" of animation.",

In a deplorable situation, abandoned by all. But as the relative pointed out, the boy could have tried to find any kind of work to afford things to eat. Before the strike in his neighborhood, he had worked at the local factory, after-all. He kept on waiting for his father, lamenting his sad state of affairs, but in effect, not doing anything about it. Also, the voice of Setsuko really started to get on my nerves about twenty minutes into the movie. Oh, boohoo. The boy was so obviously in denial about everything, the death of his mother, no contact from his mother, his sick sister. I got quickly sick of this movie. To me, the stubbornness and denial of the boy character represented the Japanese Empire's attitude towards reality before, during and maybe even after the war. To that end, I felt no sympathy for the children.",
598,12 June 2006,fijihiji,2, So Disappointing,"Text: Taken place in WWII, this movie shows what life was like for two kids in Japan. The tragic story plays through Seita and Setsuko's struggles as they try to survive. The movie basically gives away the ending in the very beginning, and despite that, the movie still gets to your emotional strings. I have watched Grave of the Fireflies a number of three times, and each time it succeeded in making me cry. Definitely if not the saddest then one of Ghibli's saddest pieces. There are so many moments to make you cry, and man do they do it right. I cried my eyes out during every watch. Many animated movies try to portray happy endings (Disney--not saying those movies are bad though), but this one comes out flat and showing you the whole truth in what it was actually like for people. No strings pulled. It isn't afraid to seriously tug at your heartstrings after hitting you over and over again over a gradual buildup that has a clear ending from the very start. I haven't seen a ton of anime movies, but besides A Silent Voice, this one if my favorite. It's probably one of my favorite animated movies in general. If you want a movie that will make you cry during a struggle to survive, then you've got the Titanic. If you want a movie that is under an hour and a half that will still make you cry (with more moments to do so than Titanic in my mind), then you've got Grave of the Fireflies. Either way, Grave of the Fireflies is a true gem in the world of animation that dives deep into the losses and struggles and the overall cost of war.

I thought i was ready for this movie since I watched war movies like Valkyrie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,and Life is Beautiful. However this one made me the most emotional since I knew what was going to happen. The part where the main character was burning her sister was real painful to watch.

The animation is beautiful, and the score is one of the best I've heard from any film. To other fans of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli who have not seen this film, as someone who has seen many Ghibli films, this is by far the best one I've seen. It evokes powerful emotions in me every time I watch it, thanks in part to the melancholic yet ironically hopeful score. The visuals are stunning and the voice acting on the subtitled version is fantastic. I would not consider this film to be anything less than perfection, it's realism is unlike anything Studio Ghibli is known for, and that's one of the main reasons why it stands out as not just the best film released by such a phenomenal animation studio, but as one of the best war films ever released as well. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is beautiful, and the story is engaging and heartbreaking. The animation is detailed and layered, the backgrounds are absolutely stunning.

What this movie truly wants to show is that the civilians, the children's that die in a war, were real people with real story's, forgotten and buried next to piles of nameless corpses. The opening scene already introduces us to this truth. To Seita the can of fruit drops, that remains one of the core elements throughout the movie, is incredibly valuable. In the first/final scene of the movie it contains the ashes of his beloved sister. We know he put the ashes of her into it because he know how much his sister loved fruit drops.

There are many moments which move you to tears, and there are also moments of hope and happiness which provide brief lapses from the sorrow that permeates a war-torn world. Characters are designed to speak to the audience on an emotional level, as they struggle to survive the mayday of WWII. Though the war has already taken away everything such as family and security, the two characters revel in the joy of being alive. They scrap up any morsel of hope left as they go on an escapade through the war zones, looking for food and a roof to survive the days of restless violence. This movie is fastidious in elucidating the elements that make us human, the desire to live and the desire to love, and it does so in a tumultuous backdrop of WWII.

You will see a realistic depiction of what life was like in japan in the climax of WW2, but more importantly, you will see something in this movie that you never get in your standard war movies, a genre of cinema usually full of action packed films with stories of glorious heroism, good prevailing against evil etc.. In this movie you get to see what war time is really like, not from the eyes of soldiers who bravely fight and die to defend their homelands and their ideals, but from the viewpoint of helpless civilians, specifically two innocent children, caught in the middle of one of the worst situations of human history, in a cruel, cold, hopeless reality where countless innocent, defenseless women and children are left to fend for themselves, brutally massacred by Napalm bombardments (by the good guys mind you) in a world where nobody cares about them and nobody ever comes to their aid. And this is why this movie is so important- because it depicts war as what it truly is - a true hell, in all its tragic horror and twisted pointlessness. 
You will be overwhelmed by the unbelievably sad story line, you WILL cry your eyes out like a child, you will never want to see this movie ever again afterwards, but you will take to heart an extremely important lesson about war that you will never ever forget for as long as you live.
If somehow every person on the planet saw this film our world would have been a much better place to live in.

669,4 September 2002,ShawnM,10," A very sad, insightful and cautionary film on the suffering caused by war.",'Grave of the Fireflies' is an unforgettable masterpiece (and an award-winning film at the International Children's Film Festival) which tells the story of two Japanese children whose parents have died in the war. It is a stunning portrait of the struggle they have to face just to stay alive in the face of apathy shown to them by their relatives and countrymen. This hauntingly poetic story is delivered with breath-taking visuals and a riveting narration that most animation films don't even come close to achieving. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is an emotional experience so powerful that it leaves you reeling in shock as you witness the true cost of war.,

It's a Japanese movie, so many aspects that most people are used to is to watch a movie without knowing how it is going to end. Looking for a big climax, and, of course, after all the suffering that the characters are going to go through a happy ending. But, this movie is about the scars that the war left for a proud and defeated country, and more tragically, to the people of this country, and therefore it's unlikely that it ends well for our characters. And the main character of the movie is going to leave this message pretty clear right at the start of this movie informing the viewer that he died, alone in the platform of a train station , from what it seems from starvation, and in shame by the people that pass by him.",

Japan, had been cruel in the war, not people. When anyone talks in favour of war, they indirectly put forth their commarades in mortal peril.

Just think about your family work very hard and there are 2 persons stay in your house, cutting paper and reading stupid things (and eating a lot of rice). Who not gonna get angry? And they said that is their rice too. What the heck? That is your rice but who give you a accommodation without charging and cocking for you guys? Why ur guys are so cunning?

The studio is uncompromising in its decision to never spell things out for the audience too much. The pride of Seita, for example, and the tragedy in his refusal to return to his Aunt, leading to the demise of Satsuko. There's no big fanfare surrounding this, just a simple narrative achieved through straightforward dialogue and action. It doesn't sugarcoat Seita's decision, and therefore does not justify it. Like many pieces of art, there is no conscious design upon the audience, and that allows one to sympathise with all characters involved. Themes (such as war) are fully three-dimensional: the honour, the spectacle, and the crushing despair following Japan's unconditional surrender are all given equal weighting. ",

726,7 February 2021,avinashyeluri,10, No to war ..great film .. what a film,"Grave of the fireflies; one of Miyazaki's oldest films tells the tragic story of two siblings struggling through the reality of how harsh war is. In animation you typically see the stretching of reality to make things possible that would not be in a live action, a perfect example of this is the beginning of Princess Mononoke with the shape shifting like infesting worms taking over the boar. In grave of the fireflies you see almost nothing of this sort, just reality, it doesn't use animation to depict many unique things. The cons of this film for me had to do with filler and pacing. In other Miyazaki films you see a perfect example of how using this properly can help you form a deeper connection with these characters. Grave of the fireflies which is roughly 1hr and 30 mins in an odd way feels much longer than that of a film like spirited away. In this film there is no protagonist really, it is just 1hr and 30mins of us watching a quite depressing downfall of two new orphans due to the war struggling to survive and eventually dying. I think it illustrates well the horrors of war into a digestible story but that is really the only special part about this film. It does not have the unique characters of Howl's moving castle, the masterful use motivation that Princess Mononoke demonstrates, the character development or music of Spirited Away. In short I like this film, but personally it does not share the magic which made other Studio Ghibli films so unique.",

It is absolutely heart-wrenching, and every politician should see this film before declaring war against any country.

During the second viewing of this film I invited my little brother to come watch the film with me. While watching the film I began to realize that the relationship between Seito & Setsuko was in fact very similar to my relationship with my younger sibling. I do think the film shows us a strong anti-war feeling when we're done viewing it, but it doesn't feel like it's trying to push its beliefs down our throats. During the films final act while we see flashbacks of what Setsuko was doing while Seito was away us already knowing about her demise, I began to look over at my younger brother. He was not really feeling the emotional touch that I felt (mostly because he was fiddling with my watch the entire movie). I looked over at him playing with my watch & I saw how he like many other children are basically another Setsuko & for a child to be in the position she was it just put me to tears. I stayed there until the end crying into a pillow while my brother looked on. Dark at times but beautiful in the moments we least expect.

At that time animation was not so improve like this days though I don't find any scene which give me a bad experience about the animation. The story was written by Akiyuki Naosaka and it was perfectly picturised by Takahata.

If seita was not full of pride his sister would not have died. if his aunt had been more understanding, seen seita as being stubborn then she should not have continued to hassle him and maybe both of them would have not died. the fact that the farmers had so much food and when seita said his sister needed the food they should have given him some. the saddest part of the film i found was when the little girl made food out of mud and ate it, that brought tears to my eyes.",

This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seita and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II. The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore.

844,9 April 2013,somdatta1907,10, A must watch movie,Grave of the Fireflies is set in Japan during World War II. The story is about two orphaned siblings Seita age 14 and Setsuko age 4 who try to survive through the harsh realities of war. This is not an anti-war movie where America is seen as the villain. For me it became so much more than a World War II film set in Japan. It could have been set anywhere. The story focuses on the plight of the two children in a war-time setting. I have to say that this was one of the best war movies I have ever watched. I also think it's the best animated movie from Studio Ghibli and it definitely ranks as one of my favourite Studio Ghibli animated movies (all-time favourite is Spirited Away). It irks me when people write off animation as silly cartoons like it's nothing but child's play.

The film left me wanting so desperately much for first the mother of the protagonists, and then the child protagonists themselves to some how survive that terrible war, and the aftermath, and wishing them help at many a time during its run. The viewer in my case was moved to great compassion, empathy, and sympathy for both of the characters who were trapped in a grim situation that neither of them had much ability to change.
There are several parts of the film that directly pull at the most vecieral heart strings of any parent. It left me many times with the primal desire to aid the children dispite it being a work of fiction - The masterly combination of a great story, compelling characters,
and a good musical score work together to allow it to tap directly into the heart, and leave the viewer aching to be able to help them some how. The film was amazingly done, and brought me to tears at least a few times by its' end. This was a truly great animated movie",

It depicts war from a point of view strikingly different from western film; there are no heroes or villains, no triumph or defeat, no good guys or bad guys. There is only reality, and a grim reality at that. Two ordinary people tragically forced to live through the terror of a war they never asked for. Seita and Setsuko are not extraordinary. Their story is not one of grand adventure with a happy ending. They are just children dealing with very real tragedy and very real trauma in a very real way. From the opening narrative to the final credits, Grave of the Firefiles drags you on a powerful and emotional roller coaster of a journey and will not stop until the last tear falls.

After a bombing separates them from their parents, they are on their own. I remember that a box of hard candies played a bit of symbolism in the story. To me, it represented peace, happiness, and hope. The title is from when Satsuko makes a grave for dead fireflies while they are on their own. What really broke my heart was how much Seita loves his sister Satsuko, yet she dies first, leaving him along and grief stricken. By the end of the movie, both Seita and Satsuko have passed, and the movie ends with a soldier finding Seita's body, and he finds the tin can of candies. I loved this movie, besides the sadness.

861,29 September 2016,flowerteacup,10, Beautifully heartbreaking,"I seen Grave of the Fireflies early this year and i can't get the movie off my mind.I guess the reason i can't forget about it the way the movie unfolds before your eyes.You know in the first minute of the movie that the characters died.The really heartbreaking thing is the way Seita's and Setsuko's spirits have to relive their last few months of their life.The Happy scenes really are misleading into giving viewers false hope that maybe just maybe they will pull through.The beach,fruitdrop,firefly and bath scenes really can't prepare you for the last 12 minutes of the movie.",

864,24 June 2021,subscribephoenix,10, Short explained.,"The fireflies, the fires, the planes that fly emitting fires. Love, death, destruction and tears. Rarely does a movie make me weep for humankind and its lack of kindness too. As one reviewer said, one needs to decompress for months after seeing this film but must see it again to renew compassion and understading.",
865,19 December 2018,genettahanby,10," Haunting, heartfelt, hurting but ever so beautiful","A masterpiece to cry over indeed. I didn't expect it to be one of the most connecting movie for me as it explored that part of my heart which I hadn't opened for quite a time I guess. It shows the affects of war, effects on economy eventually affecting people's life. It is just not a movie but a story that tells a lot , the love between siblings and lot of stuffs. Hope you guys enjoy it and cherish it like I did.",
866,19 May 2022,sanketgiri-71237,8, not saddest but connects deeply to make you cry,I hadn't heard anything about the film before I got it. I have 9 studio ghibli films and assumed it would along the same lines as those but it isn't. It was very emotional and moving unlike most world war two films it was sad but you can image it being a true story as families were split up and destroyed through the 2nd world war. I was crying when the credits rolled my eyes were leaking uncontrollably I wasn't sobbing or crying but just unable to stop my eyes from tearing. I'm so glad I watch it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I found it so damn sad! But at the same time I would love to heard my friends comments about it to see if they cried too.,
867,12 August 2007,emmaburtonmoore,10," sad, depressing and beautiful.","I think the story that this animated tells, and the way that it tells it is something that many other movies could learn from. Some of it is devastating and raw but the story is clear, and filled with opportunities to be emotionally engaged. I highly recommend this movie to anyone of the ages 13 and up. While it is animated it certainly is a bit to raw for younger audiences. I believe that older audiences will appreciate the story and messages hidden within it much more as well.",
868,3 November 2017,tatakaievil,10, Absolutely love this movie,"Grave of the Fireflies is a powerful, tear-jerking animated film that conveys the feelings and hardships of the Japanese at the end of World War II, as well as the selfishness of children, through the story of two siblings. The story revolves around Seita, who is fourteen and his younger sister Setsuko, who is four. The movie begins with Seita dying of starvation in a train station after Japan surrenders. There is a flashback to the last year of Seita's life, beginning with hundreds of American fire bombers fly over his neighborhood. Seita and Setsuko bury key supplies before fleeing their home, which they must do because of their father, like most men at the time, was at war, and their mother had a heart condition and had to get a head start to get to the bomb shelter on time. As they begin to evacuate, bomber planes begin dropping bomblets intended to start fires, and soon the neighborhood is destroyed. While the two are unharmed, their mother suffers severe burns and soon dies. The two go to live with their aunt because their house has been burned to the ground. The two retrieve the supplies that they buried and give them to their aunt. While first glad to have them because she is under the impression that military and navy families get benefits (Seita and Setsuko's father was a captain in the navy) and she is under the impression that their mother is still alive, but the aunt soon begins to complain that the two siblings are not doing their shared to put good food on the table, and the two eventually leave and move to abandoned bomb shelter where they steal to in an attempt to survive. They aren't able to steal enough though, and Setsuko slowly dies due to malnutrition. Setia cremated her and wanders around, essentially waiting to die, eventually ending up at the train station where he dies, as shown in the beginning of the movie. The movie ends with Seita and Setsuko's spirits going back into their memories of normal childhood before the war. The film offers a unique view of the war by portraying those that lived during the war as real human beings that have fears rather than as perfect heroes to avoid alienating younger generations and help them sympathize for the generation that experienced the war. For example, there are scenes that the siblings play that bear a resemblance to regular children because even though there is a full-blown war going on, children are still children. This movie also shows how children were sort of expected to grow up faster during the war. There is an especially touching scene from which the film gets its name, that reminds the viewer that these are just children. The night that they leave their aunt's home and move into an abandoned bomb shelter, Seita and Setsuko catch fireflies and put them in a jar for light. When they wake up the next morning, all the fireflies have died. Setsuko is greatly affected by this, while making a grave for them Setsuko cries, asking why the fireflies and her mother had to die. This scene is touching, because a young girl, who shouldn't have to know this much about death and hardship has already faced so much. The same sentiment about having children grow up faster could also be a critique of children, saying that they are stubborn and only care about themselves. For example, Seita decided to run away from their aunt (who fed them and gave them a place to live after their mother died) because he argued with his aunt when he complained about the quality of food they were eating as opposed to the aunt's daughter and the other man at the house that worked to help in the war effort, and the aunt said that they did nothing to help the country, so why should they deserve better food? These were difficult times, and if he really hated the food, Seita could have gotten a job like most older children of the time, such as the aunt's daughter and because schools were burned down, it's not like he had something better to do. If he really didn't want to work, he could have made up with his aunt by apologizing and accepting the food that maybe didn't taste as good, but would still keep them alive. To conclude, Grave of the Fireflies is a movie worth watching because of its touching and realistic view of everyday life in Japan at the end of the war, and the hardships that young children had to deal with.",

870,25 June 2020,mjust-36607,10, .,"When I first heard of Grave of the Fireflies I was interested in the movie to see what it was like for the innocent civilians of Japan and especially for the children during the American bombings of Japan. I feel that in order for all of us to kinder people we need to learn from both sides of the war. Here in America we hear about the attack on Pearl of Harbor, but what do the average American know about what happened over in Japan when we did the bombing? Nothing. This I believe is one of the best description of what they went through, my heart goes out to the innocent of Japan. I brought up what they went through to a friend and he was as cold as dry ice towards the innocent victims of the Japan people. I hope if there is one lesson that we can learn from this is, even if the Nation is hostile to another we must learn sympathy towards them or we all will end up like those children. DEAD.",

873,13 August 2018,facebook-64052,10, Incredibly hard to watch but necessary- beautiful & emotional,People who think one life is less valuable than the other life should be made to see this movie and even then if they are not convinced that everyone's life is equally important and personal ego isn't worth taking other's life.,

875,18 July 2020,tjaytarun,6, Very traumatic and depressing,"This movie touches your heart in such a way, that moving on from it almost seems impossible. The story shows how the minds of children tries to overcome their troubles and how the actions you make out of love for your famile, can have devastating consequences. There are alot of stories about how love can move mountains, but not many that shows how immovable a mountain really is. I have never shed more tears at the end of a movie, and probably never will. This is in my mind a masterpiece and a movie i will never forget and with almost utter certainty, ill never watch it again. My heart could not bear it.",
