0,13 August 2011,ferguson-6,7, Minny Don't Burn Chicken,"Greetings again from the darkness. The film is based on the controversial best selling novel by Kathryn Stockett. It was controversial because it is the story of Jim Crow-era maids written by a white woman. Yes, the book is actually the fictionalized story of a white woman getting black maids to discuss their lives as maids for white folks. Rather than get into some politically correct dissertation on the book, movie or story, I will only comment on the film itself ... this very entertaining movie that also manages to deliver a timeless message.",/
1,1 November 2012,JamesHitchcock,8," Well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama","There have been a number of films about the Deep South during the Civil Rights era, mostly (""Mississippi Burning"" and ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" being examples) concentrating on the political struggle for equality. ""The Help"" is a recent film which brings a slightly different approach to this period, concentrating on the relationship between well-to-do white Southerners and their black maids. ",r

3,4 February 2012,planktonrules,8, Some really nice acting here....,"While ""The Help"" has received TONS of great press and a ton of SAG and other awards, I am also aware that there is some controversy concerning the film. Some people have felt that the film was a bit paternalistic--as it might be interpreted as yet another story of a rich, enlightened white lady going out to help all the downtrodden black folk. I am just not sure if I could see this or not--especially as the black women in the film end up showing LOTS of strength during the course of the film. BUT, I am also a white guy--and it's not fair for me to automatically brand the film one way or another. Just be aware that there are a few who resent the idea of this film.",v

5,4 September 2011,littlemartinarocena,7, Disney's Help,"Lovely performances makes this far too clean and neat story, not merely palatable but enjoyable. We know by now that the plight of the ""colored"" in the South wasn't that clean cut or gentle in any way or shape. Here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal in the wonderful face of Viola Davis. But, it all remains in the mild margins of the real story. Entertaining yes but I couldn't forget documentaries of the period or ""The Long Walk Home"" with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in ""The Help"" too and she's very funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. The bitchy, almost evil light. She's better here than she's ever been. Emma Stone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbingly recognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt the film was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that's were its weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it.",e
6,23 October 2011,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: The Help,"The Help is one of the many films that's set in the 60s that deals with themes like prejudice and racism involving segregation amongst the Whites and the African Americans in Jackson, Mississippi, but having the very same themes also being relevant in society today even here in Singapore especially, with recent talk and focus on the issue of domestic help and our attitudes toward household maids that many employ for various reasons, who assist in looking after the children and the elderly, as well as to keep home while the rest of the adults are neck deep in economic pursuits. While racism is generally kept under control here, there are niggling incidents that pop up every now and then, so clearly we're not off the hook and there will always be individuals who choose intolerance.",w
7,13 August 2011,facebook-124-955845,9," A Must See, Oscar Worthy film","Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn't around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed ""chick flick"" it would be this one. In spite of that, I've heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I'm happy to say that I'm glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go. ",/

12,29 April 2013,claudio_carvalho,9, Unforgettable Movie about a Forgettable Time,"In Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, the aspirant writer Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has just graduated and returns home after finding a job writing in a futile newspaper column in the local newspaper. When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) is gone. ",1
13,13 April 2019,blrnani,7, A very nice film about a shameful subject,"We have seen and heard a lot about individual cases of terrible racial injustices. What makes this film different, and precious, is the way it shows the way good people were terribly hurt in a 1,001 little ways, every day of their lives - not only by a system designed to keep them as second-class citizens every bit as nasty as apartheid, but by the way others who considered themselves good people enforced that system and behaved towards fellow members of society who were making an important contribution to that society.
I don't know how it is possible for white people in the USA not to watch films like this without squirming in their seats, not from guilt - for guilt is not something one inherits, nor is it automatically collective - but from the discomfort of seeing how badly people can treat one another, based entirely on the colour of their skin (or any of the myriad other silly little ways that are used to divide us as a society - how can any reasonable person believe such distinctions reflect a person's true worth?).",9
14,7 September 2011,Turfseer,3," Anachronistic, melodramatic take on discrimination against civil rights era domestic workers","'The Help' is a well-meaning attempt to educate the film going public about the civil rights era in the deep South through the perspective of the relationship between black maids and their white female employers.  Author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the book on which the film is based, does well in reminding us that the black 'help' not only had to endure the threat of violence as a result of the encroaching backlash from white racists upset over a new black militancy in southern communities, but also had to deal with a multiplicity of indignities on the drab domestic front, including being forced to use separate bathrooms in the homes of their white female employers.  Not only does Hilly Holbrook (the film's principal 'villain') enforce this rule in her own home and influences her immediate neighbors to follow suit, but lobbies local politicians in order to have her racist initiative be codified into law.",2

16,18 January 2019,tabuno,9, A Movie That Helps To Expose The Racial Divide That Yet Remains,"14 August 2011. The unintentional and revealing shock of this movie isn't how the trailers and previews misled the audience as to the nature of this movie, but that the marketing arm and distributor felt that it was necessary (perhaps rightly so) to depict the movie more as primarily a comedy rather than a drama in the first place. Fifty years after this period piece takes place, the irony is that the emotional drama and power of this movie arises for its ""contemporary"" audience from the likelihood that we can be shocked by this movie at all and its ability to push the audience's racial button after all this time. Like the hidden embarrassment of sexual products on commercial television, this movie seems to have dared to expose the dirty laundry in a balanced drama, lightened with elements of humor.",0

18,27 December 2011,Rob-O-Cop,2," Cartoon caricatures trivialize in black and white,","This movie wasn't badly made, it's just bad that it was made. In it every character is a cliché cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken. If this is how America learns its history (and judging by the reviews where many have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of hope and struggle????), then no wonder the western world is in trouble. Is it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome oppression in racist 60s America is centered on a privileged white woman on the road to New York success? Marginalized yet again it seems. This movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it crossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and offensive. And shockingly many people seem to not know the difference.",?

21,3 February 2020,Benjamin-M-Weilert,9, Proving there's a little more hope in the world.,"At first, I didn't give this film a second thought, and I didn't have much motivation to see it. When the Nominations for Best Picture came out, and this was on the list, I decided to give it a watch.
I had a saying while I lived in Alabama, ""At least there's Mississippi."" What I meant by this saying was that even if your state gets a bad rap, there's always a state that's worse. This film highlights that fact by showing us what Mississippi was like around the civil rights movement. I spent most of the movie just confused that people could be that hostile and ignorant toward their fellow human beings, but by the end, I saw that bright piece of victory. It's not a happy ending, per sé, just one that makes you feel like perhaps there's a little hope in the world. Overall, I can see why it was nominated for Best Picture, and I would not be sad if it beat out some of the other films I'm rooting for.",f
22,23 December 2011,Lejink,3, So help me...,"My wife had recently read the source novel and was most keen to see this movie adaptation, plus I have a keen interest in the US Civil Rights movement and was likewise keen to see it. Perhaps it helps to be an American to appreciate some of the nuances a bit better, but I basically found this a sentimentalised and overly patronising story, with as much resonance as an episode of ""The Waltons"" or ""Little House On The Prairie"". The basic idea of the young college girl writing up her town-life experience and causing controversy as she does so was used before in ""Peyton Place"", that historical but much decorated cinematic piece of soap opera, which for me is about the level the film achieves.",_

24,15 September 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6," Very successful and captivating, but something's missing","""The Help"" is an American 2.5-hour film from 4 years ago written and directed by Tate Taylor. He did not get that much awards attention, but still this film was one of the big players during awards season 2015, especially for Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer, who won an Oscar for it, and Viola Davis who came very close as well. The core topic here is racial equality in the years and decades when it was the biggest issue in America. We follow the lives of a couple Black housemaids from the perspective of Emma Stone's character, who writes a bock on the women's lives. There is one main antagonist played by Bryce Dallas Howard, a racist young woman, and it's a bit of shame that she did not receive real awards attention just like Stone, whose own family and relationship with men plays a crucial role in here as well.",t

26,19 June 2014,hermeoine12,10, Brilliant !,"This movie will hold a special glue to anyone who has been a Gone With The Wind fan , for the rest it just might simulate them to revisit those history lessons . The film is brilliantly cast , there being not a single dull moment. The film revolves around three very different women who form an unlikely friendship in their quest for a common goal. It is much more then just being about the state of events in the 1950s at the South .Its a portrayal of a waning tradition that still grips the peninsula even after a century of the Civil War which was fought to abolish the exact same custom. It raises serious issues - demarcation of people based on skin color , making another human being walk in incessant rain rather than allowing her(it?) to use one's own bathroom , makes us reflect that we still aren't very far along the vicious prejudice. The movie also touches upon how the untarnished mind of a child is capable to love the same person he would grow up to walk all over on, of how society can be a venomous influence in conditioning the brain on so much discrimination. In the end it also hints that even after being subjected to centuries of venom , the heart still has the capability to love, that there is still hope for all of us.",_
27,19 June 2014,TheMovieSnob247,9, This was an incredibly moving film,Three very courageous women decide to tell the unique story of what it's like to be a black female helper taking care of white children set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement and the rampant bigotry of the time. I thought this film was very moving throughout; a particular scene that comes to mind is when a helper is betrayed after a life long service to a family. It's the most powerful scene I saw in a film in 2011 and my heart just sunk as I watched it. ,u
28,2 February 2020,wittkecmission,10, A dramedy that's extremely hard to make well,"How do you turn a serious book about African-American maids living in 1960's Mississippi into a comedy-drama film? With great care. It's very difficult, but not impossible, and by a miracle, The Help does exactly that. It mixes comedy and drama so well that sometimes it's hard to distinguish whether it's trying to be funny or serious or both at the same time. I can still hear the roar of laughter from the audience, and myself, during the hilarious ""eat my sh*t"" scene. This is one of the few movies I've seen with every single aspect of film-making perfect. The screenplay is perfect, the acting is perfect, the direction is perfect, the sets are perfect, the cinematography is perfect, the editing is perfect, the costumes are perfect, and, finally, the CASTING could not be better. Movies like this don't come around often. Because there is nothing in this movie that I would improve, I'm giving it a 10/10.",r
29,14 January 2012,lesdroits,4, Hold on just a minute - cartoon city,"Well, I grew up during this period in the south and we always had a black maid. We loved our black maid Veronica (first black person I'd ever seen and I thought she was made of my favorite stuff -- chocolate), and our family corresponded with her (and sent her money) for years after we moved. Other families had black maids and no one ever, ever, ever, ever, ever talked about them or treated them the way they are in this film (haven't read the book) but instead with value and respect, though within the confines of the segregationist times.

30,17 October 2011,CineCritic2517,6, Cute but forgettable,"The Help, based on the novel of the same title, deals with the rise of the black help in the 60's in the overall quest for equality between the races and more specifically the equality of civil liberties. The film plays out as a neat 3-acter with barely any surprises along the way. For a film dealing with these sorts of issues it is surprisingly black and white and straightforward. The soundtrack is nothing more than sugarcoating for the overly pretty sceneries and often annoys. Some roughness to the film seems sorely lacking, it almost plays out like a cartoon. Fans of the film should also want to check out the 2007 film 'The Great Debaters' (Denzel Washington, Forrest Whitaker) with a comparable premise which suffers from the same, in my opinion, weaknesses.",

The light, fluffy, glossy look and woeful acting (from a good female ensemble cast) strips away the suffering and hardship reducing the feeling for the characters (which should be it's focus). Instead of staying truly serious to the subject matter this is flipped into an ugly light-hearted entertainment journey (trying to create the Helps versus the nasty white housewives).",

35,11 December 2011,zetes,5, Poo pie,"This film actually starts off well, and it has some powerful moments in its runtime, but, holy crap, does it take an awful turn near its end. And it's too bad, too, because the actors give it their best. It's really hard to believe the original novel was so popular, and that anyone with half a brain would sign on to such a ridiculous script. But what do I know? It was a huge hit and it'll be nominated for a bunch of Oscars. Emma Stone stars as a Southern woman in the '60s who has far more sympathy for the African Americans around her than her friends or family. She herself loved her own maid and caretaker, and she wants to write a book about how the help feels about their employers. This is a very dangerous project. Whites have no desire to know what their servants think about them. In fact, as far as they're concerned, they have no right to express those feelings. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play the two maids who are brave enough to work with Stone. Davis has been quite celebrated for this role, and, it's true, she's tremendous in the film. No doubt she'll win an Oscar for it, and it'll be deserved. The plot point that ruins the film, though, well, spoilers follow, but you'll want to hear this if you plan on seeing it, to prepare yourself: Spencer, at one point, gets so mad at her employer (a deliciously evil Bryce Dallas Howard) that she bakes her a chocolate pie - made out of her own feces. Howard somehow chows down two pieces of this pie and doesn't notice it, and later Stone uses this fact to blackmail Howard into denying that the book is based on the maids of Jackson, Mississippi. The concept of a poo pie is so disgusting that it completely derails the film. It made me completely change sympathies. The put-upon maid now felt like the villain and the virulently racist Howard became the victim. In real life, Spencer would have been lynched, like instantly. And I almost want to say that she'd deserve it. It-girl Jessica Chastain has a nice role as a white trash girl who wants to be friends with Howard. Really, there's way too much plot about the white chicks in the movie (the film runs way too long anyway).",
36,9 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,4, Not for me,"THE HELP is one of those feel-good Hollywood productions that always makes me feel cold inside instead. The sentimentality is overbearing and the shrill performances extremely off-putting to this viewer, with Bryce Dallas Howard and Jessica Chastain making me want to switch off every time while they're on screen. The film seems to have been made to assuage white guilt and looks at the plight of black maids in the American South during the 1960s, where they were regularly bullied and treated as lessers during the civil rights era. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer give well judged performances but the story feels padded out and lifeless at times; it really didn't need to be two and a half hours long. Emma Stone's grating character gets too much screen time and seems a bit dim while the decent into bad taste humour at one point is something I couldn't forgive or come back from.",

Thank you for bringing it back to our family."" Skeeter (Stone) moved back home to Mississippi so she can get some experience writing for a paper before she can move to New York.

This is a very difficult movie to watch, but this is a must see. The subject matter will infuriate you and the Hillary character is one of the best movie villains to come along in awhile. For a movie that at its most basic level is about interviewing people for a book it is very engrossing and moves along pretty quick. This is a very emotional movie that will leave you thinking and wondering how you would have behaved in that situation. The cast and acting alone is worth watching for.

40,25 November 2011,sddavis63,4, It Goes On - And On - And On,"This isn't a bad movie. It actually has a lot of good material in it. It's an interesting perspective on the civil rights movement of the 1960's and especially on race relations in the state of Mississippi. It revolves around the writing of a book by Skeeter (Emma Stone) - an aspiring author largely raised by a black maid employed by her family who decides to write about what life is like as a black domestic servant in the City of Jackson. As we watch her write, and as she manages to get more and more of the stories of the various ""maids"" shared with her, we see the sadness and injustice of the southern lifestyle of the era. The ""maids"" were only slightly better off than the slaves who had come before them - at the whim of their ""employers,"" poorly paid and useful mainly because they allowed the women they worked for to enjoy a relative life of ease, not even having to take responsibility for the raising of their own children. There may have been a little too much caricature involved in that portrayal (although not having lived in Jackson, Mississippi in the '60's, I can't say for sure) but this certainly gives a taste of the era and the society. This isn't about marches or protests, although the killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers earns a mention; it's a story about people and the struggles they faced overcoming a legacy of racism.",

43,29 February 2012,mmukasa,1, A Disservice to Important History,"This film uses every cliché in the book starting with the liberal minded white person who is the voice of conscience and the long suffering good hearted but somewhat simplistic black people.This film is emotionally manipulative and panders to a sentimental reduction of complex history. Its moves were predictable and uses every trick in the book, even the scene in the church is cliché. Both the white and the black characters are mostly reductive caricatures out of some story book world which doesn't do justice to the historical complexity of such situations. Why would you want to make a saccharine comic book out of profound historical situations-- other than to pander to audiences longing for a feel good experience for the sake of box office. I actually don't mean to disrespect to people who like it, and I don't want to attack the actors. They didn't write the film, but at the same time, I can't believe that so many people fell for this bag of tricks. Still, a bigger problem and disservice a movie like this does to our culture is that such bad history and simplistic human portrayals turns race dynamics into good guy bad guy stories which we can watch with a complacent feeling of how much better we are than those bad old days. Such complacency leads to a historical ignorance that retards honest critique and real progress. This movie would be better if it just didn't pretend to be about something. Let it be some sappy comic book. That wouldn't be the worse thing in the world. At least it would be more honest.",

48,29 September 2011,tavm,8, The Help is a very compelling drama about domestic life for women of color during the early '60s,"Just watched this very compellingly historical drama with my movie theatre-working friend who seen it twice before. We both enjoyed this fictional account of many of the African-American female maids and their stories they tell to an aspiring author named Skeeter (Emma Stone). Among those female servants, Abileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) provide the most interesting of their trials of working for their employers. The most mean of the white employers is one Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) who gets most of her comeuppance in the most dirty ways one can imagine. Then, on the other side of the tracks is Celia (Jessica Chastain) who somehow becomes Minny's savior and vice versa. There's also good supporting turns from Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson, Mary Steenburgen and especially Allison Janney. Since I haven't read the book, I'm sure there are some details I haven't been privy to that I'm sure might have made this movie even more compelling.

They made the movie realistic and followed the characters from the book exactly. I don't think many actresses could have pulled it off. Also, it was a relief to see that Hilly was a lot less intimidating in the movie than in the book.

In The Help, Charlotte played by Allison Janney regrets firing her maid Constantine under pressure from the society. An incident parallel to this happens towards the end of the film with Aibileen, Hilly and Elizabeth, with Elizabeth reminding us of Charlotte, Aibileen reminding us of Constantine and Hilly of that supercilious lady who pressurized Charlotte to fire her maid.

Full of sugar, whimsy and wholesomeness but totally lacking in truth and bite. Ugh! The performances are almost uniformly two dimensional - even Allison Janney opted for cartoon like characterisation. The period detail is sometimes accurate but occasionally glaringly inaccurate. For example no girl in the early 60s would have worn her hair in Emma Stone's hopelessly anachronistic style. I blame Tate Taylor who was credited with the screenplay and direction. Apparently Taylor was born in Jackson and is a close friend of Kathryn Stockett. Can this really be how Ms Stockett wished her novel to be brought to the screen? But there again I haven't read the novel. Could it be full of the same yukky apple pie philosophy?",

An aspiring author played by pretty Emma Stone during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African-American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis. Subject is sensitive but treatment is not. In fact most of the time it is balanced, comical take on the racism that makes it an easy watch rather a shocking watch. If we talk about performances, Octavia Spencer treats big time with her delightful portrayal of Minny Jackson for which she was awarded an Oscar. Viola Davis also stands tall with her sincere portrayal of Aibileen Clark. Whole movie is crafted like a girl's movie so there is very less for male actors to show-off here.

All of the characters come alive in some of the best performances by actors that I have seen in a long while. The MacGuffin here is Skeeter's (Emma Stone) desire to become a writer and achieve the self-worth she feels she has been denied all her life. The vehicle then is to interview Jackson, Mississippi maids so they can tell their stories. The setting of the South in the 60's is perfectly captured. Some may find the story a bit too preachy but its overall themes of love, self-worth, and individual courage carry this film. Viola Davis (Aibileen Clark , Allison Janney (Charlotte Phelan) , Sissy Spacek (Mrs. Walters), and Octavia Spenser (Minny Jackson) are wonderful in their roles; but, Bryce Davis Howard (Hilly Holbrook) who plays the snobbish and racist power in the town and Jessica Chastain (Celia Foote), as the woman who Hilly believes stole her boyfriend and then married him, turn in two performances that are amazing.

Even the mother managed to dig herself out from under the 'bad-bus' at the end. These performers all had easy parts since their drums were easy to bang. BUT Bryce Dallas Howard was remarkable. From the beginning to end, her character was an unlikable southern racist. This must have been a very difficult part for this young woman to play. If one plays an evil murderer or a vampire, they get a passif one plays a racist – a very brave move and she did an outstanding job. I do remember these times but not from a southerners' perspective, but from one in the north looking south. As a Yankee, many of us are way too busy painting a racist brush over the southern whites - never taking the time to gaze into our own mirrors. Ah well, that is enough pontificating.

I expected something a little less serious, but if the movie was in any way different than it is, it wouldn't be this good. The story is extremely difficult emotionally. It deals with a problem that was an issue not so long ago, and I believe that is what makes it so powerful. People who took care of their children, them, their entire lives were treated, by them, like slaves. No respect, no consideration for their feelings, their problems. I was actually considering leaving the cinema after 40 min because I got so enraged by how those women were treated I could barely stand it. Why was that so? Primarily, the acting. Every character in this movie was played to the point of perfection. Bryce Dallas Howard and Viola Davis were astonishing. One can feel nothing but hate for Hilly, and nothing but sorrow and love for Aibileen. Another staggering performance was the one by Jessica Chastain. I found myself wanting to jump into the movie and just hug that woman's character through and through. Such cuteness I have never seen! The only minor problem is Emma Stone who got a little lost in the sea of these marvelous performances. All of the above named characters simply ""ate"" her on the screen. One more name worth mentioning is Octavia Spencer. She was my favorite character. Strong and powerful, but also extremely gentle and frightened. As is presented, the movie's leading characters are women. Another thing that deserves an absolute A+ is the contrast of the exterior space and the interior of the people. The hairspray generation, the houses filled with thousand of colors and at the same time such dark and evil personalities. See this movie and take everyone you know to see it.

101,21 August 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Often heavy-handed and overly sentimental, yet ultimately entertaining and emotionally resonant.","Yes, 'The Help (2011)' is often heavy-handed, soppy and overly sentimental, and it does - to a degree - feel as though it was only created to garner the critical acclaim and Oscar buzz it inevitably did. However, it also strikes a chord on a number of key levels and manages to move past its basic presentation to provide a perhaps surprisingly resonant experience, one that takes a unique and relatively unflinching look - given it's essentially a 'feel-good' flick designed to reach as wide an audience as possible - at America's darker domestic days and proves that the best way forward is to remember and educate rather than ignore and forget. The star-studded, somewhat eclectic narrative moves between a number of key perspectives to tell its alternate civil rights tale and all of them are brought to life with well-rounded, period-and-place accurate writing and excellent performances. Some mention has been made about how much of the piece focuses on a young white woman who aims to shed light on the situation she sees around her and, indeed, it could be argued that the picture itself serves to make most white audiences feel better about themselves as they'll most likely relate to her as opposed the more overly racist antagonists, but the movie itself features plenty of strong black characters who take control of their own situation and it doesn't actually present any of its proceedings as instant 'solutions' to anything, instead showing the positive and negative outcomes of the risky actions taken by all its core players within both their wider and more personal contexts. It's commendable that the film focuses so heavily on a strong, racially-diverse female ensemble while also promoting equality both on and off screen, through its very existence. To pick apart one of the few examples of this is perhaps reductive, though lamenting a civil rights struggle being framed through a white protagonist's perspective is understandable. On the whole, the feature is fairly endearing at times and rather emotionally affecting at others. It may be quite 'by the book', so to speak, but it's ultimately an entertaining drama that takes a tough situation and examines it through several well-rounded characters. 7/10",

104,16 January 2019,izzymhall,10, This Film Needs No Help,"The movie The Help takes place in early 1960's Jackson, Mississippi. The film focuses on two main characters, Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark and Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson who are African American maids that work for white families. The maids are paid 95 cents per hour but had the responsibilities to cook, clean and take care of the children. Aibileen, Minny and the rest of the African American community faced extreme obstacles of racism and segregation but couldn't stand up for themselves until one day, future journalist, Skeeter Phelan, played by Emma Stone, wanted write about the truth behind the cruelty African American maids face when working for these white families.
The purpose of Skeeter's novel is to expose the truth about the way maids were treated and to empower the African American community. Skeeter's character plays a major role throughout the film. Her bold decision to go under the law to get all the awful stories about white families all the maids worked for gave the African American community a chance to share their voice during this time of silence. Not only does this expose the racial injustice within their community, it brings the gender inequality to light as well.
Director Tate Taylor's creative direction gave this film the magic needed to create the realism added to this film. Director Taylor pulled the strings feeling like you're trapped in the film itself. Viewers felt like they were in the shoes of each character and felt each emotion the actors portrayed, deeply. By the end of the movie your heart ached so bad you couldn't help but cry. This film also uses humor to grab the attention of the audience and keeps them engaged the full way through. I sitting on the edge of my seat, laughing and crying the whole time.
The Help is like a fresh breath of air after a ten mile run. This film gives you a raw new view on our country's history. Yes, the films tendency to take you on a rollercoaster of emotions is somewhat exhausting but it is well worth the journey.
The films hand picked actors and actresses put on the perfect performance and most went on to win a few awards. The film peppers a few cruel characters in but keeps the limelight focused the heroines of the story. Most characters fall into the stereotypes during that time in the 1960's, but a few stand out from the rest. Skeeter phelan (Emma Stone), Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer). They are pronounced heros in this film as they are in combat with the patterns of society and racial inequality at that time.
The Help is a very well known movie and has been awarded for its excellence. You might of heard of major awards like, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. The Help won this awards from both ceremonies in 2012. This film was also nominated for multiple other awards, totaling up to 81 wins and 117 nominations.
Others may know this story from the book, The Help, written by Kathryn Stockett and released in February 2009. The novel was a hit and sold over three million copies. The book received the Goodreads Choice Awards Best Fiction.
This five star film brings their audience on an emotional journey with side effects of heart warming laughter and love for the characters and storyline. If you make the choice of watching this spectacular film, be prepared to feel a wide range of emotions with the first one being love. The wild humor and heart felt message will make it one film enjoyed by all.",
105,15 March 2019,jchen-07237,10, The Help Is Gold,"This movie warmed my heart. The Help should've received an Oscar. I saw the movie before I read the book, and I loved both. It is such a meaningful movie, it touches my heart, and it tells about how things were back then in the days, when people were cruel enough to judge people for how they looked and what color their skin was. Added with comedy and lots of delicious fried chicken memories from Minny, The Help is a wonderful film. With Aibileen's quiet strength, Minny's strong sass, and Skeeter's stubbornness and determination, these three make a difference that make a big change in the human race forever. I rate this a 10 for a million good reasons. Watch this, or you'll regret it.",

110,28 December 2011,anudeepraju,10, The Help is the movie of the year...!!!!,"In 2008,I had a chance to watch a movie that stood on it's strong performances and an excellent adaptation from a Tony Award winning play...........I'm talking of the movie 'Doubt'.The movie had nearly the entire cast nominated for the Oscars that year.One performer was Voila Davis,who had strongly caught my attention for her class performance.She had a screen space of hardly a couple of minutes .....but she exploited those moments completely to show us an authentic portrayal of a concerned mother. This year in The Help,she again manages to move us with her acting potentials.She does the role of a black maid who raises white children.The movie is set against the backdrop of racism, wherein the maids (all colored women) from Jackson come forward to give in their experiences in the houses of the whites where they are employed.And each ones experiences comes together to take in the shape of a book by Anonymous, thanks to Skeeter(Emma Stone.... another notable character in the movie),which turns out to be popular but also a threat to some of the white women who have to face the consequences of their mindset(one hilarious moment being when Mrs.Hilly eats the pie made by Minny........an incredible revenge I say)...oh yeah .........Minny....Octavia Spencer,I should mention has done an outstanding work....one class apart performance......and even Jessica Chastain manages to grab your attention as a dumb white mistress(Ms.Celia Foote) to Minny but she is extremely good at heart(which I believe is more important to call yourself a human being). Viola Davis as Aibileen is not only just impressive but is the real show stealer.The performances of the women are so brilliant that the viewer tends to overlook everything else about the film. But what makes the performances so strong is beautiful adaptation of the screenplay and a good job from the director ........Tate Taylor.....he surely does deserve kudos.What I loved about his work was that he could purely read my mind....I gave it a thought .......is the movie about racism?.......NO..........it is only about the maids who are doing an incredible favor to their mistress.......raising their children.........and in return these women get treated like shits.I adore the way he made this point clear across the film. The movie on a whole has been brilliant.....after a long time I got to see a movie that made me laugh,cry,thrill.......and most importantly made me feel humbled...It is surely one of the best movies of the year!!!!",
111,18 December 2011,RolyRoly,5, This Movie Left a Bad Taste in my Mouth,"The Help has two outstanding performances: one from Viola Davis and the other from Octavia Spencer. Beyond that, I felt like I was fed a slice of Minny Jackson's pie. When the emotional apex of the film is a young, prosperous and coddled white woman agonizing about whether to leave the racially charged Jackson for a glamorous life in the literary swirl of New York,you know that something has gone very wrong indeed. This film did not need Skeeter and the fact that she became its centre-piece, no matter how ""enlightened"" she may have been, is a subtle form of racism in its own right. The maids in The Help are more interesting, more compelling and much more deserving of the film's unwavering attention.",

My father, being from a Slavic country and having emigrated here after WWII, was an exception as well. Perhaps having been mocked for his accent and being old when I was born he knew how hurtful it is to treat another human being as a second class citizen for being different, even though he was white and Catholic. I was harassed for the religion I was brought up in, rather than being some form of a Protestant. Southern hospitality is a farce because as soon as you walk away from someone who is landed gentry or if they feel you're different and lesser than them in some other way, they are laughing at you and saying the meanest things they can think up. I won't live in this awful place much longer, where they pay less, hate women and the KKK and Rebel Flags still are displayed with pride. The most hateful are the women and the most violent are the men. Of course there are exceptions, but the culture of racism and sexism are still alive 50+ years since the Civil Rights Act was passed. I work in healthcare, and there are even Indian doctors who still believe in the caste system, that the disabled and mentally ill are somehow less entitled to the basic quality of service than ""normal"" people. But that seems to be an American standard across the country these days, especially since the most recent president was elected. There's no changing this country in my lifetime, so it's off to Europe for me.",

I have to say, Viola is one of the most passionate actors out there. If she's in pain, you are too. If she's crying, you are too. Add to this film the remaining exceptional performances by Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain and you have a winner. The pacing was a little slow for such a long movie, but still beautifully written an acted. 8/10 from me!",
115,25 May 2012,Hitchcoc,9, A Story We Need to Remember,"I am really responding to the wide range of personal responses to this film. I think that when one tries to paint a works of art with one's own historical view or agenda, we lose sight of what the director/author intended. I can't abide someone criticizing a film because it doesn't depict things the way they are today. Does that negate any film with an historical base. This is a single slice of life portrayal with well meaning people using the hand dealt to them. To say that they are caricatures is really unfair. We focus in on principal characters who carry the weight of the movie. When we look at the larger picture, we see an oppressed and manipulated group that we don't see. But they are there. They just don't have the wherewithal to make change. Sometimes it would be life threatening. Granted there are some cheap thrills. The famous pie or the young white housewife and her foibles. But this makes good storytelling. It doesn't damn everybody. There are some good people and there were some good people. I personally believe the author did a superb job of creating the tension that existed. Nothing happened simply. It's also about turnabout. Let the fifties speak for themselves.

Very well done.,"It took me 3 days to read the book and I went out and watched the movie right afterwards, with every detail still fresh in my mind. Of course in a book based film there will be some differences, details that get left out. I was thoroughly pleased with this film and how close it came to the book. The things that were changed or left out are understandable. There are a couple of small things I wished the movie stayed true to: Constantine being a large, tall woman, and of course the way that Stuart left Skeeter. Although, I would have been happy if they left out him leaving all together and had him stay with her :) The cast they chose was incredible. I am a huge Emma Stone fan, but I have to say that Hilly's character was my favorite. That beautiful woman played that horrible part so well. And please let me revert back to a teenager for a moment and say that Chris Lowell is a hottie. Last but not least... I saw interviews saying that Aibileen's character was really going to have to work hard to fill the shoes and believe me, SHE DID, but I have to say that Octavia Spencer was outstanding.

125,7 May 2014,evancyl,7, Good but the book was way better,"The book was a fantastic read and I think the movie did a decent job of bringing it to life. Set in 1960s Mississippi, The Help is about a white girl, Skeeter Phelan, who collaborates with black maids to tell their stories of what it's like to work in a white household. They hope to narrow the racial divide and improve conditions for blacks. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer put up excellent performances as the maids, Aibileen and Minny. As president of the county's Ladies' League and leader of the racist campaign to build separate toilets for blacks in every household (not to mention Skeeter's friend), Hilly was also just as smooth and poisonous as I had imagined her to be. Emma Stone was alright as Skeeter, but a lot of her inner struggles in the book didn't really come out, so I found it kind of hard to connect with her. ",
126,29 August 2012,michaelRokeefe,9, Change can be started with whispers.,"THE HELP is based on the novel of the same name by Kathryn Stockett; this is more than just a movie...its an experience. Set in Jackson, Mississippi at the dawn of the civil rights movement, a couple of women take clandestine steps to make a change for the good. Skeeter(Emma Stone)a fresh Ol Miss graduate returns home to where her mother is eagerly awaiting with the major thing on her mind is to find Skeeter a husband. However, Skeeter is determined to become a writer and gets her start by taking the help/advice column for the local paper. Skeeter wants something more substantial and begins the greatest experience of her life. With help from her best friend's maid, Aibileen(Viola Davis), she decides on writing about the true unhappiness of the many black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white southern families. This undertaking begins slow, but Aibileen convinces more of her friends to come forward. In secret Skeeter and the maids collaborate on putting their stories to paper. In spite of Skeeter's white friends, she has definitely forged a sisterhood with the willing maids that eagerly await the finished product...Skeeter's novel. The high class women of Jackson can't put the book down, unassured that it is actually about them through the eyes of their own maids. Whispers can make a change. THE HELP makes you want to read the novel if you didn't read it already. A very strong cast in a very entertaining film.

Set in his hometown of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1961 just as the civil rights movement was taking hold of the Deep South, the film benefits immeasurably from its excellent cast, in particular, a gut-wrenching performance from Viola Davis, a brilliant actress who blazed through just eight minutes of screen time in John Patrick Shanley's ""Doubt"". Showing more nuanced shades of her trademark stoic strength here, she serves as the film's emotional center as Aibileen, a haunted middle-aged maid who has spent most of her life raising white children and just recently lost her only son to racially motivated violence.",

Octavia Spencer is the best out of all the actors, she's just so intense and you never want to look away whenever she's in a scene, you better believe she's a force to be reckoned with. WELL deserved academy award win! Emma Stone is great here too, very believable performance. And then there's Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek, who both really impressed me with their portrayals of their characters. And Bryce Dallas Howard was incredible in her sinister nasty role of Hilly Hollbrook. Oh and you cannot forget about Jessica chastain! Her portrayal of Celia Foote is near perfection, so down to earth and kind, a true lamb among wolves. The movie does a masterful job at telling these African American maids stories and seeing how the disgraceful conditions that were present in those times really affected people. The writing and the acting combines in an effective way, the two things are just so great here that when you put them together it almost knocks you back lol. The scenes are wonderfully directed and have perfect timing. The character depth is ever deep and you are left very satisfied. Each character's story gets resolved in some way and you are left also feeling refreshed and renewed when this film comes to an end. 10/10 for The Help!!

The riveting performances by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer will make your melt faster than a snowball in a microwave with their scintillating performances. I was a bit disappointed with the DVD because there was a lackluster of bonus material. In addition to that over four minutes of scenes were deleted. All we get is a five minute music video, which makes me cringe because I felt cheated when I purchased the DVD.

135,5 March 2012,bbewnylorac,5, Serious doubts about this,"At first, I loved this film. Great acting, a solid plot and script, gorgeous costumes, sets and locations. But in thinking about it and by reading the other reviews, I realised I had missed some key points. I must emphasise that the movie is certainly well-meaning and sincere. Yet while it purports to be about black rights in the South of the 1950s and 1960s, the heroine is Skeeter (Emma Stone) a wealthy white woman. Maybe this makes the movie more appealing to white audiences? Isn't it a little patronising that the young journalist Skeeter is the one who gets the black women recognition, who encourages them (and enables them) to tell their stories and to rebel against their oppressors? As if they can't do it themselves? And isn't it a little revisionist (historically) to imply that there would have existed, in those times, a pure-hearted, heroic white woman like Skeeter, who not only sought to save, but succeeded in saving, black maids' dignity? Does this premise let whites off the hook for all the indignities and wrongs they perpetrated on blacks in real life? Saying to white audiences, ''hey, don't feel so guilty about your oppression of blacks - not all of you discriminated''. I suppose you could counter-argue that maybe in such a situation as in The Help, a white person was the one who had the social and political clout to effect change. Other issues with The Help include that for most of the movie Skeeter has it both ways -- while she is secretly plotting for change, she continues to enjoy life as a willing participant in her overtly racist circle of friends. For most of the movie, she doesn't really challenge them on their horrible acts of exclusion and prejudice. Also, as others have pointed out, at the end, Skeeter gets to skip off into the sunset, to a great job in the big city, while the maids who rebelled presumably have to stay and be unemployed or face continued discrimination in their home town.",

Notwithstanding the ""white saviour complex"" which has some merit, even though a story should be left to be a story, even the ""good"" characters are horrible. Bryce Dallas Howard plays a one-sidedly bad woman, and now she's even recommending people don't watch the film to educate themselves on black history (although I don't see her donating her movie film cheque to any black causes). But the treatment she receives (one gross incident in particular) is still wrong - but Hollywood is always happy to sink to the lowest common denominator for humour against the ""baddies"". And stupidly this makes the films two main African American characters, Minnie and Abileen the long suffering and loyal maids look bad also. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer Are very good however even with this, and the only redeeming thing about the movie. Emma Stone is absolutely insufferable also. Both the black and white characters and lifestyle are stereotyped and unsurprising.",

However this one, succeeded into making me feel the humor, wonder and closure in one full length film. The Help is as pretty and as lovely as it was engaging for viewers to watch. At first, I didn't really know what to expect, but as the story dived in further, I found myself glued to my seat. Right after, I was informed through the credits that it was based from a novel, which made it all the more exciting. Now, I've gotten myself curious as to how different or similar the book in contrast to the one on screenplay. And to be perfectly honest, if the directors were able to write a screenplay this good, as well as produce a very interesting movie, I think there is a lot more to read about the book.

143,17 June 2014,Hecaterus,10, Film Journal Review,"Perfect. A movie about the civil rights movement in the 1960's responds with a light hearted approach to the chaos whilst conjunctively addressing the hardship of 'The Help'. Whilst the in-story author requires help from the help, to right about the Help may seem disorienting, Tate Taylor (Director) does this in a way that no other Director seems to be able to do correctly. Great camera work located at about 30 minutes, where the camera spirals upwards, following Emma Stone up the spiral staircase is a shot that has been remembered by myself and is something I look for within movies today. However, this shot and the shot at the end credits place it comfortably - in my books, as the shot which is on par with final shot from 'The Passenger'. The end credits in particular allow the actors the right of recognition which they all deserve. Keeping to the underlying message right down to the point.

144,20 April 2012,victor7754,5, Far From The Truth,"The Help comes nowhere near the horror that infected Mississippi and the Southeast during the Civil Rights movement in 1960's America. This silly portrayal is filled with cinematic clichés. The film bounces between fluff and nutter with Actors placed in nice lighting. Give me a break. The Help has a cast that is able to carry the story with moments of humor balancing the hardships of being victims of racism. The Evangelical Baptists and Congregations were filled with much oppression and ignorance during this time. Why is this not touched upon with a more accurate eye. 50 years later, Mississippi is ranked the most miserable state. Perhaps, in the sequel, ""More Help"" we may see such realism. It will scare the hell out of ya. No pun intended.",
145,8 September 2011,chaz-28,8, Unsettling but necessary; Surefire nominations for Viola Davis & Octavia Spencer,"The Help is at once a joy to watch for its absorbing yet haunting story and for the superior acting by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. On the other hand, it is nauseating at times to suffer through the scenes of outright cruelty perpetrated by the white women of the south in the early 1960s. It is one thing to read about Jim Crow in a book or listen to an old person nowadays discussing what it was like, but to see reenactments of just how dehumanizing and vindictive the times were is just unsettling.

The whole film has always given the audience a warm feeling, and its female perspective has also made the female audience around the world feel warm. There must be a large number of brave, intelligent and unruly women in the world, otherwise the society will never have to move forward. The narrative level of the film can be said to be very ordinary, a bit like a TV series, but the issue of women will never be out of date no matter what country or when.

I grew up with racist parents and grandparents and I can tell you I could very well have ended up prejudice but I hated it then and I hate it now. We make choices in life if we are going to do right or wrong and we all bleed red. If people can't get along on earth what makes anyone think God wants them in heaven? This was wonderful how they presented what was still going on in the 60s. I saw the racism and hatred with the watts riots, the tension in Long Beach, and the hatred from both sides. This movie was presented so good and had such great aspects to it that it was the one movie in hundreds I have seen that I would even want to give a review on. Acting great, story great, and even if it was just a presentation of what things went on and might not have been about a particular family...this was pretty darn accurate by what I lived through in the 60s. Thanks for the movie. It was a delight to watch and I give it a triple A rating. All families should watch this together and discuss it after because it truly should win every award out there.",

149,2 January 2012,classicalsteve,10," The Untold Story of African-American Maids Raising White Children in the South: The Best Film on the Subject Since ""The Long Walk Home""","In American historic culture, we often think of race relations in terms of the civil rights protest marches of the 1960's and the work of Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr. Behind the scenes and for many decades prior to the legislation signed by President Johnson in 1964, African-Americans and Southern Whites interacted within a societal infrastructure which was not often discussed. African-American hired ""help"" often raised the white children of southern aristocratic society. Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan is a young white woman raised by one of these African-Americans, Constantine Bates, whom she regards as the person who raised her. She decides to document the experiences of the maids when she finds out Constantine was fired by her family without her knowledge.",
150,13 February 2012,gilligan-11,6, Mediocre at best,"Considering all the praise that's been heaped upon it—not to mention Oscar nominations and other awards—""The Help"" left me feeling rather ambivalent. Yes, it features some ""very important"" themes and it begs to be called a ""movie about issues"" (namely, racism and women's rights). And yes, the actors deliver fine performances—Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney are outstanding, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays the delightfully detestable antagonist (probably the best role of her career—certainly better than anything she did in that ""Twilight: Eclipse"" nonsense). But something about this film just lay flat. The moments that were meant to stir up emotions failed to do so, the plot just kind of meandered with no real suspense or uncertainty, and a main plot device (one of the black maids extracts revenge on a racist former employer by baking a pie that contains a decidedly unsavory and rather putrid ingredient and savoring the racist's enjoyment of it) is almost vulgarly offensive enough to distract the viewer's attention from the alleged moral indignation he/she is meant to feel for the unjust treatment the maid has received. Ultimately, the film is a disappointment, despite the strong performances of its cast, and I'll be thoroughly perplexed if it wins any Oscars at all.",

153,15 August 2011,judywalker2,10, Yes it's a feel good movie for white people and everyone else,"I gave this movie a ten because it left such a good feeling with the audience but I have to admit that it wasn't perfect. The Help is your typical movie told by white people about civil rights. It has all of the right characters and ends in the right way. But it is the story of the black women and the performances of the actresses that play them that I will remember most. Viola Davis is wonderful as always. Cissy Spacek has a plum role that she makes the most of. Octavia Spencer is a jewel and I would love to see more from her. Emma Stone was also okay in her role but the character of her mother played by Allison Janney is great. The two things that are ultimately wrong are the portrayal of most of the men, black and white and the story concerning Skeeters' maid which was very weak; though Cicelie Tyson does a wonderful job with the minute role. Yes it is a feel good movie and you feel really good. Just one more note my daughter and I were the only Black people in the theater and it really made me have to think. Are these kind of movies the only ones that white people will come and see? And the audience was majority white women. Why won't they come to see other stories where black people are the center of the story and I don't count Tyler Perry movies. Just something to think about.",

This may be easier to understand when one takes into consideration that Walt Disney Studios are responsible for the distribution of a film that is targeted at the older woman, the single hardest demographic to coax into cinema screens presently. Having read the book, (read review here) I knew the director had a lot to prove. As a fan I was wary yet excited at the evolution of this great book and the reception it's had worldwide. It is an unfortunate truth that Hollywood rarely makes the most of the projects it gets it's hands on, in terms of quality at least thus, the concern for an international bestseller making its way into the lap of Disney is an obvious worry.",

158,13 August 2011,aharmas,9, Viola Davis' Quiet Revolution,"Reading the novel on which this movie is based was one of the most thrilling moments of the year, and seeing its film adaptation is also one of the highlights in a very good movie year. Still, before going into detail, let's be clear about three big questions in the adaptation: ""the source of the idea for writing the book?"", ""the college/jail subplot?"", and ""Celia's revelation"". If you are a purist, you'll be a bit upset by the changes. Just remember both the film and the book have their hearts in the same place, a quest to educate about a period in American history, full of pain, contradiction, confusion, and hate, with the insight provided by the writer and the devastating, moving, and flawless performance by Viola Davis and most of the supporting cast, ""The Help"" is a truly outstanding film, one that needs no hyperbole in its advertising, manipulation in its marketing, or a radically different way to do ""storytelling"". Here is a film, with a strong narrative, a handful of moving scenes, and a big, strong, and marvelous heart.",
159,17 February 2022,solojere,9, You is Important,"Over ten years later and The Help is still as touching and relevant as the day it came out. First, it should be noted that the Help is a fictional film based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel by the same name. However, I don't think it makes the story any less relevant. The film follows an ambitious writer in the 1960s, who publishes a book with multiple stories of black maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis. While the stories are fictional, the situations feel very, and the characters are very relatable. In fact, some of these same issues, particularly the separation between the haves and have nots are still present in our society today. The cast is amazing, and there isn't a weak performance from anyone. Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, and Bryce Dallas Howard give some of their best work. Anna Camp even has a small role, and it is clear this was before she got famous. But she still plays her part excellently (there are also some really good deleted scenes with her in it on the DVD). The second thing is that this film is sometimes accused of perpetuating the idea of the white savior. To people who think that way, I would say that context is important and that the time this film takes place in, African American women didn't have the same opportunities as an upper-class white woman would have, and clearly, a movie set in 2011 would approach the subject matter differently. I will also say that there are times when people need to step in when they see inequalities in their society, and it doesn't matter what their race is as long as they are helping to create a better society for everyone. It's not a perfect film, but it's a must-watch for its subject matter alone. Because don't we all want to be told ""you is kind you is smart you is important"" ?",

Tate Taylor did a very good job in both directing and the screenplay. Emma Stone was a good choice, and of course the Oscar nominated Voila Davis did a spectacular job. Davis is a great actress, no one could argue with that. To my surprise, Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer performed amazingly. Chastain really showed us in this movie that she is versatile, she was able to make us sympathize with her as a vulnerable wife in ""The Tree of Life"" opposite Brad Pit, in this movie she showed us she can also play the sexy, southern, naive wife. Also, to my surprise, Spencer shocked me that she can combine both good acting and being funny, it will be after this movie that Octavia Spencer will be in movies that could show us more of her talent. Watch out for the Oscars, some of the ladies in this movie ""may"" be competing against each other at Academy Awards in 2012.",

It feels like she is/was a star for a long time, when you see what a line-up she has/had for 2010-2012. And I don't see an end to that career anytime soon.

172,5 March 2012,ConDeuce,5, Gets So Much Right and So Much Wrong....,"I'll give ""The Help"" 10 stars for the Women. Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Cicely Tyson (playing old, old, old yet again) are thrilling to watch. They have the all out fierceness that makes movies like ""The Help"" enjoyable and seem to give them ""weight"". One wishes the film makers trusted these Women more and let them have more screen time. When Emma Stone's Skeeter finally gets Viola Davis' Aibileen to talk to her for a book she's writing about the experiences of black women who serve as housemaids and nannies in assorted white households in Jackson Mississippi circa 1963, Aibileen very tentatively begins by relating a story of the first child she took care of as a 14 year old in 1925. The way Davis speaks it, the story sounds fascinating and I wanted to hear all the details. But the director cuts away the scene to where Aibileen and Skeeter are done with their talk and we never hear all about Aibileen's story. The movie could have done with a lot more of the real stories about these women's lives but we only get bits and pieces. We really don't get to know a whole lot about them and that's a shame. We might think we get more but that is because these actresses are so damn good that we fill in the gaps ourselves.",
173,19 January 2013,lee_eisenberg,7, addressing the criticism,"When I first learned of ""The Help"" - having never even heard of the book - I almost immediately heard conflicting descriptions of it. The praise was that it was a thought-provoking account of the Civil Rights era. The criticism was that it gave white people most of the credit for the movement and relegated blacks to the roles of servants. Now that I've seen it, I'd say that there's some truth to both descriptions. Part of what we see is that the white employers put on the veneer of civility but clearly view the black servants as beneath them.",
174,2 August 2012,jboothmillard,6, The Help,"I saw the trailer for this film based on the acclaimed novel and I had mixed opinions and was unsure whether I'd want to see it, but then came the awards season, and I was definitely interested to see if the winner for Best Supporting Actress was deserved. Basically, set in Mississippi in the 1960s, during the time of the Civil Rights movement, middle-aged black maid Aibileen Clark (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viola Davis) recently lost her son, and she has raised many white children in her life for the families she works for. Another black maid has been fired numerous times because of her outspokenness; Minny Jackson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Octavia Spencer) does however have fantastic cooking skills. After graduating from the University of Mississippi, young white woman Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has returned home, and she is surprised her childhood black maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) has quit her job, she questions why she did not write before leaving. All her friends from university have got married and had children, but Skeeter is single and keen to start a career as a writer, she gets her first job for the local paper writing ""homemaker hints"" columns. Aibleen is the maid of Skeeter's friend Elizabeth Leefolt (Ahna O'Reilly), Skeeter notices that the maids are treated as nothing more than the ""help""; she is uncomfortable with the attitudes towards them, especially from Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is racist and sees black people as a disease. As one of the few in the country that sees black maids as equal citizens of society Skeeter decides to write a novel based on their lives and their time taking care of white children. Most maids are uninterested in being interviewed and talking about their live, they are worried they will lose their jobs, but Aibleen is open to share her experiences, after Hilly's harsh comments, and the children she looks after are becoming like their parents. Minny gets fired by Hilly after ignoring the rule to use a separate toilet, and she finds it impossible to find work with her reputation being poisoned, and her daughter ends up becoming a maid as well. Minny initially says no to answering questions for the writing of a book, but she does agree, and Aibleen helps find her job working with Celia Foote (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jessica Chastain) as a maid, Foote is married to socialite Johnny (Mike Vogel), and with a working class background and her husband being Hilly's ex is an outcast, but she treats black maids with respect. A draft of the book is finished by Skeeter, but Harper & Row editor Elain Stein (Mary Steenburgen) in New York City says the book would only get interest with at least a dozen interviews from black maids, with the Civil Rights Movement she should do this soon. It is after the assassination of Medgar Evans and Hilly firing her latest black maid that many more do come forward to talk about themselves, they believe the book will allow them to have their voices heard during the time of all the tension between races. Minny also includes one last story to ensure no-one will reveal where the stories came from, she confesses that she baked a chocolate pie for Hilly, not long after being fired, accused of stealing, and, in front of Missus Walters (Sissy Spacek) as well, after eating two slices the maid reveals to Hilly that she baked her own excrement into the pie. Skeeter also adds her own story about Constantine and being brought up by her, and she finds out from her mother Charlotte (Allison Janney) that she was fired as a maid during a reception, but she felt guilty and sent Skeeter's brother to find her in Chicago living with her daughter Rachel, but Constantine was dead. The book is finished, and after being published the writer and the maids are pleased that it becomes an instant success, all the royalties are shared between the author and those that participated, and Skeeter is pleased to be offered a job in a New York City publishing company, but her boyfriend Stuart Whitworth (Chris Lowell) who does not believe in racial equality breaks up with her. Hilly is hatching a plan to get rid of Aibleen as Elizabeth's ""help"", getting her accused of stealing silverware, and she is successful in getting her fired, but she agrees to leave, even after giving her opinions of Hilly's vindictiveness and pleading her innocence, Elizabeth's daughter Mae Mobley is so upset, but Aibleen looks to go and find a new and better life for herself. Also starring The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as Preacher Green, Anna Camp as Jolene French, Aunjanue Ellis as Yule Mae Davis and True Blood's Nelsan Ellis as Henry the Waiter. Spencer certainly deserved her Oscar for the great scenes she is in whether serious or funny, the most memorable of course being the pie sequence, Davis could have won as well for her emotional and established lead performance, Stone is a great choice to play the woman writing the novel to hopefully make some change, and many supporting cast members are great too, I'd say particularly Howard as the nasty snobbish ringleader with disrespectful and very racist views. It is a terrific film told from the perspectives of the black women who want to speak out for all black people who are mistreated in the world and the woman hoping to help them speak out for those suffering the torment, and it has all the emotions, good and bad, to make a well-paced and most worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Song for Mary J. Blige's ""The Living Proof"". Worth watching!",

189,30 January 2012,evanston_dad,7, Far from Perfect But Carries a Welcome Message,"""The Help"" has so many positive things to say and is full of such good actors giving such good performances that it's pretty hard to outright dislike. It's one of those movies that seems really good while you're in the middle of watching it but begins to fall apart somewhat when you think back on it. I wonder how much different the viewing experience would be if you'd read the book on which it was based (I have not). As it is, there are many parts that feel like they're in the film because they're in the book but weren't as fully fleshed out in the movie as I imagine they were in the novel. An entire storyline involving Jessica Chastain as a helpless housewife who turns to her black maid to help her is welcome because it gives Chastain a chance to deliver a winning and immensely likable performance, but I'm not sure what it really had to do with the rest of the movie around it. The character played by Allison Janney doesn't make much sense at all. Representative of a certain kind of white person who's basically well meaning but allows peer pressure to turn her eyes away from the injustices of segregation, her character is first portrayed as a foolish and vain woman with whom we're supposed to be disgusted and then turns on a dime to become a champion for her daughter, played as appealingly as always by Emma Stone, when her daughter writes an expose of white oppression from the point of view of the black household staffs. And don't even get me started on the character played by Bryce Dallas Howard, an unlikable actress anyway who's given a gross caricature to play, so vile but ultimately so juvenile that she threatens to undermine the entire point of the movie -- if all racists were as silly and as easy to dismiss as her, all of our race problems would be solved.",

191,16 August 2011,griffolyon12,9, Don't Eat The Chocolate Pie!,"While there have been many movies made detailing the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, The Help's director and adapter of Kathryn Stockett's novel, Tate Taylor, manages to let the movie be something different than just a movie about the plights of African Americans in the 1960s. The Help is an ensemble story, following the multi-layered cast of some of the finer actresses currently working in the industry and their own brushes with the help of black housemaids in upper class Jackson, Mississippi. Where The Help distances itself away from the pack of similar tales, is that the movie isn't simply preaching a history lesson of tolerance, in fact it's left to our imaginations whether or not the white racist women in this movie will ever change, but the tale succeeds because it wears its heart on its sleeve and is not afraid to be both funny and oozing with sentimental emotion at each turn. The thing is, there is no moment where the white people's hearts are changed, as is seen in stuff like Remember the Titans, but rather The Help just lets the events unfold and speak for themselves. We watch these black housemaids struggle with their own emotions, caring for the white children they are nannies for, but detesting their mothers who talk down to them and wont let them use the indoor toilet on a rainy day. The Help just is, like an old fashioned Hollywood movie, there are not many frills or whistles in the direction, it is straight forward storytelling that does very little manipulation or fantasy creation to try and paint a more beautiful picture, but rather it is beautiful because of the chemistry between the flawless ensemble cast (with particular accolades to Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote). While the movie runs long, it will keep the viewer watching till the end to see where these characters will end up.",

The storyline follows a young up and coming writer just out of college who returns home to Alabama looking for fresh content to make it big. When her longtime family maid is fired before she gets home she is inspired to hear more about what happened and why. Maids at that time are like family members who spend more time raising the kids than the parents. She decides that these maids, their lifestyle and the tasks they have to help with, or hide, would be the perfect content to write a book about....",

Her job on the Jackson Journal – writing a column on house cleaning tips – leads her into contact with the experts: black women who are the nannies, cooks and housekeepers for rich white folk. Thus begins an unlikely alliance that exposes the indignities suffered by black maids at the hands of Southern belles who ironically spend their idle moments raising money for African charities. The ultimate revenge of the maids is both funny and gross. The movie evokes many emotions; laughter, tears, anger and perhaps even shame. There are wonderful performances by the maids, Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis, who surely must be in the running for Oscar nominations.",

205,7 December 2011,KineticSeoul,7, Not the most entertaining movie of the year but a movie that is still worth seeing,"I am going to be honest this isn't one of the most entertaining movies I seen this year but it's still a movie that is worth seeing. The story takes place in the 60's with the civil rights movement and has to do with the mistreatment of black housemaids during that era and what blacks went through. And revolves around a writer Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan(Emma Stone) writing about what the black housemaids went through and tries to get it published. This movie takes place in a conservative era and portrays most of the whites as arrogant one dimensional superficial characters. I guess it's needed to show the cruelty the blacks faced during that era but sometimes it just seemed a bit forced at times. Maybe I had to have lived during that era to get a better understanding though. The movie is a bit dry though and it sort of reminded me of books I had to read in middle school although it's based on a novel. It was sad to see how the blacks were treated in a degrading and demeaning manner in that era. Nothing new to anyone that graduated from high school but still leaves a bit of an impact. If your looking for a fast paced movie with some shock factor in some genre like this you might be a bit disappointed. But this movie does a decent job of showing the feeling and emotions of blacks during that era. And their perspective of what is going on at that time. This is a good movie to show in school during class in order to educate the students but it's not a movie that I would watch again. But it makes you think when it's over, especially about how the blacks were forced sometimes no matter how hard they worked they didn't have enough to give their children a proper life. I am not going to lie and say it's one of the most exciting movie of the year it just lacked the focus but it's a film that is worth seeing and has good character development and that applies to the side characters as well.",

One person wanted to stick up for those that weren't being treated fairly and so she did. It was a brave thing to do. Especially when it turned her into an outcast. But did that bother her? Of course not. She set her own personal values aside in order to make a difference. This movie had me laughing. It had me crying. It had my heart breaking. Then it had me leaping for joy.

The film is very message-heavy and sentimental to boot, and yet it makes for an engaging experience thanks to a slew of well developed characters brought to life by talented actresses. Octavia Spencer, Cicely Tyson and especially Viola Davis provide strong supporting turns as some of the poorly treated African American maids who in many cases care more about the kids whom they are helping to raise than the parents themselves. Emma Stone also delivers a fine turn as the protagonist who only gradually realises the seriousness of her endeavour, however, it is Jessica Chastain who steals the show as a ditzy young woman completely oblivious to how maids are usually treated and overly cordial when hiring one of her own. She has some strong dramatic moments late in the piece too. Sissy Spacek is also great as the mother of the vilest and most racist young woman in the film, but as the young lady herself, Bryce Dallas Howard is absolutely grating. She given no likable qualities at all and therefore makes for a rather flat antagonist, and many of the other young women in the film do not come across much better.

229,27 January 2012,meeza,9, The Help gets the job done!,"""The Help"" needs no help in reaching for more success. It has captured the hearts of critics and moviegoers alike; it has been nominated for a few Academy Awards and was a surprise box-office hit. Writer-Director Tate Taylor's film about an aspiring Mississippi writer in the 60's who decides to write a book detailing the lives of African-American maids through their point of views did sure help uplift my spirits upon watching it. I thought it was a sensational, inspirational movie that was ""maid to love"". Taylor's tailor-made script and direction helped make it one of the best movies of the year, but the Academy sure needs some help because they snubbed Taylor for both director and screenplay Oscar nominations. Emma Stone stars as Skeeter Phelan, the go-getter young white Southern writer who gets a gig writing a laundry column in a Jackson, Mississippi newspaper; that was the gateway that brought her the idea on having African-American maids detail their challenging experiences as maids in Southern homes of wealthy, white families that even had segregated bathrooms built for the help. Viola Davis also stars as Aibileen Clark, an African-American melancholy maid who eventually decides to spill the maid beans to Skeeter. Octavia Spencer co-stars as Minny Jackson, the vociferous maid who is no Minnie Mouse when it comes to proving her points, whatever that means. All of these performances from the Big Acting Three of ""The Help"" (Stone, Davis, and Spencer) were remarkable and Oscar-worthy. Davis and Spencer both received Oscar nominations for their grand performances, but I think the Academy was stoned by snubbing Stone. With Spencer as the frontrunner for a Best Supporting Actress win, Octavia will soon be a ""Spencer: For Hire"" by being offered lucrative roles in major future productions. Other stellar supporting acting performances which helped ""The Help"" have one of the best acting ensembles of the year come from Allison Janney as Skeeter's sick mother who pressures Skeeter to get married, Bryce Dallas Howard as the racist villain Hilly Holbrook who is simply pure evil, and Jessica Chastain with her Oscar-nominated performance as the scene-stealing southern socialite Celia Foote. How could I have chastised Chastain by not including her in the aforementioned Big Acting Three of ""The Help""! So, let's call it the Fab Acting Four of ""The Help"" with all apologies to Janney, Howard, and the rest of the solid cast of thespians in this movie. There are some touching scenes of ""The Help"" that will help for you to have your weepie-hankie handy when seeing those heart-tugging moments.

The Help is a good, solid movie, but it just didn't live up to all the hype for me. Racial and segregation films like this one have been made before with much greater effects. This film felt a bit light at times, and reminded me a lot of Fried Green Tomatoes. I can't help but think this film could've been much stronger considering the strong cast it had and the social issues it was pointing out. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's novel of the same name, and it was adapted for the screenplay by director Tate Taylor himself. This is Taylor's second film, after having made a small film three years ago named Pretty Ugly People. Taylor, a relatively unknown has jumped to fame with his work in this movie, but considering the material I think a good director could've brought so much more to the story. In a way this seems to be a light drama which is touching a serious and dark period for many people. There are some funny moments, but the movie is really long and drags during some periods of time. I thought that the last half hour was probably the best part of the movie and you end up leaving the theater with a smile in your face.

You will laugh, you will cry and ultimately come out of the theatre feeling changed from when you went in. It will be no shocker to see this film being recognized when Oscar season rolls around. Both Viola Davis and Emma Stone truly shine through this well acted and directed picture. I was extremely pleased to see Stone taking on a more serious role that allows the audience to finally discover just how talented she actually is. Overall The Help was a complete breath of fresh air on what has been a somewhat dismal year of film thus far. GO SEE IT!",

HOWEVER, The screenwriters/producers/editors CONSISTENTLY took the edginess out of the book. They consistently deleted powerful scenes from the book that underscored the pervasiveness of the racism of the era. What they deleted illustrated so much more powerfully the quiet courage of the protagonists of this fabulous story. I won't go into detail about what they cut so I won't reveal the plot variations, but the consistency with which they sliced and diced shows a pre- determined decision to make the movie ""sweeter"" and more upbeat. But this decision made the choices of the characters seem ""safer"" and their decisions therefore less significant. It's too bad, because the film is beautifully acted and filmed.",

243,21 November 2011,luckmaster,9, 2011's best drama,"At the outset, I have to say that I have not read the novel by Kathyrn Stockett. Written for the screen and directed by her good friend Tate Taylor, The Help is one of the must see movies of the year.Strung together on a modest budget of 35 million, it has become one of the sleeper hits of the year with a domestic gross of over 160 million and still counting. Set in the background of 1960's civil rights struggle in America led by Martin Luther King, The Help focuses on the plight of African American housekeeper community and struggles against their racist white employers in suburban conservative Jackson,Mississippi. With an all star outstanding cast, it tells the story of a single independent white woman (Emma Stone) and her dogged pursuit to bring to light the plight of black cleaning maid community. When two of the help of the conservative households in Jackson come forward to tell their story, the struggles threads a thin line between fight for survival and a better future and fear of death from the dreaded and bigoted Ku Klux Klan. Portrayed brilliantly by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the desperation and fear of the marginalised and oppressed Black community comes to fore with outstanding performances which is a sure bet for supporting actress nominations for both the actresses. The ensemble cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Chris Lowell,Alison Janney and veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson .The performance of Cicely Tyson is one of the most the emotionally poignant scenes of the movie and though she has a screen time of just under two and half minutes, her performance is bound to make you reach for the tissues.The Help is a movie which will highlight how bad it was in the 1960's and how far we have come albeit with a long way to go to still achieve equality for all marginalised communities.The movie will make u get angry, frustrated, it will make u cry, and feel for the desperation of the maids and still manages to have its feel good moments.It is by far the best drama yet this year.",

Although fiction, it succeeds in being luminescent about past times of segregation and racism in the South. Viola Davis gives an Oscar-Worthy performance and leads a veteran cast of actresses. The developing story keeps your interest piqued for the majority of a hefty runtime (137 min) which is testament to the sharpness of the script and the quality of acting. Indeed, Taylor puts together one of the best movies of 2011 filled with the right touches of humor. See it for the acting, story, and drama. Strongly recommended",
249,20 January 2012,williamschendel,6," Having read the book, this film was disappointing","I was disappointed when I watched this film. I had just finished the book, which, to me, is an incredibly enjoyable read, and the same day watched the DVD - a big mistake. I don't think a movie can ever have the richness and emotional complexity as the book it came from because readers create an image in their minds about the characters and setting that are seldom realized in the movie version. The Help was no exception for me. Just a few of the disappointments: The Hilly character in the book was an over-weight, scheming, and domineering woman. The film actress was much too pretty and perfect and was not at all convincing to me. The other actors in the film were likewise one-dimensional and not at all real. Whatever happened to real southern accents? I seldom could get to the point where I did not think they were acting. The Skeeter character was not developed well and much was left out of the film about the effect her actions had on her life. And the most puzzling thing for me at the ending was the scene where Constantine's daughter appears at Skeeter's home. The real impact of this in the book was that the daughter's skin color was that of a white person, and that was considered by some at the time to be quite shameful and embarrassing and reason enough to fire Constantine. I wonder how anyone watching the film could be able to get that impression.",

261,19 August 2011,tfclougher,10, Upper class child rearing,"All conquerors make the mistake of leaving the children with ""the help"". After Strongbow and the Norman-French out of Wales overran Ireland in 1176, the Gaelic-speaking girls raised the children. These children in one generation spoke Gaelic, wore Irish clothing and had Irish attitudes. They became Gaelic lords. The Fitzgeralds of Kerry were an example. ""Skeeter"" was a result of such upbringing and did not become as obnoxious as her parents and their friends. The little girl featured with Viola Davis's character called her her real mother. At Monticello, a docent spoke with what I can only describe as a Black dialect. Because Blacks were kept away from education, the dialect was almost incomprehensible. My friend from West Virginia said, ""It's because they had Black nannies."" So I found that part of ""The Help"" totally believable. It's a novel but novels often reveal the real feel of a situation. Perhaps it was superficial, broad, not intense like Shamaylian or Hitchcock. But Hilly scared the hell out of me. Even in Queens County New York, teenage counsellors at a day camp could urge the Black kids to leave the bus in the afternoon by saying, ""Bongo Muchacha, Water Boy Number One, Booga Booga,"" or the like. In the late 1950's. Maybe that is why so many baby boomers were at this movie. We all experienced the blindness. And the respect for certain loudmouths who could intimidate a kid into silence.",

I especially loved the exquisite, tailor-fit, vintage, early 1960s dresses worn by the white actresses. I got a huge kick out of the over-the-top performances. Bryce Dallas Howard, though a living person, is every bit the Walt Disney cartoon villainess. You love hating her. You grimace when she cackles and you cackle as she reaches her inevitable, and utterly unbelievable, nightmare, revenge-dream-fantasy downfall. Howard should have won an academy award. Viola Davis, who radiates soul and depth and can make you cry just by walking into a room, is the deep, rich heart of this otherwise silly film. Octavia Spencer is adorable.

Its focus is through the eyes of a young aspiring writer and a group of maids that work in southern homes. This movie is not down and ugly like ""Mississippi Burning"" or ""A Time to Kill.""

The film follows three different women. The first is Skeeter (Emma Stone), a young woman hired to write a column about housecleaning. She's also wondering what happened to her maid Constantine, who helped raise her, but has now disappeared. The second is Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Skeeter asks her for advice with her column.

The third woman is Minny (Octavia Spencer) and she finds work as a maid for Celia (Jessica Chastain), who lives out of town. Celia doesn't want her husband to know that she can't cook or clean so Minny has to help secretly. Bring these women together is Skeeter's plan to write about how African American maids are treated by their white employers. She's upset that one of her friends Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) is looking to enforce a rule that will force the 'help' to have separate bathrooms from their white employers. But Skeeter finds the maids reluctant to share their experiences because of the dangerous political climate in Jackson. ",

Bryce Dallas Howard also overplayed Hilly Holbrook in what could have become one of the great on screen villains. The cinematography was also very bland and poor.

It's more of a drama about relationships, than a historical film. The movie revolves around Skeeter, a white journalist, searching for black maids who are willing to share their stories with her. I thought it was interesting to learn about the crucial role that the maids played in the families that they worked for. They practically raised the children, and yet they were treated horribly and received very little pay. Despite my interest in the maids' stories, the ""white savior"" aspect of the movie bothered me.

301,25 December 2011,nickmesafilms,10, The Help (2011) - Chance Begins with a Whisper!,"Adapted from the best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett, ""The Help"" is a comedy-drama adaptation that stole the hearts of many movie lovers. With an all-star cast including Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen, and a special appearance by Cicely Tyson, and a beautiful adaptation to a powerful novel, ""The Help"" is the movie that will steal your breath away. Set during the Civil Rights era in the early 1960s, the movie talks about a young white woman, portrayed by Emma Stone, and her relationship with two black maids, portrayed brilliantly by both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Stone plays a journalist who decides to write a controversial book from the point of view of maids, expressing the racism they are given, when working with white families. This is quite a beautiful masterpiece, and it's one of the best movies of 2011. I was completely stolen into this movie from it's funny moments, to it's heartwarming messages. I loved this amazing casting ensemble, and they deserve total Oscar consideration. Emma Stone is wonderful for her third performance this year, Bryce Dallas Howard is incredible as the character you love to hate, Jessica Chastain is just magnificent, but it's both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer that deserve Oscar nominations for their performances as the black maids. This beautiful script has helped create a movie filled with heart, emotion, truth, and courage. There was nothing in this movie that I did not like, because I was blown away by the sight of what I've just seen. This movie delivers powerful messages involving the Civil Rights movement, and how blacks should be respected equally. From the powerful messages to the incredible cast, ""The Help"" is the feel-good movie of the year, and you won't be disappointed because this is a powerful, and beautiful masterpiece for the ages. I hope this gets the Best Picture nomination of 2011. ""The Help"", in my review, ""emotionally powerful, an exhilarating masterpiece"".",

306,4 November 2020,iamserokl,10," Touching story, worthwhile to see.","This film left me with a lot of thoughts in my mind. It is a well-known fact, that superiority of white people over black was called into question years ago. Still, history reveals that the lives of black people were full of humiliations even in the 20th century. The film tells us stories about the relationships between white families and their maids. Let me remind you of some of them.
In the middle of the 20th century, equal opportunities were more of a dream for negro. Just to give you an idea of how much the inequality was, imagine that some houses had a toilet built especially for maids. Whites couldn't stand sharing the same bathroom with blacks because blacks were thought to be of another nature, of another social stratum, and might have some incurable diseases. Minny, one of the maids, was fired for using guests bathroom. By and large, maids significantly affected the day-to-day well-being of the hosts of the houses. They knew how to cook tasty and diverse food, how to clean house, and, I'd like to draw your attention to that, they knew how to raise children. The last picture of the film shows us how much a kid got attached to the help. Unfortunately, white hosts could not put their pride aside in some situations and, regardless of how much their child loved Aibileen, the help, they fired her. What surprised me is that blacks were afraid to talk about their deprivations to anyone, they were threatened by being exposed and were inclined to keep all their lives secret from the general public. It was extremely complicated to Skeeter, the young journalist, to make them believe that her intentions are pure and she just wants to write a book about maid's lives. Luckily, Skeeter sought a way how to deal with the problem and finally established enough credibility with a number of maids and the book has been published. So, we could watch such an incredible film.",

324,11 December 2011,troy-manatunga,9, A movie from the point of view of the help a movie that deserves a nod at the Oscars! Title: THE HELP,"Although Kathryn Stockett struggled with over 60 agents and had her novel rejected repeatedly the 2011 summer release THE HELP is been widely accepted even as you read this. Summer 2011 is not one of the best we have experienced in the lines of cinema. With just a handful of movies that would remain in our minds I consider THE HELP an exhilarating and heartwarming production that contains emotions and laughter from a time not too long ago. I have not clearly lived during the timelines the plot has been set. In fact the Civil rights movements and the efforts to create equality between color, race and religion is something I have just read during history lessons. To see it been brought to life at a time where racism and religious discrimination is frowned upon and where equality is boasted of is quite interesting. Especially to read the uprising debates the movie seems to have caused within some communities. If THE HELP is fact or fiction is irrelevant at this point. However the beauty and the depth the movie is revealed to me should not go unnoticed. There is an aura of near perfection that seems to hover around this title. The screenplay that has been adapted by the novel itself is said to be doing extreme justice to the original text the experts say. I have not read the novel. In fact I have not read the Harry Potter novels. However this does not stop me nor did it stop those who passed judgment on the HP franchise. The magical screenplay and direction that is done by Tate Taylor who is said to be a childhood friend of the author is key ingredient. Taylor's vision and heart is in the right place when he tries to extract the emotional lives of the black women of Jackson Mississippi. I have read many write ups about the racial atrocities that has taken place around the world. In fact I have seen with my own eyes the ethnic conflicts that stir up from some of them. THE HELP is just one of those stories that made it to the light! Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer clearly stood out with one of the best performances I have seen in recent times. They drew tears to my eyes. To be the help at the said time and to be in their situation is something that I am unable to even imagine myself in. Yet Spencer and Davis took me to 1960s Jackson. They showed me the pain and discrimination. They showed how much they gave up just making sure their children could have a better life (Although the outcome was not what they expected). The most important lesson I learnt by being in the year 2011 from the movie is that even with all the imaginable hardships of the world are upon them, they will not give up! Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer you ladies nailed it! There convincing performance was not too far away from Bryce Dallas Howard who places the other extreme end of the racial white house lady. Her ultimate goal of creating equality from within separation, Brilliant performance! Tate Taylor wanted her to come out as being mean insensitive and callous and Bryce Howard did Taylors expectations Justice. Between the help and the lords of the house there is a common ground. This is where Emma Stone comes in. I need to be honest; I was not a believer that Stone could pull through the perfect Skeeter. To my amazement she did. This Performance of Stone holds the Davis-Spencer Vs Howard battle in a balance. Aibileen Clark who has raised 17 white children is a black woman from Jackson Mississippi. She loves the children she raises just as if they were her own. In fact the children love the help more than they love their own mothers. This is only fair since the mothers of the time showed seem to have got their priorities pretty mixed up! Minny Jackson who works for the Holbrook house walks out one day after failing to tolerate the cruelty of the lady of the house. Jackson Journal writer Skeeter returns home after her graduation to find out that her maid Constantine who has raised all her life has been sent away by her mother. Skeeter who does not respond to this very well takes up to write the stories of black women and their emotional struggle for survival. However she is unable to find a volunteer who would share with her. THE HELP is a must watch drama and is indeed one of a kind. Guaranteed to have you balling out by the end of the movie and will make you look harder into yourself. A movie from the point of view of the help a movie that deserves a nod at the Oscars!

The story was pretty good and the cast was absolutely tremendous with their excellent performances. The only weak part and problem was that Emma's lead role wasn't as good as the others even you can feel it is an easy character to play with very little details about her all the movie was filled with ordinary details of her that was repeated.

336,29 March 2023,atleverton,8, Suprisingly Funny,"The help is a movie about a dark period in American history that is remarkably funny. I think it's refreshing because you can have different approaches to traumatic events. It's hard for me to describe why the movie is so funny without ruining one of the best parts of the movie, so I won't talk about it, but I will address some of the criticism that has been directed towards the movie. Actress Viola Davis has since distanced herself from the movie saying that it did not provide voices for the black characters in the film. It seems such an odd thing to say, and you wonder if she actually watched the movie. Because yes a white character is used as a sort of framing device - the movie is all about the lives of these women who have to live within the framework of this rich, white, very racist society. Maybe her criticism is because we do not see major events in the lives of the black characters in the film, we only hear about them, whereas we do see major events in the white characters lives. But I think instead of criticizing this film for what it is, why not make another film about the same character but focusing on those aspects of her life? So in short I wasn't expecting to enjoy the film, but I ended up liking it.",

338,12 August 2011,zadkine,9, Prettified but Powerful,"""Steel Magnolias"" without the syrup? It's better than that, but it looks like that. Too many pretty people, too many scenes with heavy-handed and romanticized art direction, a bit sugary at times, but how can you complain when the acting is terrific and the story is so compelling? For the first time in a major film, the focus is on how white women treated black women during the era of Jim Crow. Rather than another harrowing portrayal of the horrors of racism involving white men treating black men badly, very badly, we see something that is every bit as disturbing. White women, many of them, degrading and demeaning black women, many of them, in so many small and cruel ways that it makes you ashamed. Much of it is painful to watch, and it's mostly done with soul-killing looks and words, very ugly words. All of the insults, dirty looks, callous remarks...it's a shocking reminder about the banality of evil. Amazing performances. Hope it's shown in every high school in America.",
339,13 August 2011,lisa-629,9, Better than the book!,"This is the first time in my life I have ever liked the movie version better than the book. I finished the book the night before seeing the movie. The book left a lot of unanswered story lines, and it also left Hilly on top, with no one really telling her what a piece of trash she really is. The film does an excellent job of incorporating a majority of the book, while adding two scenes where Hilly finally has someone tell her what an a$$hole she really is. I rank the movie a 9 out of 10 because it really is almost perfect. It has Emma Stone as Skeeter trying to break out as a writer by tackling the hot button topic of segregation from the view point of the help. Both supporting characters-Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer-carry the wisdom and truly make you question how racist morons in the south as high up as the governor were able to reign supreme for so long. Skeeter's mother-Allison Janney-lit up the screen. She is the souther belle that has also been dealt a pretty harsh case of cancer that has left her losing her hair and her speed, but she still pushes for the best for her little girl, and in the end proves to be proud of her daughter for being such a courageous writer and human being. Now we have Hilly Holbrook-Bryce Dallas Howard-the villain of the film. I LOVED her in this role. The very sight of her on screen turned my stomach every time. She is a self proclaimed Christian southern belle, but is in reality an ignorant racist that enjoys controlling all her friends and pretty much everything in her life and everyone else's life. She enjoys treating the help terribly, it appears to genuinely make her happy. This is where the book failed terribly. The book had Hilly come out on top, with no one ever really giving it to her. The movie is redeeming, and I cried numerous times throughout. I see numerous Oscar nominations in its future.",

345,3 September 2011,Snichols12392,6, Emotionally Helpful,"One can't help but cheer for maids everywhere. This wonderfully adapted screenplay is leaving audiences everywhere with a heavy heart and a clean mind, spotless actually. Director and Screenwriter Taylor Tate transfers the reality and accuracy of the book, The Help, exceptionally and also maintains emotional congruency that leaves this movie masterful. The quality of actors and the acting in this picture supersedes every conceivable disappointment. During the somewhat clichéd version of a 1960's setting, that leaves something to be desired, an upper class white woman, Emma Stone, writes a tell all novel of black maids and their point of views of working for white families. Emma Stone as Skeeter Phelan is exactly what every audience needs, a good old fashioned beating heart, underneath a beautiful complexion. The believable love portrayed by Viola Davis, as Aibileen Clark, is remarkable and one can't help but feel for the black maids who dedicate their lives to serving these families. Along with beautifully exercising the relationships surrounding Jackson, Mississippi, The Help provides comical arousal. The ""Terrible Awful"" is probably one of the funniest practical jokes ever portrayed in a film of this nature. The comedic timing is just like a perfect slice of chocolate pie. It would be impossible to purchase what this movie provides, which is the raw emotional passion that you can only find with ""The Help.""",

But: between the lines of the mothers kindness is still her readiness to dismiss a serving slave Constantin when she believes it is needed. And still decides the Hilly Holbrooks over Jacksons mind. Aibeleens reason to help is: 'God.' Is the preachers: ""See, courage isn't just about being brave. Courage is daring to do what is right in spite of the weakness of our flesh. And God tells us, commands us, compels us to love. Amen. See, love as exemplified by our Lord Jesus Christ, is to *bent yourself in harm's way for our fellow man. And by your fellow man I mean your brother, your sister, your neighbor, your friend and your enemy. If you can love your enemy, you already have the victory"" As children the white are colorblind, listening to Abi's: ""You is kind, you is smart, you is important"". And Miss Skeeter remembers what Constantin told her. Her mother did not choose her life, it picked her. But you, you're gonna do something big with yours. You wait and see."" The movies American message is mirror clear: it depends on you what you do. The three woman as for runners: as maid, as writer, as journalist can you do it as long you do not accept on you property: ""You know Hilly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been eating too much 'pie'.""",

356,31 January 2015,khemass,9, One entertaining film with gentle message,"I and my family enjoyed watching this film. It's a delicious blend of laughter and tears, hope and fear, and ended with a good message. Just like everyone else, I agree that this is a great cast, many of them delivering subtle and powerful performances. Although there are sad moments, heartbreaking moments, there are also very funny moments too. You can feel humanity resonating here and there. The story is not dark. There is hope, there is a trust in the good side of people, a warm feeling from friendship and humanity that comfort your heart a whisper that says ""love will conquer in the end."" The villain, Hilly, was an excellent example of the pharisees and their hypocrisy.She presents herself as the most godly woman in the community but actually she is the most godless person among them. Hilly is presented in contrast with Celia, who is a little crazy and unmannered, but very sincere and sweet. This film shows us love, hatred, patience, honesty, courage, and after all...love your enemy. :)",

Would have loved to have seen more scenes and more about Constatine. This period piece really looks the period. Early 60's. Kudos to the art direction. While all the ladies do an outstanding job with their roles, it's Jessica Chastain as a Marilyn Monroe ditz character who really shines. See her in THE DEBT and then this. You'd never know it's the same actress. The New Meryl Streep. For all those who compare this and all movies based on novels: This is a movie...NOT THE BOOK. Any movie adapted from a book is just a condensed Readers Digest version of said title. No way can any movie include everything that the book entails. Take PEYTON PLACE.

It shows that there can be good found in people, as well as hate.

This is as she filches some deviled eggs, which are for the party, and pops one into her mouth, laughing as the other maid says don't take from this plate, take from that one.

362,15 May 2012,doisbuzianos,4, Disappointed,"Down here in Brazil, we -- or at least I -- had the impression that this movie was going to make some subtle observations as to the employer/domestic relationship. It was looked forward to as a contribution to comparative ethnography. What a surprise! The movie was neither dramatic enough to be a drama nor comic enough to be a comedy. Pity Divine from the old John Waters movies wasn't still alive to do the part of Hilly. At the conclusion of ""Pink Flamingos"" many decades ago, Divine did a memorable star turn with dirt the dog had left behind, so Divine might have brought some dimension and resonance to the heavy-handed scene in which Hilly eats chocolate cake, whereas the performance by the little Hollywood actress, whoever she is, had barely enough richness for a remake of National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. Audiences aren't resentful of being hammered with the obvious seven times over? E.g., that Aibeleen, not the white woman, is the standard-issue cute toddler's only real mother? As for the repeated returns to the face of the wounded child in the window, shameless, shameless, shameless. Anyone with a serious interest in employer/domestic relations -- and not merely in smugly being on the right side of a battle that, at least in the terms stated, was won a long time ago -- would do well to get hold of the Brazilian film Domésticas, which I believe is in video stores in the U.S. under the title Maids.",
363,27 May 2012,terrellrobinson71,9, A celebration! A miracle that is both entertaining and lyrical.,"Whatever happened to the old-fashioned films that didn't need special effects, talking animals or huge action scenes? Relax, here's one to help you calm your nerves. The movie ""The Help"", based on the best-selling novel (that me and my mom read) by Kathryn Stockett, is just as lyrical and enjoyable as the book itself. Being a movie that is 146 minutes long, you have to give credit to Tate Taylor, who is not only the screenwriter and director of the film, but is also Stockett's childhood friend who definitely promised to stay true to her book without falling apart. Set in the segregated, 1960's Jackson, Mississippi, the story follows three women: 2 African-American maids, Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer, in her breakout, Oscar-winning performance) and Skeeter (Emma Stone from ""Easy A""), a white college-grad who wants to be a writer, but ends up writing a cleaning column for the local newspaper. Aibileen hasn't seen much hope in her life after her son, Treelore passed away years ago. She's basically tired of working for white women who are basically racist toward the maids and don't like raising their own children. All she wants is for her stories to be told. This comes into the point of Skeeter, who had a maid, Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who disappeared years ago. She also has to have a controlling mother (Allison Janney) and doesn't want to be controlled by her or her friend Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard), who, along with her friends in the Junior League, happens to be racist as well. Skeeter comes up with an idea to write a book about what it's like for a African-American woman working as a maid. When Aibileen and Minny join this ""secret"" project, this proves to be a great idea by changing and breaking the rules and the society in which they lived by, angering Hilly and surprising everybody in this small Southern town. ""The Help"" is NOT a chick flick, to be clear. This is a movie for everybody and it is a movie that a mother and her son can enjoy together (I should know because me and my mom loved it). It has great characters, a warm heart, and something for us to believe in: Hope. I was definitely anticipated to see this movie right after I read the book and I had no idea that this movie would actually become a big hit. Now we know. The all-star cast is electrifying. Emma Stone is amazing as Skeeter. The character Hilly in the book is more of a snobby Southern diva who wants just segregation and how everything should be done her way. Bryce Dallas Howard does play it, but adds a few sides of her to show that there are some good things about her. (I basically loved her and her comeuppances). Jessica Chastain is perfect as Celia Foote, a Southern belle who is basically being shunned by Hilly and her group, but finds a friend in Minny. Now for the scene-stealers: Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. They are excellent when you see them. Davis captures her shining moment yet in her first leading role, bringing light and hope for Aibileen. Spencer is hilarious and warmhearted as Minny, who has some secrets that has to be kept somewhere secret. If there was a movie that has to be talked about other than ""The Hunger Games"", I choose this one because it is funny, sweet and it feels so authentic to the period and you want to be cheering for the three women for making a change and finding courage in their lives. I think this movie itself is a dream come true for anyone hoping to tell their stories. What a miraculous movie. What a celebration.",

I believe that the directors created this film with so much respect to all races. No matter what race you are, so much can be learned from the story line of this film. Although this film was based on times that we no longer live in, it did an excellent job portraying it in a way where viewers could relate, understand, and be entertained. This film is not just to bring awareness to past history, but it is also a film that contains different scenes that will make you laugh so hard, scenes that will make you fall in love, and scenes that will make you cry of both sorrow and joy. It is unbelievable that such a great, appropriate, and family friendly movie, can contain all the factors that us as viewers enjoy to sit back and watch. I definitely recommend this film to everyone!

I was not only impressed by her, but by the entire cast. I'll admit I have not read the book but the movie was so good that I can assume it does it justice. Although this film deals with a tough subject it manages to find humor amidst the struggles.

There is nothing extraordinary about it, it is just so easy to identify the bad people and you tend to like hating the bad guys. It is easy to follow the plot and is predictable. It follows stereotyped characters which is disappointing: The white Male does what is expected of him and of course the leading female character is liberated (even in 60s) we can not possibly have any deviation at all there. This type of writing takes humanity out of the movie; that is, the characters are politically correct sanitized and pasteurized for today's activist groups.

While the story is especially moving, we have been down this road before in MUCH better films... EXAMPLE, check out the movie that came out in 1990 ""The Long Walk Home"" which was pretty much ignored at the time... with Whoppi Goldberg (when she was an Oscar nominated actress fresh off Color Purple) and very ironically; Sissy Spacek! Whoppi that year won the supporting actress Oscar for ""Ghost"" (well deserved for a predominantly comedic performance...no complaints there)...just she was ignored for a best actress Oscar nod for a performance in LWH that mirrors Viola's performance. If you loved The Help, see Long Walk Home. One other beef... I can understand that current audiences love a good poop, bathroom humor joke in a comedy (most recently ""Bridesmaids""). But in a drama as this, was there are more creative way to make the point of the pie eating scene? This movie goes for high drama and settles for sophomoric humor in that one part. That to me is pretty sad, as was attention and detail to the period. Emma Stone's hair with products with Aveda products to enhance and shine her curls, to make her look like she is on the cover of a 2001 Vogue? Looks like she just stepped out a Beverly Hills salon. Does not look like a girl of the period. Minor maybe, rest of period seems pretty well depicted ... unless I missed something else.

Fine performances, overly-fine sets. That being said, good idea to mythologise the past, surely! But not without impacting the present, in other words, it is too easy to feel good coming away from this. In moral terms, it is nearly a black-and-white (no pun intended) presentation of the era, distancing itself too easily from messier, greyer reality.

With tremendous performances from Viola Davis and Emma Stone, it brought tears just hearing the words they say. The acts of selfishness from the main antagonist Hilly is quite harsh. It made me think that if it were me, I would fight right back. But this movie is not just very dramatic. It had very funny moments where a maid bakes a pie for Hilly and says that it is her feces although it isn't. The help is an example of what we don't realize. We don't realize what goes on in our real lives. We don't see that people are getting abused behind our backs. ",

403,26 September 2012,geoff33,10," ""The Help"" is one for the Ages","I enjoyed the movie because it followed a logical sequence that captured the genuine vernacular of the period. The attitudes of the characters in the movie are not fictitious; they represent the real attitudes of an oppressing group. The condescending stereotypes and attitudes did not die with the end of the era, some of the accompanying lifestyles did. Some of the families who employed house cleaners and other domestic help were not rich or even middle class people. They under paid their help with sub-minimum wages and expected much more return than investment. They enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle at the expense of the black domestic workers who served for little pay. The most important aspect of ""The Help"" is the moral implications of how domestic workers affected the lives of the children they raised, befriended, and loved. Despite the mistreatment they often endured, many of the workers attached themselves emotionally and the families rarely reciprocated. Some of the young children identified with the domestic service providers more than they could relate to their own biological parents. The maids often instilled a strong sense of self-esteem and a proud, but healthy, confidence into the children they raised for white people while they struggled to do the same at home. The dichotomy between their surrogate roles within white homes and their reality often produced major psychological torture and emotional turmoil. The same superior attitude that demands special privilege and entitlement prevails today, but the issue is no longer just black and white nor is it confined to the South. ""The Help"" dares to scratch the surface that illustrates a mild realization of the actual degradation imposed upon an innocent cross section of American society. I highly recommend this movie to every American who likes history, especially in light of our society's preoccupation and fascination with many aspects of the lifestyles of the rich and famous. This movie will serve as moral tonic and a dose of reality for families and school aged children old enough to understand.",

I would think it would take some courage on the part of Bryce Dallas Howard to play the role she was cast in, as most people, upon viewing, might be tempted to see her as the ""Godless woman"" that she portrays. I always have a little extra respect for those actors all while I'm struggling not to yell at their characters through the screen. The highlight performance to me, however, is Jessica Chastain, who depicts an individual incredibly lovable in her naiveté. She just doesn't realize that black people are supposed to be viewed as second class citizens by their white - and superior (<-- sarcasm) - counterparts, which makes her the most easily likable character in the movie (to me).",

436,5 June 2012,bobdobbs888,9, No Summary,"Two main things about this film. First is the matter of 'radical' politics, leftist politics — or, just plain, and frequently, as here, obvious truth. Common sense truth. In a crazy context such as our world of the 'masculine' principle dominating in a 'Domination Reality', truth looks funny, if it appears at all. Just attempting to tell the King he is naked puts that argument at several kinds of risks of being misunderstood. The best approach is to create a truthful world elsewhere and not participate in the Domination World except to leave FROM it (and to understand rather than be understood). ----------— From what I've just said, my point can be clearly seen. A secondary criticism of the film is the resemblance it has to classic 'Liberal (/Progressive) presentations; it looks manipulative. It 'looks' this way generally because the status quo Domination has the tilted playing field set as level. With out larger context we say ""People are the same everywhere, survival of the fittest"" etc. The obvious truths like in this film, as well as all the rest, our World doesn't even recognize. So we cant speak. ""I must scream but I have no mouth"", paraphrasing.-------–The other thing about ""The Help"" is the central emphasis on the key concept of domination in general — to dominate is to be/become dominated. This happens throughout, but is more obvious at extremes; like in this film with parenting forced on slaves who become the real Parent. This is nicely shown and is put central, where it belongs. -------–Btw, southern broads, yes, are generally just like these ditzes — they're not exaggerated.-----–The two main black women's acting is extremely good. -------- If this film were done in a more realistic and serious style it would be too hard to watch. Impossible to watch — the world would end.",

So we know it's fictional and nothing has changed. The story is of an aspiring newspaper reporter come writer returning from New York to Jackson and see's the opportunity to write a book on 'The Help' the black maids who raised the white children of the south but were unable to look after their own or indeed use the toilet facilities within the house. There is no doubt this is a well told story and to not be moved would possibly put you amongst the red necks.

We were not rich, very much not, but my Mom had a made I think once or twice a week and Gertrude kept us whenever Mom and Dad went out. We loved her. She told us funny stories, rocked us and tucked us in. We were always kind to her. I never knew about this side of her life ... I was a child and not aware. The stories here moved me very much and sometimes I smiled and laughed and sometimes I cried. It was sooo well done and in spite of the hardships shown here, really heart warming at times.",

However, I walked out of the theater not only wanting to see it again, but wanting to go pick up the book immediately. I was thinking here we go, another ""Blind Side"". Typical white character helps poor helpless black character as they build a bond. I was wrong.

476,13 August 2011,himelda,10, Wonderful portrayal of complicated intercations reflecting the complications of real life situations.,"I recommend this movie. The story, the production, the casting and the film techniques are wonderful. The story is easy to follow and entertaining and at the same time it presents a portray of real life that is full of complications. A young women writer approaches the difficult task of presenting the lives of the ""help"" in a southern town from the perspective of ""the help."" A group of rich ladies who like and dislike each other are presented as real life persons who need to carry out expected roles with aggravation, with respect and with lack of respect in their interactions with the help. You feel like you were there seeing the story develop but at the same time the movie allows you to be critical of the reality of the time. The southern ladies are portrayed in a manner that shows their pros and cons. They are the well dressed, dedicated wives who have to have a perfect home and at the same time they are the daughters and wives of less than perfect family members. The maids are hard working, dedicated, and they love the children they care for but at the same time they feel trapped and it is hard for them to be loyal to their bosses. The movie manages to show several sides of the same story with a nicely flowing rhythm that is captivating and does not allow the viewer a brake. You are in the movie for a whole two hours.",

The Help according to me is one of the best movies to have come out in recent times. Right from the performances to the storytelling everything was just next to PERFECT. There are moments in the movie when you will cry and there are moments when you will laugh and isn't that what storytelling is all about. The movie is about how the African American maids were treated during the time of the civil rights movement But the movie has so many layers that it hits at so many levels. Most of the stories in the movie are about how there existed discrimination during that time and how the African American COLORED maids were treated by the families they worked for but it also gives beautiful examples of some employers being good to their maids and a different kind of discrimination which exists for a girl who has just gotten married rich and is considered WHITE TRASH. So you see discrimination in so many forms: discrimination because of skin color, discrimination because of wealth and other forms. The relationship these maids have with the children that aren't theirs is also beautiful. There are so many scenes that move the viewer especially the one in which Constantine is fired and Cicely Tyson is just so fine in the scene where she makes an impact without even opening her mouth with no lines at all. This one is sure going to my favorites list. Please don't miss it. It would touch you at so many levels that you would feel that why you hadn't seen it earlier.",

Emma Stone as Skeeter was just perfect and so was Hilly, Abilene and Minny. Brave women such as these were the backbone of the civil rights movement. This movie acts as a powerful vehicle to show us all how senseless and stupid racism is; look out your ignorance is showing. And I noticed that the men in the audience were just as engrossed in the story as were the women even though the plot revolves mainly around women. Lastly, I was impressed with the baby girl in the movie. Anyone know who she is? She's going to be one h@ll of an actress someday.",

It was not, in my opinion. The film seemed to drag on and on; was over & I was still waiting for something to happen (it never did). The ladies who starred in the film were great, but it just didn't 'take off'. There were some sad parts, for sure, but nothing that I'd call 'belly laugh' funny; nothing really 'got 'em by the nuts', either. I bought this movie; missed as it aired in theaters. I thought it would be a 'see-more-than-once' movie. It wasn't. I feel as if I wasted money on the DVD purchase. I would not recommend this as a 'must see' movie - even with the great casting!

493,24 July 2013,jahs495,4, Don't Agree,"I do not agree with most of this film! If I had a maid that stole a ring and hocked it, I would fire her too. Also when the maids are walking down the isle in the grocery store taking up the whole isle, that is not right. They make it look like it was the white woman's fault. It wasn't!! When Minnie makes the pie, that is totally rubbish, if you did that in real life you would most likely die! get Cohlera, or EColi. I do not think that was funny at all. If someone really did that, it would be disastrous. The big fuss they made about the outside bathroom was over blown too. She should have been glad she had one at all, and not a outhouse. Also when Skeeter gets a job and he only pays her what was it, 5.00 a week? Thats ridiculous! the maids were making more than she was. Cause Viola said she was paid 95cents an hour or something like that. Just figure it out, thats more than five dollars a week. True the actress that played Minnie, did a fantastic job and well deserved the Oscar. I think the whole movie was misleading and false. Doesn't the writer know we can add?",

495,20 August 2011,AimSabSmoke-1,8, A solid film,"You will hear people critique this film on the basis of race among other things. Let me be the first to tell you, these critiques are without merit. People may say it is too watered down and doesn't convey the violence of the African American experience. This film does NOT depict the experience of all African Americans. It depicts the experiences of a subset of the race as seen through a white woman's eyes. This is how the author related to the story. As the audience, we see it as she sees it. Other people may say it is just another movie depicting black women in subservient roles. They were! Especially these women! While the story itself is false, it closely mirrors the stories of many southern families. Perhaps what these critics should be concerned with certain other films marketing racist images toward a largely black audience! The performances in this film are incredible. The writing is strong. It is sensitive to issues of gender and race alike. Overall a very moving experience at the movies.",

500,12 September 2012,bellopaula,9, The American Civil Rights Movement,"Last week we watched a film which was absolutely amazing and made a great contribution to our general knowledge. We can mention some data: Title: The Help Genre: Drama Author: Tate Taylor; kathryn Stockett Director: Tate Taylor Actors: Emma Stone, Viola Davies, Octavia Spencer Characters: Skeeter, Aibileen, Minnie Plot: During the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960's, Skeeter decided to write a book detailing the African American maids' point of view on the white families for which they worked. The most important thing was the hardships they go through every day. Aibileen and Minnie were brave enough and they could demonstrate how they were treated by the white people. They made a big change. Reflection: Through the film and the text we read, we learned how black people were treated in 1960's. Racism and discrimination were the most important themes of that period. The film showed us that if you really want something, you have to fight for it no matter the consequences. It also taught us to love our enemy, not to fight with violence. The best way to overcome any problems is praying for them. White and Black people are the same, because we were created by God with the same dignity. For that reason, we have to love and respect each other. This film is worth seeing because we can learn many values.",

It's the point of view we see all this. This movie give us all a little more understanding about the apartheid. We meet this young girl, Skeeter who's brave enough to listen to a voice who's not normally heard. It meant much at that time to not being friends with the ""blacks"" and Skeeter is then interviewing them anonymously. The movie shows us also the heartbreaking relationship Skeeter have to her ""house-helper"". She comes to a shock in the movie where she finally gets the explanation why she left. The movie shows some clips about their relationship and it's so heartwarming and so kind. What I also liked about the movie, was that you learn you have to stand up for those who don't have a voice, and how important it is to make a difference, no matter how small or big. What I missed was that some of Skeeter white friends should have stand up and join her in some way. There's much portrayal of what is fair and about consequences. I wished Skeeter's mom would have had a bigger development during the movie. We see that she's all about other opinions about her, and I wished she just gave that up and supported Skeeter in the end. If you see the movie, you will understand all this.",

They reveal how they are treated as well as the secrets of the families they work for. This film in set in the 1960's Civil Rights era. It is two-sided in that it shows there were white families and people that were in favor for equal treatment of African Americans. The film is able to convey messages of equality in an uplifting tone through use of comic relief. The scenery of Mississippi provides beautiful views throughout the film. Emma Stone is a fun character and seems really genuine with the interviewees. Viola Davis (who plays Abileine, a maid) is an amazing actor making the film more realistic. In summary, I would recommend this film to those who are interested in historical films as well as people who enjoy Emma Stone as an actor.",
504,15 April 2015,jamesmorton-198-353688,7, An inspirational movie!,"The Help is an amazing movie. It incorporates relationship struggles, historical events, and funny comedy all into one, two hour movie. I have now watched this movie two times and have decided there are two ways to watch the film. One way is you can watch the film by seeing it as a cute story about black and whites becoming friends during a time of inequality and oppression. There are plenty laughable parts of the movie making it light hearted and a feel good movie for the weekend. Another way to watch the movie is by looking at the more complex issues of the movie. This movie is set during a time when there was not equality. Not only were black people oppressed, but so were women. This movie focuses on both black and white women and the struggles they faced living in a society dominated by white males. The fear, hopelessness, and courage shown in this movie illustrates the times of the Civil Rights movement when so many black people were afraid yet felt the need to fight for a better future. There are plenty complex issues of feminism, racial injustice, and relationship struggles introduced in this movie making it very meaningful. However, the comedy, amazing acting, and outrageous characters makes this a movie accessible and enjoyable even to those of us who are not history buffs. I would recommend watching this movie!",
505,17 April 2015,ktohman,7, Very interesting!,"This was a wonderful and moving film. Throughout the duration of the movie, I laughed, I cried, I clapped, I cringed with discomfort and squirmed with anticipation. The range of emotions I experienced can be credited to not only the excellence of the story writing but the quality of the acting and the personality of the actors chosen to portray each role. I especially appreciated that the focus was to develop the characters of the maids as opposed to the white ladies that they worked for. This allows for a consistency between the main character's goal to write from the Negro perspective and the goal of the film itself. Unfortunately, it seems that some critics think that this film and storyline are not realistic. It has been criticized for simplifying the complex race relations and omitting the various forms of violence that characterize the time period.",
506,14 April 2015,gabriellkolmercc16,8, Extremely emotional heartwarming movie,"The help is a film full of emotion, and hope, telling the story of the black housemaids in southern Mississippi and their relationships with their white employers. A college graduate of Ole Miss, aspiring journalist and society woman of Mississippi, Skeeter Phalen, goes to work on a piece that evolves into a sort of exposé on the help and their relationships and feelings toward their white counterparts. Throughout the movie you are taken on a journey of highs, and lows, that is very emotion evoking. Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson are the two main maids that Skeeter gets her information and stories from, however once they start talking, many more women tell their stories as well. There is a background element of the secret that Skeeters mother is keeping about the mysterious disappearance of Skeeter's family's own housemaid which is just another one of many elements that keep you wrapped around the story and wanting more. The whole story serves as a kind of hopeful element of this time, among the tragedy that is touched on throughout the movie, it doesn't seem to focus so much highlighting the very terrible ways that whites treated their black slaves in this time, but rather on the fact that through the use of Skeete and her sympathy and interest toward the help that not all white people were terrible people back then, which serves as the element of hope for society throughout the movie. Overall I was very impressed with this film and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in historical happenings of this nature, or are just in the mood for a heartwarming story.",

Although the reality of the South was much worse than the movie portrays, I believe the movie carries out all the ideas it involves with great proficiency. The Help shows an attitude of love even towards those who hate and hurt those you love and even yourself. It shows a persevering way of life and creates an environment of hardships and despair with JFK's assassination and the death of the main characters son, to demonstrate how awful life was, especially for African Americans, in this time. Furthermore, nonviolent ways of life is shown, allowing the historical fact that nonviolent actions were what changed generations (ie, the actual book The Help written in the movie). Overall, I greatly appreciate the timeline and plot of this movie and find it to be incredibly inspiring.",
508,13 April 2015,caleblyon98,9, Tells the story of black maids in the south before the Civil Rights movement,"The Help is a story about black maids in Jackson, Mississippi who are mistreated by their white bosses. However, there is a young white journalist who wants to help them by writing a collection of stories of what their life is like. Originally she has a hard time getting people to volunteer to share their stories, because it is very risky. However she manages to get lots of volunteers in the end and she published her book. Fortunately for the maids, they aren't punished because their bosses are afraid to admit that the stories are about Jackson, because there are embarrassing stories. Specifically about how one of the bosses ate a pie made out of her maids poop. This is a great movie for seeing how African Americans were mistreated in the South for so long. It is ridiculous that the whites believe that they can't use the same toilets as blacks because they carry certain disease, yet they allow them to take care of their children.",
509,9 April 2015,Lyon-josiah,7, Good movie about discrimination in the South,"This was a very good movie. It was interesting to see what's life was like for African- Americans back then and what they had to go through. It was crazy that they were treated that way and that they couldn't even use the same toilets because they thought it would spread disease. It was cool and inspirational to see how one person could make a difference just by telling other people about what it was like. It was also strange to see how dangerous it was just to share their experiences and how it could have very serious consequences. It was inspirational though that they were brave and did it anyways, especially Skeeter who didn't really have anything to gain by challenging the norm. Overall it was a very good movie, even though it was pretty sad.",
510,15 April 2015,amrisewick95,10, A Heartwarming Film,"The Help is an extraordinary film that makes the viewer laugh, cry, and has every minute of their attention. Unlike some Civil Right's movies that take a more serious route, The Help is more light hearted where it ties together an ""unlikely"" friendship that would occur during its time period, yet is still very effective to get its moral across. Together, Skeeter's ambition, Aibileen's generous heart, and Minny's wit, spark a ""revolutionary"" movement across Jackson, Mississippi. The Help not does not just focus on the life of the 3 main characters, but draws attention to their help and support to main people in their lives, such as Aibileen's nurture in trying to boost little Mae Mobley's self esteem, who is imperfect to her mother, (Aibileen' tells Mae: ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important""), Minny's own nurturing of her employer, Celia Foote, as well as Skeeter's attempt to nurture her relationship with Stuart. The Help is truly a beautiful film that captures the concept of equality for all, and that friendships matter solely on acceptance and care, rather than race or ethnicity.",

It's a movie, if you've not seen it; you need to add it to your to-do list now. Go! Add the book to your summer reading list along with 'Murder Behind Closed Doors,' by Jere Myles, a similar story about characters who refuse to be invisible in a society that would be more comfortable if they were. It's a simple story, set in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early 60s. You don't need a history lesson about what's going on, but it's an education for those who've never heard the word colored used to refer to anyone who was not white. I grew up in Tennessee, and it was like a walk home, and when Aibilene tells Skeeter, who wants to write about the help, she'd never had a white person in her house, it was like ""I can't either."" Ironically, the movie for me was somewhat reminiscent of Whoopi Goldberg's ""The Long Walk Home."" ",

However, I still truly appreciated the performances, the funny moments and certainly the heartfelt moments that elicited some of my tears. The two biggest differences between the book and movie were the tone and lack of character depth, save the characters of Aibeleen and Minny. Although Skeeter was lovable, Celia cute and Stuart, well, he just made a couple of short appearances, none were captured in a way that truly showed the core of who they were nor explained their treatment of others within the story. *SPOILER* In the movie you see Minny showing Celia how to cook fried chicken, however in the book, their cooking lessons took place every day and cemented their bonding and friendship. As well, the side story in the book where Celia literally saves Minny's life is completely left out of the movie. All in all, the movie was a beautiful story filled with laughs and extraordinary performance by the lovely ladies who played Aibeleen, Minny, Hilly and Celia. I would recommend seeing this to anyone with sensitive sensibilities. Although there were a few men in the full theatre I was in, I am hesitant to say that ""even your guy"" will love it.

529,19 March 2023,alexysfarmer,10, An enlightening story...,"The Central insight of this film is racism and inequality amongst other minor themes as well like classism. Social life plays a big part as well in this film because not only does this film provide a racial theme but shows how the higher classes operated with other lower classes. A film that has the same and or similar central insights as this film would be hidden figures made in 2008. This film exudes racial inequality, sexism and many other themes. This film also allows for improvement to be made both socially and morally and humanly. There were multiple techniques used within this film that helped bring forth the central insight. One example would be through camera angles. Within the first 10 minutes of this film we see the use of the extreme long shot. In this scene skeeter, one of the main characters, Is driving home from college in her car and all you see is the dirt road she's driving on as well as all of the land surrounding it grass and fades out into an extreme long shot.(00:04:10) Another camera angle used was the three shot technique. This scene shows hilly Holbrook her mother and made many leaving the Holbrook home to go to the bridge event. We see first hilly Holbrook walking first and then straight line and behind her her mother and lastly maybe Jackson. This shows the dynamic of boss and employee as well as white and black at that time as some whites believed that they were superior to color people so they established themselves in a higher rank in order to hold the power in a sense.

537,29 January 2012,lilpeanut990,9, Review,"The Help is a great movie to see that I would definitely recommend to anyone! It was written and directed by Tate Taylor. The Help is an entertaining, funny, touching, and moving film that keeps your attention the whole way through. It opens up our minds and takes us back to that time period of the Civil Rights Movement. The movie takes place in the South where the whites are upper class. The actors did a phenomenal job with portraying their characters. One of the main characters played by Viola Davis is a ""maid"" to a white family. But as the movie goes along a viewer soon realizes that the term ""maid"" becomes irrelevant. The maids are more like nannies than anything else. Not only do they cook and clean, but they also raise the children in these families like they are one of their own. I definitely recommend it to anyone, the whole production team produced a great film and you really felt as if you were taken back to that time period.",

This movie shows both sides of the racial segregation in the 1960s. It shows the hardships of the African-American maids and how they coped with their situations. Likewise the movie also showed the Caucasians' moral dilemma as they were faced with either siding with the truth that ingratiation is the answer or continuing with the old ways of segregation. While racial tension plays a major role in The Help, it contains comic relief to alleviate the harsh tone of the message communicated by the movie, but also maintaining the message's integrity.",

541,7 February 2012,mandyson246,7, The Help is a must see.,"The Help is smart, witty, scandalous and a tear-jerker all in one. Tate Taylor took a risky chance writing a movie that brought us back to a dark period in American history due to racism an inequality. He did a very good job creating the experience of the movie to be surprisingly light- hearted and touching. With help from leading actresses Viola Davis, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney; these women did an incredible job making the Mississippi, Southern style of life come alive. The movie explains the relationships between African American maids during the 1960s and their families they provided for. With constant care taking, daily routines and chores many of the maids went about their lives saying very few words to the white folks. When Miss Skeeter Phelan, a University grad with a passion for writing, comes back to town, she stirs up a hot pot of drama. Persuading the maids to tell-all about their unspoken stories and redemption towards white families they have worked for, may have sounded like a good idea at the time. Lets just say that some thoughts are better off not spoken. The passion and friendship Skeeter shows towards these women is truly touching and heart-warming. This movie shows how the determination of one person can change the lives of many. At some point everyone is forced to make the choice of either staying with or breaking the status quo. The light humor and strong Southern accents will definitely keep you intrigued throughout the entire movie. The Help is a must see.",

544,27 April 2012,april-kobus,9, Leaves all that watch a sense of urgency to stand up for what they believe in,"The Help, based off of the 2009 novel by Kathryn Stockett, tells a story of three courageous women who join together to uncover ways they are mistreated as African American housemaids in the 1960's. Taking place in Jackson, Mississippi, these types of actions were unheard of. If caught, the members of ""the help"" would face arrest, never be able to find work again, and be shun from the city, however this did not stop them telling their story. Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan, played by Emma Stone, has just graduated from college and come back to her hometown. After scoring her first job as a cleaning advice columnist which she is clueless about, she turns to Aibileen (Viola Davis) who is the African American housemaid of an old old childhood friend. to ask for advice. In doing so, she begins to notice how poorly Aibileen and other members of the help are treated, inspiring her to write a novel though the eyes of the help. Skeeter knows the dangers this can cause for Aibileen, ignores the consequences. After much convincing, Aibileen agrees to help, eventually recruiting her best friend Minny (Octivia Spencer) and other maids to join in the fight against the cities unjust treatment of the help. The writing of this book soon becomes much more than any of the women involve could have imagined, giving each of the maids a voice as well as a chance to finally tell the world what was seldom spoken of. It transforms into an important movement that was able to change the entire city of Jackson, Mississippi and the lives of all housemaids around the state. ",

551,24 September 2014,schornak-rachel,9," The outstanding cast and engaging emotions, make The Help a must see.","People want to believe that they have courage, but they are unwilling to speak against social norms for fear of rejection. In The Help, Skeeter, an ambitious, white writer tries to explain what it is like for black women to serve white families during the civil rights era. Due to the social separation between the two races, she faces many obstacles in an attempt to compile stories from maids, such as Aibileen and Minny. The film does a great job of explaining the social differences at the time, while still giving the audience a deeper meaning to consider. The dialogue creates distinctions between the white and black characters through a difference in education. Although all of the characters talk with a slight southern accent, the white characters speak with sophisticated vocabulary, while the African American characters sound uneducated. The quote, ""you is smart, you is kind, you is important,"" said by Aibileen, shows the limited education available for African Americans at the time. The way the different races talk about one another also indicates this separation. Hilly, a white housewife, insists on the necessity of separate bathrooms in houses due to the risk of catching ""black diseases."" The filmmakers make a point to show the different distinctions, giving the audience a better understanding of the social norms at the time. Through the use of heavy subject matter and humor, the filmmakers grab the audience's attention in an engaging way. The cruel accusations towards the maids, and brutality displayed by the white police officers, keep the film impactful, but the filmmakers incorporate humor to lift up the film's serious tone. Minny brings the humor to the film in her sassy comments. Humor is present when Minny tells Skeeter ""You ain't got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League. You done burned every bridge there is. And you ain't never gonna get another man in this town, everybody know that. So don't walk your white butt to New York, run it!"" The filmmakers set the tone through serious events, but develop a more unpredictable plot by including humor. The unpredictability adds to the film's overall enjoyable story. Through the acting of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the audience can better understand the characters they play. Viola Davis successfully portrays her character, Aibileen Clark, as a loving, hardworking individual. Davis delivers her lines with a tired voice, suggesting that she commits herself to her job. We also get the idea that her character is good with kids by the way she lights up around her boss' child, Mae Mobley. Davis is able to change her delivery to fit the scene. Octavia Spencer entertains the audience with her sassy interpretation of Minny Jackson. Spencer does this through mannerisms, such as pursing her lips, standing with her hands on her hip, and rolling her eyes. These mannerisms that Spencer uses add to the idea that her character is very head-strong. Octavia Spencer also delivers lines in a loud, bold manner. When Skeeter is interviewing Aibileen, Minnie storms into the scene and states, ""And just what makes you think colored people need your help? Why you care?"" Octavia does not hesitate before she delivers this line, adding to the confidence of her character. These actresses add believability to the film with their genuine portrayals of their roles. This film sets a precedent for future films discussing controversial topics such as the treatment of African Americans. This movie is not only entertaining, but it also sparks thought about how the audience treats others. It plays with the audience's emotions to ignite a passionate response to the subject of the movie.",

It goes through the lives of numerous people in Jackson, Mississippi. Although the transition from book to movie isn't perfect, the writers did a good job at including all the story lines and characters, showing the importance of each one no matter how little a role they had. A really emotional part was when Aibileen had to say goodbye to Mae Mobley at the end of the movie, knowing that she was the only good influence in the girl's life and that her mother wasn't able to take care of her the way she deserved. This scene was put together well and had just as much emotion in it as it did in the novel. The writers did a good job at showing the struggles Aibileen and Skeeter faced when trying to coordinate and get together to write the book about the poor conditions of ""The Help"" in white households. Overall, this movie is a good representation of what African Americans had to go through in the early to mid 1900s and I would recommend it to anyone.",
556,12 April 2015,minitucker,8, The Help Review,"Over all the movie I thought had a touching message and was brilliantly acted by all the actors that portrayed these characters. As a movie based of a book I say that they followed the book pretty well. The reason this movie did not get a perfect 10 from me will be very apparent if you look at the historical inaccuracy of the book. Although the movie does portray a broad range on the 1960 from Jim Crow laws to the KKK and even Kennedy's assassination it down played the way living in Mississippi in the 1960's would have been like. Instead of showing the horrificness of killing, rape, abuse, lynching and racial slurs it was substituted by mean hose wife's who crated drama. Although maid at that time were a lot closer the the children then their own mothers were it doesn't excuse the fact of the movie tiptoeing around what it was actually like down south. Another thing that they hovered around was the maids telling the story knew and told of why it was dangerous but the sense of the physical danger they could face was missing. Overall it was a well casted movie and very touching storyline but not historically portrayed well.",
