0,21 October 2012,Wuchakk,9, The spirit of freedom vs. the spirit of legal-ism,"Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.",/
1,14 January 2005,pyrocitor,10," Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once","I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.",r
2,3 July 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience","Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10",e
3,14 September 2004,philip_vanderveken,10," ""What an excellent movie"" is all that went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece","What a movie, what an excellent movie!!! That is what first went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece. I've seen many movies, but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.",v
4,20 July 2018,perica-43151,10, A masterpiece,"The seventies produced some of the most interesting and worthy Hollywood movies. Before the era of blockbusters, and ever increasing dumbing down of the cinema art by the Hollywood power-brokers and greedy moneymakers, there was this short but truly amazing window of time that produced many of the timeless gems. A great portrayal of oppression, this gem should not be overlooked by anyone. Truly recommended.",i
5,22 January 2000,Don-102,10, Poetic - Powerful - Simple: The Greatness of Cuckoo's Nest.,"The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak  glance at an Oregon morning.  Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches.  Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.   ""Randle McMurphy"" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as ""McMurphy"", is something of a paradox.  Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be?  That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.",e
6,13 August 2002,Agent10,9, Jack Nicholson at his finest,"It's tough to really judge this movie. Is it Milos Forman's greatest directorial masterpiece or Jack Nicholson's best performance. Tough to say, but the marriage between both director and actor are quite phenomenal. From the first time we see Jack Nicholson to the sad, yet uplifting ending, one cannot escape the sheer power of the film. When a film is parodied as many times as this one has been, typically, greatness can be associated. Well, greatness was achieved, and let's hope this one never falls through the cracks.",w
7,15 April 2000,Quinoa1984,10, Best film of its era,"Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a landmark (one of the few I might add) in cinema. Pretty much everything in this film is at or close to perfection. And rightfully so, it became only the 2nd (1 in 3 films in history along with It Happened One Night and Silence of the Lambs) film to win the top five Oscars- Best Picture, Actor (Jack Nicholson), Actress (Louise Fletcher), Director (Forman), and Screenplay (Bo Goldman).",/
8,18 June 2005,b1lskirnir,10, A great order vs. chaos tale that everyone can relate to,"Based on the amazing novel by Ken Kesey, Randall Patrick McMurphy is an antisocial and dangerous man no different than a petty criminal, placed in a mental ward to have his behavior studied. He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital, much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched, the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.",r
9,6 August 2005,Boba_Fett1138,9, A perfect mixture of entertainment and drama.,"Czech director Milos Forman seems to be obsessed with rebellious characters that don't like to go with the flow. Just think about Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or Andy Kaufman in ""Man on the Moon"", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.",w
10,8 March 2015,ironhorse_iv,9, You have to be crazy to hate this movie! This movie is a masterpiece,"Put a straightjacket on me, because I think this movie is insanely good! Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film. The movie has aged well, with newer DVD copies, putting out the best quality for it. Overall: The film is powerful, and moving. It's a must-watch. I recommended it.",4
11,15 January 2009,bkoganbing,10, The Ultimate Backfire,"It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.",0
12,13 March 2015,deloudelouvain,10, Extraordinary,This movie will always be one of my all time favorites and therefor I have to give it a maximum rating. It's one of those movies that will always stand the test of time. The whole cast are excellent actors. The constant mental battle between McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) is a delight to watch. You feel so much hate for nurse Ratched. All the other actors are brilliant in their roles. You kind of want to slap them in the face and wake them up to face reality. The daily routines in the mental institute would even drive a normal person completely bonkers. I saw this movie so many times without getting bored once. This is truly one of the best movies in that genre.,7
13,19 March 1999,MovieFan983,10, One Flew Over One of the Best Movies Ever Made!!! (And that person was me),"First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.",8
14,6 March 2009,planktonrules,10, A wonderful film,"Before I discuss this exceptional film, I need to point out that there is a lot of truth to this film if you are looking for what it was like in psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s and into the 60s. The hellish practices and dehumanization was definitely true of many facilities during this era. However, today, many of the horrific abuses are no longer relevant. So, while some will point to this film as proof that psychiatry in general is evil personified (such as the Scientologists), for the most part, this isn't the case today. Shock treatment is rarely done today and when it is, it's nothing like it is portrayed in the film and it actually has therapeutic value when all else fails. Lobotomies are also thankfully a thing of the past. So, while debating the pros and cons of hospitalization and medications is reasonable today, don't assume the film is in any way like psychiatric institutions today--many of which have been closed or severely reduced in size as well as the length of stay of the average patient.",6
15,14 August 2007,dataconflossmoor,10, Get Mad If You Want To! This Is Very Realistic!,"This is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. In 1975, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" swept all four major academy awards... Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) Best Direstor (Milos Foreman) and, of course, Best Picture!! Only on very rare occasion does this occur... Only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is a stunning portrayal of mental illness, and how even the most affluent nation on earth (The U.S.A.) is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... The array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. The emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers, directors, actors or actresses could partake in this film!! Such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the ""Booby Hatch"" you will be when you get out of it!! In the case of Jack Nicholson's character, he seemed relatively non-culpable for any intense psychiatric affliction, it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! It is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! The talent in this movie is incredible.. I liked the television show ""Taxi"" and it stands to reason why... So many of the actors who starred in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were in the T.V. Show ""Taxi"" too!! The gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! The line I remember in particular was ""Do me a favor and don't be on my side, okay""... In the ""normal"" world, the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! In the case of a poorly funded mental health facility, this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously, and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! Authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding, so they are quick to generalize!! The overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as ""sad"" and platitudes such as ""we will do all we can"" are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! Mental illness gets a generic label, and, from there, becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! Here is where the film ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!",7
16,9 July 2014,Sylviastel,9, Now I know why they closed?,"This film is a brutal commentary and observation about mental health services in the United States. Many of these facilities have since closed. Many of these patients would be homeless on the streets. I only saw bits and pieces of the film in the past. Finally to see it altogether, Jack Nicholson is perfect as McMurphy. Nurse Ratched is well played by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched is seen as the villain and labeled one of film history's villains. I don't see Nurse Ratched that way though. I don't know her enough. I believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading a psychiatric ward. I guess we see her coldness and true nature at the end when she discovers Bill's indiscretion. She uses it against him cruelly which leads him to tragedy. But I still don't think Nurse Ratched is this monster.",3
17,6 February 2011,Steffi_P,5," ""You're not a goddamn loony now!""","The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.",/

one of my favorite reads. Some books just can't make a good transition from page to screen; McMurphy is so much larger than life,
so multi-faceted, that no actor could ever portray him the way Kesey did. Nice try by Nicholson, but he just wasn't the right...something (physical build? Attitude?",_

25,28 November 2012,thewillt08,8, Amazing and Unforgettable,"Would you go to a mental hospital to avoid a prison sentence? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story of patients in a mental hospital and how their life was changed by R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, arrived in the ward to avoid going to prison or working on a work farm and he made an impact. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a memorable story that goes down in history as one of the best. Let's start with the characters. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a criminal who has history of violence and aggression. He was sent to the asylum after acting erratic on the work farms. He isn't really mentally insane, but he fakes it to avoid going to prison. He thinks he can serve his sentence in the asylum and life will be easy. In the asylum we have Billy Bibbit, a nervous stuttering man with depression and anxiety. Cheswick is a nervous man who also struggles with anxiety. The actor who portrays him did a great job in playing the part. Danny Devito, yes little Danny Devito before he really went nuts, plays Martini, a lovable character. Then there's the Chief. Chief is a 6'5"" mute who everyone thinks is dumb as a rock. He turns out to be one of the most important and influential characters. McMurphy originally goes into the ward to avoid prison but he eventually helps the patients in there. He thinks some of them could survive in the real world and he ends up giving the other patients confidence and a type of therapy. Billy eventually stops stuttering for a little bit. Harding has more self control and Cheswick learns to stick up for what he believes in. An example of McMurphy's ""therapy"" is the fishing trip. McMurphy climbs over the fence and steals a bus with the patients from his ward. He takes them to a fishing boat and takes them fishing. McMurphy had his own agenda but he also helps the patients. He gives them an experience a normal man would have and they have fun. One of the best aspects of this movie is the accuracy to the time period. Men with mental illnesses were put in asylums like the one we see in the film. They experienced the different types of therapy. They took drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti- depressants. Any means to help them relax and make them acceptable for society. They experienced group therapy, which we see often throughout, and something I've never seen before in hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, during this time period there were a lot of problems. If people were overly aggressive or considered dangerous they would undergo electroshock therapy. Basically, doctors tie you down and put conducting gel on your temples and a rubber mouth guard in your mouth so you don't bite your tongue. Then they literally send a shock through your temples into your brain. The idea was to reset the brain and make you more relaxed and in control. The audience witness's electroshock therapy in the film and it is a little disturbing to watch. You can see the suffering on their faces. Finally there is the lobotomy, where doctors drill into the skull or go through the nose to scrape out a piece of your brain. This turns a man into a vegetable who can barely survive on their own. It is illegal today but back then it was common. Character relationships are important for a successful movie and not many compare to the relationship McMurphy had with the vile Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was the head nurse in the ward. She controlled the groups and she was in charge. Her character is difficult because I couldn't ever really tell what her intentions were. Sometimes she tried hard to help the patients and other times she acted like she wanted to make them worse. A prime example is the one therapy group when Cheswick wants his cigarettes and Nurse Ratched just ignores him. Cheswick grows a backbone and stands up for himself and Ratched tries to put him back in his place and treat him like a dog. That scene really changes the movie and the major events of the movie unfold from there. McMurphy and Ratched would clash all the time. McMurphy would get under her skin and she under his. It made the movie really entertaining and a little comedic at times. Now no movie is perfect and I did have a few problems with it. Mainly it was the ending. It was a fine ending but I feel like it was a little too drastic. I don't want to give it away but it was one of those moments where you smack your forehead and go, ""you idiot."" When you see the movie you will know what I mean. Also what happens to one of the patients is completely unnecessary. I understand he was upset but he didn't have to do what he did. It was a little ridiculous and I can't see it really happening. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a great movie with excellent characters, a well written script, an interesting, and entertaining storyline. It deserves all the credit it got and will go down as a career making movie for Jack Nicholson. He did a fantastic job and deserved the Oscar he won. This is not what I would call a ""background movie."" Meaning, it is not something you can watch casually. You need to sit down and watch it and pay full attention. That's my advice and without a shadow of a doubt, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and is something I can watch again and again and enjoy every time.",t
26,26 June 2011,mitch_e33,6, Underwhelming...,"'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1975), based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman, centers around R.P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) a prisoner serving time for the statutory rape of a 15 year old, among other things. In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary, McMurphy fakes a mental illness, leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There, he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).",_

28,30 March 2006,Hitchcoc,10, Excellent Film-making; Excellent Casting,"Take a book like Ken Kesey's which did startle some and had a good following. I read it in a graduate English class. I remember setting it down and saying, ""That's a pretty good book."" It is well written with insights into the characters, but I didn't get the life I did in the movie. Throw a good director and some great character actors into a film like this; add Jack Nicholson, one of the most complex actors on the face of the earth; throw in Louise Fletcher with her soft spoken acts of terror; and you have a real film. Even though there are a few differences between the book and the movie, I actually enjoyed the book more the second time because the movie extended, for me, the depth of the characters. I don't know if Kesey would like to hear that, but sometimes it becomes a win win situation. The mental patients (some people choose to call them psychos which isn't fair) are wonderfully alive and full of their own being. Nicholson's character comes along and pulls out the humanity from them. I met some of the most wonderful people when I worked at a state mental hospital for a time (I now teach Junior High kids, which is a whole other issue). How would you like to be treated, given their setting? Medicated and controlled? There was a lot of that where I worked and I always thought, you may as well sentence them to death as treat them as you are. I think things are a bit more enlightened now. I think that maybe the movie helped a bit. This one has always been a top ten film in my book.",r
29,23 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, So much good about this movie...,"What an amazing movie! I cannot begin to describe how good One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is, the whole film has the word classic written all over it. The production values are of top notch quality, and Jack Nitzsche's music is excellent. The film also has a brilliant script, superb direction from Milos Forman(who also directed one of my other favourite movies Amadeus) and a compelling story. The pace is spot on, and there are many memorable scenes especially the very poignant yet harrowing ending. The characters all add a lot to the film, especially Nurse Ratched who is oppressive and terrifying. The cast are all terrific, Jack Nicholson is superb in one of his best roles and Louise Fletcher is just unforgettable as Nurse Ratched. Among the supporting cast are Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Douif, all great. So overall, I cannot fault One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it is considered not only one of the best of the 70s but one of the best ever, and it deserves that reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",v

To me, McMurphy is the villain in this film. He is not the lovable scamp whose madcap antics enliven a mental institution -- as some seem to see him. He is, rather, a destructive, evil force. He is in the institution because he is faking mental illness in order to avoid prison for statutory rape. He has no compassion or sympathy for the other patients in the ward; he uses them as pawns to get what he wants. It is his reckless behavior, and not the ""evil Nurse Ratched"", who brings about Billy's death. In the end, when he mets his ""tragic fate,"" my feeling was that McMurphy is getting just what he deserves. ",
34,10 February 2015,Horst_In_Translation,8," A true classic, packed with great performances","""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one hell of a movie. Not only does it deliver fully in terms of comedy and drama, but it also managed to win the five big categories at the Oscars back in 1976. Jack Nicholson gives the maybe finest performance from his career and that says a lot. Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched regularly makes all-time villain lists and this film is considered one of the greatest examples of how the movie is better than the book it is based on, namely Ken Kesey's novel. So congrats to the writing team Goldman/Hauben, of which the latter never wrote another screenplay than this one here. And to director Milos Forman who, now in his early 80s, gave us many more great films during his 50-year-long career.",

Which he is, because he's the only one who isn't impaired. I didn't think anything all that interesting happened. Maybe it was well made, but I thought it lacked something in the narrative.

36,5 March 2021,Coventry,10, Insanely perfect,"This will probably be regarded as a very blunt and unpopular statement, but I think that almost one third of the films listed in this website's top 250 do not belong there. Particularly among the first 50-100, there are far too many movies that are either vastly overrated and/or only listed so high because they have large and obsessive fanbases that vote continuously to keep them up there. The opinion naturally doesn't count for a handful of films that are - and forever will remain - undisputable masterpieces. ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is such an undisputable masterpiece, and it actually hurts to see that a landmark like this is getting pushed back in the ranking. I remember, a couple of years ago, this was #5 and all of a sudden, it's only at #18 now.",

38,22 May 2006,moonspinner55,7," Difficult, fascinating drama runs on pure emotion, not logic...","Multiple Oscar winner is an astounding, gripping piece, although occasionally the material allows too much showing off for its star and the four-letter dialogue coupled with the bleak material can be exhausting. A softened (albeit no less hard-hitting) film-adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about sex-deviate Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) sent to a mental institution instead of prison, quickly butting heads with the stony head-nurse on his ward (a hissable Louise Fletcher playing Nurse Wretched--uh, Ratched). Ostensibly a downer, the film does get a rousing kick from Nicholson, going full bore with an actor's relish and infusing the movie with unpredictable, kinetic energy. Director Milos Forman helps us get to know the patients at this hospital, easing us through the preliminaries and yet sparing us none of the ugliness. Still, this plot is a bit thin on the screen; Forman does his best to ""open up"" the material, which was first produced on the stage, but the sequence on the boat is more an emotion-based relief for the audience's benefit than a logical turn of the story. Tough-going, compelling film is occasionally brilliant, with Nicholson and Fletcher both winning Oscars, as did Forman and producer Michael Douglas. *** from ****",

47,22 September 2020,harrishcraig,10, McMurphy Villain,"Randal McMurphy is too often considered a tragedy of the nonconformist hero standing up against an unjust establishment. Taking a closer look at this character shows the exact opposite may be true.
1. The story suggests that McMurphy has been incarcerated at least five times, four for assault and battery, and at least once for statutory rape. While downplayed in the film, his sex crime was against a fifteen year old girl. His habitual and uncontrolled violence is displayed many times during the film both against orderlies and Nurse Ratched.
2. McMurphy is manipulative in such a way that is harmful to those around him. He takes advantage of his fellow patients by gambling, winning all of their cigarettes and much of their money. His escapade with the fishing boat endangered the patients lives - none of them should have been out unsupervised. However comically presented, at times no one is driving the boat and McMurphy simply desires to satisfy his sex drive after occupying the others with the fish.
3. McMurphy takes bets that he can get under nurse Ratchet's skin and disturb her and he intentionally causes chaos on the ward without consideration of the other patient's well being. He is further unable to recognize that his own well being is also jeopardized by his actions.
4. It is McMurphy's own actions that lead to Billy Bibbit's suicide. Unable to see this, McMurphy attempts to murder the very people who are trying to help him.
Ultimately and tragically, it is his self centeredness that leads to his lobotomy and his death.",

51,22 March 2010,Aaron1375,9," When I was a kid I felt bad about really disliking the nurse, then I found out you were supposed to hate her!","Not usually the type of movie that I would watch or like, but for some reason I really enjoyed this movie. A drama with good humor in it and top notch performances all the way around. Seriously though, when I first saw this movie as a kid I did not like nurse Rached and I did feel bad about it because she was the nurse and nurses are supposed to do what is best for you. Then later I found out you are in fact supposed to hate here, and despise her and I do feel that way about her and do not feel the least bit bad about it. One of my regrets over this film is that Jack Nicholson's character did not break that witch's neck and at least take her out. Most of the movie is not quite that dark as we have a new patient that comes into a mental ward and kind of rallies the patients to go against that nurse whenever possible. He makes friend with an old Indian who never speaks and does a lot of other things during this fine movie dealing with the patients as he makes friends and tries to make their lives a little less on schedule as it were. Nicholson turns in a very fine performance and I think he won an Oscar for his role, and if not he certainly deserved one. I am not sure but I think Louise Fletcher also got an Oscar as well, and if not one was certainly deserved in her case too as I really disliked her character. The movie runs over two hours, however it is a quick two hour run time as the story and characters are just to good for it to feel as if the film is dragging. The ending though is sad and like I sad Jack Nicholson's character could have had the same fate, but man it would have been so nice if he could have just snapped Ratched's neck. Oh my, that is a bit harsh on my part not isn't it?",

53,19 March 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, Lighthearted and free-spirited yet surprisingly dark and ultimately poignant.,"This eclectic tale of a sane man pretending to be 'insane' in order to gain a lighter sentence manages to make a few poignant commentaries on society, freedom and acceptance while also maintaining a dark core story that isn't afraid to be bleak but also isn't afraid to be fun. 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' keeps a lighthearted and free-spirited tonality that allows for the more pessimistic points to have extra punch whilst never spoiling its overall 'live free' message. The fact that it is so free-flowing can sometimes lead to a lax pacing, however, and the increasingly tiresome escapades of the protagonist can become a little, well, tiresome after a while. The film ends up as an affecting and memorable experience, though, one that highlights the 'odd' in 'oddball' but makes it work wholesale with an amazing central performance from Nicholson alongside some surprisingly super supporting performances - including a few familiar faces, too. 7/10",
54,7 December 2014,brogan-stanford,9, Oh Nicholson,"Jack Nicholson's mere presence in this picture was enough to bring this production to the screen, after the novel written by Ken Kesey was dubbed as 'unfilmable'; once Nicholson had his name on the contract, Hollywood took over. Nicholson's performance granted him an Oscar with acknowledgements that he was born to play the role of a misfit gone crazy when admitted into an insane asylum. The picture was moving yet simple and funny and was labelled as a dramatic masterpiece as it highlighted society's distorted outlook on the 'mentally unstable' and eventually won the 'top five' Oscars and was the second film in history to do so. This could never have been achieved if Nicholson's reputation had not got the ball rolling on this project in the first place. This picture was rightly the definition of the character that Nicholson should play and made him the top choice to play Jack Torrance in The Shining and the Joker in the 1989 interpretation of Batman.",

Brooks, who plays Dr. John Spivey, was at the time the actual head of the Oregon State Hospital.Harding is playd by the amazing William Redfield.A tragic thing about this actor.He was diagnosed with leukemia during shooting by Dr. Brooks.He told he'd have about 18 months to live, and about 18 months later he died.Yet he stayed in the picture until the very end.The marvelous Scatman Crothers portrays Turkle the janitor.He got the part with the help from his friend, Jack Nicholson.The music done by Jack Nitzche is really beautiful and haunting.There was a musical saw and crystal glass involved.I've seen the movie a couple of times in the past.Now I saw it on DVD, where you could also listen to the commentary track by director Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz.Michael's father Kirk Douglas, who was in the play actually possessed the movie rights for a long time before his son started the project.This is a true masterpiece that works on so many levels.In the movie we have this R.P.

68,2 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is brimming with memorable characters.,"Films today just don't have that sense of story and character, it's more visual narrative and overacting. There's no overacting here, every performance is understated in their own unique way. Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, is cool, calm and collected and yet her mannerisms exude terror. Her authoritative figure and soft spoken voice just adds to this, so much so that the patients in the state mental hospital are petrified of her. Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, is just a common criminal who to start with plays along with the other patients. However, upon the realisation that he may not ever get out...he starts to find ways in order to escape. I found his performance captivating and clearly he is great and portraying crazy people, just look at The Shining. He is able to control the smaller scenes with his charisma and own the bigger crazier scenes with his excitable energy. His raucous behaviour puts the other patients at risk of certain procedures such as the controversial electro therapy. What really compelled me was the similarities between the mental patients and the outside world, to which McMurphy says that there is no difference. The screenplay for that scene, well every scene actually, brings life to each character. From the first 30 minutes, every character's personality and state of mind is indicated to us. There are no boring characters, each of them have unique qualities and that is something you don't see in every film. Loved the fishing boat scene, adored Chief's and McMurphy's friendship and appreciated the time and effort spent on character interactions. The way they talk to each other in the therapy sessions just felt natural, and to balance the screen time between them all was just genius. You just don't get films like these anymore.",
