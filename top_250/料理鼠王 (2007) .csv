1,9 July 2007,planktonrules,10, One of Pixar's best,"This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks' latest release, SHREK III. In many ways, this is very ironic, as one of Pixar's best films, MONSTERS INC., was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success. I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie, people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC. was an exceptional film. Now, Pixar gets some payback with one of their best, RATATOUILLE.",r
2,4 May 2019,Hitchcoc,10, Among the Greatest Animated Features,"The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him. This is such an intelligent film and it works at every level.",e

4,17 June 2007,PoisonKeyblade,10, Best Animated Film in Creation,"The combination of Disney and Pixar never ceases to amaze, but with Ratatouille, their newest effort, animated features are brought to new heights with the best one to date. Ratatouille is stunning, surreal while at the same time realistic, and a joy to watch. The writing is, in one word, just amazing, and the voice acting is sensational. The characters are poetic and real, and the rats are some of Disney/Pixar's cutest creations. Ratatouille is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), and features stellar voice acting from Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, and Janeane Garofalo.",i
5,17 June 2007,willden21,10," An Amazing film, made for film lovers, with an artistic/indie appeal","I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.",e
6,17 June 2007,stalcup,10, Incredible,"Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.",w
7,29 June 2007,Quinoa1984,10," truly devilish fun and mind-blowingly entertaining as classic cartoon style, but also very successful in storytelling- magnifique!","It's pretty easy to make little rodents charming and fun characters (just ask Disney himself, to a clich√©d extent), but it's even harder to make them work in such a way that's original and exciting as comedy in conventional ways for today's audiences. But Brad Bird shouldn't be lumped into the group of today's CGI animators. He doesn't really think in those terms, but rather in how to make things look real, and yet at the same time keeping in full mind that it's a cartoon, not reality. This goes not simply for the rats themselves- the funniest, probably even funnier, that Disney's remotely had to market since the Great Mouse Detective- but the human characters too, who have their own distinct shapes and qualities based on personality and relevance to the story (whether they're good or bad, or maybe even more complex too). He places the designs for the characters right up there with the rest of the atmosphere, and then also adds in just the right way to make that wonderfully formulaic Pixar storyline- you know a lot of what may unfold, though not everything, and you know that you're in excellent hands because of the levels of detail and nuance in the comedy chaos at times. It'll be hard to beat this (to put it in a corny phrase) 'gourmet selection' as the best animated film of the year, and certainly the best that Pixar's done since, um, the last Brad Bird movie! ",/
8,16 June 2007,ashowen,10, Another Disney-Pixar Masterpiece!,"This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today's youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don't have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. ""Ratatouille"" is my new Disney-Pixar favorite! ""Ce film a pleine de joie de vivre!""",r
9,10 August 2007,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: Ratatouille,"The Pixar juggernaut continues! I've always been enthralled by the movies that Pixar puts out ever since Toy Story, and through the years, Pixar has built a brand of trust amongst movie goers, with quality storytelling using animation as a tool to tell them, not because it's cool to do things through the medium, but that it adds a certain powerful, believable dimension, with stories rooted to universal themes, yet jazzed up by the structure in which it's told. The Incredibles ranked amongst my favourite so far, but writer-director Brad Bird has topped that with Ratatouille, a story about a rat, and probably the most mature of the Pixar stories to date.",w
10,11 June 2007,superfan18,10, Excellent movie!,"Tonight I went to see Ratatouille during a preview offered to Myspace users in Boston. Overall the movie was GREAT! It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. A real ""feel-good"" movie. I admit I was a bit skeptical going in, I mean the idea of a rat in a kitchen kind of left me queasy, but I left the theater excited to see it again when it is released. The voice actors are excellent and the animation is amazing. I've been to Paris before and the overall views were very accurate. At times I could tell exactly where in the city the events were taking place. Overall a fabulous movie, I highly recommend it!",3

12,28 December 2018,cricketbat,9, Features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time,"Not only does Ratatouille do a fantastic job of portraying the joy of eating, but it also features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time (the childhood flashback scene). Yes, the premise is goofy and, yes, rodents are actually pretty disgusting, but that doesn't make me love this movie any less. This is one of the Pixar greats.",9
13,22 January 2008,bobsgrock,10," Amazing, spectacular, and perfect.","The greatest test of whether or not a film is truly admirable is how well it holds up years after its release. It has been almost three years since Ratatouille has been released and I have now seen it at least four times, maybe more. I am proud and thrilled to say that it has not lost any of its charm, still looks amazing and holds up better than almost any film I've seen as many times as I've seen this.",6
14,31 July 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," An unexpected surprise of a film, with a great message.","I really loved Ratatouille, it was original, sweet and lots of fun. While not as laugh-out-loud funny as the two Toy Story films, it is definitely one of the better Pixars, and a complete delight from start to finish. Honestly, the whole family will find it just as delightful as I did, and the film has a great message ""a great cook can come from anywhere"", summed up perfectly by Anton Ego. The story was highly original, if a little slow at the beginning, and deliciously engaging up to the last minute, and the animation was just spellbinding. The script, while not as irreverent as Toy Story, was very entertaining and touching, and I loved the characters- everyone was likable and unique, but what made Remy stand out for me was because he was so adorable, and his voice actor did a delightful job voicing him. The voice cast were very talented, and all did a superb job, especially Peter O'Toole in a marvellous turn as the ""nasty"" food critic Anton Ego. All in all, a brilliant film, that fully succeeded in what it promised to do, to make us want to cook. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.",8
15,19 July 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Mmm, perfecto!","Another masterpiece from Disney and Pixar, this year they bring us another family classic for generations to come, Ratatouille. My friend and I saw Ratatouille tonite and we just had a blast watching it, this film was such a pleasure and was so funny and cute. I would say that actually this is Pixar's best work, they have come such a long way from Toy Story, it's incredible. But Ratatouille had amazing animation that was so real, makes you wonder if we'll ever need actors in the future, lol. The story is just so charming and a perfect fit for any family to watch, even just to watch this film on your own, I guarantee you will have fun watching it.",2
16,17 February 2008,Galina_movie_fan,10," ""Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.""","When ""Ratatouille"" (2007) was released last summer, I was not too eager to see the animated 106 minutes long film about a rat in a kitchen of a five-star Parisian restaurant. The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that ""Ratatouille"" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, ""little chef"" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. ""Ratatouille"" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: ""How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it."" Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw ""Ratatouille"" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a ""grim eater"", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.",2

We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.

21,17 January 2008,BigWhiskers,10, Charming movie and Remy is adorable.,"My only regret is that I let this movie slip by without seeing it on the big screen. It's not even playing in those cheap theaters that charge a buck after the movie has been out for a while. I picked up the DVD and watched it 3 times. Remy is adorable and I fell in love with him ,his facial expressions and body language are so sweet, you care what happens to him,there is one scene where he is trapped in a jar and Linguini is going to drop him in the water,you can see the fear in his eyes and how vulnerable he is,it pulls at your heart and you want to just rescue him and take him into your arms. Once the kitchen show gets going though it really rocks.. Linguini is hilarious and Colette a wonderful tough lady chef who falls in love with Linguini. Hijinks in the kitchen as both Remy and Linguini pull off the most hilarious illusion of cooking with Remy pulling his hair to make him do things and Linguini's incredible Jim Caerryesque slapstick bodygags. The supporting cast is equally marvelous with various big stars doing voiceovers like Brian Dennehy ,Peter O'Toole and others adding to it's charm. I'm usually OK with most animated Disney movies that have come out lately but this one really moved me and I'm a 42 y/o man. It was very adult in nature since it appealed more to the older crowd then just kids. I do hope they do a sequel as I would most like to see what happens to Remy next. Bravo Brad Bird and the cast and crew . 10 out of 10",f

23,23 July 2007,jaredmobarak,9, He calls it his Tiny Chef¬ÖRatatouille,"Brad Bird is by far the best writer/director of animated films coming out of America in a long time. Besides a Hayao Miyazaki, there is no one else with the track record that this guy has. From The Iron Giant to the Incredibles to now Ratatouille, Bird just gets better and better with each new move. This new Pixar installment is definitely the most intellectually stimulating yet, but really which of his films haven't been intelligent first, kiddie-catering second? Ratatouille is by all means cinematic in scope and execution. There is nothing to this movie that screams animation besides the fact that it is a cartoon. The characters are all well fleshed out with emotions and inner struggle to survive the lives they want at the expense of that laid before them. Each frame is also composed with a sense of cinematography for real life. The expanses of Paris are breathtaking to behold and many camera movements stay within the constraints of a true machine there to capture the action. Bird's world on display is all encompassing and you will be fully immersed into the tale, no matter what age, because it never loses its integrity or ability to surprise with its never ceasing authenticity.",=

People uses to say that the best food in the world is in Paris, more precisely in Gusteau's, and Remy dreams on becoming a chef. On the same day that his idol dies after reading a bad review of the arrogant critic Anton Ego, Remy gets lost from the clan of his father in the sewers and ends in Paris in front of the famous restaurant. Remy does not resist and goes to the kitchen, improving the soap that is being prepared with ingredients and spices.

26,1 July 2007,L. Lion,8, A scrumptious Pixar pastry that is only harmed by some hollowness in its middle,"Ratatouille, Brad Bird's third feature (after the scintillating Iron Giant and The Incredibles) measures up to his oeuvre. It's a fine film with wonderful animation, a charming story, and a slam bang finale that had me laughing. The story, in brief, is that Remy the Rat has the dream (and the talented nose) to be a great chef. Through a series of misadventures, he finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's, a former five-star restaurant now clicking over on the reputation of its deceased former owner, the great chef Gusteau, whose ghost (or else figment of Remy's imagination) is mentor to Remy. Remy develops a relationship with the hapless Linguini, a garbage boy in the kitchen with a secret past, and through him begins to return the restaurant to its greatness. ",_

30,1 July 2007,mstomaso,9, The Rat in the Hat,"Ratatouille is a sweet little film about a Parisian rat with ambitions to become France's top chef, and a young dish-washer who may just be his only hope. The plot takes a number of clever twists and turns and delivers some unpredictable elements, which keep what could have been 'just another Pixar' quite fresh. Setting the film in France, and giving it just a pinch of French absurdist comedy for seasoning was a stroke of brilliance. The voice talent is also quite excellent - especially Ian Holm's ""Chef Skinner"" - who also does a mean Golem impression btw - and Jeanine Garafolo's ""Collette"".",
31,4 June 2019,www-aktomer,10, Awesome movie!,"I generally like animated movies more, so my review might be biased a little. But overall, the movie was great. It was very relatable. Not a rat cooking in a kitchen, of course, but in breaking out of mainstream, going against the wind, breaking the stereotypes. That kind of stuff.
Going to my all time favourites definitely!",
32,30 June 2007,verdie,10, The best yet!,"At this point, Brad Bird is no longer making great animated movies -- he's making great movies, end of sentence.",
33,17 June 2007,GSmith9072,7, Pulls the most out of an okay story,"Ratatouille is a major step up from a lot of last year's animated fare, and a vast improvement from last year's Oscar winner for best animated feature. Here we re-discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story-telling techniques of Pixar, and here's the kicker, no heavy handed messages hammered in with a drill, but there certainly is a message and it's delivered with subtler grace despite some flaws. Although, aspects to the message are borderline confusing if you over analyze the reality that occurs in the film, but the film doesn't scream for over-analyzation in the same fashion as ""Finding Nemo"". For me, the animation slightly overpowers the story, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The film is directed, camera-wise, with the same interesting techniques as ""Happy Feet"", but the film has more in store. We get to see the world mainly from Remmy's perspective, and it's visually exciting. The camera-work is what makes the film's physical humor work so well. More on the artistic scheme, the film looks really great. Particularly the lighting stands out. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city-scape. Then the rat's fur are very impressive, it moves against the wind and gets wet very much like real rat hair. Don't let the detail in the clothes get past you either. The film manages to find a balance between superficial realism and animated characters. The character designs for the humans are marvelous (Bird seems to get much humor out of the smaller villains as seen in the past ""Incredibles"" and the non-Pixar film ""Shrek"") and the rats, while moving a lot like real rats still have acceptable personalities and animated form. So we feel like we're entering an animated world that is fleshy and real. Speaking of such, other animated marvels are the organic forms of the food. As real as the food in the film is, the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursues. It introduces the viewer into the world of fine-dinning and develops something rare in today's animation, a bleeding heart.",
34,1 July 2007,David65536,10, A classic of the computer animation films,To me this is one of the best animated movies of the last years. It has a very inspiring story and has a timeless signature. It has many comedy elements but is not overloaded with jokes that make reference to the present time (like Shrek).,
35,10 January 2022,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10, Best Pixar Film.,"In my opinion, Ratatouille is the best Pixar movie ever! The way that it humanizes rats could've easily been misdirected like basically every other animated movie that has animals as main characters, somehow Ratatouille managed to surpass every single other Pixar movie I've seen. I had a long fear of rats, but after watching this movie my fear was suppressed and I realized that these rats are just like us humans - asides from the fact that most of them live in the sewers and don't have easy access to food - the message feels realistic, there is emotional depth, the animation is artistic and it is a visual masterpiece.",
36,30 July 2007,DonFishies,8, A great animated fable packed with enthusiasm and absolutely amazing animation,"After last year's horrendously average and overrated Cars, I was unsure how to approach Ratatouille. It looked impressive, and it looked like another great entry into the Pixar/Disney lineup. But then, so too did Cars. But something about Ratatouille struck me as immediate, as something that needed to be seen now and not simmered over later. And thankfully, albeit with a few minor flaws, the film comes out as being just as excellent as I could have hoped.",
37,28 July 2007,AngelOfPolitik,10, A Must See,"Where do I start with this? When I first saw promos for this movie, I was thinking ""Another rat movie!"" After Flushed Away, rat movies just seemed, well, bad. But after the good words from the critics, I warmed up to the idea, but was skeptical.",
38,30 June 2007,diac228,10," Much more complete than the average movie, Ratatouille is a 7-course meal providing nothing but the best in animation and storytelling","The only way this movie could not be enjoyed is if you watch it on an empty stomach. The folks of Pixar deliver what just might be the most complete animated film since Toy Story 2. By complete, we are talking the full course, not just story and humor. With flawless animation, a brilliant score, the best voice talent in ages, an excellent script, a nice story, plenty of humor, a dosage of romance, and a rather surprising amount of realism, and a heartwarming ending, Ratatouille is the best Cinderella story from Disney since¬ÖCinderella. From the director of The Incredibles and from a studio that has delivered hit after hit after hit, it is no wonder why Disney spent so much money purchasing them. This was a tough-to-sell concept executed beautifully, poetically, and just might become the best film of the entire year. The only problem is that this movie sets the bar even higher for animated films from here on out.",
39,6 October 2007,Igenlode Wordsmith,8, The film that launched a thousand rats,"""Ratatouille"", to pick a culinary metaphor, is, like the curate's egg, excellent... in parts.

40,12 December 2007,paul2001sw-1,5, Surprisingly conventional,"Modern animated features have often been marked by profound ruminations of life and death 'Toy Story', 'Madagascar') or by hip references to popular culture (the 'Shrek' movies). But 'Ratatouille', this year's smash hit, it by contrast a very conventional animation, a straightforward cartoon story inspired by the simple pun that gives the film its name; indeed, it reminded me in some ways of 'Wallace and Grommit', although (obviously) without the northern English flavour. I liked the animation of France (Citroen D-Seies included) and Peter O' Toole is very funny, voicing a snooty restaurant critic, but I think a chance was missed to make the rats as physically repulsive as most people find them in real life; a cuddly rat is sort of missing the point. And overall, I found (as an adult viewer), the same joke stretched a little thin by the end of the film; a film where a woman shoots up her own house to kill a rat (as happens early in this movie) is not one to encourage dark thoughts about the nature of life.",
41,23 July 2007,afdiazr,10, Ratatouille must get a Best Picture nomination (in a fair world),"Brad Bird really moved me when I saw The Iron Giant, a film I didn't want to see at the time. That little animated feature is simply beautiful and touching. Ratatouille takes that level of emotion to another point. Way higher. Don't think kids won't get it. They're not stupid. I remember going to the movies with my parents (they took me to Abel Gance's Napoleon) and being fascinated by the whole thing, even if I didn't understand the whole idea. This is not a comedy. There are some laughs and everything, but it's something more intelligent and dramatic. It's an astounding and complex film about longing for a different life and trying your own talents. About not to be content with the way things are and to go and challenge everything. Even if you end up empty-handed. Gorgeous animation, great script, wonderful characters. This is how things must be done.",
42,25 November 2022,dasa108,10, Such a great movie!,"It is one of the best animations of all time. And the reason for this statement is the general charm and attractiveness of the characters. It is a film capable of transporting you to the world of the protagonists and experiencing together with them an adventure of self-discovery, triumph, failure and glory. It has humor, excellent music, great design, excellent voice casting, and some sequences that will go down in animation history. A great film is one that can stand the test of time and that despite being several years old, nothing has been made that can surpass it in quality or emotion. It is a film that meets the simplest requirement of cinema: to entertain. And the latter does it very well.",
43,28 November 2020,baileycrawly,6, Cute,"Ratatouille isn't as good as some of the other Pixar entries, in my personal opinion, but it's still a pretty good movie. It's perhaps a little bit too long and tries to do a little bit too much. As far as emotions are concerned, this film doesn't really do a whole lot in that area, which is a real shame because one of PIxar's most potent weapons was the ability to make an audience feel strong emotions and react emotionally to the things transpiring on screen. This movie was absolutely brilliant from an animation point of view and really continues the upwards trajectory of raising the bar not just for their own productions, but also for the future of animated film in general.
It just felt a little overdone in some places and undercooked (if I may say that) in others. It didn't connect with me in quite the same way that other Pixar films did. Not to say it's a bad movie, because it was an enjoyable experience for me... it just didn't offer as much resonance as their other entries.",

45,1 July 2007,blossom114,10, Delight,"Okay, I admit, I haven't seen an animated film in a theatre in a long time...but when I saw the previews for this I thought it looked cute, had nothing else to do, bought a ticket and went in and saw it. I was extremely pleased with what I saw. The animation was great...the characters were cute. (What can I say? I have a fondness for rats, I had a pat rat myself when I was younger). It almost had an ""American Tail"" feel at the beginning. Delightful to watch, and some really funny parts in it. The kids will love this, and if it's doesn't win an award for best animated feature, something is definitely wrong with the Academy.",
46,17 July 2007,Polaris_DiB,10, More scrumptious than eye-candy,"Okay, first things first: scratch ANYTHING you've read in any review, private, published, online, or otherwise, that worries that children might not be that interested in this movie; the presentation I went to was filled with people of all ages, and they all sat right through the end credits. I'm getting really offended by reviewers' habits of passing off successful character development as something children wouldn't be interested in, as if children don't have the basic cogent powers to understand stories, but even if that were the case, this film is remarkably kinetic and exciting--it even is a little slapstick.",
47,16 September 2007,ackstasis,8," ""If you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff.""","In the last decade or so, beginning their incredible run with 'Toy Story,' we've come to expect nothing less than masterpieces from Pixar studios, and they've rarely ¬ñ if ever ¬ñ disappointed us. My favourite Pixar animated feature to date would probably be 'Monsters Inc.,' followed by 'A Bug's Life,' with the remainder of their CV not dwelling too far behind. Nobody in their right minds would consider producing a children's film that featured rats lurking around kitchens, and yet, not only is director Brad Bird in his right mind, but he's also made it work. Welcome to the beautiful city of Paris, France ¬ñ the food capital of the world - where a young and aspiring rat named R√©my (voiced by Patton Oswalt) dreams of becoming a first-class chef, despite the complete lack of support from his family and human beings' natural aversion towards rodents. Welcome to 'Ratatouille.'",

I enjoyed Cars, but didn't LOVE it like some of the other Pixar Films (Monsters Inc and The Incredibles are my favorites). This movie, however, was just about perfect. If I had one complaint (and it's VERY small) it was a just a little too long, but not by much. But the voices, the computer animation, the music, and above all the story were all top notch. I'm continually amazed at how Pixar continues to crank out great films like these that both children and adults can appreciate. I have a feeling most critics and film goers alike will rate this one very high. I wholeheartedly recommend the film - it really was a fun night out at the movies! Congrats Pixar!! Oh, and they also continue to do wonderful shorts that appear before the feature. This one involving aliens(that's all I'll say) is really cute and continues that fine tradition.",

Ratatouille, on the other hand, takes place within the real-life, contemporary ""human"" world, and thus does not need to establish the physics and dynamics of its own alternate universe ¬ñ much humour is usually derived from the parallels between it and our real world and from the absurdity of the mechanics of these universes.",

Ouch.) Animated films are getting hard to judge and harder to sit through these days. As the quality of animation gets higher, the pool of ideas gets lower. it seems we have more and more talking penguins, fish, and Shrek rip-offs (Heck, from what I've heard, Shrek3 was a Shrek rip-off). Ratatouille succeeds in bringing something new to the table. Brad Bird directs, so like The Incredibles, this one is more for the adults than the kids (Suprising as it is G rated) but that shouldn't be a bad thing. It's still talking rats and there are many well constructed prat-falls to hold their interest.",

67,27 September 2007,come2whereimfrom,5," Rats, what a let down.","Pixar are the computer boffins behind such great films as 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredible's' so it is with excitement I look forward to watching their new film 'Ratatouille', but I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed. The idea is basically about a rat who longs to be one of the greatest chef's in the world, lucky then that he lives under Paris, unlucky that he is a rat. Basically that's it, there are no really cool characters like the turtles in 'Nemo' or the aliens in 'Toy Story', there is his unbelieving dad, fat brother, bumbling chef accomplice who are all quite unassuming the only one with anything to them is the evil head chef who runs the kitchen with an iron fist. There is none of the magic that made earlier films so appealing for young and old and the jokes are thin and far between or have been done before. I think the whole thing is let down by the idea, it just isn't as strong as previous outings. There's a loose theme of humans hating rats as they are pests but it never really gets of the ground and a kitchen doesn't really allow for many action sequences. The animation is as you'd expect flawless and the rats (despite being pests) are all fluffy cute so the kids will probably love them but all in all this is probably the worst film to come from the Pixar stable, which considering past achievements and their normal level of originality ends up being a bit more of a let down.",
68,11 February 2008,Luigi Di Pilla,10, Very Original and Sweet Story,I am very satisfied with Ratatouille and so were my five old year son and my wife. My son doesn't stop asking to see it again and again. I didn't know the story before I watched it and it is never boring. The character of Ratatouille has been developed with lot of sensibility and depth. It is nice watching and delivers a great adventure with a very surprisingly end. The screenplay is well adapted to the atmosphere of Paris. The special effects from the PIXAR production house are as usual masterfully executed and should win at least an Oscar. ,
69,27 June 2007,laci-5,9, Truly excellent,"Nowadays I don't believe the first reviews that appear here on IMDb; most of the time they say the movie is excellent etc., yeah, as they are written by plants, studio people who want to generate excitement and make the movie successful. It was a relief to see Ratatouille is really, truly excellent. The reason I did not give it 10/10 is simple: maybe some of the dialogues should have been trimmed a bit; sometimes the talking parts seemed to be a bit slower and longer than they should have been. And that's all what I can say on the negative side. Ratatouille is great. It is heartfelt, it is moving, it has style, great French feeling, it has lovable characters (especially Remy, of course), great story and, again, except from some man-to-man dialogues, every second of the movie shows creativity, care and a really high skill that the team at Pixar has. I loved the talking scenes with Remy as his gestures are great, also seeing his little heart pumping all the time etc. makes him instantly lovable. And the non-talking scenes (call them 'action scenes', not as if it was an action movie) are always so skillfully directed and effective that I was totally amazed. I haven't enjoyed an animated movie like this for years; I think it is among the three best Pixar movies (the other two being Finding Nemo and The Incredibles). I just can't express how much I loved it. Pixar is really the heir to (Walt) Disney as Remy is for Gusto - as both really do know how to serve food that is perfect even for the most hateful critic...",

This is the essence of movie-making, people. The comedy hearkens back to ye olde days; this movie could have worked just as well as a silent film. Camera angles (if you'd like to call them that) are top-notch and provide an invigoration to the action that never gets old. The acting and writing are very smart; this isn't just a kiddy film. There are strong plot ties to egoism, relationships, and a rather Burton-esquire approach to critical cynicism, not to mention references to religion (*gasp*), alcohol (*gasp*), and illegitimate children (*gasp*) which are unfairly taboo in today's family films.

Despite that, however, I found the story very enjoyable especially near the end when All is revealed. I found myself crying when that came so this movie definitely touched me on some level. Now that I think about it, I can't think of anything I would cut out or shorten so if the humor doesn't always flow smoothly, when the laughs come from me or the audience I feel they are deserved for the most part. Loved the scenes involving the old lady discovering the rats in her house and her attempts to shoot them all. Loved the constant weird movements involving the garbage-boy-turned-chef-with-a-rat-in-him that made the other staff look at him. And definitely loved the relationship between that garbage boy and the rat Remy and the way they cooperated together. Not to mention Remy's constant speaking to an image of his idol, Gusteau. So while not the funniest Pixar feature (The first Toy Story probably deserves that distinction), Ratatouille is certainly one of the most touching. So on that note, I definitely recommended it.",

They're filthy little rodents with fierce, ugly teeth that scurry across your feet when you aren't expecting anything, dragging their long, scaly tails behind them and sending those they cross into squeals of fear. Rats in a kitchen comedy are arguably an impossible sell. If you don't like rats to begin with, you certainly don't want them anywhere near your food. Yet here we are smack in the middle of the premise for the near infallible Pixar's latest summer crowd pleaser, RATATOUILLE. Separated from his rat colony, Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt), finds himself accidentally putting his culinary talents to good use in what was once one of Paris' most prestigious kitchens, earning him rave reviews. Of course a rat can't take credit for fine food preparation so he forms an unlikely friendship with a gangly, awkward fellow by the name of Linguini (Lou Romano), who serves as his front. Together they bring new life to an aging restaurant and inspire each other to be better than they believe themselves to be. The folks at Pixar might have been sniffing too many expensive cheeses when they concocted this mousecapade but they may also be the only people out there who could have pulled it off. Only, under the writing and direction of Brad Bird (THE INCREDIBLES), they didn't just pull it off; RATATOUILLE is a masterwork in the field of animated film-making, deliciously reaching heights that no rat has ever reached before.",

This movie is so different. It feels like you are watching a live action movie that has been painted with cartoon colors and textures. Everything is meant to look real and at the same time fictional. The characters seem more human than in most cartoons and more time is spent developing the attributes and emotions of each character. The part where they learn how to cook with each other is quite hilarious. You see the bond forming between the two, not like most cartoons where the characters seem to just get along out of nowhere. I recommend this feature to everyone, with the exception of really little kids(ages 4 and under).

Besides the awesome setpiece of Remy, the gourmand rat, entering Gusteau's kitchen for the first time and the wonderful climax, there is little that is memorable. The characters are also pretty generic, except for food critic Anton Ego, voiced by Peter O'Toole, and Colette, voiced by an unrecognizable Jeneane Gorofolo. Remy is dull, as are a lot of cartoon heroes (they're hardly ever the most memorable characters), and the other rats don't have enough screen time to make an impression. The villainous chef is a dull bad guy, and Luigi, the human who is helped by Remy, is never redeemed by the script. Even in the end, that character has taken advantage of Remy.

168,8 July 2007,Jonny_Numb,5, Dazzling visuals do not hide a half-hearted story,"My reaction to ""Ratatouille,"" the latest from the seemingly endless siege of computer-animated features from Pixar or Dreamworks, is one of semi-exhaustion. Written and directed by Brad Bird, former ""Simpsons"" contributor and maverick behind 2005's ""The Incredibles,"" the film has the necessary ingredients for greatness, but comes off as a lukewarm dish overall. The positive message of this very kid-oriented feature? ""Anyone can cook!"" Which is what rodent Remy (Patton Oswalt) does best; after being separated from his colony, he winds up in France, helping a gawky clean-up boy at an upscale restaurant produce brilliant dishes, much to the head chef's chagrin. Strangely enough, ""Ratatouille"" has a monopoly on frenetic action, brilliant cinematography and editing, and a fine balance between authentic and cartoonish animation styles--yet none of this really makes the film 'funny.' I often found myself laughing at the sheer zaniness of what was happening on-screen rather than any of the scripted punchlines; even in a theater populated largely by children and their parents, the occasions of unison laughter were few and far between. Bird hit the mark much better with ""The Incredibles,"" which combined genuine thrills with satire and a sense of humor that pleased kids AND their parents. ""Ratatouille,"" with its cultural displacement (it takes place in France, after all) and focus on razzle-dazzle and lesson-learning, comes across as half-hearted effort.",

Remy yearns to be a chef. Problem is that he is a rat with a taste for great food. He unites with Linguini where he performs through him in exchange for food. Of course, he is watched by a cynical chef, threatened by food critic Anton Ego, and perhaps even a visit from a health inspector. Directors Brad Bird Jan Pinkava collaborate and are given gorgeous Pixar presentation of France. Bird directed another Pixar film called The Incredibles as well as The Iron Giant. He is backed by the voice of Patton Oswalt as Remy whose passion for food makes it worth the risk. Whether it is ethical to deceive the public with regards of what is preparing their food, is up to the viewer. Lou Romano voices Linguini, a dish washer turned cook who is assisted by Remy. Janeane Garofalo as the female assigned to help Linguini is a complete cardboard romantic prop. Ian Holm voices the antagonist chef who conspires against Linguini. Brian Dennehy voices Remy's father whose old fashion traditions call for eating out of a trash can. Stunning animation that is often amusing and certainly recommended to kids. Simple plot with detailed structure that glorifies God's gift of food. Score: 6 / 10",

It's cute, funny, and has amazing visuals of Paris along with other things. Ratatouille won best animation won best animated film back in 2007, and deserved it. Ratatouille is the story of Remi(Patton Oswalt), a rat that is smarter than most rats. It can detect poison, read, and cook. The rat clan don't appreciate him. They lose Remy one day and ends up being in the sewers of Paris. Remy is hallucinating Chef Gusteau(Brad Garret). Who leads him to his restaurant. Remy soon becomes friends with Linguini, who is a screw up who messed up a dish. Remy begins pulling him around and doing the cooking for him. Linguini's boss(Ian Holm) soon becomes suspicious and finds something out about Linguini. Something that he never expected to find out. Ratatouille is a delight for the eyes and ears. I left out some of the other voice talents in the film. Jeneanne Garfulo lends her voice as Collet, who is Linguini's love interest. Also, Will Arnett lends his voice as one of the cooks. Ratatouille is a delight for everyone. It's a beautiful film that you'll want to sink your teeth into to. Ratatouille is one of the best films ever made.",

Not only is it a Pixar movie (by Brad Bird!), it seems to have a reputation as one of their very best. I was disappointed for several reasons. I thought it was weird to cast Patton and not give him a single humorous line, but that doesn't make the movie less enjoyable. Neither does the fact that it's not really for young children, although that is also strange since Pixar usually makes movies that all ages can enjoy. What bothered me is that I didn't care at all about the story or the characters. I really don't get why it is so revered. I also wish they had used the opportunity to animate more of Paris. Take a look at the opening scenes of Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris and you'll see what I was hoping for. You can't deny that it is a work of impeccable quality--the effort pours out of every frame--but I just wasn't into it. I will still give it a 7 because I appreciate the work that went into it, and I concede that just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it wasn't great.",

I had my eyes wet all over the film, not by nostalgia or whatever, but its brilliance amazed me so much I felt like in heaven... It was a feast to the eyes, those colors and those views were amazing, perfect, flawless... Best in animation ever seen, not even the colorful Pacific Reef in Finding Nemo could beat the elegance and perfection of Paris in Ratatouille. The characters, oh the characters! There were so many! But the difference with so many movies was the REALITY of them, I loved those to love, and hated those to hate! They were so multi-dimensional! The story, sooooo perfect! I must say, there are some films that are stressing with so much problems and conflicts with characters that last for the whole film, but in Ratatouille every problem was solved quickly so i enjoyed EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of it!!! The action was also incredible! I wanted to run along with Remy, very impressive. To finish, the conclusion was incredible! I can remember when the critic tells the chef to surprise him, I could see myself telling that to Disney Pixar, and they absolutely followed my wishes! They really really surprised me!!

Remy meets a young wannabe Chef at a restaurant who find out Remy is a cooking rat and has him help him in becoming a master chef. Linguini's boss Skinner knows something is up and sets out to expose him Skinner also exploits and commercializes Remy's late idol Auguste Gusteau buy selling many different products with Auguste's image on it. It's not so much a comedy but it has a great story like many other Pixar movies it proves that animated movie don't have to be that funny to work it' one of the few pixar movies i have seen in the theater. The ending is very happy and it show rats in a good light something that almost never happens there's also a subplot of Remy's family's who don't think rats should be clean or coexist with humans. It is a great family movie that shows how it's not bad to be different and unlikely friendships can work out. This was originally not going to be a Disny movie it was going to be Pixer's first movie without Disny before the company's got back together. Ps. there is also a mock buster movie called Ratatoing that i haven't seen yet but i plan to and review.,

Remy is gorgeous and the city of Paris is breathtaking. Linguini and all the other characters are just truly marvelous, especially Anton Ego. His monologue at the end of the film, might just be one of the greatest voice performances in CGI animation history. By far the best animated movie of the year, and pretty much one of the best films of the year. Just shows that Pixar Animation Studios is simply the MVP at this game. This films goes into the books.

The animation is top notch and visually incredible. I found very little in the way of any portions which might detract the story from it's intended audience, namely those who enjoy a good story. The great talent of Peter O'Toole is the voice of Anton Ego. a empirical food critic and the icing on this movie cake. Others like (Ian Holm) who is Skinner's voice, add impetus to the star, Lou Romano who plays Linguini. He's excellent by the way as are Brian Dennehy as Django and Peter Sohn who is Emile's voice. Two surprises to this film are James Remar (Ajax, from the Warriors) plays Larousse and Janeane Garofalo who is the voice of Colett, the heart-throb of our hero. The fast paced action and sympathetic storyline is enhanced by the musical score. In all the many talents who contributed to this magnificent tale are to be praised as the story becomes as favorably superb as the recipes themselves.

As a critic, i always look out for flaws; as a movie-lover, i tend to be forgiving. In this case, there are hardly any flaws to speak of and so, nothing to forgive. Animated rats have always been cute, but the ones here are not only lovable but very realistically characterised as well. While this animated feature may have been made with the adult viewer in mind, there is more than enough of the fun factor thrown in so that the younger ones will find it appealing as well. At the same time, many life lessons were included as part of the story; thankfully, these were not imparted in a heavy-handed way.

The dialogue is a bit limp, similar to Ice Age, with only one in-joke for the adults that I noticed. Both the lead characters are supposed to be French, but have not a trace of a French accent. They both have aggressively American accents. I found this jarring. There is only occasional non-descript background music. Disney's best work in contrast puts singable music centre stage. The plot is somewhat predictable. Perhaps the most interesting thing is the way they manipulate the audience alternately to identify with the rats and feel disgust for them.",

Apart from the technical aspects, which seem remarkable to me (although I'm no expert in the area), I found the plot and the characters absolutely delicious. They are funny, they are human, they have an enormous sense of humor. We don't have the typical animated story where animals and people speak the same language, but instead we see that different worlds, different languages can come together and find some sort of understanding. Besides they managed to make rats interesting, even attractive. I do hope more films like this one will come up!",

In its essence, there are so many similarities with ""The Perfume"", another superlative movie in my eyes. OK, Grenouille was really not a rat, maybe in the metaphoric sense he was, but still a nobody who created the most fine perfumes ever, just using his extraordinary well developed nose. Same as here. But at the end... who cares... Not everybody has seen ""The Perfume"" so this will leave him or her the freedom to enjoy without the feeling of deja vu. The movie is very entertaining and funny.

I loved all the previous pixar movies. This one is a big let down. The chefs in the movie actually make fun of American food, burritos , hotdogs and even Asian food. I don't think that was necessary, all these choices makes America such a great place. and since when are food critics the biggest villains. I am not sure who is incharge at pixar for creative ideas for emphasizing the french. The small part of Edna in Incredible was fine. but this movie is kinda stretching it",
233,29 June 2007,letsmakeadeel,8," It is, how the French say...MAGNIFIQUE!","What a fantastic movie. I haven't enjoyed an animated film like this in years. Perhaps animation these days has become more of measure of how real we can make things look with technology. We have forgotten what makes classics like Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin & Beauty and the Beast forever remain in our hearts and our memories. I have seen Finding Nemo & Toy Story, and though I can appreciate the trailblazing methods in creating animation that is unbelievably life-like and impressive, I have always felt that something was lacking. It's that feel-good, lesson-learned, awe-inspiring, tear-jerking story that we all want to share with others close to us. This isn't a semi-musical, as many of the classics were, but an equally well constructed soundtrack does the trick too. How about creativity? Most animated films these days make a parody of real life through the eyes of an ant, car, fish, or chicken - while throwing in the voices of a few currently popular celebrities for good measure. But not this film, the voices are done by those who really fit the role/character, and the daily life of a rat is not paralleled with our daily lives. It does not monopolize the story. I felt an absolute joy watching Ratatouille (what a title too) - the plot, the creativity, the animation and the soundtrack; all were on point. Pure genius. If given a chance, this one may just become a classic. Bravo!",
234,7 July 2007,neil_fraser,9, awesome,"Out of all my reviews I have done for IMDb, this is the one review i'm most happy to be typing right now. If you are reading this, I can't tell you enough to go see this movie. It's that good. Easily one of the best, if not the best Pixar film to date. Animation is awesome, script is awesome, scenery is awesome. Not only that, but it really benefits from being on a big screen too. Voice acting is great, not to mention the casting. Good on ya. They really chose the right actors for the job. Never are you distracted with that annoying feeling that you heard that voice before. (i.e Woody Allen as an ant.) Personally what I really appreciated most about this movie was that they truly made a family film, a film every age can enjoy. I always felt that with ""Cars"", even though a great film, wasn't made for adults. Just look at all the toys and products that had Lightning McQueen's face on them and you will see what I mean. This film has an off-beat, yet adult story of a young chef/rat trying to make it as a cook. It deals with bad bosses, relationships with co-workers, and job stress. In fact you replace the rats with kids from a rough neighborhood, and you have a drama/comedy about class struggle. The fact is, this was a film about real life (minus cooking rats). Not a cute story about a world run by talking cars. If I had to nitpick. And it really would be nitpicking. I would have to say that the film felt about 15 minutes too long. Also the basic story formula was familiar movie territory. Fish-out-of-water mixed with a pseudo-Cyrano de Bergerac story. It worked, but I was very aware of what I was watching. The evil chef sorta felt like Dean Wormer from Animal House. Thats all. Just little things here and there sometimes felt very familiar. I will say this. I am proud of Pixar for maturing in their storytelling. I was starting to notice that every film by them was a rescue story, again! Thank you for not making another. It is a welcome change. Also, to it's credit, Ratatouille was not nearly as gaggy as the earlier Pixar releases. Instead they relied more on clever facial expressions and situation comedy. Plus gags, when present, were more visual. Nothing like the stupid one-liners, i.e ""find a happy place"" in other Pixar films. (Hey it's a fish that needs therapy, yuk yuk!) I'll say this, Pixar used to really emphasize the novelty aspect of computer animation. It seemed like they use to make a game out of reproducing cheese puffs, or toy packaging, or making sea turtles into stoners. This was getting old for me. I really enjoyed the change of pace in Ratatouille. Lush scenery, realistically detailed rats and objects, and perfectly rendered lighting. Very impressive. I wouldn't be surprised if this won for best animated feature at next years Oscars. Well done!",

236,2 August 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,10, The rat's nest of a French Haute Cuisine kitchen,"Everyone knew that Paris hotels had the biggest, friendliest and juiciest fleas in the world with whom all tourists fell in love at the first bite. A real legend these fleas of Paris Hotels. Ask Ms Paris Hilton: she will tell you everything about it and she can compare with the fleas of American prisons. But Walt Disney has decided to go a lot further in its debunking of Paris, to teach those damned urban frogs a good lesson since they don't seem to have understood that they had to make themselves very, very small after their being rejected for the 2012 Olympic Games. And the lesson is as hot as hell. All best restaurants in Paris have hired, as chefs in their kitchens, the ugliest and least hygienic people they could find, I mean the gutter and sewage rats, and there again Paris has a record: not so much as for the quality of their rats but as for the number of them. It is even murmured that unemployment has gone suddenly down in Paris because of this hiring policy of Paris hotels since all unemployed people in Paris, particularly in the ethnic northern and eastern suburbs, are nothing but rats basking in the moonshine. That will show how low these Frenchies of Paris have gone: their haute cuisine is done and produced by rats. You can be rest assured that in the next Walt Disney film they will show that French haute couture is in the hand of a bunch of pigs and French perfumes in the hands, or shouldn't I say in the sweaty shoes, of bedbugs, or who knows what other stinking beetle or skunk. The kids though love it and there is some humor here and there, and I must say the Parisians deserve it quite a lot because they are always obnoxious with foreigners, strangers and tourists. All serious study proves it with hard data. So they just get the change their fake forged bank notes deserve. But there are some myths that like going around in the world. Ratatouille has nothing to do with Paris since it is a dish prepared in Marseilles, originally, at least as far I know, though some dictionaries tell me it is from Nice. Same mistake. At least they do not bring up the most popular and famous dish of France in France today, i.e. couscous, that is prepared, it is well known in France, by some special species of rats, but this would have been racist. At least one thing will be sure: French fries will no longer be what they used to be. I bet they can be called fried rat's nests and enter the legend that in Haute Cuisine they don't have cockroaches, but they have coq au vin, and no one knows what's the connection between the two, nor which one is better than the other. At least in Paris you can't make the difference. I must admit though the few views of the Eiffel Tower were quite appetizing.",

238,6 September 2007,valadas,7, Rats and Men,"In formal and technical terms this movie is undoubtedly very good but not better than the average recent other computer animated movies. Its main original feature is the story itself which tells us about the rat that wants to be a chef and attains its aim after a lot of exciting vicissitudes. This movie has the successful peculiarity of making the viewer to take to the rats which are animals we are used to face as repugnant, distasteful and disease-carrier mainly in what relates with food. But here we sympathize with them indeed. Getting back to technical aspects, the design is stupendous, the puppets extremely original and expressive, the action runs at a sometimes hallucinating rhythm and the visual effects are of an amazing movement and perspective. This is one more excellent achievement in the field of animation movies.",
239,8 July 2007,kgprophet,6, A Rat who Cooks in Paris? If it's Pixar - Yes.,"Brad Bird really put himself on the line with this strange concoction of a film. The only way this concept could work for the length of a feature (at 1 hour and 50 minutes - that's an eternity in animation time), is to go all out. Indeed, that's what this epic does and succeeds. From a floating imaginary chef to hair pulling as puppetry, the film is stuffed full of little details and subplots. No, you can't let a film with a strange Tom and Jerry feel to it become the central part of the film, so the character of Linguini and his own strife counter-balance the rat's story. Indeed, Linguini, a clutz in the Jerry Lewis vein, carries the second half of the story, with the rat mostly disappearing in many scenes. What Brad Bird accomplishes, meanwhile, is that Pixar magic, where you get an unexpected emotional attachment to strange world they have created. ",

I'm into cooking myself, but I mean SERIOUSLY into cooking, like people who are more interested in the kitchen of a fancy restaurant than in the food. The premise is pretty silly, a rat living in the sewers under the streets of Paris unwittingly discovers a talent for cooking that some of the most highly trained human chefs can't seem to attain, so he befriends a young boy, the garbage boy at the restaurant (who might remind you of young Wart from Sword in the Stone) and basically uses him as a puppet so he can get access to the kitchen.

247,27 February 2008,jboothmillard,8, Ratatouille,"From Pixar, the geniuses behind Toy Story and Monsters, Inc., and director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles) this is another pleasant experience. Basically, young rat Remy (Patton Oswalt) lives with his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) and father, leader of the pack of rats, Django (Brian Dennehy), and because of his great sense of taste and smell, he is a rat poison checker. But he dreams of becoming a great chef, like his hero Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), who he often imagines talking to. The rats escape the house when the old woman living there discovers them, but Remy is separated from his family, however he does find good luck when he sees that he has been living under Paris for all long, and he heads to Gusteau's restaurant. There he encounters Linguini (Lou Romano), who spots the rat putting ingredients into a soup that he almost spoilt, and when it is taken away to a customer, who they didn't realise was a food critic, everyone believes it was Linguini, and chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo) convinces nasty owner Skinner (Sir Ian Holm) not to fire him, as long as he can recreate the same soup. Linguini realises Remy knows how to cook and can understand him, so they soon form a ""partnership"", and to make Linguini do what he wants Remy controls him by pulling his hair. After a long while, Linguini is made to look like a great chef, and unfortunately for Skinner, he may be the heir of Gusteau, and obviously later it turns out to be true. Oh, and there is a small bit of love story with Linguini and Colette. Of course there are negative turns, when Skinner discovers it's Remy that is the genius, Remy sees the bad side to human when he is reunited with his family, but there is a happy ending, and the man they are desperate to please, food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) gives his praise, and the kitchen is revealed to run by all the rats. Also starring Will Arnett as Horst, Julius Callahan as Lalo/Francois, James Remar as Larousse, John Ratzenberger as Mustafa, Teddy Newton as Lawyer (Talon Labarthe), and if you have the British version, it would be Jamie Oliver as The Health Inspector. The animation is (as always) impeccable, the characters are all well thought out, and the story is good fun and gives a great perspective into the restaurant and recipe creating world, all the family will enjoy this charming animated comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Michael Giacchino, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film.

250,3 July 2021,Kdosda_Hegen,4, Basic and plain crude.,"I've seen this many years ago as a kid and thought it was alright. But now after rewatching it, I think it's not even that good. The film tells a very basic premise that is told in the most obvious way possible, by directly explaining it multiple times during the film. There's just no subtlety in it. It has the expected human-rat friendship, but of course, it has to have the boring cliche of the friends almost breaking apart from each other before the final challenge. Also, Linguini is just so awkward and not an interesting character in the slightest. There are also tons of chase/action scenes to make this more suspenseful, which I don't think works at all, the pacing is terrible. The best thing about this whole film is the critic, he is the only cool, yet fair and honest character who has a very arrogant personality, yet stays with pride, dignity and respect for his opponents when proven wrong.

It is like the final dish served by Remy (the rat). Hard work, craftsmanship and a lot of love that provide the magnificent end result. How can you not like this movie? From the moment we get introduced to Remy the rat you will believe that he is a wonderful cook. The fact that he is a rat makes it even funnier. We want Remy to succeed. Even when the people and rats think that it isn't possible. There are some lessons to be learned by adults and children. But most of this cartoon is I think a more adult approach on matters.

252,11 October 2007,EijnarAmadeus,10, Top Three Pixar,"Pixar is one of the most successful film-creators in recent history, and rightfully so, the re-defined the family-genre with TOY STORY, not just adding enormous depth to story and characters but also showcasing stunning animations. And TOY STORY wasn't a one-hit-wonder, it was followed by several successful outings; tell me one family who hasn't seen MONSTERS INC., CARS or FINDING NEMO and I will send them a DVD right away. And Pixar took their universe a step further with THE INCREDIBLES, an amazing character-study of superheroes left behind, trying to behave like regular people. Now, in 2007 Pixar does it again; RATATOUILLE is arguably their finest movie so far. Right from the outset and throughout it's entire runtime it was a warm and powerful feeling that kept me wanting more and more of this tale about a rat-going-cook in Paris. As in any Pixar movie, there are many supporting characters which helps making it fresh and always fascinating. And as in any child-friendly movie, there are moral and life lessons, and although they have behaved a bit cheesy from time to time, they serve well. RATATOUILLE portrays Paris in the most romantic and dearly beloved way imaginable in a animation-movie, and were better to put a story than in a classy restaurant? And one should not forget the impressive main characters here; the Rat Remy and the garbage-boy-turning-cook Linguini, both being Pixar at their peak capturing character-studies. Remy delivers serious speeches about his urge of getting out of the rat-life, like a human being he wants to create something new, and not eat the left-overs from something left behind. As he arrives Paris to discover his dreams, he realizes that his big idol, cook Gusteau, is dead. But Gusteau has already entered his mind, and Remy slowly evolves from being just a rat to becoming something quite extraordinary. Linguini is quite possibly the most likable character Pixar has created yet, a troubled but behaved, ambitious but not talented boy who lives in a small apartment, bicycles his way to work and blushes more than he blossoms, he isn't just the perfect sidekick to Remy with his funny behavior, but his romance with companion cook Colette is so sweet!

Unbelievable CGI--Pixar is the primo company in this art form and always will be...If only every movie was made with such love and attention to detail!~~~sigh~~~",
259,30 July 2007,RandomPerson123,10, A Tour De force for Francophiles and Pixar fans everywhere!,"After last years somewhat disappointing Cars, Pixar and Brad Bird have renewed my faith in movies with the delightful Ratatouille. The title itself is an actual French vegetable soup, and also that the narrator is a rat! Unlike other movies featuring rodents, the rats are realistic, and Remy actually washes his paws before cooking, unlike many Americans chefs I'm sure. Because many people on the forums are grumbling about how bad this movie is, let me tell you something; European culture is much different and sophisticated than here in America. There is a tender subtlety to this film that makes it speak to an older audience than previous films. So there isn't any violent action and anything of that kind, who cares? This a sweet, soft-spoken movie that hearkens back to when movies could be nonviolent and just as good. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys cooking.",

Me and my friends went into the movie expecting nothing more than a few kicks and giggles. This movie, on the other hand, exceeded every one of our expectations.

264,7 November 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7, Has some to offer,"I base this upon the 2-Disc Special Edition. This definitely does a thing or two differently than other 3D flicks... as an example, instead of doing tricks for the audience with camera and animation, it feels more like a movie that happens to be all CG. The movements are very realistic, and in a lot of ways, this actually doesn't strain credulity. That's, of course, not counting the main concept. Why must Hollywood always oversimplify psychology and the complexity of the human brain? Also, am I the only one whose had enough of critics being regarded as bitter and crusty old jerks who just like to pick apart the work of others? People, if their judgments bother you that much, *stop listening to them*, it's not a difficult thing to do. The plot is OK, though it doesn't all make sense. Voice acting is marvelous, everyone sounds exactly right. The characters are well-written, they come off as people that could exist outside of fiction, and few are annoying. This is visually well-done, immense level of detail, and grand, vivid color and lighting. The romance feels tacked on, and in fact Linguini is dangerously close to being completely useless in this. I don't really find this funny, however, someone put forth that it's really a drama for kids to a greater extent than a comedy, which I largely agree with. It often tries too hard for laughs when it does go for such. There is intensity and potentially disturbing content in this, as well as one use of a moderately strong word. The DVD comes with Lifted and Your Friend the Rat, the shorts(that I will review on their individual pages) several well-done featurettes, a handful of deleted scenes(in early stages) and some trailers. I recommend this to fans of these films. 7/10",

In fact, it brings with it a certain kind of realism - similar to the grounded vibe of Bird's other Pixar presentation, 'The Incredibles (2004)'. It's an enjoyable film that stays focused on character right the way through, presenting its anthropomorphised animals with as much sincerity and nuance as its humans. That's why it works as well as it does, really. It sticks pretty closely to standard story structure, but it hits the beats it needs to with aplomb and also includes a few surprising consequences for some of its more outlandish actions (something that's often overlooked in similar fare).

The voice casting of the film is as good as always, with Patton Oswalt and Ian Holm being the standouts for the film in general. The film can be a bit slow natured at times, mainly with its runtime being nearly 2 hours long, but it still manages to feel fresh and engaging, despite its somewhat dragged out and formulaic nature. I enjoyed the look of the world in this film, as well as the music throughout it. It didn't feel forced, like so many other Disney films do, and I was interested to see the world around Remy come to full circle. In the end, Ratatouille may feel like a standard animated film at times, especially for Pixar, but it does flatter the audience and myself with its charm and its tender nature and inspiration. It's not the best animated film Pixar has made, but I certainly wouldn't mind watching it again.

310,2 December 2008,dwpollar,6, Unique & funny computer animated film...,"1st watched 11/28/2008, - (Dir-Brad Bird): Unique & funny computer animated film from Brad Bird & Pixar again takes us to worlds rarely seen. This time it's the world of rats and more precisely a rat who wants to be a cook and create instead of steal like most of the rats do. This breaking out of the nest philosophy isn't unique in films, especially animated movies, but a rat that wants to be a cook is. Humans usually shriek when rats are near food or call the health inspectors but Bird brings us one who not only touches food but makes it wonderfully tasty with it's touch. Bird uses wonderful camera positions to make us feel like we're looking from the rats point of view. This incredible animation along with a very unique story made for an enjoyable movie-going experience. I've basically already outlined the main story but also involved as the patsy or puppet human is a young man who wants to cook but doesn't have the knack for it. He's hired on as a janitor for a world famous restaurant and after botching up the soup recipe he notices a rat putting various ingredients in and the customers love it after his special touch. He's amazed by this and the human gets the credit but he can't duplicate it without the rats help. They scheme together a plan where the rat controls the human through his hat by pulling on his hair to direct him.(OK, so this is a little weird but in animation anything goes) There is a subplot involving the restaurant owner who thinks the boy named Linguini is the original owner's son and is afraid he will inherit the restaurant. This eventually is the case and there are some funny scenes where the owner notices the rats' involvement in the process and others think he is crazy, of course. This is an unusually convoluted plot for an animated movie but this is what makes it enjoyable for adults. Kids will like it too despite this as the movie is an enjoyable experience throughout. Bird & Pixar keep kicking out new material that continues to surprise and they probably will both be at it for a very long time, god willing.",

Unlike the animated films under Disney's banner, this one doesn't offer any musical numbers as story breaks. Director/co-screenwriter Brad Bird, who was also behind the ""The Incredibles"", returns with a charmer that is as much a sumptuous treat for the Food Network generation as it is a parable about self-fulfillment and tolerance.

It's an unconventional story about a rat(Remy) who wants to be a great chef, however, he's just a rat and that raises some problems. After causing his colony to flee from an old cottage, he finds himself alone and stumbles upon his favorite chef's restaurant as he decides to mingle with a soup that was being bluntly prepared by a new hire named Linguini, Remy gets spotted by the kid, who gets the horrible task of disposing of the vermin, only to find out a critic tasted the soup and liked it. So Remy and Linguini team up to help each other out. It's a rather curious choice, in a world where women carry pepper spray if guys get a little too close, yet a food critique enjoys a meal prepared by a critter that feeds off of garbage without worrying he might get sick from food poisoning. Normally when you see rats going around, it's not a good sign, but yeah, it's movie, so I'll let that slide. The humor is great, physical humor works wonders in this picture and Linguni's own awkward and goofy temper provides some of the best laughs in the entire movie. Most of the other character are somewhat forgettable, apart from Collete who's sorta makes her the de facto girlfriend and the one who Remy and Linguini can count on when everything goes to heck(even though the two have different views on the matter). Sorry if I sound a little cranky while writing this, I left with the impression kids under 10 year olds should be banned from theaters, which kinda clouds my better judgment.

321,9 August 2018,shadow_blade-89459,9, Inspiring,"""Ratatouille"" (2007) is a professionally produced animated adventure comedy about a rat named Remy, voiced by Patton Oswalt, who has an uncanny ability to cook and an aspiration to become Paris' top Chef. Remy, through coincidence and direction from the spirit of famous Chef Gusteau, voiced by Brad Garrett, meets Linguini, voiced by Lou Romano, and forms an alliance between rat and human. I have watched this film several times now and every time I get this warm feeling in my heart. This animation provides a very real sense that there is an ability to separate the differences between entities to share commonalities. The story is very strong and realistic. In the film, the scenario is applied to a despised animal and a human, but the same scenario can be applied to the race, gender and sexual orientation that plague the world today. The vocal acting compared to the visuals is spot on. I never felt like anything was out of place. I commend directors Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava for bringing this work to life and delivering such a powerful message through, what most people consider, a ""kids movie."" I love this film and recommend to everyone to watch at least twice.",

Ratatouille was a pleasant surprise for the first sixty minutes. Director Brad Bird who also wrote the screenplay weaves an excellent adult fantasy up until that point. Sadly this 110 minute film could have been cut to 87 and Ratatouille would have been far more digestible. This is a movie about life, food, and new found relationships all working together to keep the human and animal spirit evolving. The animation is excellent. Pixar does magical film work, especially on a large screen when 2D becomes 3D. The colors, the depth, and the pure movie magic is completely captivating. Too much seasoning can foul the taste of the broth, too much time spent on needless scenes, drags out this film. Parents, this is not a film for children because it is made for an adult audience. There are only bits and pieces of cute scenes that your small fry will truly understand or comprehend. The actors who dub the voices of the main characters do an excellent job. How can you go wrong with such luminaries as Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, and Janeane Garofalo. Where Ratatouille sours is that it tries to choke itself on it's own recipe.",

The worst part was the Linguini character. He was so stupid and ridiculous that it got tiresome, and he just wasn't likable. The voices in this show are awful. I know they're in Paris, and are French, but I couldn't understand 90% of what anybody said. Except Linguini who sounds like he's from New York for some reason. Why? He's Gusteau's son, why isn't he French? He also sounds exactly like Ray Romano; and his name is Romano, but I couldn't find anywhere that they're related. Honestly, all of the characters are kind of repulsive and unlikable. And why aren't the rats French? Overall it's a mildly entertaining forgettable film.",

A beautiful and very cute story about the extraordinary French rat, Remy, who is a great fan of the famous French Chef Auguste Gusteau. Remy is truly gifted with cooking. Remy discovers that his adored and TV celebrity chef has passed away but lives on in his imagination guiding him on with his create motto ""Any one can cook!!"". Remy deserts his rat family clan to pursue the culinary arts at Gusteau's restaurant which is now managed by a little evil conniving chef Skinner who thinks he can take over ownership of the famed restaurant and convert the operation into a Frozen food company using Gusteau's recipes.. A clumsy and awkward young man Linguini is seconded by special written reference to commence apprenticeship in the restaurant and Skinner soon discovers that he is the son and heir to Gusteaus restaurant. Remy also discovers that Linguini has a strong but misguided desire to cook and forms a strange partner ship with him not unlike the famous Cyrano De Bergerac story. This partnership is wildly successful and the only female chef Collette in the Kitchen develops an attraction to Linguini whilst trying to teach him the basics of cooking. Remy soon discovers Skinners plans and reveals them to Linguini and Collette and in the process reveals himself to all as the master chef behind the newly and highly successful reemergence of Gustaeus restaurant. Finally the famed and extremely strict gastronome and food critic Anton Ego endorses the miracle recipes and cooking despite the fact that little Remy is the behind it all. In his critique Anton states "" Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere"" alluding to Remy's genius. Proving you don't require "" Larousse's Gastromonique"" recipes to for great home cooking. Brilliant film.",

350,24 August 2007,Illymovies,4, Whose Paris is it anyway?,"I recently saw this movie because I thought it would be cute movie, rats, mice, pigs, fish...monsters...they all can be so cute. I thought the movie was far from magical. This movie had problems because it tried too hard to combine things that are hard to combine such as: Rats, cooking, Paris, the English language and in the same time humor. Biggest overall disappointment was how Paris was introduced, unfortunately in a very American manner as the so called city of lights and high cuisine. I don't think the essence of Paris was captured in a nice way, and since the setting was in Paris, this influenced the whole movie in a negative manner. Also, speaking French-English doesn't help much with creating a french atmosphere at all. I liked the rat, because as always, humans look a bit creepy when animated in this manner. At one point, I was a bit grossed out by the rats because although it's just a cartoon, and it's supposed to be cute, I think I find mice sort of cute, but rats can be very big, and as cute as you try to make them it may still gross some people (like myself) out. The humor was poorly done: it borrowed a lot from other movies, and I found the jokes forced and not so funny. So, Pixar ran into a little bit of trouble in this movie because they tried to go in unfamiliar waters so to say. They tried to find an original story, and I guess with all the popularity of cooking shows they thought it would be a good idea. However, they could've tried harder if they wanted to capture Paris in a good, romantic manner rather than an American cheesy manner (no pun intended cheese-rats :)) Make it funny in a more subtle way make the characters less boring and more dynamic. Paris could be a great setting for a cartoon if done properly. Unfortunately, this was not accomplished and the result is thus mediocre at best. If you want to see a beautiful animation in a very Frech spirit then I recommend the Triplets of Belleville.",

353,14 June 2015,sharky_55,9, Anyone can cook,"And a great artist can come from anywhere. It's the sort of motto only Pixar would take to mean an anthropomorphic genius cooking rat. But animation needs these types of crazy premises because there is so much potential in the medium. It's Paris, France however where Ratatouille takes place. The lover's city, one of the most beautiful in the world, and yet that famed shot of the Eiffel Tower is used sparingly to great effect. Most of this film takes place in one kitchen, that of the recently deceased Auguste Gusteau. The vibrant and lively animation from Pixar studios is on in full force here. More than a million hairs animated for the lead character of Remy the rat, but that's not even the best part of it. His character design is full of human mannerisms which add so much to the rodent voiced by Patton Oswald: shrugs, finger guns, running skids, rubbing his hands together and waving to waft in the aromas of French cuisine. Which brings me to another of the film's many strengths; the animation brings the kitchen of a world class restaurant to life. Bunches of spice, fat cloves of garlic, thick ringlets of white onion, a bubbling brimming pot of soup, crunchy clusters of grapes, huge wheels of cheese, even a simple aromatic omelette. Readers of Brian Jacques and George RR Martin know exactly the feeling. Rataouille is a mouthwatering delight equally for those microwave masters and fine dining connoisseurs. ",

357,29 September 2018,janjeltes,10," Superb film, holds up over time","Ratatouille is yet another masterpiece of Brad Bird. Most of his earlier films (before he became politically correct) are works of art (iron giant, the incredibles).
Ratatouille is a very clever juxtaposition between artists and critics and about following your passions. It sticks true to its values and doesn't get itself sidetracked with sex politics (like he did in Tomorrow Land and Incredibles 2 - where his focus concentrated on the genitals of the characters rather than a deeply clever story).
Disney has had its issues in the past (see the mouse that roared). However, until a few years ago Disney had never taken to marginalising most of its audience.
As a conscientious family, we are now going back to the older (pre politically correct) classics like Ratatouille to avoid Disney's modern shenanigans targeting little children.
While Disney and Brad Bird have let us down in recent years, there are still superb movies such as Ratatouille that conscientious parents can watch instead. Ratatouille and the original incredibles are definitely worth revisiting.
As for Disney ... watch the new Wreck It Ralph 2 trailer and ask yourself : inclusive? Divisive? Rubbishing all of the Disney princesses as ""victims"" and to all of the children who lived the Disney princesses in one swoop? That's a master stoke of something. It's up to you to decide what that something is.",

359,21 October 2007,jackbrugts,2, Technical perfection completely out of place.,"Let me get right to the point, i think this is one of the worst animation movies i've ever seen. Why do American movie makers think that things in Europe work like they do in the US. The theme is French, the people are too, it plays in a restaurant in Paris. Yet it has not even the remotest European charm due to typical American moralism and blandness. So i wasn't even surprised that everybody is speaking with an Italian accent, behave like they in a sort of mafia movie an orders get screamed around like in some kind of cheap American diner. This movie is technical perfection, but does not go any further then the outside of nice graphics. It does strike me that the voice acting of the linguini caracterer is completely out of place and not suitable. A comparison to flushed away needs to be made, cause of the European rat theme, but there's really no need, flushed away is funny, very smart, intellectual and for all ages, where ratatouille is probably only for children, and boring, stupid and way over the top for adults. O yeah the story........there isn't any, apart from a vague clich√©. The botomline is that i left after watching this rubbish after 45 minutes.",
360,15 February 2020,Ryan_Barbakins,8," The closest Pixar will get to an ""Artistic"" film","Ratatouille is such a great film for not having that appealing of a concept. A rat wants to learn how to cook. On the surface it sounds really boring, but how it is executed proves that Pixar can make just about anything interesting. I believe that this is the closest they will get to an ""artistic"" film, because of how faithful the entire thing felt to cooking while delivering a super rich message. This isn't to insult their other films, in fact I love just about all of Pixar's films.
The plot takes many unexpected twists and turns that make you want to keep watching. I love how self aware yet twisted the villain is, as it adds to the comedy and enriches his behavior. In fact all of the characters seem to leave a lasting impression on the audience, even the side characters.
This film is defiantly the most ""adult"" pixar has gotten. It doesn't feel like something made specifically for kids who would care less about plot development and character arcs, because this film is filled with them. The ending just about proves this by describing one of the main quotes of this film, ""anyone can cook"", through a critic's interpretation. Anton Ego's speech is one of my favorite scenes in all of film for having such truthful and inspiring dialogue overlayed with an artistic montage of the beautiful city of Paris.
For anyone who wasn't a fan of this film as a kid, give it a second chance. I'm sure it will come around to you.",

I was really excited to see it after all the hype and great reviews I had heard and read. Last year, I was pleasantly surprised by Cars and was hoping to be just as pleased with this film. Unfortunately, my experience with Ratatouille was not as great. From the beginning, I felt that it wasn't going to be that entertaining, but I hoped it was just a slow start. Nope, the slow, boring, tedious pace continued. I found myself chuckling only maybe 3 times at most at scenes that weren't that unique. So many of the other Pixar films were truly hilarious in such creative ways. Also, I know that a film has made an impact on me if I can remember little quotes or parts that stood out, and are easily recognizable when someone randomly says them (such as Guido's ""Pit stop?!"" from Cars or Dory's ""I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy"" from Finding Nemo). There is nothing of that sort from Ratatouille, other than ""Anyone can cook""...lame lol. I was really expecting a lot more from this film, but it just didn't deliver like past Pixar films.

Set in the high end restaurant kitchens of Paris, France the film has an old-world, indie film look and feel to it. The performances across the board are all pretty solid. The score is a perfect match and lends itself wonderfully to the action. While I appreciated and enjoyed Ratatouille immensely, the final notes didn't hit me quite to the degree that I was expecting.

369,12 October 2007,blairgallop7,10, Pixar Studios serves it's best meal(no pun intended)/movie,"Another great animation from Pixar Studios, Ratatouille is a movie that is best served warm(pardon the pun). It essentially follows the journey of Remy the rat(Patton Oswalt) who leaves the colony by accidental means and ends up in Paris.He is caught snooping around in the recently deceased Gusteau's restaurant by a garbage boy by the name of Alfredo Linguini(Lou Romano) who is later revealed to be the son of Auguste Gusteau(Brad Garrett). But in my view one of the more interesting characters is the mean food critic Anton Ego(played brilliantly by screen legend Peter O'Toole) as he is the main villain in a way and as his performance was sort of a dramatic one, I think he should get an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. This film should also be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as well as the aforementioned Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Peter O'Toole. A great movie with a great taste.Bravo!",

Although I thought it would be impossible to top Cars The Incredibles, they have done it again. Ratatouille takes the somewhat offbeat concept of a rat who cooks, and turned it into a truly enjoyable movie. As has become their trademark, Ratatouille was able to balance entertainment aimed at children and adults. There were many moments the children in the theatre found enjoyable, and many moments intended for a more sophisticated audience. Ratatouille also excelled at holding the audience's attention.

It may be because I'm older, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. The voices are good, the animation is stellar like all Pixar movies, and the jokes appeal to me. But it doesn't have the hilarious supporting actor/voice, like in Finding Nemo with Dory (my absolute favourite Pixar movie ever), and The Incredibles (E). Emile and Linguini just don't have that funny flair like Dory and E did. In Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, I found myself saying memorable quotes a lot (Dory speaking whale and E showing Helen the new suits). Ratatouille had me with none of these, except for the one from the trailer (Don't just hork it down!). Overall, 8/10. To rank it perfect is not true, and to give it anything less than 8 should be a sin. Also, what may have made it bad, was this annoying woman behind, laughing at the most unfunny things in the movie.",

I can confirm this, because as much as I applaud the creativity and ingenuity of Pixar's fantastic offerings thus far, the idea of a sewer rat preparing French cuisine sounded... unappetizing. However, from start to finish, this unique story surprised me as I found myself drawn into the world of the intriguing characters fresh out of the imaginations at Pixar. A creative mixture of true-to-life elements and fanciful creativity, the journey contains the predictable moments one would expect of a tale of mice and men. But the added humor from the mind of Brad Bird (Writer and Director) and his colleagues provide the unexpected moments that make the story not just the run-of-the-mill cartoon about a rodent. The best element of the film however, is the running theme provided by the title of Chef Gousteau's cook book. The book that began the journey of our favorite rat Remy: ""Anyone can cook.""

Yes the movie shows a rat that is good at cooking food but the movie is not about a rat, it is about a someone, who is bound by expectations and culture by friends and family while still wanting to pursue a dream of his own. A dream that seems impossible to achieve because of where he comes from and his culture, but does that stop him? No, he takes his chance, he builds friendships, he gets in to trouble, he does mistakes and he tries to do the right thing at the end. This movie shows moral conflicts and stand points that are so regular and normal that it's truly a mystery that people have succeeded to miss those.

394,8 December 2020,mfellipecampos,8, Very good,"Pixar has the gift of telling extraordinary stories based on simple premises, such as ""Ratatouille"", a film about a mouse that dreams of being a cook, and much, much more! Making a review about ""Ratatouille"" is a very interesting experience because it is a film that talks about a critic's relationship with an artist and the mistakes and successes of each one. I'll start with the mistakes of the film, one of them is the progress of the story, at times I felt the film losing its breath and beginning to drag on, especially when Remy's problematic relationship with his father comes on the scene, it's one of the cool topics covered by the film, but it was poorly developed and it was kind of uninteresting. They are insignificant problems in the face of so much quality, ""Ratatouille"" is the perfect example of how Pixar manages to demonstrate maturity and depth in children's films. There is no child who does not love ""Ratatouille"", it is a colorful, cheerful and full of jokes film, to match the romantic atmosphere of Paris, there is the relationship between Linguini and Colette that serves as a sweetener! It is wonderful how rich the color palette is, inside the kitchen the colors are warmer and give a feeling of oil and smoke, the restaurant lounge has warm and vibrant colors, the ""Ego"" room is dark, it has references to the room of dracula as the coffin shape and the red and black colors themselves. Magnificent! The animation technique of the film is a marvel, extremely detailed mainly in the textures of the foods, an extraordinary feat for the time when the animation was produced! All this shell involves a delicious script that tells an original story and that conveys beautiful messages, the most beautiful and clear is that an artist can come from anywhere. Most of the characters are well built, with depth and layers. The only Pixar brand I missed in ""Ratatouille"" is the tear-tearing drama, this is one of the few films in the studio that doesn't make you cry! ""Ratatouille"" is a greeting to the artist and the art critic, a completely adult and profound children's drawing, which, like a good wine, the more time passes the better!",

Here are my thoughts on Ratatouille: Excellent animation, nice story without the focus-group-topical-jokes, and they got the food right. Not quite the genius of The Triplets of Belleville but still a great movie. It would be interesting to show both movies back to back as they both use animation and food in contrasting ways.

The animation was (as expected by Pixar) excellent, the detail was the usual fantastic level we've come to expect. We went to the 'sneak preview' showing, and I must say that even though it started slow, the story was very fulfilling and had an emotional ending (which, while this would also be 'as expected' it was pulled off very well). It truly earned its 'G' rating -it wasn't loaded with innuendo like so many of them are these days, and while the dialog had a decided nod toward the adults in the crowd -not dirty, it just wasn't strictly aimed at kids, so you didn't see many adults just nodding off while they waited for the ending. Lastly, its been YEARS since I've attended a movie (and never in an animated one) where the entire theater burst into applause at the end. People sat all the way through the credits (my wife and I always do anyway -especially to catch the often included little 'bits' at the very end -and we're usually the only ones left by that point).

I was disturbed by the fact that the rat's brother was so overpriced that there were so many sudden movements in the kitchen, and every minute I got the feeling that something would be overturned and obviously I was very uncomfortable

431,16 May 2022,BabelAlexandria,10, American Pop Culture Meets French Haute Cuisine (Talking Rats are Involved),"This is probably the most creative, whimsical entry in the Pixar canon of animated films. I've now watched it twice: the first time a few years ago with my then 6-year old daughter, before going on the dark ride at Disneyland Paris (among the best dark rides out there), and picking up a French-speaking Remy (the rat) stuffed animal for her younger brother. We watched it again recently after both kiddos had developed an interest in cooking and baking. And this movie only deepened that interest. While it satirizes both American pop culture, in the form of corporate mass-production, like ""Chef Gusteau's Frozen Burritos,"" and French cuisine, though more gently, with the premise that even Ratatouille, a ""peasant's dish,"" can become a gastronomic extravagance; the most important lesson is the idea that everyone can learn to cook well, at least with some talented instruction. The video game that comes with the blu ray release is also a fun way to learn about French-style food ingredients and preparation, and was also a good excuse when my wife suggested that I stop building up the blu ray collection now that we have Disney+! When we drove by Hardee's recently, my son complained that they gave themselves a star rating even though they don't deserve it. Did he get the film's message?",

Another part that was gross was when the lady shot the top of the chandelier, and it fell down, and then all the rats were found there. Ratatouilli was really funny, though. The credits were cute, because they were cartoons, as well. I hope that no one thinks that Ratatouilli is just a lame Disney movie, because it isn't; it is definitely worth seeing. Although paying to see it in the theater was a lot of money, it was definitely worth seeing.

An unfortunate incident in the house they all live in causes Remy to become separated from his family. His travels through the sewers bring him to Paris.

It's critics will say it's just another fish out of water buddy movie. But I don't care. In a summer, so far devoid of any originality, this movie is refreshing and fun. The story is easy to follow. You know who the good guys are. You know who the bad guys are. You laugh because it's funny. Not because it's added humor to amuse the adults who had to take their kids to a Saturday matin√©e. I get a little tired of the targeted humor and having to stop and explain to the kids why I thought it was funny and they didn't get it. For the most part Pixar films have been void of ignoble humor. I liked this film as much as my boys, (10 and 13). This Rat has a quick pace, danger and intrigue. It's chock full of positive messages and family values. I didn't cringe and most importantly I didn't fall asleep. I read comics when I was young watch the Flinstones and Jetson's and Rocky and Bulwinkle and I feel this 3D animation is just another upgrade.

I have seen dozens of people that just start to question all of the ""unrealistic"" parts of the movie. THIS IS AN ANIMATED FEATURE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE REALISTIC OR TO ENDORSE ANY KIND OF ACTIONS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE PERFORMED BY A NORMAL PERSON! IT'S MEANT TO ENTERTAIN AND IT DOES EXACTLY THAT!!! GET A LIFE AND THINK OF WHAT THE MOVIE AIMS TO BE BEFORE YOU QUESTION IT! Phew, now that that is off my chest, i'm going to start the actual review by saying that this is one of the greatest animated features if not the best movie i have seen. The CGI is absolutely amazing and even though i'm as critical as Ego when it comes to special effects, they left me in awe as i watched how beautifully Paris was portrayed before my eyes. The movie made me laugh more than ever and yes, you can't control somebody by pulling their hairs, yes a rat will never cook, yes you will never be able to start a business after you've gained a reputation of having a whole freaking colony of rats in your previous restaurant. But who cares? Even though everything is so far-fetched, the way it is all cooked together using a marvelous recipe is amazing, and delivers one very good movie. Going back to the fantastic side of the movie, i find it absolutely amazing that people have nothing against elves, dwarfs, gnomes or other such fantastic creatures seen in movies but they get hectic when it comes to a cooking rat :| Not many more words can be added without becoming either repetitive or really boring so i will only say this: Do not take into account what some people who are angry that an animated movie made it to it's well deserved position start saying about this movie and not even what i'm saying about it. Just go and see it for yourself just like i did, and please, beyond all else think of it as an experience and don't treat it like something from real life... it will only spoil any kind of feeling it may and probably will give you. And please be objective if you decide to rate it. I'm not saying to give it a 10, because it's not my place to impose such a thing.

We may not know for sure if literally anyone can cook, but we do know that anyone can do at least one thing something special in life.

Mature in its storytelling, but kid friendly enough, Ratatouille tells the story of Remy, a rat with a keen, almost supernatural, sense of taste and smell, making him unique amongst rats in his ability to cook and create new flavours. However, his status as a rat prevents him from pursuing this dream, until he meets Linguini, a young man who is incompetent in the kitchen, but is somehow able to act as Remy's puppet, a human vessel allowing him to pursue his dream, but not without some resistance.",

The animation depicts the setting very well, and the characters move quite fluidly and realistically. The story has plenty of original twists on the dreaming chef (or two) and features some cleverly executed jokes. The characters act with purpose and will keep your eyes glued to the screen, and the voice acting is some of the... I won't say best, but the casting was nothing short of precise. And to think that some people consider this among the worse Pixar movies, right down there with the Cars films and A Bug's Life. This was a film meant to please critics, and being the highest rated animated movie on Metacritic, I don't see why audiences don't enjoy it as well. Sure, there are a small handful of moments that drag, but I was affected pretty hard by this film. Specifically, I was encouraged, as my 6-year-old self, to be a risk-taker with cuisine and become more tolerant about it, helping me to discover several more killer dishes from around the world.

We look forward to negative reviews - fun to write and read - but the sad truth we must face is that in the grand scheme of things, any rubbish has more meaning than what our review lets on. But sometimes the critic takes a risk every time he discovers and defends something new... the world is often cruel, with new talent, new creations... new things, he needs friends. Last night I experienced something new, an extraordinary series from a singular and unexpected source, to say only that the plot and its creator have defied my prejudices about the good plot, would underestimate the reality. They have touched me deeply. In the past, I've never hidden my disdain for the show's famous tagline: Anyone can have it.

494,28 May 2011,rdukeesq,9, don't kill that rat he is the best chef in France,"So I watched 2008's Oscar winner for best animated feature film Ratatouille. So is this movie good, I say once oui, bon tre bon. I think this movie is an instant classic, and is one that does not just appeal to kids and most adults, but in particular to gourmets, which I am. This movie captures perfectly what it is like to be in love with food. It defines the dividing line between what is eating to survive and surviving to eat. About the only character I had a problem with is Linguine, which I didn't dig. The character didn't seem up to the standards of the others, and he does share the lead with Patton Oswalt's wonderful Remy the rat. Besides from that I literally loved every single second of this movie. From the beautiful animation, to the clever story line, to the interesting characters, it is one of the best animated films I have seen period. Some of the people who do voices may surprise you, not in the sense they are doing this film, but in the sense that I honestly (outside of Patton Oswalt) didn't know who did the voices until I looked it up, and was very surprised. This is particularly true of Janeane Garafalo who apparently doesn't have to sound like some whinny gen x'er who smokes too much all the time. Too sum things up, I have to say, any movie that can make rats cooking in a kitchen adorable, has to be good. Why? Because if you saw that in real life all the rats in this movie would be dead not cooking. So enjoy this flick maybe even make some ratatouille yourself, because as Gusteau says anyone can cook!",
495,28 August 2007,happiscotsman,9," If I don't like it, then I won't watch it again","I identify with the passion of one of this film's characters who declares to be ""hungry for more"" after having seen this work by Brad Bird. I absolutely loved ""The Incredibles"", and yet figured that Brad Bird would stick to his schedule of only making a movie every few years or so. I certainly wasn't sure that he'd team up again with Pixar. And then I saw that he had chosen this project. I was a little trepidant approaching this movie's opening. Could lightning strike twice or was Bird doomed to wander into a wasteland of storytelling like M. Night Shyamalan? I am now confident that Brad Bird will not dwindle away his talent. This movie was as richly fulfilling as the feasts it displays and I'll try to stop with the food metaphors from here on. I had thought the story was going to be about urban rat adventures in the same way as ""Flushed Away"", ""The Great Mouse Detective"", or ""The Secret of NIMH"". But then I saw the teaser which informed that instead it would focus on the delight of making and eating fine cuisine. With rats? Yes, with rats. It encouraged me that are others out there who know that real reason haute cuisine is so snobbish is because it has the wealth of flavors that you won't get from The Olive Garden or McDonald's. I watched with shear joy as food was woven into the plot and displayed with such magnificence. My mother who was an art major in college said that this was the finest animation she had ever seen, and this from a woman who has watched ""Toy Story"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", and ""Wallace and Gromit"". All you have to see is the breathtaking vistas of Paris and you also will want to shout Bravo! Finally, what I've started noticing and liking about Pixar versus the sequel maniacs at Dreamworks is their ability to cast characters. ""The Incredibles"" could've had bigger names than Craig T. Nelson or Elizabeth Pena, but they would not have matched character as flawlessly. That continues here as you will not immediately recognize most of the cast (Lou Romano?), but you will agree that no else could've matched so perfectly. Another skill I attribute to Brad Bird. I now eagerly await ""1906"", confident that it will be one more feather in the cap of someone who is making a claim as the greatest animated filmmaker ever.",

It has so many facets which ultimately make the movie truly interesting/remarkable: a rat with an identity crisis, a vengeful ex-employer a.k.a. the arch-enemy, a ghastly looking food critic named Anton Ego, a supportive rat family, Linguini's conflict of heart and the fact that he's leading a double-life are just some of the reasons why I decided to give this movie a 10/10.

Only mildly entertaining, Ratatouille is a pretty significant dropoff for Pixar in their new era after selling their studios to Disney. I would recommend this film for kids 9-12 but don't go in with high expectations. You will likely be disappointed if you do.

511,16 March 2023,timothywalton-31924,7, A triumph in animation,"Ratatouille is, by all measures, an unqualified triumph in animated filmmaking. I have no reservations recommending it to anyone, for it is a masterful blend of great ingredients. The animation is firstly marvellous- it is warm, bright, and almost even realist in some places. The colours are vivid and there is great detail without sacrificing warmth. The voice acting is also, expectedly for a Pixar film, very well done- the voices and their intonation seamless blend with the character traits of the characters. Ratatouille also has a funny, interesting, warm story which enthrals the audience, whether young or old. Personally though, I have never been a fan of Children's movies, and while this is a film which I believe has a wide audience appeal, I still must hesitate to rate it higher. Children's films will always be children's films- they inevitably rely on a feel good story with easy, animated dialogue. Unfortunately for myself and myself only, my inner child has vanished, and it is difficult in general to connect with exaggerated dialogue and monologues. If I were to offer a disinterested opinion however, I find Ratatouille to be one of the greatest animated films I have watched, and I can unreservedly recommend it to anyone.",

At some parts all the spectators giggled. It's very, very funny, but not silly or childish. There're also some serious parts in the movie, although it's not too unsmiling or too emotional for being fun. The only thing I have to say against Ratatouille is that I don't think it's qualified for general audience and should be rated higher than G. I would rate it PG (6 in Germany).

I say were, because after a scathing review by the feared and infamous food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), the great Gusteau died of what seemed to be a broken heart, and his magnificent restaurant lost two stars, giving him three out of five. Although his family tries to knock it out of him, he continues to try to become a cook. Then he is separated from them and finds himself alone in Paris, at the restaurant that Gusteau owned before he died.

523,10 January 2019,mirkobozic,10, The rat pack,"I grew up with Disney's 2D classics like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King etc. Either due to growing out of the age of their target audience, or the fact that the aesthetics of Shrek and the like were just too unappealing to me. And then came Ratatouille, a perfect little animated gem by Pixar, which combines two things that are very easy to grow fond of: good food and a good story.
It's a tale of the rat Remy with an overdeveloped sense of smell and taste, who refuses to settle for the usual trash bin menu, and goes on a mission to change his life. When he accidentally meets Linguini, a clumsy garbage boy of a Parisian restaurant, the two form a friendship and Remy helps him advance to the position of the cook, to the displease of the chef Skinner who is suspicious of Linguini's sudden success. The restaurant's original owner, Chef Gusteau, bequeaths the place to Linguini, and when Skinner finds out, a conflict unfolds, until it's discovered who is behind the boy's transformation into a stove genius. The characters have very well developed , distinctive personalities and the chemistry is palpable, especially between Remy and his rat pack (pun intended). The critic Anton Ego has a threatening charisma and it's a pleasure watching him unleash it on restaurant staff and writing about it. However, in the unexpected finale, he delivers a beautiful monologue about food critics, that pretty much sums up the relevance of them. Cooking is a joy, and one to be shared as a means to form friendships. Remy tells us a story of persistance, loyalty and dreams worth fighting for. A pleasure to watch, with excellent voiceovers and animation. Definitely one of those you gladly come back to.",

Ratatouille is one of those films. While its themes are relatively straightforward, the multitude of them and the unique way of which they are told is enthralling. It is not the funniest movie Pixar has come up with, but it plays out like a rich elegant 5 course meal. The animation is so vivid that you can taste the food that is being cooked. The movie does not cut corners by giving easy pay-offs to scenes, but allows the plot to develop organically. The only thing that keeps this from standing as the crowning achievement of Pixar repertoire is that it feels patchwork. It bites off more than it can chew. There are so many characters that you don't get to really know several ones that would have been good to have dwelt upon. There are so many themes interwoven together that they don't always coexist well. And some of the humor feels forced as a result. That being said, it is a wonderful and enchanting film that is a must see for all lovers of cinema.",

I love Disney / Pixar films and they have never made a bad one (unlike Dreamworks who insist on producing tripe such as 'Bee Movie'), anyway, I was slightly worried after hearing that people were put out by it's lack of humour or it's lack of action. If you see this film expecting another 'Incredibles', 'Monster's Inc' or 'Cars', then you will be, but if you watch this film without any preconceived ideas about what a Pixar film usually contains (think of it as a normal film and not a cartoon), then you will see one of the best performed, well scripted and technically perfect films around (the water looks so real!) As for the humour, there is a small amount of slapstick stuff for the kids, but quite a lot of grown up themes and jokes... vegetables anyone?? Enjoy.",
546,24 October 2007,moviejam,3, Talks the talk but...,"Ratatouille is a good film in that it is very well executed in terms of animation (Pixar remain peerless) and in terms of sound design...basically the film looks and sounds sumptuous. But. This is nowhere near as entertaining as I wanted it to be and nowhere near as good as The Incredibles. Pixar have choked twice now with this and with Cars. I wanted to love this...what's not to love? The trailer highlighted a story with heart, with a lovable character in the form of Remy who wants to break away from the rat race and become more than he is. He believes that barriers can be broken down and humans and rats can work and exist together. It's a metaphor of course and not an unworthy one but the story execution lets this film down alarmingly. My main criticisms are: The characters are unlovable; Skinner the head Chef is loud, brash and down right cruel, Linguini the put upon plongeur who Remy helps learn how to cook is stupid and has an incredibly grating voice and Remy's family are add-ons who fill no real purpose except to provide the ying to Remy's raging yang. Also, the idea that pulling Linguini's hair makes his arms and hands move involuntarily pushes the suspension of disbelief too far in a film where we are already happy to accept that a Rat is a culinary genius. You can ask too much of an audience. The tone is all over the place and any message the film is trying to get across is totally lost in the dense plotting and endless dialogue between some rather unpleasant or boring characters. The kids in the cinema I was in became bored very quickly indeed. Only Peter O'Toole's performance and the animation/character of Remy himself are the saving graces here. Perhaps Remy should have tried escaping from this movie instead of the sewer. My advice to Brad Bird would probably be to make The Incredibles 2 as soon as possible.",

548,29 June 2007,Cel_Stacker,6," ""It is about ze food, and zat is really enough to zell it to ze Americans...""","Remy (Patton Oswalt) was born with the unique gift of deciphering smells and tastes, and marrying the two effectively--a gift any chef would give their apron for. Unfortunately, Remy was also born a rat. When it becomes apparent that his family cannot really appreciate his gift outside of its use in avoiding rat poison, Remy attempts to refine his talents in human kitchens. He even has the guidance of the late, great master chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett) to influence his endeavors. A series of unfortunate events unfolds, and the little rat finds himself in the big city, namely Paris, attempting to prove his talent with the help of hapless kitchen boy Tony Linguini (Lou Romano, Bernie Kropp in ""The Incredibles"") to the most discriminating of palates, including that of tough-as-nails critic Anton Ego (Peter ""The Great"" O'Toole). This is actually a nice piece of storytelling and an even better piece of animation. The environments of Paris and the French countryside are represented in grand scale--Bird's capable team and Pixar's diligent artists even manage to make a sewer look amazing! Meanwhile, you truly get the desperation and inspiration driving some well-designed characters, who are sure to remain memorable. Bird's fans might be a pinch disappointed in this one, though--it doesn't have that breakthrough stance employed so boldly with ""The Iron Giant"" or ""The Incredibles"", although it is nice to see him take on something a little lighter. A few lulls in the pacing make it feel a bit long, and technically, it's probably a little TOO good. It's evident that the Pixar crew did their usual in-depth study on the subjects, and while the rats are designed cute, the sight of millions of them gushing out of kitchens and houses made my skin crawl and took me right back to cult head-turners like ""Ben"" and ""Willard"" (brush up on your film history if you're unfamiliar with those). While far from Bird's or Pixar's finest, it's still a good time, and really a must for those of you (You know who you are!) who truly appreciate food.

559,2 July 2007,cathie454,7," Good animation, but not the best Pixar","First, I have to say that Pixar movies are amazing, and Ratatouille is no exception. Great animation, especially the views of Paris at night (of course, how could a view of Paris at night not be incredible?), the scene when Remy is swept away through the sewers under Paris and the first ""chase"" scene in the restaurant's kitchen, when the cooks are trying to catch the rat. I liked that the other rats seem more like rats, swarming through the garbage or when the old lady's ceiling collapses and is full of rats. But I still wouldn't rank this with Nemo, Toy Story or Bug's Life, and I can't quite say why. I thought the first hour was much more enjoyable than the rest of the movie; by that time, the jokes didn't seem as funny, it was a little too slow-moving, and I just wasn't as interested. But it is a good movie. The audience I was in was enjoying it, but not, I thought, as much as the audiences for Nemo or Toy Story. Even though I thought the story idea was good, other than the woman chef, the other characters just didn't seem as interesting by half way through the movie. Still, it's a fun summer movie.

We cut to our protagonist; a rat named Remy (Oswalt). Remy is gifted with an advanced sense of smell which teaches him to appreciate the food that he eats. He'd rather not eat garbage when there is a whole culinary world around him. In his attempts to get some basic spices, he stumbles upon a cooking show featuring the aforementioned chef. Before he knows it, Remy finds himself in Paris. Exploring a little further, he makes his way to Gusteau's restaurant. He watches, with hungry eyes, the creations of the master chefs. Remy crosses paths with the recently hired garbage boy, Linguini (Romano). The pair team up; Linguini will be the human representative of the two, while Remy provides the culinary direction.",

It calls for the core ability and latent values for both people and arts, instead of peoples' outlook or their past. Quality output can arise from simple and inexpensive materials in the presence of innovation and diligence. The story brings two apparently incompatible subjects together: rat and fine dining. It is rhetorically weak subject wise but propitiating both story wise and theme wise, coming with a classical narrative flow of Hollywood flicks. The epilogue brings an enlightening remark for commentators of any kind. The Cantonese version of voice-acting (Hong Kong) is excellent. Some graphics and dialogues are locally adapted with vividness enhanced. The flick is no less a film for adults as well and a good one with depth indeed.",
566,5 December 2008,manikhero,10, It was totally Fun and Cool,"The movie was fun and comedy. Remy was very cute among the rats. I like Remy's gift-smelling if, there is poison, is very useful for rats. Whenever, Remy cooks, it is very fun and cool. Remy controlling Linguini's action by his hair, it is an excellent idea. I like the restaurant named ""Gusteau's"" because the dining hall and the kitchen are very beautiful. Linguini's expressions and his movements make it totally funny. Skinner looks like a pucca villain. I like the rat's fast moving when they run. In the last scene, when the whole family of rats comes to the kitchen and cook and remy is directing how to cook, that scene is totally cool. When the customer tells the waiter that you have something new and tells we need the food from Linguini, that time Linguini cooks very fast but it is very funny, that scene was also superb. When skinner is chasing remy to get his documents, that scene is totally cool. When, remy falls in the kitchen and he tries to escape from the kitchen, that time he runs very fast from the humans, that scene is totally thrilling. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Ratatouille"".",

Now the negative, Ratatouille is definitely too long for younger children (trt: 1:50), and the story is certainly too ""deep"" for a 4-7 year old. Also, not that I'm a prude, however, a certain type of film is expected from Pixar/Disney when it is rated ""G"". Why my child needs to be exposed to an old lady running around the house shooting a shotgun at a ""living"" creature is beyond me. I'm sure the creative types at Pixar could have come up with a way to make the point that she wanted the rats out of the house without taking the easy way out and having her shoot at them with a gun. I also think that Pixar should stay with animating non-human characters (cars, fish, toys, etc), they seem to struggle with making the human characters ""human"". Bottom line, if you are a fan of Pixar, as I have been, you may be disappointed, with the price of taking the family to the cinema, I'd suggest waiting for this to be released commercially.",

How anyone could consider this to be Pixars greatest achievement let alone the greatest animated film of all time shocks me. There is no denying the technical achievement that this film represents, however the reason for any film should be the storyline. Throughout the film I was checking my watch to see when it would finish, as the poor plot and unbelievable characters did nothing to draw me in. One of Pixars finest abilities is to create a film for children that appeals to adults humour as well. This was probably the least funniest Pixar film I have had the misfortune of seeing and can only see any humour in the pretentious reviews written by so called 'art types'. Not the worst film I have every seen but in no way what so ever a classic of any type.",
573,6 December 2007,rake-7,6, Pleasing but WAY overrated,"With all the raves around this picture it's next to impossible not to have high expectations. Lower them. Unless you are entirely bowled over by visuals alone (which are truly stunning), you will be left wondering what all the fuss is about. This may be a movie about fine cuisine, but the story seems to have been concocted in a Cuisinart--it's a mash-up. Instead of a clear character objective or a distinct plot through-line, the filmmakers have tossed in every possible character type, sub-plot, and chase sequence, with the cumulative effect of holding your attention (for the most part), but leaving you ultimately unfulfilled. It's not that these sequences aren't artfully done (the technique is flawless), but they amount to an obfuscation of the fact that there's not much here but numerous pastry-thin layers of small vignettes (even at that, the filmmakers seem to have missed a lot of opportunities here, especially comic ones). There are also serious problems with suspension of disbelief. This may sound odd considering that this is an animated world, but such worlds hinge on their ability to establish their own parameters of reality. For reasons I cannot quite fathom, Ratatouille goes out of its way to set very specific and highly-realistic parameters, and then proceeds break them. You find yourself literally rationalizing certain plot developments with a conscious determination such as, ""well, it is, after all, a cartoon."" Great films may indeed be like great meals, but flavor alone doesn't satisfy.",

This is the most mature movie they've ever made and it has the best characters, easily the most intriguing, gripping, mesmerizing and stunning story out of any animated movie I've seen thus far and in cinema in general.

The plot was not special. I doubt they used the entire five hours. The premise I cheerfully accept as fantasy, but I doubt anyone living in a slum area or anyone with a sense of hygiene would find it all that humorous.

Both visually appealing and musically engaging, the film also offers a social critique on the tendency for the culinary arts to be male-dominant and hierarchical, as well as, the tendency to bring of other countries to commodify French heritage and high cooking for profit on fast food chains, for example--a subtle point touching on French-American tensions regarding dieting and cooking.

After all the hype and all of the five starts and great reviews that it received, I was severely disappointed to discover that the movie was anything but great. The movie revolves around a country rat, Remy, who with his rare gift of a fine palate dreams of cooking as a chef in a fine restaurant to the dismay of his lesser civilized family. After a twisted turn of events, he finds himself able to get that chance: in the hat of a boy who cannot cook to save his life. From there, the film becomes ridiculously stretched out, as if Brad Bird intentionally took all of the most incredulous ideas about a rat in fine dining and threw them into a terrible stew called Ratatouille. I feel strongly that whoever came up with idea, took it and ran with it¬Ö.straight into a wall. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and if anything, I was waiting for poor Remy to get the axe (literally). With its lack or violence (sorry, Remy never gets caught in a trap), foul language, or any sexual content, Ratatouille received a well deserved G grading for ""God, what was Brad Bird thinking taking up this project instead of The Incredibles 2?"" I give this film 2 out of 5 stars.",

PIXAR has been an utter bore since 1995's TOY STORY which debuted with enough success for it to be called a masterpiece. Pixar Animation Studios had dished out enough offerings that impressed the audience and the critics alike. I noticed this a long time ago. But the problem was FINDING NEMO, THE INCREDIBLES, they were sweet but just not on an all-time high level. I'll be straight, Pixar Animations Studios had never dished an offering that impressed me. That is, until the year 2007 came along with it another Pixar offering, 2007's RATATOUILLE.",

The only issue I had with this film is that some parts were a little over the top...such as the old woman shooting at the rats, and the chasing scene near the end...a tad too cartoonish. Also, while this film was funny, it didn't have any memorable laugh-out-loud, must-see-over-and-over again parts like Finding Nemo did.

Despite a promising premise that had the makings of a classic story, the story itself isn't consistent with it's internal logic. This leads to some frustrating and inexplicable moments and contrivances and makes you wonder what exactly the movie's message is. Wonder if the character of Ego made critics afraid of being someone like that. The movie is still enjoyable with some good humour, and a love for food.

605,4 April 2018,StoryTaker1,6, Positives sadly Do Not outweigh the negatives.,"Fully animated film projects were once considered childish and appropriate only for kids. Cartoons would never have the same meaning and plot as live action films. However, in recent years, producers have proven this belief to be incorrect, elevating the standards of animated films and dispelling the rumor that movies without real cameras were inferior. Now, graphic designers and artists compose widely popular projects that receive widespread praise. However, as there is competition in every industry, the movie industry is largely based on critics and reviews. There are disagreements as to which movies are better than others. Disney's ""Ratatouille"" stands as the best animated movie ever created, perfectly utilizing relatable struggles of everyday life, rocky relationships, and the power of food in order to show human consideration and compassion for others.
 Ratatouille is the story of a rat who helps a human find his purpose and during that process, learns about himself too. The movie is based in the beautiful country of France, where food is a big part of their culture. However, in the beginning, the movie starts out completely differently, with Remy, the rat, running in the rain to an old lady's house. Remy and his family are stealing food, but when the old lady finds out, she tries to kill them all. This leads the crowd to panic and run down a drain, but as Remy is the last of his entire family to go down the drain, Remy reaches a fork in the piping system. Here, he's forced to choose a path, and when it turns out to be the other path his family went down, he loses everybody he counted on and is left by himself. Eventually, he crawls through the sewer system and finds himself on a rooftop above Paris. Amazed, he starts roaming the city, eventually meeting Linguini, the human main character. Linguini works for a restaurant but can't cook, and Remy is a rat who can cook. Together, they come up with a hair pulling control system where they quickly receive praise (and trouble) around the kitchen. The restaurant, after getting a bad review from a critic, is expecting another highly esteemed critic and depends on Linguini's incredible dishes. However, they don't know that there's a rat in his hat cooking for him, and Linguini is still a shy, insecure cook who was initially hired to be a garbage boy. This entire adventure goes through ups and downs as Linguini's and Remy's friendship develops. The pair discover their motivations, passions, and how they need to work together despite being different species.
Compared to all over movies, ""Ratatouille"" builds up the most relatable main characters despite one not even being a human. Remy, the rat, is able to show a completely different life while still having human emotions and feelings. Alfredo Linguini is the new, cheaply paid employee who can't seem to find any significance to his daily life. Both of these characters have personalities that revolve around conflicts we all have encountered. In the beginning of the movie, Remy and his family are forced to steal food, and when he is separated from them due to escaping down a drain, he's completely lost. Remy doesn't know who he is, and nobody can help him except himself. This struggle of self identity and the idea dealing with the unknown hits home for all of us. Linguini, after being hired as a garbage boy, gets into a mishap with the owner of the restaurant and is constantly picked on for not being anything more than his job. His life is miserable and he lives without much meaning, which we've all gone through at some point. The struggle, confusion, and fear displayed by both main characters connects with the audience deep down, bringing an all too familiar sentimental feeling to everyone in the theater. 
 Some say that, despite its high reviews, ""Ratatouille"" is a weak attempt by Disney to use European values for interest and money. They say that the ""French"" culture of Ratatouille is filled with American workers with awful examples of cliche French language. Others say that the whole idea of having rats interact with humans in a plot about food is simply disgusting. However, if you look closer, you'll see that Disney really pushed the French culture aspect in the movie, molding the setting, side characters, and streets like something out of France. In fact, when drawing the food animations, the production crew consulted actual French chefs. Also, as disgusting rats are, the producers used this to show how animals can have good values too. They can help humans, and simply seeing animals as dirty inferiors isn't right.
When the movie first came out, I immediately loved it. There's charm, excitement, weirdness, comfort, and relatability in the movie. The lessons taken from the scenes are down to earth, important lessons that everybody should know, and just the idea of having a meaningful dialogue with a rat in it is incredible. When the producers were creating the movie, they blended French culture with a plot that revolved around French cuisine. Bottom line, I believe that everybody should see ""Ratatouille"" because it's unique plot and animation provides such a range of emotions that only a few other animated films have accomplished. No matter your age, you can find humor, a good cry, a heartwarming message, and everything else from the movie. ""Ratatouille"" is one of the best animated movies ever, and it's a masterpiece of cinema history.",

Fine art can come from a very humble origin (which is here an animation film, that is mainly intended to be a children movie), as like as a great cook can be a rat! In my place there is a common misconception that animation films are made basically for children. I see it in my father's eye when he 'caught' me watching a 3D animation film! I think this film is a very good reply for that. Animation films are always under-rated everywhere, so it was a good surprise for me to know that Pixar's new film (Up!) is now in Canne's film festival (2009)!

Instead, let's go with a movie about a rat, and just to make sure even fewer people can get around that, let's make the rat and everyone else French. Nobody really likes the French. Even the French don't really like the French. The only reason to have French people in a movie is to make fun of being French. But that doesn't work unless there are enough non-French people to point out how much cooler it is not to be French. There was a great computer animation film featuring rats, but it was ""Flushed Away"" and the rats were Brits. There were some French frogs and they were hilarious. The only reason I give this one four stars was that everyone making this really worked hard.

I can only say that ""Ratatouille"" was an intense disappointment, especially when measured against a film like ""Paprika,"" which demonstrates the adult potential of animation. The Rat story was a kid story with a good moral but was unexceptional and banal in its execution on the screen. Unlike ""Spirited Away"" & ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" which are both moral stories appropriate for children (as opposed to, say, ""Grave of the Fireflies""), ""Ratatouille"" was not at all sophisticated or imaginative in its presentation. Big noses and crooked teeth are a limited device for conveying the Gallic character and the villain's pencil-thin moustache made him look as if he'd been recycled from a WW II animated piece on the Pacific theatre.",
614,21 July 2007,harborrat28,7, Cute (So-oh-oh Disney) versus WOW,"I must concede, when you think about old Disney films - the requirement to suspend disbelief was always paramount. Take 'Lady & The Tramp', say - two dogs, having a romantic, candlelit dinner and being serenaded by a couple of Italian Chefs. No bottoms are sniffed at anytime, and nobody looks in danger of being neutered against their will... Yet, I loved it, I would say 'at the time' but the truth is that I still kinda love this old time Disney schmaltz. You know why?...Because, despite the ridiculous situations and prepositions, they STILL pull it off. If only for a second, they have carried you away somewhere on their whimsy, and lost you in the elaborate fantasy. There shouldn't, therefore, be any problem in taking this concept a little further down the food chain. After all, if you can love stray dogs once you realise they have feelings too, its surely only another leap of faith to love the rat that wants to cook your dinner. Really?! Try watching this film WHILST eating your dinner, and then come back and tell me it was a great idea. And, therein, is where I believe the problem lies - plausibility.",

I gave Brad Bird the benefit of the doubt. I wasn't surprised to learn that he did not originate the project but deserves credit for the ""save."" The story about a rat who wishes to follow his dream is universal enough to overcome the snobbishness of the arena in which he wishes to make his mark. The element I found myself questioning was the hyper-realistic setting. When the kitchen and the food are made to look so real, it calls into question whether or not this could have been shot, much less expensively, as a live action film.",

The standard Hollywood cartoon mode can almost find similar themes from the cartoons produced every year, only the characters and stories are changed.

Well if it's an animated restaurant, where the story is just told for entertainment purposes, then this movie succeeded. I must admit, seeing that many rats (even if animated), can be disturbing. Once they started speaking English in Paris, and gave the little rodents characteristics comprehensible to humans, then the fear of animated rats in the animated kitchen subsided. I'll give the writers credit for disallowing the main character, Remy the rat, from speaking to Linguini, but only gestures to him on how to cook. The movie is sometimes implausible, and yet the story has an innate charm to hold your attention. This maybe an animated film, but it's also undoubtedly a ""food"" movie, with Remy being inspired by Chef Gusteau, the pleasures of fine dining. It is also somewhat of a morale lesson, in that, Chef Gusteau as a ""ghost"" supplies Remy with more than the fine art of cooking. I'd have to disagree that this is a classic Disney tale. No one dies and there's no rain. Even the chief villain (the food critic Ego) has a happy ending. It is however, a very well made animated feature with super cooking rodents.",

643,29 March 2020,playstationonward,10, One of the Finest Animated Films to Ever Grace the Silver Screen,Ratatouille is truly phenomenal. It has everything I love in it. The humour is at times nuanced and at others obvious. The characters are fully realised and have genuine personalities. The story is interesting and the fantastic soundtrack makes it all the much better.,
644,6 April 2020,jonnydmullan,10, Phenomenal,"This is not the best Pixar movie to be ever made, not even close because even Cars 2 and that boring movie The Boring Dinosaur is better than this film, fans of Pixar always cite this film as the best animated films of all times because of the ""messaging"" but ignore the rest of the boring film that does nothing to help improve the animation medium which proves to me that 3D animation is a waste of time and resources, proving that Disney shot itself in the foot by buying this cursed company.",
645,7 March 2023,Doctor_Dafaria,1, Most Pretentious Animated Films I have ever seen,"Almost each new product Pixar released made me think ""It can't get any better!"" But than comes Ratatouille... What was presented by Brad Bird is truly phenomenal! Ratatouille manages to combine the magic of the old classic Disney pictures with some fresh ingredients and stunning animation! Without any doubt Ratatouille has forged a new path and has established the new standard in animation. This movie will be definitely enjoyed by both kids and adults and even those who normally don't like animation. Never before have animated characters been so adorable, Remy and his fellow rats are just the definition of cuteness. It's hard to believe how outstanding Pixar animation has become - it looks so real that you just forget it's all virtual! What else can I say...I just wonder what's next.",

I just saw the sneak preview and it not only met my expectations, I wasn't expecting this much actually. It started not bad, sort of classic, and went pretty well to the end. The best part about the movie I guess was the way the events were designed and the reasonings in the movie. You know, at parts, I was expecting some classic events that you expect from animation context. But they didn't, substituted by more realistic, human-like ones. Also, no exaggerated useless drama, just enough. The laughing parts were adequate and at the right times too, and on top of all, the animation itself. At some points, you could actually feel the afford they've put on this to look as real as possible, yet an animation. The only thing was that I just felt it could be better to have more shadows underneath rats' legs, but they're the experts, maybe I'm wrong. Overall, I have to say 10/10.",

The movie is also incredibly original, hard to compare with anything else out there. The best animated movie I've seen yet.

652,27 July 2007,HRMoviegoer,5," Superb Animation, Sleepy Story","Pixar have done it again. This is the Second Best Pixar film so far, as nothing beats Finding Nemo. It was directed by the Oscar-winning Brad Bird director and writer of ""The Incredibles"", who has created a film with humour, heart and meaning. If you see the film at the cinema it will begin with a hilarious so called ""Pixar Short"" called Lifted, that will actually make you cry with laughter. Anyway back to the story, it follows Remy a young and lovable rat with a special gift of hyper smell I suppose and he just loves to cook. He actually loves to cook so much that he ends up putting his huge rat family in danger and ends up in (with some help from his ghostly hero Gusteau, a top chef) Paris the food capital of the world and right in front of Gusteau's restaurant that's being run by Skinner who's just in it for the money not the love of food. Remy then makes a friend called Linguini who can't cook to save his life. So with some amazing discoveries and clever antics, Remy and Linguini run this top restaurant, with help from their staff of course. Then all goes wrong when Linguini falls for one of the chefs called Collette, Remy is fed up with Linguini getting all the credit for his work and worse of all, the food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole Troy, Venus and many films that I am too young to know) that could determine a restaurants future by a few words. Well that's the clever and original story, but what really makes this film shine is the beautiful and absolutely mind blowing animation, the attention to detail is unbeatable and this definitely shows when you see the water in the sewers. This backed up with brilliant sound and brilliant voices from people that I have never heard of, except Peter O'Toole of course who gives quite interesting speech at the end. The message of this film is anyone can do anything if they put their mind to it and it doesn't matter where you come from, which I suppose is true. So overall a clever and warming film for the whole family, with humour that both children and adults will find funny.",
653,27 February 2008,jonnyk12,8, Pixar second best film to date,"Ratatouille is path breaking stuff. Animation movies are no longer for kids and people who are kids at heart, this is serious stuff.

Yes, the animation was out of this world but I left the movie feeling like it was a waste of money to see in the theater. I went to this movie for a funny pick-me-up movie...it didn't achieve that for me. I wish I would have waited until it came out on video and I definitely won't own it...like I do the other Pixar movies...even the into short fill wasn't supper funny but it was much better than the full length movie! I definitely think that the story line is too far above a child's thinking, but the cuteness of the rats will appeal to them. The adults will understand the story line but not see any humor in the story. I think I laughed once or twice...and that was at the end. The beginning is VERY slow and I heard lots of kids getting restless in the theater...maybe wait till you can watch it at home before you take young kids...and it will save you a lot of money because, in my opinion, this isn't worth seeing in the theater",

For example, when Linguini slams the back door of the kitchen after he says:""then let's do this thing!"", I felt the embaressment as if that had happened to me.

This movie touches on all points and winds up with their typically surprising yet always satisfying ending. In a world where a rat can cook and understand English anything is possible, even impressing the stuffiest of critics. It's a silly concept really, and done by anyone else would be dismissible as just another kid's movie, but Ratatouille captures the heart and makes you care about every one of the characters. I am glad to see that the interaction between the rats and the humans didn't go beyond simply nodding but even that level of communication conveys exactly what each party is attempting to get across.

Or there are topics which are concentrating on surviving, caring, love story, struggling for basic needs and so on that plays on basic instincts. That's why a bottle's neck of ideas and ""prospective"" is becoming narrower and narrower for creators.

The visuals are outstanding especially when Remy goes to the roof of a building and he looks out and you get a spectacular view of Paris which really impressed me.

The animation is perfectly gorgeous. The skies are drawn with rich color and the special effects are not just professional but they are exciting. Ratatouille's animation is a 10 out of 10. The voice acting is pretty good and I give it 7 out of 10. Every thing except the plot was above average for me. I will give credit where it is due. The concept of the film is great. I think it is a very creative idea to have a rat that loves to cook and a struggling chef work together in a restaurant. This film is not new but I still like how creative it is. The actual story-line was a 5 out of 10. I think there should have been less comedy and more sentimentality in the film. Ratatouille needed to be a little more serious. There were too many gags in it for me to enjoy as an adult. But I still liked it.,

The animation was spectacular, one the the best yet on Pixar's part. I loved the music- it was very fitting for the film, and I loved that it was in FRENCH. The plot development was done very well, as was the character development, particularly Anton Ego. Ratatouille contained so many subtleties that really add to it and make it a truly great animated film. I think it's suitable and enjoyable for anyone of any age without losing any charm or fun.

The short film in front of the movie is pixar's best yet, it's brilliant.

Even a rat (which i find to be disgusting),"Simply the most boring children's animated movie, Ratatouille focuses on the contrasting visual perspectives of a rat and a teenage boy and attempts to draw most of it's humour from here. The comedy did not exist within the story itself... the joke of a rat assisting a teenage boy's cooking skills wears off after a few minutes. You can dissect the movie and delve into discussion around it's wonderful cinematography and attempts at being innovative with POV camera angles etc. but I think this is another film that reflects changing attitudes towards cinema that are quite dangerous for the industry. Production companies are putting far too much emphasis on captivating audiences with technical 'cleverness' rather than telling an interesting story. The reason for Toy Story's success is obvious. Not only was the animation absolutely enthralling, the story constantly held us in suspense with a variey of fascinating characters. Ratatouille not only holds on to themes and catch phrases for far too long, with the annoying 'anyone can cook' statement, it creates an extremely unrealistic relationship between animal and man through a very week scene of a boy discovering the capabilities of a rat. Anyone with even the most powerful imagination will be unable to accept their interaction, and a voice in their mind will scream out 'far fetched' throughout most of the film. ",

706,28 October 2020,delvyjane,10, Great Chef,"Ratatouille is by far the best Disney movie ever! It tells the story of a little rat named Remy wanting to be a chef. Remy gets his chance when a young man named Linguini needs his help to cook in a restaurant. They come up with an idea that Remy can control Linguini by tugging on his hair and get involved in a little adventure. This movie is a great family movie that makes you realize that you don't have to have money, be rich, or popular in order to succeed; you just have to have soul and potential. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys cooking, comedy, and a heart-warming tale! I guarantee that anyone who watches this movie will love it the very first second they watch it!",

Pixar can only go down from here."" Cars proved me right. But Ratouille's detail and splendor has built on the success of The Incredibles. The action scenes are breathtaking and Pixar turns cooking into an exhilarating nerve-racking experience. The characters are likable though none of them are particularly memorable except Anton Ego, who is voiced by the brilliant Peter O'Toole. And Ratouille is even better because there is something missing that has been in Pixar movies for years: The annoying supporting character with the voice of nails on a chalkboard. I'm talking about characters along the lines of Ellen Degeneres in Finding Nemo and Billy Crystal in Monsters Inc. Thankfully there is no such character in this film. Ratatouille's story is simplistic but the movie is aimed at a younger audience after all. There are funny scenes, the animation is gorgeous, and there are some important lessons in the film (the importance of art, accepting difference, don't forget where you came from, etc).",

728,16 July 2007,tpbeme,10, Great film/animation...,"Me and my mentally challenged friend decided to watch Ratatouille. Where does one even begin with this film? This rat has not only travelled to a great city, and made a living as a chef, but him and his family committed murder together. It is through this act, of murdering the health inspector that they formed a bond closer than any other rats could have formed. It is through this bond that they are able to begin to overthrow the government. The look in the health inspector's eyes showed it all, those few brief frames of fear in his eyes showed not only his life flashing before himself, but a realization of the world that is to come. These rats have not only begun to fool the chef into trusting them, but have now begun to overcome the humans that were once higher upon the food chain. It is in these brief moments that the tables have turned, in that the revolution had begun, the revolution of that rat. These rats would have begun to realise that they would no longer need to hide in the shadows, but they can now, as one, begin to reclaim their lost throne on top of the food chain. The rats now will have a chance within this cruel world, to make a change for their own species. Something the humans are not prepared for is that simple fact they are outnumbered by the rats. In the more than likely event that the revolution takes place, our world is doomed. Once they take over Paris, they will be able to take over the world with their own technology, which has never been seen before. Does this sound familiar to you, of course it does, everyone has heard of the French revolution before, even the rats. They have watched history unfold before their eyes, and have learnt from our mistakes. It is from sitting in the shadows that they have watched us and learnt, learnt our weaknesses, our desires and our goals, of which they will be able to not only overcome, but exploit. Ever heard of a pandemic before? Of course you had, we are in one now./ ever heard of the plague? If you have ever been in school before, of course you have, the rats have learnt about all of this. They will reintroduce the plague into our society, and will eventually, through this method, the revolution and industrialisation of the rat kind, will not only overcome us, but will wipe the human population from the face of the earth. This is the image provided to us as the viewers, from these brief frames, these brief frames of fear we witnessed from the health inspector, before he meets his death.",

Despite a somewhat predictable story, this film is compelling from beginning to end and full of excitement and hilarious humor. The pacing is brilliant, including a rare freeze frame animated sequence and some seriously interesting perspective on the world of food. The slapstick scenes are sometimes as original as a vintage silent film and when they are overly silly, they are still funny and playing to its target audience. It may not make as much money as Cars, but that film was boring and once joke strung out for the same laughs. Remy is a balanced main character, with solid voice work by comedian Patton Oswalt. The portrayal of France was romantic and genuinely appealing and I felt some scenes could have had a cheerful song or two, but as it is the film is nearly perfect and paced exceptionally well. Garofalo and Garrett both use accents well and create memorable characters and the theme of having help from sources outside of yourself is one often covered and re- covered in popular film, but never as comically and effective as is done here.

I say the following with real regret. For some reason unknown to me, the word 'bloody' was used by Peter O'Toole as the voice of Anton Ego in the context of swearing! What a great shame, and to the dismay of many parents in the audience too! Children were commenting whilst I watched the film saying 'that man used a bad word'. We were all embarrassed and left wondering whether any more swearing was going to materialise and consequently interrupted the flow and enjoyment of an otherwise spectacular film. Why did such a great animation have to be spoilt by such ridiculous use of language. Sure, Anton was angry, but swearing when 4 and 5 year olds are in the audience. It was absolutely not necessary, especially for the use of just one word. My fear is that it is an attempt by the film company to educate the very young and very innocent in the use of bad language at an early stage. What a sad reflection on the film company!

The story is amazing and we get to follow Remy the rat's journey from living in an attic in a country house and sneaking into the kitchen to pursue his cooking passion and longing for something more, to ending up in a 5-star restaurant in Paris and getting to live out his dream, while simultaneously befriending Linguini and helping him go from a garbage boy living in an apartment to gaining rightful ownership of his father's 5-star restaurant. You get to see the battle Remy faces in which he has to juggle between following his dream of being a cook and being there for his family, which in the beginning, do not support his decision. You get to see all of the things that go on in the kitchen and Linguini and one of the cooks, Colette, become closer throughout the movie. Eventually, Remy's family supports Remy in his cooking dream and they all come together as a family and help Remy. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is towards the end when the food critic, Anton Ego, eats the Ratatouille and he is immediantly brought back to his childhood when he ate that dish served by his mother.

While I have seen a few witty and groundbreaking animated movies, namely Shrek and The Incredibles, I have been detoured by the recent plugging of well known actors to draw an older crowd to ultimately ""kiddy"" films. It came as an enormous surprise when I took a daring leap and picked up Ratatouille. This movie is not only animated to a degree of showing emotion better than some A-rated actors/actresses, but also hits dead on by illustrating many scenes of grief, stress, and happiness with its vibrant and dynamic colors. But this movie is not dependent on sheer animation, as my fears came to a rest. This movie explores the human spirit and its desire to overcome, endure, and bare creativity. That there is a potential for excellence and uniqueness that is not found in just anyone, but can be found anywhere. A rare Disney message that is a fresh approach to its overused ""everyone wins"" motto.",

814,11 July 2022,mhalfakeeh,10, One of the best Pixar movies.,"I have seen ratatouille multiple times it stands as one of my favorite movies ever. It was made in 2007 which surprised me as the animation is better than many movies made in the past 5 years. The plot simple enough a rat that can cook gets separated from its colony and finds its self in Paris where he stumbles across his idol's restaurant (Gusteau's). He accidentally enters the restaurant and after almost escaping he finds a soup messed up by the garbage boy Linguini. He fixes the soup and Linguini is saved so they team up and the rest you have to watch. There are definitely flaws in this movie, I don't quite like the character of Linguini I can't really express it but it's just a thing I can't get over. They didn't need to bring back chef skinner he had served his purpose after the first act. This movie isn't perfect by any means, but despite its flaws it still remains one of my top 5 movies of all time. From the beginning its motto becomes clear ""anyone can cook"" a simple message but a powerful one that would be restated time and time again in the movie and is the main driving factor for Remy. This motto is so much, it isn't meant to be taken literally it's not meant to mean anyone can be a good cook, but as they say in the movie, a good cook can come from anyone. Remy is probably the best main character in any Pixar film because he represents us. He has a drive to do that one thing and that drive will not let him stop. He represents the part of us that wants to fulfill our passions. Ratatouille is not the perfect movie. And though it is in my top 5 it isn't my favorite, but it is the best Pixar film they have ever produced. Remy's voice actor can get annoying after a little while but it doesn't take away from the movie as you would think that this is how Remy would sound if you could actually hear him. This movie means so much to me which is probably why it isn't a great review. It's my first review ever so I don't expect it to be very good but I love this movie so much I couldn't help myself. There is still a lot more that I could talk about from the animation to the characters but I find that schaffrillas productions on YouTube says everything I wanted to with better articulation. So I will leave you with the review that Anton Ego left the restaurant. It sums up so perfectly what I am trying to say. ""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.

821,22 July 2022,rxktstv,10, *SPOILERS* AMAZING FILM,"The simplicity of its message makes Ratatouille great, it is a sample of an experience of simple emotions that appeals to the hard truth of knowing that the conditions of the individual alter their possibilities but nevertheless do not limit them.",

Its a desert of the films. the animation is superb. the drama which unfolds with the journey of rats struggle for making it big as a Cook is simply awesome.

826,29 September 2014,hiru556,10, 10 out of 10 isn't enough for this movie.. :),"A very good animated movie from Pixar. The movie has all elements to make it a perfect animated film. and its not just for kids. It has comedy, emotions and a good message. "" One should never discourage any one for any reason. "" The animation was at the expertise level. Pixar proved it again that it can create any kind of technology that gives more realistic feeling to the characters in the movie. The story was beyond imagination. The effects were awesome. mainly the water was rendered in a much realistic way. The best scene was when the rat enters into the kitchen and starts coking food. Each frame in the movie has the beauty. There was no scene that we feel it's like more. Everything suits to the story. And the character designs suits to the story. At the end I say its the best movie from Pixar.",

828,18 September 2011,kidneyxd,8, Cooking has never looked so good.,"ratatouille is a great movie. another Disney hit. it does not exceed Disney classics like snow white, but i believe it stands with them. i found myself laughing histericly, at many different times in the movie. for the people that cant look past the fact that rats are cooking food, this movie is not for you, but if you can look past that and enjoy the cleverness, shear enjoyment, and the great message that this movie has. this is a great family movie and it will be enjoyed by people of all ages.",
829,15 February 2012,twynia,9, another Disney hit,"Loved it! Amazing children's movie that teaches children to do what they want to do and not to let anyone stand in their way. There was a lot of great humor in this movie as well which made it very interesting and it was great how the made it realistic in a way that rats can't cook since they are really messy but they do it anyways which isn't as realistic. Also, I really licked how the rat's guide was like an illusion for him since he was already dead and wasn't real become it made it see like he was thinking to himself and arguing with himself of what to do but they showed him talking to a chef that was dead like he was talking to the rat and giving him advice, which I thought was really cool.",

832,20 February 2021,matthewgolden1989,8, A classic Pixar favorite,"Spanning the last decade of Disney films, one is rarely filled with any hint of Disney deja vu of yesteryears. Over produced failings and plots of mediocrity have caused many to conclude that the certain Disney experience that once caused laughter, smiling tears, and most importantly thought, is a thing of the past; after Cars, Chicken Little, and even Nemo, I was forced to agree. Then Ratatouille scurried in. This is Disney-Pixar's crowning achievement, finally blending the Toy Story animation with that classic humanistic feel of the hand drawn. The characters and animators are on the same page thought the show with excellent performances by everyone (especially by the wondrous Peter O'Toole) After watching Ratatouille, one is left with the old sensation that somehow those crucial themes of identity, discovery of self, family, truth, and comradery are secretly baked into a multiple layered extravaganza. Ratatouille presents a three course Disney feast, stirring both soup and soul,not seen since The Lion King . Bravo Chef!",

835,12 October 2020,mmmymmm,10, Animated Favourite,"I remember, a hot sunny day of July 2007 with my favorite aunt, Guylaine being so happy to see Ratatouille. We went at the Kirkland Coliseum to see it when it released. Getting so much feelings just reminding how beautiful those days were ! Back in 2007, so many great memories. Recently bought the Blu Ray to watch again my favorite animation movie. I have seen a lot of animation movies since 2007, especially the ones made by Pixar following Ratatouille but this movie is incomparable. The story-line is just incredible, the animation made by Pixar is perfect and the mood...I have no word. Definitely recommend this one for anyone on earth ! - Thomas",
836,30 March 2016,therealfocz,10, A true masterpiece,"After going to Disneyland Paris last year, I went on the Ratatouille ride which was fairly new at the time. It is sort of like a simulator in the way that you are immersed into the action but not like the thrill of a roller coaster. After going on the ride twice I truly fell in love! After this I decided to buy the DVD of Ratatouille and since then I have never looked back. ",
837,14 September 2015,sophiekaraolis,9, Fun and Delicious! Do Not Underestimate!,"Ratatouille caught my eye ever since I first saw the trailer for it. Now, almost a decade later, it stills holds a place inside me. I highly recommend watching this movie if you haven't already. This movie will definitely entertain you if you like food, the beautiful scenery of Paris, or if you simply like good, animated films!",
