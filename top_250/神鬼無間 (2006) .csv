0,7 December 2009,bkoganbing,10, Moles And Rats,"When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.",/
1,19 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, One of Scorsese's very best movies,"Martin Scorsese returns to familiar territory with this story of the lives of cops and gangsters living in America. However, a few things are different this time around – it's Irish gangsters rather than Italian, and for the first time in his life, Scorsese is shooting a remake, of the Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS. I haven't yet watched the original film but I'm pleased to say that THE DEPARTED is an example of the director at the top of his game and I'm completely satisfied that he finally won his best director Oscar for his efforts here.",r

3,31 October 2006,MaxBorg89,10, Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!,"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.",v

5,3 October 2006,Alwood,10, Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!,"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.",e
6,2 October 2006,General_Turgidson,10, Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.",w

8,4 October 2006,Jay_Exiomo,10, A masterpiece right up Scorsese's alley,"Director Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"", a gangster flick based from the Hong Kong thriller ""Internal Affairs"", goes without saying as perhaps his best work since ""Goodfellas."" Working on a genre that's right up his territory, Scorsese is back on top of his game and recreates a new dimension to the genre. This crime thriller treads the same theme as much of its director's previous films does. It's about two young men, the people around them, and the complications brought about by their characters' ambiguity.",r

10,29 September 2006,SoncoChairman,10, Fantastic Bro,"Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated.",1

12,1 January 2010,Hitchcoc,9, Whom Do You Trust?,"Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish.",6
13,2 April 2018,TheMovieDiorama,7, The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film.,"Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a ""thriller"" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims ""harrrrrdest!"". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative.",1
14,19 February 2007,grumpy-3,1, major let down,"what a let down, after all the fuss and rave reviews, the film is not a patch on the honk kong original. scorcese takes two and half hours to tell a very simple story that in the original had you tensed up all the way. here what we get is banal dialogue,(goodfellas again) implausible plot turns, (i'm trying to remember if infernal affairs plot was as ludicrous, take the fact that di caprio goes to see the police shrink, in the police building, what no ones sees him. the basic premise and point of the movie is when and how they are going to discover,each, it takes ages to get to this point, by which time i was bored silly with nicholsons way over the top performance, di caprio looked and sounded like he was about to cry any moment, but worst of all was that the film had no energy, it just sagged, this is now the third film from sorcese that looks tired, it started with gangs of new york, then aviator and now this, by this going, his next film will positively crawl to the end. overrated, overblown and forgetfull",6
15,18 October 2006,adrossan,1, Save your money,"Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line ""I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...."" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. ",9

Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told.

Having discovered the film is a remake of a superior foreign film this explains a lot (though probably not all) of what makes this such a bad film.,f
22,21 August 2022,IamROCKAS,7," What happens to rats trying to ""out-rat"" each other?","A good guy, playing the bad guy, or a bad guy, playing the good guy - who will prevail in a standoff like this? The answers (sort of) lie within this movie, though the narrative is more about them trying to ""out-rat"" each other. What did that lead to? Well, more casualties than anyone could expect, for one. It also resulted in a lot of hurt feelings. Finally, we were left with an ending that leaves quite a lot of questions, even though by that point we had almost all of the answers. If there's a message that this movie tried to deliver, I'd guess it would sound something like ""being a rat doesn't lead to any good"". Seeing the rat in the final shot also gives a similar impression.",_

24,15 October 2006,kongwong,7, Jack is great but the Original is MUCH BETTER,"Just watched it last night and can't help but think how much better the original ""Infernal Affairs"" was compare to ""The Departed.""

25,27 September 2006,ClaytonDavis,9," Scorsese's Best since ""Goodfellas""","I'm very glad to say that this is his best achievement since ""Goodfellas"" and the best of his career. ""The Departed"" is a remake of the Hong-Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" which tells the story of two men, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) whom are on two opposites sides of the law and seem to have their lives revolving around one of the most notorious gangsters, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy comes from a family of mafia lords and crime smugglers however, seems to find his way into the honorable profession of law enforcement and wanting to make a difference. After his graduation from the academy, he is made an offer that involves getting entangled with the roots of his family and becoming the one thing he swore to fight against. ",t

I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung (Mou gaan dou, Ying xiong), Li Gong (Miami Vice, Memoirs of a Geisha) and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha, Ying xiong).

27,25 April 2007,wricketts,1," Another ""Sympathy"" Oscar","I'm never going to be in a position to win an Oscar, so maybe I just don't understand how goshdarn fab it is to get one. Still, were I Martin Scorsese, I can't imagine not being too ashamed to show my face in public after receiving an Oscar for this claptrap. This isn't a Martin Scorsese film; this is a Saturday Night Live sendup of a Martin Scorsese film. This is the Academy saying, ""Well, we didn't give him one for Gangs of New York or for Good Fellas, and he's getting a little long in the tooth, after all. We'd better give him an Oscar for this before he croaks."" Is there anyone -- ANYONE??? -- in this film, with the possible exception of DiCaprio, who isn't acting following a major dose of Xanax? (Matt Damon evidently took his Xanax after a lobotomy that was so botched that he could no longer even change his facial expression.) And what's with Mark Wahlberg's HAIR??? Is there any redeeming social value in scene after scene (after scene) of heads exploding in a red cloud? Even Scorsese is bored with depicting violence; he does it because it's expected of him, not because he really gives a damn anymore. You're stupid enough to want it; he's jaded enough to give it to you. A plot line with more holes in it than the hull of The Titanic. Characters about as appealing as Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't care what happens to a single person in this film, and you can't even care that the moral center collapses about an hour in. This film isn't even sickening; it's just dull, dull-witted, and trashy. Scorsese got his Oscar out of sympathy; too bad the film doesn't have any for the viewer.",u

29,26 March 2007,badtothebono,1, THIS won an Oscar? Any Oscar?,"I wasn't surprised when it won. The ""oh, he/she has never won, so we've got to give it to he/she"" has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn't seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn't last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson's games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn't known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn't have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson's character wouldn't have fingered and killed DiCaprio's character quickly is also ridiculous. Let's see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? ",v
30,31 December 2020,thecarmenlips,10, Hands down the best film of its genre/one of the best films of the century,The plot line of this film you could almost say is a Shakespearean tragedy. Beautifully written with surprise reveals. Casted perfectly and Howard Shore's score works great to bridge together the scenes. It's honestly as high of a 10/10 as you can get.,
31,9 October 2006,kane4782,7," Scorsese tries, almost succeeds, but fails in my eyes...","I have loved the original (Infernal Affairs) from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story, and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.",
32,8 December 2006,jeanbal,1, Come on! Where is the logic of it all? (Spoiler warning),"I love Scorcese, but, eh, this is the guy who also shot Gangs of New York of ridiculous fame. And this... piece of work is worst. Don't get me wrong, I liked a lot the first half hour of the movie. Even Nicholson is ""good"" and doesn't overplay his part in the beginning. Quite a miracle in itself for this decade! But then... where goes the plot? By the ending you get some unlikely situations that should have been ""preserved"" for the Da Vinci Code Crap: ""So, he is the traitor? Well, I'm not going to tell anyone, I will send him a CD with a recording I don't have yet and I will bring him on the top of a building to... huh... to use the lift with to get to floor level and I... huh... will call my old academy friend... huh... to... huh... ask him to come so the 3 of us can use the lift! Yeah! Good idea! And we will shoot everybody, and I won't tell the police, and I won't tell the only officer who knows who I really am. Genius!"" NONSENSE! The last 45 minutes are full of pretentious unbelievable ""so called smart ideas"". Try the original ""Infernal Affairs"". Even if it's not much glamorous, it definitely has ""something"".

33,22 February 2007,ccthemovieman-1,6, The Good & Bad Of 'The Departed',"THE GOOD - A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if will be found out. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, ---- (the only female with many lines), Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone give superb support.

BUT....",
34,4 January 2020,Horst_In_Translation,8, A film that only gets better with each viewing,"""The Departed"" is an American 2.5-hour live action movie and one of the biggest hits from the unique career of director Martin Scorsese, also because it won (him) Best Director and Best Picture at the Oscars. This film is from 2006, so almost 15 years old now and another Oscar that it won was for Best Screenplay and that one went to William Monahan, although the original is of course a Korean movie from a few years earlier or actually several Korean movies as this one here is just an adaptation, but the kind where most people would say it is superior to the original or where most people do not even know there is an original. Anyway, the only Oscar it did not win from its nominations was for Best Supporting Actor, but that was no surprise at all because Wahlberg being nominated over Nicholson (and DiCaprio) surely came as a bit of a surprise, even if he was nominated for a Golden Globe too. I mean I don't mind Marky Mark, but he definitely was not the best supporting player from the bunch here. I guess he surely profited a lot from the fact that he was basically the only bigger character who survived the movie in the end. He may have lost his job, but he did not lose his life and actually the last scene is just really memorable when he shows up at the central character's home and kills him because otherwise the bad guy would have gotten away with it. So he makes somewhat sure we get a happy ending if you can say so. Speaking of lead actors, I am also not sure if you can really call DiCaprio's turn a supporting performance like the SAG Awards did (unlike the Globes and BAFTAs), but maybe it was this category confusion that cost him the Oscar nomination eventually. He would have deserved it, more than for ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"". In my opinion, he may not have been a lead as big as Damon, but surely a lead nonetheless. Also it really surprises me that Damon received no awards recognition whatsoever from the big awards bodies. He would have deserved it as well. But yeah, Scorsese-DiCaprio is just something that has worked so well for so long, so no surprise this is maybe what is more on people's minds. And of course, Di Caprio and Marty deserved all the accolades they got for this film.",

40,17 March 2007,martinitaly,1, The Untalented,"The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics.",

The acting in this movie is simply incredible!! The plethora of acting talent simply overwhelms you!! Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, and of course Matt Damon!! I thought Matt Damon's performance was the best acting performance in this movie!! The comment he made which I found to be very interesting was ""The Irish are impervious to psycho-analysis"".. I went to grade school at an Irish parish, and even though they were affluent, they did seem more visceral than many other ethnic groups are!! Boston is the only city in the country where the Irsih control the syndicate. The Italians are accustomed to ruling organized crime in virtually every other city in the United States. Boston is where the movie ""The Departed"" takes place.. The F word replaced a lot of semantics in this movie, and the violence seemed to have some kind of tenet of amelioration attached to it!! ""The Departed"" won for best picture in '2006, as it would appear as though the copious quantity of top notch talent in this film would almost mandate such an accolade!! How were all the problems in this movie solved?...WITH A GUN!! The violence in ""The Departed"" was almost satirical, as it signified a precarious set of checks and balances!! Everyone's anger seemed to reflect a sordid and justifiable pontification for everything!! Many techniques of agitation and vindictiveness with this movie told the movie audience one thing- This is a Scorcese film!! His style emanates a proverbial belligerence through frustration that he has incorporated in so many of his past movies!! I enjoyed this film, and I can definitely see how it won best picture in '2006. What is the best way of saying ""The Departed"" is an excellent movie, by saying this: ""The Departed"" is a really good (F word) picture!!",
43,27 February 2007,sansay,1, Just as the nay sayers said,"This movie sucked big time. I agree with all of those who complained about the abusive and unrealistic cursing, specially when coming from the cops. It makes no sense that educated people whose job it is to run investigations would keep talking like that all the time. But even if you choose to suspend disbelief on that matter, there are just too many inconsistencies to be able to let yourself taken in for the ride. Other viewers have described them very well, so I thank them for saving me the time. I also felt a great disappointment since I used to think that Martin Scorsese was a great director. Well no more I guess. Just another big commercial production which just doesn't fly...

48,18 April 2010,Geeky Randy,3," Should be called ""The Retarded""","American remake of the successful ""Internal Affairs"" trilogy, about two men seeking out each other's identity; one is a cop that goes undercover as a mobster, the other, a mobster that goes undercover as a cop. Dream-boats Damon and DiCaprio do a good job vanishing into their roles as tough guys, but their charm and ruthlessness still can't mask the crime-thriller clichés; and the ultra-climatic conclusion is just really nothing more than simply over-the-top. The wittiness of Jack Nicholson doesn't impress since he doesn't seem to do much acting, but rather just charismatically act like Jack. The quirky dialogue of Irish-American mobsters comes off as corny and tiring. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg are memorable and well-delivered in the humorous good-cop-bad-cop odd-couple, with the latter earning a Best Supporting Actor nomination. It was the only nomination that was well-deserve, the only nomination that didn't win and the only nomination that should have won. Won Best Picture, Editing and Adapted Screenplay.

I was quite mesmerized up to the point where Costigan discovers the truth about Sullivan. In spite of Scorsese's compulsion/obsession with every filthy aspect of human nature, I was very much enjoying the performances and the story. Then, it seems he or the screenwriter had a brainfart. In light of that fact, all of the excess of the film caused it to implode. In the ensuing vacuum, I could find no redeeming quality of the film at all. What does the story tell us?

63,29 April 2007,gelman@attglobal.net,4," Vastly Overrated. Worst ""Good Film"" of 2006 POSSIBLE SPOILERS","Maratin Scorsese has been a fixture in Hollywood for decades and members of the Motion Picture Academy must have felt that they ""owed"" him this Oscar for being Martin Scorsese, certainly not for this film which has more phony elements in it than any movie in recent memory. True it has 3-1/2 high profile stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Plus it has more violence than can be found anywhere outside a war zone and enough blood to fill your average blood bank. Scorsese has plowed this field before -- in ""Goodfellas,"" a vastly superior movie. Why didn't I like it? Because the plot is stuffed with unbelievable elements including a three way romance between Damon as a cop, DiCaprio as an undercover agent posing as a criminal and a police psychiatrist who is treating them both ???). As for Jack Nicholson, he is reprising previous roles as the Devil, this time in the person of a crime boss who is also -- get this -- an informant for the FBI. Damon is Nicholson's ""mole"" inside the police department and DiCaprio is the police department's mole inside Nicholson's organization. The question is who's going to find whom first and, eventually, after many (bloody) twists and turns, who gives a damn anyway? Scorsese has made more bad films than good ones but what the hell -- it's time to give him his Oscar. As for the principals, DiCaprio presents himself as a cool but tortured soul living a dangerous lie, Damon is Damon once again, and Nicholson is out there in front of the camera chewing the scenery as he is increasingly wont to do. Wahlberg does quite a decent job in a completely over-the-top role as an overseer in the under cover section of the police department. Martin Sheen distinguishes himself in this movie (as DiCaprio's ultimate boss) primarily because his character is almost believable and he's low key where everyone else is hamming it up big time. This movie is expensive trash and its success proves once again that you can't underestimate the taste of the American people (or of the Motion Picture Academy).",

Wahlburg's performance, though excellent, is really little more than a cameo, and he has actually done better work (e.g. his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm).

83,6 December 2006,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Superbly intricate and inhumane,"Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power. The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words. The action of the film is then not that important since it is nothing but rotten cops and rotten gangsters that are trying to infiltrate their respective sides incognito of even the people on their own sides. We are the only people to know who is a mole and who is not, and yet, even so, Scorcese manages to bring a final mole out of the woodwork in the last two minutes of the film. And is the police mole infiltrated among the gangsters really better than the others ? Maybe yes, but it is so tenuous and brittle an impression that we could doubt it. The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations. Nicholson is not abandoning himself to his traditional ticks and habits. Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful. Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard. And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face. Apart from that it is quite obvious that Scorcese must have found some tremendous enjoyment in directing three men in that dramatic and tragic situation. No film is wasted on any sentimentalese mash. It is all raw granite and solid quartz.",
84,3 November 2007,moonspinner55,6," ""Honesty is not synonymous with truth...""","Cocky Boston police detective with the Special Investigations Unit--who, as a young man, was mentored by a drug kingpin, an overgrown thug who is still making everyone shake in the old neighborhood--is still in-cahoots with this mob boss and attempts to ferret out the police cadet whose job it was to infiltrate the bad guys' circle and get hired on. In turn, the cadet--who is frustrated by his lack of identity--must find the spy on the police force who is playing both sides. Big Oscar winner from director Martin Scorsese is an Americanization of Hong Kong's ""Mou gaan dou"" from 2002. It is also very typical of this particular filmmaker: flashy, fast-moving, repugnant and yet reveling in its nastiness--to the point where one nearly feels the rampant ugliness and constant homophobia gets the director's seal of approval. As the undercover cop, Leonardo DiCaprio does some of his finest work yet; although he can't do much with the man-woman stuff involving a perplexing Public Service psychiatrist, DiCaprio is convincingly rough in a very difficult role to pull off. As the bad detective, Matt Damon is also first-rate, bravely playing a real pr*ck while giving the picture a smug swagger that suits the narrative well (I would have preferred more about this character's loss of morals however, which happens entirely off-camera). As the drug-lord, Jack Nicholson performs without vanity and slithers through the movie like a smiling cobra; his unpredictability as an actor is tailor-made for this role, and Scorsese is careful not to overload the screen with Jack (we get just enough of him, although one sequence in a porno theater goes over-the-top).

97,15 October 2006,eugeneluah,2, Abject failure of a remake of Infernal Affairs (SPOILERS),"Caught The Departed last night and I have to say, its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).",

The acting in this is amazing and every actor did their job. I think this is Leonardo's best performance. He did it so well and it was actually like he was the character and not actually performing. The music is awesome. Especially Shipping Up to Boston which is done by one of my all-time favourite bands @dropkickmurphys. The song was the perfect choice for the film and they played it at just the right times. The plot is ingenious and Scorsese directed it superbly. This film even managed to be better than Infernal Affairs, which is what this film was based upon. I love the opening scene with Jack Nicholson's monologue and it really set the film for what was to come. The film also had it funny moments (thanks to Mark Walberg). This film is extremely entertaining and I love the characters. There is nothing to complain about in this film and I could and probably will watch this over and over again. One of the best this century. I was actually sad when this film was finishing because I didn't want it to end. Acting: 10/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Entertainment Value: 10/10",

The guys who do the ""infiltration"" are Matt Damon, doing the bad guy on the good side, and Leonardo DiCaprio vice versa. The story develops slowly and you have to pay close attention to all the minor details because so much is given that you might lose some info. The bad guy of the story (Jack Nocholson )doesn't appear to be all that mean and bad. In fact, you don't feel much for any of the characters, except maybe for DiCaprio's. This aside, the movie moves at a fair pace, although the beginning is a bit slow. By the time the movie's over you hardly notice what's going on. This is a finely crafted movie, big budget and stuff and a fine Martin Scorsece film, but, in my humble opinion, don't think it deserved a best movie award. I think most of you out there will agree with me that Scorsece has done way better in the past: TAXI DRIVER, CASINO, GOOD FELLAS, RAGING BULL, etc. I think the Academy felt so wrong and sorry for not awarding ANY of his past movies that they just had to give him an award this time around.

111,9 October 2006,zetes,8," Average Scorsese - which means it's still a fine film, just not one of his best","Scorsese's long-awaited remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs was a good film, but it always seemed to me like a gimmick, and more like a skeleton of a film than a real film. Scorsese predictably fleshes it out so it doesn't seem as much like just a good concept. The actors add a lot to it, too (though the Hong Kong actors, including Andy Lau and Tony Leung, were very good, as well). I don't think it stands anywhere near Scorsese's best work myself. It doesn't carry near the weight of Goodfellas, for instance. It starts to get a little silly near the end, and the director makes a few really bad choices  especially including that awful image in the final shot. That's just plain embarrassing film-making. And that's not to mention the awful choice the filmmakers made to change a certain part of the ending of Infernal Affairs - the original is definitely stronger in that respect. Of the actors, my favorite was Mark Wahlberg. Matt Damon comes in second, and DiCaprio third. Nicholson has a lot of fun as the gangster. The best comparison with previous Jack performances is actually the Joker from Burton's first Batman movie. Alec Baldwin has probably the most memorable moment, where he expresses his love for the Patriot Act. Well worth seeing, but definitely not best-of-the-year material. I would rank it quite below Scorsese's previous two films from this decade, The Aviator and Gangs of New York.",

The dialog was forced and without life. The story was predictable. The direction was static. And the writing, well, let's just say I've read crossword puzzles that were more interesting. The only reason I can see why this movie was ever made, is that Jack, Leo, Matt, Alec, and Mark said they would do it.

Perhaps Mr. Scorsese can rationalize his admirable work on film restoration and figure he's doing his part for the greater good, but I'm not buying it. In fact, I no longer will see a film simply because Martin Scorsese is the director. I wish he and Mick Jagger would take their champagne and yes-men to France, and leave the film and music-making to more eager and less corporate fellows. Also, as much as I respect Roger Ebert's analysis and writings, I can not take seriously his review of a Scorsese film.

When Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to beat Matt Damon on the top of the building was lame. With the Infernal Affairs was awesome. Tony Leung(Leonardo) pointed his gun at Andy(Matt) and said, ""Sorry, I'm a police officer."" Later Andy killed Tony in the elevator that was great action. Unlike The Departed was really retarded. For the Infernal Affairs it's a 10/10! There is one thing that was good about The Departed was that there was Leonardo DiCaprio. He acted extremely well. Matt Damon doesn't know how to act.

If it wasn't for the sheer perfection of Goodfellas, I think this would be his best film. The performances, the script and of course the direction are perfection personified.

Goodfellows is still the definitive Mob movie ( The Godfather being the definitive Mafia film ) and there is no movie ever made that rivals the visual style that Raging Bull brought to the screen. To me The Departed is a movie about corruption. I never felt any sense of organized crime ,it was more like organized chaos. Characters are never developed or made memorable , thats all sacrificed to make more room for showing how intense the movie is suppose to be. Maybe because 2006 was such a lackluster year this will get more praise than its due. I enjoyed it for what it offered and will leave it at that.

151,3 April 2007,andrej-zupanic,1, A pale remake of an Asian classic,"The Departed, the winner of the academy award for best motion picture, is just another remake based on a Chinese original. Critics called it one of the best movies of the year 2006, but in my opinion it is a disgrace to the Chinese original, called The Infernal Affairs. And it is also Scorsese's worst film ever. Even Gangs of New York were more original than this film. Let me explain why I didn't like this film.",
152,8 October 2006,refresh_daemon,8," Good, but it lack the resonance of Scorsese's more notable works.","I watched The Departed the day after it's general release. While watching, I tried to set aside thoughts of the move it's a remake of, Infernal Affairs, aside to be able to assess the movie clearly. Now, I haven't seen Infernal Affairs in a while, so this wasn't too hard to do, however, since I was privy to plot foreknowledge, nothing was all too surprising.",
153,12 April 2007,odie_ven,1, Too slow and boring,"Seriously, what's the big fuss about this movie? Too long, too pointless, too slow. After an hour and a half I just couldn't keep watching it. I like suspense movies. This isn't one. Is it supposed to be about the characters? The info about them was so eschew that I didn't know them very well after 90 minutes. What was supposed to be great about it?",

155,14 September 2019,JoshuaMHetu,10, A Knockout,"""The Departed"" is arguably the greatest cop movie ever made, and certainly one of the best movies of the 2000s - period. What Scorsese did with this movie was masterful: he took a perfectly good crime thriller (the original ""Infernal Affairs"") and elevated it even higher to become a saga of class, race, betrayal, and ""families always rising and falling in America."" ""The Departed"" is one of the most hard-edged, dramatic, and gripping movies that I've ever seen, with a multi-layered story that keeps you coming back to the film again and again. I love the central premise, which takes classic Scorsese tropes like Catholic guilt and ethnic identity and fuses them with true crime history - Frank Costello, after all, is based on Boston's infamous Whitey Bulger.",
156,6 December 2007,takseng,5," Scorsese got his Oscar out of sentiment, not for this embarrassment","Very, very, very disappointing given the all-star cast. I love much of Nicholson's work, but in this he's not very believable as a crime boss. Nicholson can certainly do the man in charge, but not in this. Leonardo is fairly believable, although he seems to be working hard on looking sullen. Damon is okay, nothing special. Sheen is fairly good but Wahlberg is awful. Sheen has to pretend there's not a bad smell in the room when he's with Wahlberg. We are to believe that his Dignan is expressing real emotion, this is a real tough guy? This story relies on so many twists to carry itself, but the weakness of the characters and to some degree, the plot, is surprising. I didn't hate it, I just hated not seeing the performances I expect from these actors. It was okay as late night entertainment, but this thing won Oscars?",
157,9 October 2006,WriterDave,10, The Renaissance,"Martin Scorsese has reached a point in his career where he has free reign to do whatever he wishes as a director. It's hallowed ground for an auteur, and as such, every actor worth his salt would kill to work for him knowing full well that whatever Scorsese chooses to do will be an uncompromising work of art. With ""The Departed"" he has quite possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The deliciously convoluted plot based on the recent Asian flick ""Infernal Affairs"" showcases Jack Nicholson as an Irish mob boss; Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring; Matt Damon as the crime ring's inside man with the police unit assigned to bring them down; Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg as the cops working above Damon and DiCaprio; and a breakthrough role for Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist in a love triangle with Damon and DiCaprio. This brief but confusing rundown is merely the tip of the iceberg and reveals nothing of the plot twists and tension riddling every aspect of the film like bullet holes from a machine gun massacre. ",
158,10 January 2016,kjarvis1212,10, As Good As It Gets,"Martin Scorsese, perhaps the greatest American film director of all- time, delivers in a major way with The Departed. The movie represents a return to the material that made him a superstar in the first place. And the result is one of the best American crime dramas ever made. Aided by a brilliant script (William Monahan), and an outstanding ensemble cast, Scorsese is in top form here. It should be noted that The Departed is technically a remake of the Chinese action hit, Infernal Affairs, unseen by me. It also uses the true story of infamous Boston mobster Whitey Bulger as a template for the Jack Nicholson character. But I think it would do the film and the viewer a disservice to think of it as a Bulger picture. It is not. It is its own story with its own characters that stands on its own. The film opens with a young Matt Damon in a local diner, listening to Nicholson's notorious local gangster spouting off in his own poetically vulgar way about how cops and crooks aren't so different. Instant flash forward to the future, and Damon's character is being sworn in as a Massachusetts state police officer. Meanwhile, so is another character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. We learn that Leo's character comes from a family with an unsavory, non-law-abiding past. He's confronted by his superior, Martin Sheen, and his sidekick, Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg might be the single most enjoyable aspect of the film, which is saying a lot. He steals nearly every scene he's in as a foul-mouthed, results-driven hothead. They present Leo's character with an ultimatum: quit the force, or join their undercover operation as a mole in Jack's gang. It's a risky proposition, but one they all know is feasible, including Leo. On paper, he'll quit the force and get back into crime, including an assault conviction and a short jail sentence. Then work his way into the Nicholson character's world. At the same time, Damon's character has been handpicked to run a top secret task force out to snag Jack once and for all. But it appears he's still in Jack's debt. One cop who's really a gangster pretending to be a cop, and another who's really a cop pretending to be a gangster. What unfolds is an epic, wholly believable and ultimately satisfying tale about just how thin the line between good and bad can be. It's difficult to overstate the quality of the acting performances in this film. DiCaprio is incredible as a vulnerable savant looking for some sort of salvation, spending his spare time sitting next to a hospital bed occupied by his dying mother. Damon delivers a strong performance as the wormy overachiever who says all the right things and shacks up with the department's psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga in a very effective performance). Alec Baldwin has some great lines in a small but solid role as one of the squad commanders. Sheen is perfect as the wise and cautious bureau chief (or something like that). When Scorsese has material like this, as in Goodfellas or Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Mean Streets, its as if he's transported to another time and place that allows him to tell the story with an impeccable sense for placement, color, angle, emphasis, and tone. It's like watching Michael Jordan or Jimi Hendrix. It's a special thing when an artist has such control over their craft. If you're the sort of person who likes a well-written, impeccably acted crime drama, and for some inexplicable reason have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and see it.",

Yes, Di Caprio is great for the first time (he was good in some movies before, but here he is just superb).

161,15 February 2009,lndkramer,3, Don't understand the hype,"I know everybody is crazy about this movie. But just because everybody switches sides on each other doesn't make this a deep movie.

I didn't know what anybody was supposed to be by the end of the movie either. Way too confusing. To me this movie was boring, complicated, and nothing amazing. Definitely doesn't live up to all the hype it gets. One thing I did like was Nicholson as a mob boss. I thought it was a cool role for him. Otherwise, I just didn't get this movie.

The truth is that a person who has to curse to try and prove himself lacks the character and integrity to be a ""real"" man. Don't try and say that the characters in the movie are talking like cops in the real world do. I am a police officer and have been for over 35 years and have never heard anyone use the f word like it was used in this movie.

The female actress was added I'm sure just to give us a break from all the testosterone flowing from foul mouth males and she was rather weak and pointless. One scene that really sickened me was Jack in the restaurant scene with his hands and shirt covered in blood...what was he doing? Breaking in a new crew or butchering a pig ? My husband thought the movie too long and and I sometimes felt that the director was just off camera saying...""lights, camera ,action"", especially the scene on the roof top near the end of the picture with Dicaprio and Damon.It looked too staged as if Dicaprio was looking for direction. The blood bath on the elevator was horrible mainly because some of the audience (20 in total) started to laugh and because a second mole was introduced and quickly dispensed. What??? But the last frame(with the you know what)was laughable So did we like it?

178,6 March 2007,nycritic,10, Scorsese at the Top of His Game,"He's one of the few directors who have at least one movie within the top of the critics' lists during the Seventies, Eighties, Nineties, and now this decade. That's consistency in the quality of work, especially in an industry where directors come and go with one big hit, where they suddenly have slumps -- some lasting years and years --, and others make sporadic movies here and there. Martin Scorsese is also one of the few directors to tackle a theme that by now would have run its course: the Mafia movie because there can be only so much you can do with this type of film; however, Scorsese proves that there's still a lot of material that can be molded into compelling, edge-of-your-seat tales like the one he weaves here. Certainly not a ""B"" picture as he called it, yet it has all the elements of a B-picture: the seedy criminals, the sordid locations, the femme fatale, the overall feeling of despair and doom. It certainly is high noir, especially in the fact that all of the characters, to a degree, are under the shadow of this ultimate evil man, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and pretty much there is no escape, especially when Costello's deep ties that corrupt law enforcement come to light. The world of the men in THE DEPARTED is one where everyone is suspect and everyone is at danger of being ""next"". Even golden-boy Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a pawn of Costello since he was a child, can't escape this fact. Moving upwards, propelled by his good looks and extreme good luck, he's the ultimate patsy who is set from the get-go even as he tries darned hard to elude all evidence that links him to Costello and invisible man William Costigan (a hardened-looking Leonardo DiCaprio).",

Frankly, I thought the same thing after first viewing it. After several watched, I know what was going on and who was who. The dialogue is sharply written and the performances are outlandishly entertaining. Everything about this movie is great and frankly, I don't find any flaws in it. People might think I'm being too generous and that I'm blinded by my love for Scorsese. No, I just know a damn good movie when I see one. This is a gangster drama that hits all the right notes and has a great soundtrack to go along with it. I also love how much they swear in the movie. It's hilarious and its used well too. A lot of times, swearing is abused and overused in movies. Now, I have heard people cuss this movie out for how much swearing there is but realize that people talk like this. Maybe not all the time, but they do. The cast is beyond superb and all of them do a great job. I love this movie, and hopefully someone who reads this, then watches it will uh, love it too.

And I'll go a step further to say that I REALLY, REALLY LIKE it! It is an excellent story, played brilliantly by all involved, and told by one of the greatest directors in all of film history: Martin Scorcese. Scorcese FINALLY won Best Director and a film of his won Best Picture for this modern masterpiece. Of course it's not TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL, or even GOODFELLAS, but so what? It's better than 95% of the other stuff thrown at us the last few years! THE DEPARTED stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon as Bostonians Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan, respectively, both from opposite sides of the track. Costigan's father's side of the family has criminal ties, but he was actually raised apart from that w/ his mother's more uppercrust upstanding side of the family. Sullivan was a poor boy raised in the streets. That's how both characters came to be what they were as grown men: Billy was brought up away from crime and Colin was exposed directly to it. As a boy Colin unwittingly became involved with local crime boss Frank Costello (played by the great Jack Nicholson in typical scene-stealing fashion). Costigan and Sullivan both joined the police academy, with Costigan volunteering to go under deep cover to help take down Costello's organization, while Sullivan worked as Costello's inside man/mole to notify him when the cops were closing in on him.",

Wahlberg and Nicholson are also both stand outs, and I hope both get nominations. Damon and Farmiga are both also amazing. The rest of the cast are very good, but don't stand out in the amazing cast. The script is also great. The dialogue is brilliant and they manage to give each and every character enough development to work well. I also hope Shore is nominated for his brilliant score.

191,29 October 2006,animalmother05,4, I beg your pardon?,"I am shocked at the number of reviews that exist that praise this film to no end, and that call it Scorsese's best film since ""Goodfellas."" ""The Departed"" is far from a bad film; it is, in fact, a decent one, but it is still very disappointing, and the only part of ""Goodfellas"" it resembles at all is that film's last segment, starting at 6:55 AM on May 11 of 1980, after which it loses track of everything that made it one of Scorsese's best film. The film consists primarily of extremely short takes sloppily edited together which are theoretically meant to jar the spectators, but in fact only prohibit the narrative from moving effectively. There is nothing theoretically wrong with short takes; Sergei Eisenstein made very powerful films with shorter Average Shot Lengths than ""The Departed"" ever dreamed of having, but his films were conceived as juxtapositions of shots, whereas in ""The Departed,"" as in most modern films that use this technique, the shots only interrupt each other. Eisenstein's films were great, and revolutionary, because he used editing to create sequences of shots to develop his ideas; Scorsese's greatest films tend to have longer average shot lengths because he expresses his ideas in a single shot rather than a sequence of them. In ""The Departed"" he has not decided to express himself with sequences of shots rather than single shots, he has merely made the shots shorter and thus hindered the expression of his ideas in the film.",

Jack Nicholson plays a powerful crime lord spotlighted by F.B.I. Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover cop undergoing a dangerous mission to expose the target. Matt Damon is rising in position in law enforcement and exposing information to Nicholson thus leading to both young cops in a fatal position. Martin Scorsese displays the dark side of the law. Nicholson is excellent as expected chewing scenery with sly dialogue under disgusting circumstances. His power will gradually slip until it is turned against him. DiCaprio showcases the frustration placed in a situation of limited exit. He is aware that someone within the department is leaking information but it becomes a dying battle for victory. Damon in similar circumstances must cover his tracks but eventually his sin will find him out in the most fatal surprising ways. Mark Wahlberg steals scenes as a cynical Sergeant who undergoes ill treatment before using questionable methods to bring justice. To complete this flawless casting we have Martin Sheen as the police captain who recruits DiCaprio. Technically compelling view of undercover law enforcement that no one will wish to depart to.

That is certainly not lacking here. The Korean original is much shorter, more efficient and intensive, while Scorsese has made his version as long and tedious as possible. There is very little action the first two hours, and mainly only talk and paranoid intrigue. But the worst thing is the language. The word ""f..k"" occurs in almost every sentence and at least in every scene. This extremely base and vulgar language with very little vocabulary and mainly used aggressively in constant outbreaks of anger and violence ruins the film and makes it deplorably void of style. Of what use then is the brilliant technique, the excellent actors and the splendid direction, if the film is just 2,5 hours of brutal criminality, atrocious violence, constant massacres and only foul language? Sorry, Scorsese has made a few great and interesting films, like ""Bringing Out the Dead"" and ""Shutter Island"", but this is not one of them.",

Thus having Damon playing in it is interesting as he deepens his local ties from Will Hunting and in a way, his meeting with DiCaprio is the new generation confrontation of Pacino / De Niro. However, the pleasure doesn't go farther as this movie is just totally unbelievable: the new thug becomes close to the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the police rat, the policeman grows up with the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the criminal rat. With that, the movie just take fun to tell the most bad words and to show the most blood... All the characters are pathetic, badly played by the ordinary big names who does their same show over and over (Baldwin, Wahlberg, Nicholson who has absolutely no charisma as the boss!). The scenes with the shrink are totally useless and just add minutes to get a long movie!

This isn't just Infernal Affairs in America, this is Infernal Affairs in Boston. The script by William Monahan, a Boston native, ends up so intimately tied to the reality of the city, its different cultures, locations, and even history that it gives the movie such a wonderfully distinctive flavor that sets it apart from the original.

He must have sat down watched Goodfellas and thought 'hmmm. What did I used to do that made me great? I'll just copy that.' It's Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it. The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction. DeCaprio and Damon aren't great but neither are they bad, they just suffice. The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg, who finally ditches the breathless, confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself. Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age. Normally I'd say the same for Jack who's performance in 'As Good As It Gets', was groundbreaking but this time he's just playing The Joker in Batman he's too over the top for such a seriously acted movie. He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility. The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start. Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren't there; The violence was comic book (especially the number of head shots at the end), the film-making is sub-standard. Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy.",

I still haven't figured out why this character is even included in this story. As for the other performances, Nicholson seems a bit out of place in this one and Martin Sheen is a little too low-key. I must agree with other reviewers that state that this movie contains way too much information, plot twists, and should have been a lot shorter.

Leonardo Di Caprio was pretty good in his role though I must admit that i was more 'attached' to Tony Leung. Overall, I find that The departed is just a remake of Infernal Affair: it didn't really add up much. SPOILER: i really hate the The Departed ending. Why did they end it like that?

The plot revolves around two moles, one who infiltrates South Boston's well known criminal organization and the other who infiltrates the police investigating the organization. Once it becomes known by both sides that these moles exist the cat and mouse fight for survival between the two begins. For years Scorsese worked with DeNiro which earned him a Best Actor Award for ""Raging Bull"". However Scorsese has been continuously snubbed for a Best Director and Best Picture Award which he has deserved many times over. Recently he has taken DeCaprio, an excellent artist, under his wing and finally the favor was returned. At last Scorsese has been rewarded for bringing out the best performances from his actors. This film does an outstanding job examining the mobster lifestyle, authority, politics and corruption. This film has masterful acting, directing, cinematography, editing and screenplay. It is one of the finest in it's genre and a bravura film by Scorsese. Bravo Academy! You finally got it right.",

I think i will need to watch it a couple more times before making such an important decision, but after seeing it once, one thing is for sure, The Departed is a masterpiece. Everything put together by Marty in his own perfect stylistic fashion. The violence is perfect, the cursing is perfect, the actors absolutely committed. Nicholson, Wahlberg, and Dicaprio check in for 3 of their best performances of their careers (and thats saying a lot for nicholson whose had an amazing career). Matt Damon was also good here, a bit subtle and overshadowed by his peers, but nonetheless always convincing. Vera Farmiga was charming and very good in the female lead. Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen were perfect in their selective small roles as well. Marty did a great job with this one. I liked Howard Shore's score a lot and Michael Ballhaus's cinematography was amazing, absolutely Oscar worthy. IMDb Rating: 8.4. My rating: 10/10",
220,21 December 2015,Screen_Blitz,10, Martin Scorcese's The Departed is a modern gangster drama masterpiece,"No director has boasted a stricter understanding of the gangster genre than Martin Scorcese, at least not yet. His filmography dating back to 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' greatly prove this. We have seen a devilishly gritty portrayal of Henry Hill in the former movie, we have seen the portrayal of a crime family caught in the hazardous world of illegal gambling in the latter. If there is any director who's shown competition against Scorcese in breathing grit into the image of mobster families, it is Francis Ford Coppola with his uncompromising cinematic classic 'The Godfather'. This violent, gritty crime- thriller sees Scorcese continues his trademark cinematic ambition with showcasing an authentic take on the life of mobsters in the complicated world of crime. What many filmgoers may not to know is that this modern gangster piece happens to be a remake of a Chinese film 'Internal Affairs', following roughly the same plot and story structure. Set in the crime-ridden city of Southern Boston, Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a brash undercover cop and former convict of the Boston Police Department, who is assigned by Captain Queenan (played by Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Digman (played by Mark Wahlberg) to infiltrate an Irish mob gang run by Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson). With FBI informant Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) set as Costello's mole and trusts of long-time friends and business partners put to the test, Costigan gets involved in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse as the two fight to uncover each other's identities.

The Massachusetts State Police Department has set up the Special Investigations Unit to collect evidence and put Costello and his men in jail. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has just graduated from the state police academy, and has been assigned to infiltrate Costello's gang by the unit chief. Billy joins the mob and begins to earn Costello's trust. Years earlier, Costello was able to get one of his men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), to infiltrate the state police. Colin is assigned to the Special Investigations Unit, the same unit that is trying to take Costello down. The only problem for the police is that Colin keeps Costello informed as to what the police are about to do. Eventually, the police and the mob discover that a mole has infiltrated their ranks. Each man is living a double life where one misstep will mean life or death if he is caught.",

It's a very good film, i assure you, but it in no way compares to the genius of his very best films.

The first half of the movie is really there to build tension, which it does very well and it doesn't disappoint as the end of the movie is insanity, so much happens and your mind explodes with everything that just occurred. The acting didn't stand out to me, even with a extremely famous cast, it wasn't bad though.

Now this movie... America, what's happening? Listen, I'm Romanian and I keep blasting from the mike in a radio station where I work that Romanian movies suck because most of them lack morals and happy endings. The result is - people are despondent and try to get the heck out of Romania (even though we're all A LOT better off than when the dictator Ceaushescu lived). Movies and art in general should give people hope and a moral answer to the problems of life. Don't be deceived: the human intellect is becoming what it's feeding upon. You cannot watch something dirty and remain untainted, clean and pure! It seems to me that mindless, irresponsible individuals literally sell their souls to the devil in order to spread the moral decay and stupid pride that has been the fall of ALL the empires of the world. Which brings me to the title I gave these lines. America is filling her cup. God is looking at his watch. One day He'll say: ""Well, nothing good is ever going to come out of this one."" And the credits will roll as in a movie. I admire the great achievements of the American people, but you guys should get up and say: ""We are a Christian people. Here: It's written on the dollar bill. Let's show Mr. Scorsese that he has got to earn these bills by cleaning up the foul language, the blood and the repulsive subjects he drools over!"" Guys, I love America, but it's painful to see that her people are getting away from God as time goes by. Here in Romania they want the Orthodox Church be the first and last of our beliefs. Yeah, yeah, we have rights... but they put icons in schools and they want Protestants such as myself to feel it's OK... well, it's not OK! No religion in schools! Why don't they kick Darwin with his theory of evolution from schools, since they are so Christianly-oriented? I mean we were created after God's own image, right? Or... we evolved? This ought to be a dilemma... If God let us EVOLVE into His own image, why doesn't the Bible state this? Anyway, if we get back to our horror of a movie, it seems Hollywood thinks happy endings are obsolete. ""We must give the people's minds something new to feed upon. WHAT IF I just die? What if the order of things is: YOU CAN'T WIN?"" Sounds familiar? What keeps the people from killing themselves... ""but that the dread of something after death..."" as the Scorsese of the late 16th and early 17th century put it?",

243,16 October 2006,barberoux,8, Good Movie,"""The Departed"" was good but not excellent. Jack Nicholson hammed it up through most of the movie. If he had less screen time I would have thought he made the movie but there was too much of him being too much. Matt Damon portrayed the nasty little sh!t I always thought was in him. He was great. Leonardo DiCaprio was also very good portraying the mental stress I would think a mob mole would have. Mark Wahlberg could have been a bit over the top but I think his character's personality evolved from working with big ego macho cops and, for me, he was very believable. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone were good in their supporting roles. Vera Farmiga was OK. I guess I didn't believe her as a therapist. I think she need a bit more meat, emotionally, and as the girlfriend, physically. I didn't see the original, ""Infernal Affairs"" so I can't compare the two. This version's story, especially towards the end, seemed rushed and forced to finish with the big gun battle but the mechanics of the movie's cop story was secondary to the story of the two moles. If the movie is examined for the story of the cops trying to get Jack Nicholson it comes up short but the mole parallel story was intriguing and Matt and Leo were great. It was a violent movie and the ending was a bit much. Well worth seeing but not Scorsese's best. His best are icons, ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"". ""The Departed"" was just a good movie",

Who, What, Where, When, Why? There is too much talking, too much unnecessary scenarios, too much confusion on the characters - the film dived straight into the characters and not revealing why Damon becomes a cop! Things just happen in this film. There is no sense of compassion towards DiCaprio unlike Tony Leungs portrayal. I really respect Andy Lau, he was very polite to rate this boring 2hr+ film 8 out of 10.. The only thing he did comment on was the character psychology..

I would have thought the girlfriend would have been killed (and I'm convinced the baby was Will's) because she knew the secret.

Jack Nicholson is as great as ever playing the Irish boss that is infiltrating the Police Department. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as an undercover cop so underground that only Martin Sheen's character Queenan and Mark Wahlberg's Sergeant Dignam know about his secret operations. Vera Farmiga plays his police psychologist, Madolyn. DiCaprio and Farmiga's chemistry is undeniably electric and roots the movie with hope.

Also who is the protagonist? Whom are we supposed to identify with? Logically, it should be Billy (Leonardo Di Caprio) who is the honest cop undercover in the mob. But since we often follow Colin whose character has been given Matt Damon’s pretty mug, it’s not that clear. The double romance is not milked at all. It’s just shown in parallel. And on top of that too many characters play a double game. Even the bad guy (Jack Nicholson) is an informer for the FBI. One of the thugs doesn’t turn Billy in although he has understood who he is.

Jack Nicholson had a girlfriend that served no purpose, heck, for that matter the love interest of Damon and DeCaprio didn't really serve a purpose either. DeCaprio's love scene served no purpose. There was symbolism with a church at the beginning and end that really wasn't tied into the movie as a whole, and Nicholson's character starts to go mad and we don't really know why, or it isn't show in a fluid manner. I know this movie is a remake - I've never seen the original so that doesn't matter to me.

The first third of the film is excellent, despite the constant sound of the Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter every five minutes, but then it goes downhill fast. The basic premise of a cop infiltrating the Irish mob and a mobster infiltrating the cops is good, but soon so many other things are thrown into the plot it becomes a farce. Why make Costello am FBI informer? Pointless, other than maybe to give Matt Damon a reason to kill him, although it would have been a thousand times more interesting if Damon's reason was Nicholson's dismissive treatment of him since a teenager. Why did Matt Damon's character have so much power to do as he liked in the force after only joining a few months back, able even to call a surveillance of Sheen police chief? Stupid. How come Damon didn't figure out immediately that Dicaprio's character used his phone at the meet with the Chinese? He knew the whole of Nicholson's crew apart from Costigan, but Scorsese just needed to drag the film out for another hour. Why was Baldwin's character camping it up like a pantomime dame all over the screen? The acting from Baldwin was so bad it made me think he was play acting for Damon's character and actually new he was a mole, but he didn't, Baldwin just can't act. The mess of shootings at the ending wasn't a twist either it was very dull 'ho hum' and 'so what' and i had lost interest half an hour earlier when Nicholson exited the film. After the first hour this film is silly, contrived and with no clever plot twists at all but just pointless adding of layer on layer of meaningless guff.

285,6 October 2006,Quinoa1984,10," ""...Do you lie?""","The Departed is the most entertaining kind of non-stop, intense crime thriller of the year, maybe in the past few years. Some critics have said that it's the best film that director Martin Scorsese has made since Goodfellas. I understand where the compliment comes from, though I slightly resent the subtle criticism in the charge as well, meaning that Scorsese hasn't made a film as great or powerful or entertaining in over fifteen years. I would even go far as saying this is Scorsese's best since, well, Scorsese's last film, or at least since Gangs of New York. Some may forget, or maybe just not really take in, how consistently strong Scorsese's career has been overall, how he keeps on taking chances and still keeping his style so instictually 'cinematic' (he is possibly the biggest ""film-geek"" ever), so distinctive, and even so fresh in the 21st century, that his is a career akin to the likes of Kurosawa (many masterpieces, and otherwise very good to excellent efforts). The difference though this time from some of his previous outings- and this is perhaps the correlation with Goodfellas besides the obvious of genre linking- is that it's pure, devilish fun, it goes by quickly but supremely satisfyingly over what doesn't really feel like 2 1/2 hours, and it's cast is uniformly good.",

287,19 November 2007,Isaac5855,9," Scorcese's Long Overdue Oscar win is quite simply, a masterpiece","Martin Scorcese finally snagged a Best Director Oscar for THE DEPARTED and though there are some (myself included) who do not feel this was his best work, the film is more than worthy of the Director Oscar it finally nailed for Scorcese as well as the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year that it also received. This exquisitely mounted epic tale looks at the war between the police and the mob in South Boston, supposedly during the 70's and 80's, centering primarily on three characters. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio)is a young cop with a shady family legacy, who is sent deep undercover to get the goods on renowned Boston mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, a young man who grew up working for Costello,a la Ray Liotta's character in GOODFELLAS, but also becomes a police officer. A two-way cat and mouse game ensues as Costello tries to learn which member of his organization is a cop while the police try to figure out which one of their officers is a stooge to Costello. The race to learn which rat is where advances to the point where Sullivan is actually assigned to, in so many words, rat out himself. Scorcese offers one of the greatest examples I have seen in years of storytelling on screen with a meticulous and detailed screenplay that requires complete attention, not to mention multiple viewings to fully appreciated the multi-layered story presented here. Scorcese's direction is crisp and in-your-face, as always, and surprises are offered around every corner of the story told here. Every time you think you've figure it out, the story takes another detour and if you miss anything, you will be confused. DiCaprio offers the best performance of his career as the tortured Costigan and he might have won the Oscar if he had been nominated for this instead of BLOOD DIAMOND. Matt Damon's richly complex portrayal of Collin Sullivan hits the bullseye as does Nicholson's expectedly ruthless mafioso. Mark Wahlberg received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his razor sharp performance as DiCaprio and Damon's 2nd commanding officer who allows matters to get personal. Alec Baldwin, Martin, Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Anthony Anderson also register in strong supporting roles, but it is primarily the compelling story, masterful direction by Scorcese and the three electrifying lead performances that make this film an instant classic not to be missed.",

296,29 December 2015,arminazizian,10, Scorsese Classic,"This is as great of a movie as you can get. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most complete movies of the 2000s. The story-line is engaging, breathtaking, and genius. The cinematography is what you would expect from an Scorsese movie, and directing is top notch. It won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Writing, and Best Editing to back that claim. Then comes the cast of absolute all-stars. DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Baldwin. In today's movies, it seems like every time too many starts are placed in a movie, it backfires, but not in a Scorsese movie. DiCaprio delivered an Oscar-deserving performance, and was absolutely robbed by the Academy. Nicholson once again proved to everyone why he is one of the best actors of all time, as if anyone would disagree. Damon was great, although he struggled a bit to establish himself in accordance to his character's personality, however, he was able to pull it off one way or another and complete the story. Whalberg was as usual his own self, and somehow his personality translated perfectly to his character. Overall, it was a great all around effort by every actor in the movie, even those who didn't receive much screen time to prove that the casting was flawless. The story developed well, providing the essential back-story and taking the time to develop each character thoroughly. Although it seemed as if the ending was slightly rushed (even though this was a two and a half hour movie), the climax with all its plot twists unfolded as smoothly as the director intended. This is a must see movie for any fan of Crime/Drama/Thriller movies. It is also captures some of the best performances by all the main actors, whose fans can not go on without watching.",
297,18 February 2021,judemcrobbie,10, Just insanity.,"This is one of the most rewatchable films ever made. I must have watched this 4 or 5 times now and the dialogue never stagnated, the jokes still land and the ending still gets me going ""What did I just witness"".
On that topic, the ending is bonkers. If you haven't seen this, STOP NOW. The ending is just menta. It must take 27 twists and and other 27 turns in that amount of minutes.
The movie brings a new perception and depth to the notoriously cool undercover cop or spy persona, just look at James Bond. The delve this movie takes into Billy Costigan's (Leonardo DiCaprio) humanity and psyche, unveiling the struggles placed on a good man trying to act like a bad guy. Leonardo DiCaprio plays this role so well. He shows each cog whirring and wheel spinning in the demoralised and screwed mind he has at the time. Even from the early scenes he shows the anger in him, when being rinsed by Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) about his family history, that will eventually blossom to take hold of him completely.
The cast is the epitome of all star:
As aforementioned Leonardo DiCaprio is in this movie, playing his role to a t.
The great Jack Nicholson is also in this movie playing the gangsta boss Frank Costello. I mean it's Jack Nicholson, I don't even need to touch on it. But I will. Considering this is one of his last acting roles, you'd expect it not to be his best. But against all odds it really is. So much of the movie rests on the charm and charisma of his character and the subsequent charm and charisma of him. One of those 'No one else could have played this role except him' roles. Maybe not his greatest acting performances but it is amazing nonetheless. Kudos Jack and thank you for gracing us with your acting ability!
Matt Damon is also in this movie. He plays Colin Sullivan, the yin to Billy Costigan's (Leo) Yang. He plays the deceptive traitor so well, showing the times of emotional weakness he has from being brought up by a crook like Costello (Nicholson) and the times of hardship being unlike any of the other police officers in the building.
This is truly one of the most interesting screenplays ever. Watching these 2 characters, unbeknownst to each other, seriously define the others life. With incredible similarities and stark differences it makes for a gripping and enticing watch.
The writing in this movie is brilliant. It brings a sense of reality whilst also keeping that spark of screenplay. Just genius; it makes you laugh when it wants you to laugh, makes you cringe when it wants you to cringe, and gasp when... you get the point.
The cinematography is a piece of art needing to be marvelled at all through the movie, using all of the shots in the book. And those swinging shots around a character could set the tone and narrative by themselves, getting the sense that the world is revolving around them for that split second
My personal favourite of Scorsese's vast movie collection.

Because that is what Scorcese's film is-it is naked, devoid of any rhyme or reason, of any reason why things happen, of any values. To me it is just the ranting of an older man, it is Scorcese fantasizing about violence, sex, corruption ; it is Scorsese thinking ""wow it is so clever to show all this blood and to have my actors swear all the time, yeah this is art"" . Well, I am sorry, but this isn't art. This is about Scorsese repeating himself and indulging in his obsessions and us congratulating him.

This movie is another example that this director, who made milestones of Hollywood history once, totally lost his style and constantly tries to follow tired trends. That he's successful with it, tells more about his audience then the quality of his recent movies. A good example for this is the nerve-wrecking soundtrack of this mediocre remake, which dive-bombs the viewer with one blaring rock song after another. Who does Scorcese thinks he is? Quentin Tarantino? It would be excusable for a beginner to over-spice his first movie with his favorite mix-tape. I like music and i like movies.

The actors are uniformly good, including the minor characters. Ultimately, I could really see no point to the movie. It is much too long, padded by scenes which are unnecessary to the story-line and are just distracting. I was attracted to the plot. A cop undercover in the mob is old news and a cop who is on the take is also, but both in the same story is good stuff. Unfortunately, there is no character who is sufficiently in focus. The scene where Costigan is trailing Sullivan does not show anyone else dressed the way they are and so when Sullivan kills the wrong guy (dressed in ball cap and hooded sweat) it is not only a cliché but no surprise. The only criticism I have of the acting is the constant and annoying way the actors' accents vary, frequently within the same scene. I have never been in Boston (but really like Dennis Lehane's books) but do fancy high-rise apartments really have rats running across the balconies? Saying this movie is great because it won the Oscar is not meaningful: in my opinion this is not the best movie of 2006, or any other year.",

It's no surprise that Martin Scorsese's remake is the same. The running time passes smoothly and it never jars in the way that so many Scorsese films do. After you've watched it though the questions start to pile up. The story is basically totally unbelievable and would work much better with a camper approach - John Woo achieved this with ""Face/Off"", a much more entertaining film, mostly due to inspired casting of Travolta and Cage, two actors who can make the best of ridiculousness. Here instead we get DiCaprio seemingly taking it all very seriously and Matt Damon being as dull as he is as Jason Bourne. On the plus side Scorsese remains a technical wizard, a wizardry though seemingly divorced from any insight or guiding intelligence, to the point that he seems to fail to notice the pulp nature of the material here.",

330,9 April 2007,ElmStreetsLastBrat,10, Excellent Film!,"2006's The Departed is an excellent film. I'm not normally a fan of gangster films and really had no intention of seeing this film. But my mom was dying to see it and so I watched it with her. And I'm a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and seeing that Jack Nicholson was playing a mob boss I knew that it had to be a good film. And I was pleasantly surprised. It was worth the rental price at Blockbuster. Jack Nicholson plays mob boss Frank Costello, who's mole, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, is a cop who has just been promoted to a detective. But the police academy has no idea that he's Costello's mole. Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan, a recent graduate of the academy who has been hired to infiltrate the mob and bring Costello down. Mark Wahlberg is Dignam, a tough-talking cop who is working on the Costello case. His partner is Queenan, played by Martin Sheen. The plot gets a little complicated when all these characters cross paths in their attempts to catch Costello but it also is an exhilarating thrill to see who will find out who's the mole and who's the fake. This film kept me on the edge of my seat. There was so much tension that it was almost unbearable. The violence was a little graphic and anyone who doesn't like blood or doesn't like to see a lot of blood will feel a little uneasy watching this film. And anyone who doesn't like a lot of swearing and curse words will also feel uneasy. But The Departed wasn't just about blood and profanity. It gave you a look inside the mob and how ruthless and vile they can be. It showed you what can happen when secrets are revealed and when other people's trusts are broken. The most exciting scene for me was when Matt Damon found out that Leonardo DiCaprio was the one who was bringing down the mob and when Leo found out that Matt was the mole. Leo called Queenan's cell phone and Matt answered! That was such a tense moment and my whole family who was watching with me gasped. When I had rented this film the guy at Blockbuster told me that the ending was unbelievable. And boy was he right! ",

All my friends where saying it was a masterpiece so I decided to check it out. My theater was full. I guess everyone else heard the same thing from their friends and the internet. The moment this film started I thought to myself ""awww jeez, big mistake."" The acting was always good through out the movie. So don't get me wrong there. The plot was poorly written. The direction could've been a lot better. This movie was just a big cliché. An undercover cop? Let me name some films right now with that idea: Reservoir Dogs, Sin City, Airheads, The Punisher, Go, Donnie Brasco, Miami Vice, The Whole Nina Yard and much more. There was not one character I liked either. All of them acted childish and just cursed each other or bashing each other up. Believe it or not, but my theater was laughing all the way through it.

I mean, through the entire move the plot was excellent, the acting superb, the movie just breath-takingly good until the last 20 minutes or so. Then, for no really apparent reason, it turned into a Loony Tons episode and like six people get killed. Now mind you, throughout the entire movie we only see one or two deaths, and it is a long movie, and several other deaths were implied. But in the end, it turns into a three ring circus with people just getting shot in the head for no apparent reason. I understand this movie was based on a book but come on, take a little creative liberty with it like most directors do with good source material. Now let me say some positive things about the movie. The cast was stellar, all involved parties gave one of their best or their best performances ever. And this next comment goes to all the haters of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg, I have been telling you all for years that their acting skills were awesome and this movie proves it. Shame on some of you for not liking some of their early works. In the end, this movie goes from excellent dark, sometimes funny thriller, to just plain silly. This is one movie I would recommend seeing at theaters only if you are a die hard fan of the director. and love horrible endings that last for nearly a half an hour.

Granted it is very well made, with stylish shots and striking locations, the music is good, Scorsese's direction is excellent(though he has directed much better than here) and Jack Nicholson does do his best work in years here. However, I never did find the movie that compelling, the film does move in a somewhat mannered manner and there are parts that are either rushed, underdeveloped or even predictable- the sex scene was laughable. Also, I think The Departed is overlong, and the ending was very underwhelming. Then there is the script, while it has been lauded for its complexity, maybe I am being harsh but I found it too complex and needlessly convoluted too. In terms of acting, it was okay but nothing exceptional Nicholson excepted. Leonardo DaCaprio plays a different role but for me it is a role that does not suit him, while I didn't see anything special in Mark Wahlberg either. Out of the cameos, Ray Winstone's comes off best, while Matt Damon is the real weak link being very blank faced and monotone throughout. Overall, not terrible but a disappointment. As far as Scorsese movies go, I would put Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull over this any day. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

First, and most importantly, it's a great movie to watch. It's very rare for a movie to be entertaining through-and-through, ""The Departed"" pulls it off. Most movies make me look at my watch several times, as if saying ""um, are they getting near the end?"" Not ""The Departed""! Most of the actors play their characters slightly over-the-top. Matt Damon's vulgar turncoat cop is excruciatingly squeaky-clean. Alec Baldwin's vulgar police captain is excruciatingly by-the-book. Martin Sheen's vulgar police lieutenant is excruciatingly trusting, loyal, and competent. Mark Wahlberg's vulgar sergeant is excruciatingly tough, combative, and vulgar (yeah, I used ""vulgar"" twice, and for good reason). And Jack, what can one say about Jack?

Scorsese, whose Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas are classics of the genre, has come up with another gritty urban drama but, unlike his earlier efforts, it is filled with casual, ""cartoonish"" killing and a point of view that the excesses of organized crime and law enforcement are virtually indistinguishable.

Thank you Mr. Scorsese for a truly great American film. Everything is almost perfect, great story telling, great acting, and great musical score. It's very telling when a crime drama, lased with violence and corruption, still manages to have more humor then most of the comedies produced today. The characters are so well developed and intense, that every scene, every piece of dialogue is mesmerizing. All set to some of the best backdrops ever seen on film. Oh, and one last thing, anyone who thinks that Jack's portrayal is over the top, doesn't have a clue.

Not great by any stretch of the imagination but a passable B-movie with A-list actors. Mark Whalberg's character was annoying and just seemed too unstable and unfit for his position. Still marginally entertaining as I was not expecting a serious cinema and paying more attention to the visuals and Jack Nicholson's familiar antics. Once it became clear that this was a remake the whole impression just totally crumbles as you just notice only deficiencies and see no added value. To be fair it's not a one star movie characters are two-dimensional but there's some entertainment and shock value in it. Finally movies are goods to be sold let's be honest how many people among the average US movie going public have heard or watched IA?

357,19 October 2006,youramy1,10, The Departed is a REAL movie!!,"I almost never see movies twice (there are too many out there I've missed the first time), but I saw The Departed twice in 2 days and might see it a third time. First of all, I'm a retired cop; did undercover work; investigated racketeers (most dead now, some still masquerading as fine citizens). DiCaprio blew me away (missed his other movies, now I'll go back and see them including Gangs of New York; missed The Aviator, too.)Okay, I saw the Titanic; didn't want to in the first place, hope he got a lot of money for it b/c it's something he's probably been trying to shake for a long time. But I digress....Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite movies, so I've bonded with Matt Damon from that and enjoyed him since. Obviously, Di Caprio had the better role but I cannot imagine anyone playing it better (I'm sure that excellent directing helped). What got me was how inner anger drove that character. Even when he engaged with Madolyn, he didn't go soft (okay, that sounds like a reference to Madolyn's problem with Sullivan). In watching the movie the second time, I thought what drove Sullivan was his inner child/core was good and the fact that he took the bait from Costello as a child and was groomed to be bad really did not come easily to his sense of himself, thus his ""problem"" with Madolyn. Of course, someone I saw the movie with didn't catch that ""problem"" at all. As Sullivan lay on the bed and told Madolyn he thought they could start fresh in a new city, I saw that all the deceit had just about broken Sullivan, unlike Costello who would not live any other way. There definitely was a theme of virility running through the 3 major characters: Costello had only the appearance of it/had lost it; Sullivan lacked it and only Costigan had it (I choose to believe the baby was his). I really appreciated Scorcese's movement from one character/action to the next; I heard some comments that it was choppy (not here) but it brought the ""two boys"" in sharp contrast. I saw Sullivan's quiet desperation and Costigan's explosive desperation more acutely. The lack of gore and lack of explicit sex was also appreciated; this brought a crispness to the pace of the movie. While I could never get away from Nicholson the actor and think of Costello as Costello, I do appreciate that it wasn't De Niro (one of my least favorite major actors) and it wasn't Pacino (one of my favorite major actors who plays this type of role too often). The one thing lacking for me was why Costello adored Costigan to the point of having his lawyer send the tapes to him as well as keeping him in his crew because he had plenty of crew without taking in a possible rat. (The cutting room floor could probably help me on that one). But then a lot of the movie had cop and bad guy incongruities and one has to give fictional movies poetic license... I hope the Academy will recognize DiCaprio and Scorcese. Kudos to Baldwin,Wahlberg and Sheen and Vera F. She was mesmerizing. Baldwin has great delivery (loved him in The Cooler).",
358,11 October 2006,writerasfilmcritic,7," Gimme a Break! ""The Departed"" is Pretty Good but Far From Great","""The Departed"" is a fairly entertaining movie, although about 2/3 through, it definitely drags. There is simply too much reliance on cell phones as if, ""Oh, wow, ain't it something the way we can call one another at any time and, gee, isn't Generation X really interesting to watch?"" The answer is a resounding NO! You get really tired of yet another ringing cell phone and another kid picking up and blabbing away as if it's so important and so ""heavy."" Leonardo DeCaprio gives an uneven performance as the undercover cop who has successfully infiltrated the Irish Mafia in Boston. He starts out well, especially when he is being taunted by his superiors who are hoping to recruit him for undercover work, but it becomes increasingly evident that he has copied the characterization effectively utilized by Johnny Depp for ""Donnie Brasco,"" a better movie about an undercover cop who has infiltrated the mafia. Even his facial expressions start to resemble too much those used by Depp. At times, his character does hit a sort of stride, but generally, the ride strains credulity. Were I the crime boss, I'd have greased this punk the first time I suspected he might be a rat, because his denials are unconvincing. However, his IS a likable performance, despite its limitations, and I especially liked his budding romance with the sexy young psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the buildup doesn't really deliver, save for an abbreviated sex scene, mostly because the plot doesn't allow it. DeCaprio's nemesis, Matt Damon, the gangster mole in the Boston PD, never gains our sympathy. This guy is a piece of sh*t, pure and simple, and you might expect that he had some redeeming qualities, which he does not. That he gets away with all his inside machinations and is never seriously suspected by anyone in power, once again, asks us to suspend disbelief a tad too much. Jack Nicholson, as the ruthless crime boss the mole often refers to simply as ""Dad,"" hands in a reasonable performance that has been referred to as ""absolutely amazing,"" which it simply isn't. There are one or two interesting moments, such as his imitation of ""the dirty rat gnawing at cheese,"" but he fails to convince us that he is evil personified or incredibly mean and scary. This Nicholson is definitely not as good as the crazy caretaker of ""The Shining,"" nor for that matter, the inspired bum of ""Ironweed."" He's pretty good in this movie, but not great, and definitely not as good as De Niro or Pacino in similar roles. In fact, certain of the gang members, especially his right-hand man, do a more effective job of exuding pure evil. ",

I really like Scorsese and Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films but The Departed isn't even in its league. Jack shows up, well, as Jack. I think the last time Nicholson actually played a character, other than himself, Reagan was still in office. I don't buy him as a powerful Irish Mob boss for a minute. Wahlberg just yells and cusses a lot for no good reason. And Sheen looks kinda like he had a minor stroke before filming started. He looks like he's trying not to soil himself in every scene he's in.

My objections to it, for the most part, have been filled in by other users. Therefore, I'll keep it brief. The movie's characters, just like its gushing audiences,seem to suffer from attention deficit disorder. As if they've never read a book in their lives. And it appears as if Scorcese had that in mind, knowing fully well in advance that the film would appeal to people who seemingly have no problem with the F word being uttered every twelve seconds--whether it's in the movies, or in their actual,everyday pedestrian conversations. Which, I've found to be a problem with those who, quite simply,did not stay in school long enough. And who would believe-- even for a second--that two members of the Boston P.D.(played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg) would engage in banter graphically describing how each of them had sex with the other guy's mother--at a meeting where the bulk of the attendees consists of top- level Federal Agents?.

Moreover, it may very well be one of the best movies ever, and it ranks with Scorsese's best, including ""Raging Bull."" The cast was, simply, superb, and as I left the movie, I recounted who will win what Oscars....Scorsese is a lock for best director; the film will win best picture; but the acting awards will be more difficult to determine. Surely Jack Nicholson will win his umpteenth best actor award, and I would vote for DiCaprio for best supporting actor. DiCaprio might get a best actor nomination himself.

He is one of the best actors of his generation and of course when his fellow actors were promoting the film they all spoken about how much of a privilege it was to work with him. Is it difficult to notice that he can't actually act anymore; that he merely caricatures himself? Maybe he destroyed himself with playing The Joker in Batman (1989) for which he was given a percentage of the profits and made about $60 million dollars for one of the worst performances from a great actor in the history of cinema. His performance in The Departed was barely more restrained than The Joker. His performance is like a cartoon and utterly unconvincing as a real human being, despite being surrounded by grounded, effective performances.

I give it the stars just for the effort of particularly the actors involved, but the normally extremely talented Scorcese should simply have taken the basic plot and had it rewritten to a more terse, realistic thriller (something Robert Redford and his director Sidney Pollock did with Three Days of The Condor, which came from a book called Six Days of Condor and had much more exaggerated action scenes in it).

The original made a huge hit because it encompasses more than just a basic organized crime and thriller movie including the philosophies and thinking of the eastern culture and Buddhism.

The acting was excellent, though I think Mark Wahlberg's character was a bit over the top. His character was unlikeable, though at the end of this movie it works out, because the ending wouldn't have worked if he wasn't such a high-strung A-hole. The plot was simple yet intricate.

The point of the movie was that there was a rat in the mob helping the cops and a rat in the cops. So now we had to find out what was going to happen. the story is pretty much based on the inner man giving info to the enemy(rat).

What did the girl getting pregnant have to do with anything? Why wasn't Damon more upset knowing that the girl heard the CD? What about the letter? Did she give it to Wahlberg? Every other person in the movie was a mole in either the PD or the mob including the mob boss. And when Billy mentions to Damon that the only other person he's talked to has been a police psych and Damon got a strange look on his face I thought that was going to lead to some discovery.

407,12 October 2006,come2whereimfrom,6, good but not goodfellas.,"Right lets get a few things straight this is not the performance of Jack Nicholson's career (although its good), it is not the return to form we were hoping for from Scorsese and neither Matt Damon nor Leonardo Decaprio are that convincing as the two main cops. All that aside this isn't that bad a film, there are moments of Scorsese magic, there is a stellar cast including Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin to name a few of the excellent actors here, it has a great soundtrack and a killer script. Sadly it is a bit too long and not as good as 'Internal Affairs' on which it is based. Where it does shine it really is very bright but the flaws hold it back too much to be a career high for anyone involved, it is a lazy 'Goodfellas' at best and a Snatch/Lock Stock hybrid at worst. The casting of Matt and Leo (neither of which I rate as actors) as the rookie cops is an inspired take on the original story but the fact that in Internal Affairs the two cops trying to rat each other out had been on the force for so long gave the film a gravitas that just isn't here. A rather flimsy tentative connection is hinted at by a love interest they both find themselves sharing but it never goes anywhere, in fact her character just kind of disappears out of the plot leaving unanswered questions. Essentially the script highlights, apart from Nicholson, come from the banter between Baldwin and Wahlberg as the two department heads set with the task of bringing down Costello (Nicholson) but neither having access to each others resources. Being a rare 18 certificate means that Scorsese can still get graphic if needs be and he does. There are laughs, winces and tension and enough twists to keep your head spinning. Scorsese has also embraced the technological revolution and made mobiles and texting a prevalent form of communication between the cops and the bad guys and especially for the moles to sneak out info. Without spoiling the end or any of the really good bits I cant really say anymore, just that this is an OK film, not brilliant by Scorsese's earlier standards but worth seeing none the less, certainly the best he's done for a while.",

The only good thing about this remake is Jack Nicholson performance (except for the rubber penis). The original is thought provoking and make you want to see it over and over again. The characters in the original are captivating. The characters in the remake seems shallow and pointless. You don't feel for any of the characters, even the supposedly good guys, i.e. Martin Sheen, Mark Walberg and Leonardo DiCaprio because Scoresese did not care spending the time to build the story behind the 3, instead he just overloaded Walberg character with mindless swearing and stupid insults to DiCaprio.

In my screening in Gainesville, Florida, the last forty minutes of the film -- you remember, the forty minutes in which nine of the eleven main characters get skull-shot by someone else? -- the audience was so pulled out of the thing that people were actually LAUGHING AT THE SCREEN.

It seems an unlikely transition to make: Hong Kong to Boston. Going from a huge Asian industrial metropolis to a small burg that still looks as though half of it was ripped right out of England would contradict the very basis of the plot. Even the trailer fails to give the feeling that the setting is anything more than Pick-Your-City, USA. It just doesn't seem possible, but Scorsese with writer William Monahan bring their whole adaptation of ""Infernal Affairs"" to life and succeed in making it actually be about Boston. The powerhouse cast (with two hometown consultants built in) doesn't hurt one bit either.

The story is better than Goodfellas (yes, I know that was based on a real story, but this one seems more realistic). The violence and dialog are so much more satisfying than Scarface. You feel like the violence makes sense, and isn't there just to decorate the movie. And the characters are nearly as compelling as the Godfather. The acting (and writing) is so good, that I will be disappointed if there are not multiple Oscar wins for the cast and story.

Plainly the stellar cast have congregated around Scorcese and it probably wouldn't have been made without him. Obviously, everyone involved were pretty pleased to be together on the project. That comes through and that's good. However, a whole heap of entirely unimportant, improvised tooling about by the ensemble desperately needs to be hacked out of the final reel, which Scorcese plainly couldn't bring himself to do.

418,18 February 2007,ryan_kuhn,8," ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.""","The first lines of this movie are said in a monologue by Jack Nicholson's mob-boss character Frank Costello. He starts with, ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."" This line essentially sums up the movie even before it begins. The Departed is an Americanized version of a Hong Kong filmed called Infernal Affairs, and tells the story of two Boston state troopers--one goes undercover and works against the Costello gang from within (Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan) and one works for the Special Investigation Unit while still on Costello's payroll (Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan). Each one lives in a world of deception, each trying to keep their real motives a secret from their adoptive bosses, each trying to out maneuver the other. The Departed ends up being a 150 minute long cat and mouse game between two guys who are referred to as rats in the entire movie. At first, each takes to their responsibilities with vigor and enthusiasm, with Costigan having the more difficult assignment, trying to infiltrate a gang who all knew he was once a cop. As the movie goes a long, we feel the noose tightening around each, as both characters go through moments of dread and loss, until the bloody ending where all of the characters who deceived and schemed ended up getting a suitable punishment. Each character in the movie imposes their outlook on the world on their situations, as each one makes their own luck, so to say, as the first line uttered by Nicholson alluded to. None of the characters are the result of a predetermined destiny, as everyone made decisions on their own and had to live with their results. As Costello said, their environments were all products of their own actions. As far as Scorsese's direction goes, it is as usual top-notch, with quick cuts when quick cuts are needed, a neat opening that gives about as much background information as we viewers could possibly need in a fast-paced 15 minutes before the opening credits even finish, a fine selection of music (almost Tarantino -like in how the music matched each scene), and as much violence and obscenities as you could possibly get in two and a half hours. Boston makes for a fascinating location for a movie such as this--a rich subtext to each character, the possibility for interesting supporting players, and a gritty street life that makes it a poor man's version of New York City, without having thousands of movies made about it already. The one problem with the Boston setting is the accent thing--some of the characters lose the accent then it magically comes back. This is always a concern when it comes to Boston movies. Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are terrific as high-level police officers, and Mark Wahlberg goes all in with his portrayal of the salty Sergent Dignam. But the real stars are DiCaprio and Damon, each young actors who have really developed into well-rounded portrayers of emotion and gravitas. Yes, DiCaprio may never really leave the Titanic, but here he shows he can act in a subtle, yet strong roll in a Scorsese movie that is almost as good as Goodfellas.",

He managed to enthrall audiences with his witty and fascinating dialogue and tales of star-crossed lovers and brave Moors, among others. This year, The Departed was honoured with the Academy Award for Best Picture and many that considered a triumph for Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest modern filmmakers still standing strong since he first came to prominence in the 1970's.

445,11 November 2006,Sparrowmaniac,8, Scorsese hits the jackpot..... again !!!,"The Departed is one of the best contemporary thrillers that I have seen. True its a remake, and critics will be be saying,""So what the Chinese did this before and even made sequel to it.."" But Scorsese's Departed is a whole new thing. Firstly Jack Nicholson.(Screw me, but I'm a big fan of him...) Even though Nicholson is the villain, the movie doesn't give him much of a headway. He starts off as a local absconder and rises up to a mafia boss, but throughout the movie he rules about every other actor. Be it DiCaprio or Damon. Even in the scene where he dies he commands an aura of respect. Second point making this a must see, is undoubtedly its marvelous star cast. True again that some of the actors were not used to their potential like Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg but still no one would be able to resist the temptation of such an unbelievable cast. Thirdly Martin Scorsese. The bloke has given Hollywood some amazing movies over the years. He may go down in history as the greatest director not to get a Academy Award(I cant see him bagging an award for this, since its a remake) but he truly is a genius. And lastly Pink Floyd. If you people are wondering if I have lost my nuts, then no. Indeed Floyd's most remarkable song,""Comfortably Numb"" does feature in the movie in the love making scene between DiCaprio's character and Vera Farmiga.",

449,7 January 2011,juliana-944-722809,8, Boston PD Culture in an Unforgettable Crime Mystery,"Although I'm several years late watching The Departed, I was impressed by how real the film holds up, despite time travel. Brutal language, violence, Boston accents, and culture, and the evil conflicts between the Boston and Providence RI mob gangs, creates an unforgettable Scorsese film. Particularly interesting is the birds eye view of the Massachusetts Police Academy, with anecdotes of how people inside law enforcement live seemingly ordinary lives while dealing with the worst evil crime syndicates in the US. DiCaprio is absolutely at his best playing the conflicted undercover PD agent Billy Costigan, who tries to win the confidence of his mob boss (Jack Nicholson) while keeping his undercover identity secret. At cross purposes is Matt Damon, who is doing the complete opposite, as PD officer Colin Sullivan, who tries to keep the confidence of his precinct boss Captain Queenan played by Martin Sheehan. In fact, Sullivan is double crossing his public trust by keeping the mob led by Jack Nicholson's character Frank Costello, in the business of murder and extortion. The Departed is an adult film, period. Nonetheless, performances by the main cast are extraordinary - note Alec Baldwin who holds the viewers attention as a PD facilitator and instructor for the plot to uncover the undercover agents. There isn't another actor I know of who could execute this minor but bridge building role other than Baldwin. Nicholson's evil intentions carry this film's graphic plot, because his performance as a crime boss is totally convincing. Otherwise, Vera Farmiga is a somewhat ambiguous character who is not exactly likable, but she brings the cruel pieces together in the end, so to speak. I would give The Departed a rating of 10, except I did not like the counseling scenes with DiCaprio and Farmiga - they were not realistic. Yet, I believe, The Departed will stand the test of time as one of Scorsese's best films and a great cultural description of America's syndicated crime culture.",
450,11 April 2022,alexander-978-692186,7, A note on why the Departed missed the point of Infernal Affairs,One question to ask yourself when watching Scorsese's The Departed compared to the Hong Kong original Infernal Affairs. Scorsese didn't realise it was a remake until after he bought the rights to the script and didn't watch the original so as not to influence his vision. The result is a mixed bag. Do large budgets and A-list celebrities make a film better?,

It was simply too bad and too long to sit through for 7 American dollars. Come to think of it, I can't remember the last time I was able to make it to the end of a Scorsese flick without snoring myself awake during its end credits. Nicholson's accent is shaky at best and his role as mob boss about as convincing as the film's denouement when every character that you should care about takes one to the face. It's as if Monahan got tired and handed the script of to his 12 year old to finish. Neither a masterpiece or anywhere near Scorsese's best. Perhaps, throwing in the towel is not an option when you command so much respect. But, it's never too late.",

This brilliant multi-faceted melodrama about the tooth and nail struggle to jail a well-known criminal boasts several surprises, primarily at the end and a number of sensational performances, with Jack Nicholson ably cast as Boston crime boss Frank Costello taking top honors. DeCaprio is cast as an undercover cop straight out of the academy who joins Costello's mob, while Costello grooms Matt Damon as his snitch inside the department. This cat & mouse thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat as one mole in the mob circles another mole in the police, and Scorsese and scenarist William Monahan patiently construct this elaborate complex thriller without wearing out their welcome.

While it is watchable & not awful, there are at least 100 films in my queue that would have been more worthwhile. Almost every scene in this movie plays out like a rehash from another movie, so I was surprised to see that this was supposed to be a remake of Infernal Affairs (which I thought was quite good). Nothing in this movie rings true (a psychologist that dispenses drugs to patients after they've asked for them, a chief of police who hires a rat to find out who the rat in the department is, a graduate of the police academy who works his way up to the top in less than a year....the implausibilities are endless). The dialog & plot are quite contrived, the acting is always over the top (everyone has to use expletives all the time). The movie just spends too much time trying to be clever and not enough time developing any believable characters or plot. It's a sad commentary on the poor taste of the masses that a film this bad can get such a high rating.",

I was never a big fan of Leo DiCaprio but the performance he gives in this changed that. His character is very well developed and you feel for him right away. Matt Damon gives a surprising turn as a underhanded moll infiltrating the police. And of course there is Jack Nicholson in a blistering performance. Jack radiates menace, madness and charisma as Irish mob boss Frank Costello. A true legend at work. And he hasn't lost his touch. There is a reason for his 12 academy award nominations.

Jack Nicholson gave one of his best performances as Frank Costello, a Boston mobster. Instead of Italian mobsters in New York City, it is Boston and Irish mafia. Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover cop in Costello's mob. Matt Damon plays cop and his mole. The two men don't know who is playing who. The film features great supporting performances by Ray Winstone, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlburg, Vera Farmiga. The film storyline is gripping to watch and can't help to see how it ends. Martin Scorsese did a fabulous job in recreating the Boston mob. The film was shot on location in Boston. Scorsese and his brilliant film editor did a terrific job.

Their accents are really, really bad. The script itself had some good parts, had they been given to well-chosen actors they may have been more believable. The only thing I got any enjoyment out of was Matt Damon getting punched several times by Leo DiCaprio, whose performance in this film was the only highlight I can think of. He is definitely improving with age. Its also too long and upon leaving the cinema, all I heard were dissatisfied grumbles, no-one seemed to enjoy it and some people walked out before the end.

463,8 February 2007,NateW,9, Far from departed for America's modern movie master,"For over two decades, Martin Scorsese captured the essence of the modern mafia and street-wise tough guys so distinctly and vividly that the very idea of anyone else trying to so seemed infeasible. With Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino, Scorsese molded ugly, violent and unrepentant criminals into captivating and even likable characters that are impossible to forget. After going off the beaten path with past efforts Gangs of New York and The Aviator, the man most people (myseslf included) to be our greatest living filmmaker has returned to his roots with The Departed. Simply put, it's the best film of 2006, if not the last several years. From the first words, there's no mistake that Marty has crafted another masterpiece like only he can. Obscenely crackling dialogue, in-your-face blood and brutality and a soundtrack that hits all the right notes are only a few of the familiar fingerprints left in the reels by Mr. Scorsese. It's funny, it's startling, and it's spectacular. How good is it? This could very well be the work that finally gets Marty the Oscar gold that he should've gotten a few times by now. We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see if that happens, but it takes much less time to see that The Departed is a masterpiece of film-making from a director who has made a living out of creating them.",

He has a solid film resume under his belt, and despite losing all five of his Best Director Oscar nominations, continues to pump out movies. When his movies are good, they are usually absolutely fantastic. When his movies are bad, even then they still have some form of redeeming quality saving it from full ostracizing.

It has the same plot like other gangster movies but were it truly works is the amazing funny dialogue and great performances. DiCaprio, Damon and Jack Nicholson is at their best with insane amount off attention that just flows through the entire movie. There is a lot off brutal violence that is not for people that like that kind of stuff, if you don't like blood and gore I wouldn't recommend the film.

470,21 March 2009,paul2001sw-1,6, Reheated affairs,"Martin Scorcese has directed some fine movies, but his remake of 'Cape Fear' was amongst his weakest, a near-identical (and thus pointless) remake of the original. So news of 'The Departed', his version of 'Infernal Affairs', made me apprehensive. For those who don't know them, 'Infernal Affairs' and its two sequels, were brilliant films: violent yet cool, stylish but in no way shallow, and for a westerner like myself, interesting for their take on the Hong Kong underworld (a refreshing contrast to the over-familiar world of American gangsters). To be fair, in this case Scorcese has borrowed the plot elements but made his own film, a long way from a straight copy. Unfortuantly, he has also lost most of what was great about the originals. In the place of the cool, interesting world of Hong Kong, we have a very loud and direct movie full of wisecracking, foul-mouthed, ultra-macho American hard-men. Some of the writing made me squirm, it's not that the lines themselves are especially bad, but there's a depressing lack of originality in the way the script is constructed. Secondly, in the original movie, I cared for both leads, but in this film both Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio's characters (it's a starry cast all round, with a face you recognise in every role) are equally unappealing. And whereas the original movie dared start with the setup complete, leaving questions about how the plot got to this situation unanswered (at least until the sequel), Scorcese lacks the courage to do the same, walking us through the complete story in broadly chronological order, then adding some random, pointless minor time-shifting (the occasional scene shown out of sequence) as if in homage to his predecessor, while failing to understand the rationale of the device. The sad thing is that some of Scorcese's early movies, such as 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver', were as fresh and unexpected as 'Infernal Affairs' was; but in 'The Departed', he has reduced a classic to the Hollywood model of what a gangster film should be, and somehow won as Oscar for the achievement.",

A luxury apartment in a high rise, obviously high up and suddenly there, on the balcony railing, a lone rat balancing precariously on the railing with the capitol dome in the background. The only thing that could have been more ridiculous is if they'd had the rat take a swan dive off the balcony! This movie was so good, so compelling up until the last 4th of the film.

Although violent, Scorsese does not dwell on the violence as he does in some of his earlier films. The all-star cast is in top form.

Ridiculous dialogue and senseless violence which was poorly placed and showed. No character had any depth to speak of and poor Jack Nicholson as Mob boss? I don't think so. Jack was and always will be a solo act. His tirades are embarrassing to watch as they are forced and unnatural. What's the matter? Was DeNiro unavailable? Or maybe he just read the script and said - Pass.. The end is expected and senseless. Everybody dies, good bad, whatever. It makes so much sense how everybody in the movie communicates with cell phones and text messages. You want to tell me that the police cant figure that out? Has technology regressed so much that mob boss cell phones are not tapped? I'm sure that the good folks at Sprint would help if asked nicely. The funny part is that in one scene, the police is very proud of the cellphone surveillance they have, as Matt Damon's Cajones shrivel up. He talks to his mob friend once a day, from the office no less, texts him freely. What the hell is this? Where is the sophistication? Where is the Drama? Matt Damons fiancée sleeps with Dicaprio but nothing is made of it? How stupid. Who scripted this thing?

I don't believe the screen play writer hadn't watched the original Infernal Affairs while writing the Departed screen play. I am sure everybody in the cast and of course the writer and Director had watched the Original for at least 10 times if not 100 times. The actors delivered the same exact emotions and writer and director just Americanized the story. Add some sex scene. Add few sub plots not related to the story and a happy resolution in the ending. Come on guys you can be a little more creative with 90 Million dollars budget. The other sad thing is how films are sold and marketed using actor names and not the story line. Infernal Affairs and Departed are great example of this. The Original Infernal Affairs when screened in US just made $89.6K, because in US there are very few people that watch anything made outside Hollywood.

As he himself explains, he rose from poverty, little by little, to become the leader of the leading gang in SB. Naturally, he is a thorn in the side of the Boston Police and they live to bring this man down. A secret task force is formed and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio), a cleancut boy from South Boston who has graduated from the police academy, is given the special task of infiltrating Frank's mob, pretending to be a sworn follower. This is dangerous work indeed. However, Frank has the same brilliant idea. If the gang had a plant in the police department, above reproach, then he would know when the police are coming to mess up his plans. A disciple from his teens, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the perfect choice; he is bright, good-looking and seemingly genial. He fools most everyone, including the brass (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) and a psychologist (Verma Farmiga). In fact, Colin and the shrink begin a relationship while, at the same time, Cop Sullivan is relaying crucial information to Frank. As such, eventually, Billy and Colin cross paths and get suspicious of one another. Billy even goes after Colin's lady. So, whose ""traitor"" in the midst will be the most successful? How many lives will be sacrificed? This brutal but splendid film is not really for the most faint of heart. Nevertheless, is ultra-fascinating plot has to be seen to be appreciated. The story even eclipses the GREAT work of Nicholson, Di Caprio, Damon, Farmiga and the entire crew. What a breathtaking twist and turn tale of betrayal and goodness. As many critics have found, this may be the ultimate Scorsese film as his hands are behind every scene. Thrillers come and go but The Departed will stay around for the ages.",
487,5 August 2020,briancham1994,6, Brutal,This film is quite brutal and intense. I don't think it lives up to the Hong Kong original but it is still alright in itself. Scorsese proves himself as the master of bloody action but I don't think it fully paid off here.,
488,25 March 2013,cougarfan-bridger,7, Thrilling Ride,"In The Departed, Martin Scorsese makes his return to the mob underworld, and he does it with a thrilling intensity that overshadows his previous films. From the start, to the closing credits, The Departed is an incredibly exciting film, and there is rarely a slow moment. Unlike GoodFellas and Casino, the characters were written in a way that makes the viewer relate to them in a very personal way. Their trials and struggles make them very human, and I found myself very emotionally involved, hoping for the best for the major characters. Speaking of characters, give credit to the acting cast for filling the roles emotionally and intensely. DiCaprio and Damon were excellent in the lead roles, but Baldwin and Wahlberg were an absolute joy to watch as supporting characters. While the writing was intense, I sometimes felt that the plot had no central point, and it seemed to go on and on without resolve. It is sure to keep the audience guessing, but at times this was frustrating and I wanted to know more that wasn't being given to me. The finale, while intense to say the least, didn't fill all the holes created throughout the film, and is sure to leave many questions with viewers. I would go as far to say the acting is some of the best I've seen though, and if you're a classic Scorsese fan, this is definitely a movie well worth your time.",
489,1 March 2023,Ed-Shullivan,9, A top notch cat and mouse game for undercover cop Billy Costigan played superbly by Leonardo DiCaprio,"There are very few crime genre films that can hold up as good as when they were first released but I must say that every time I watch the (2006) The Departed, I feel like I am watching it for the first time again and again. It was that good!",
490,7 October 2006,quentar,6, Huge disappointment,"""The Departed"" is being hailed in some circles as Martin Scorsese's return to a genre he knows like the back of his hand -- the gritty crime drama. And to be fair, there are moments of grit in the film. The problem is they are just that -- moments. Nothing ever builds to any tangible feeling of dread. The film's effect (if it has any at all) dissipates the moment the credits roll.",

492,20 March 2010,roneb,1," Poor story, awful production.","What kind of medication, drugs, weed, or pills are the people who wrote and produced this movie on? If events depicted, characters portrayed are representative of what goes on in the USA, then the rest of the population of planet earth definitely would not be sane to emulate American behaviour and culture. The huge US movie industry has made many films which were great entertainment, ""The Departed"" was/is not one of them. This complex doublecross story was difficult to follow.",
493,23 December 2010,johnnyboyz,6," Agonisingly ordinary, routine little cops and criminals piece which is best described as minor Scorsese.","The Departed is a curious thing: a Martin Scorsese concept movie. Here's a piece by the renowned director running on a sentence long pitch which reads something like: ""there are these two fellas; one's an undercover cop pretending to work with the mob while the other's a mole employed by the mobsters mixing it with the cops"" – there's your pitch, now run with it. I've nothing greatly against The Departed; it's a serviceable and workable enough little thriller which darts along at a merry old pace but it is an oddly cold; oddly distant; unmoving and strangely uninvolving piece, punctuated by individual 'moments' or 'bits' that take what has been a flagging film up to the respective point before consequently dragging it through a hedge in the proverbial maze thus onto another path entirely. Where Scorsese has dealt with the gangster genre in spits and spots before, namely Goodfellas and Casino, and done so in a manner that took us right to the brink in terms of either coming to side with the characters or despising them, The Departed chugs along with both its post-""24"" and post-Bourne mannerisms as well as droll causality as it runs on a very specific premise plus routine character arcs. Where rather gloriously straddling that line between glamorisation and demonisation in the past, Scorsese has effectively relegated himself to mainstream fluff feigning to be about something whilst running on star power. In short, it is highly underwhelming and staggeringly average.",

495,19 October 2006,DarkVulcan29,10, The Streets Just Got Meanier,"This was a great crime drama, it was amazingly well directed by Martin Scororsese, it was well acted by the all star cast. They play off each other so well with drama and a little humor. The movie begins with Billy(Leonardo DiCaprio) is a cop who is in deep cover to infiltrate sadistic mobster Frank Costello(Jack Nicholsen at his best), as of Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon), a cop on the take, is trying to find out the undercover guy on Costellos team. It is only of matter of time on how both men are in over there heads, and will it come crashing down on both of them. A great way to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes, but it is so amazingly well paced, you'll forget how long it is.",
496,21 May 2007,hchais,10," The best cop thriller since ""Goodfellas""","This movie is excellent. It is definitely the greatest movie of 2006 is one of the 5 best movies of the decade. Everything about it is good. The story is one of the best ever. The story is just amazing. The acting is also incredible by almost everybody that was in it. The script is also great. This is definitely The best cop movie since Goodfellas, or you can say the second best cop movie ever made. This is Scorcese's best job directing ever. He deserved to win for Goodfellas. This movie was definitely worthy of the Oscars that it won. It deserved to take home best picture, director, and screenplay. I am surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't even nominated for this. This was a great movie. Scorcese's second best. 10/10.",
497,9 October 2006,amaro72,1, I want my $10 back,"Perfectly horrible. Weak storyline, choppy, and powerless. This might be Scorsese's worst work. Shallow doesn't begin to describe this movie. Unfortunately, shooting people in the head and saying the F-word don't make up for storyline. The acting is actually decent for the most part - minus Leo Decap and the lead female - but they've got nothing to work with. The suspension of disbelief is lost about and hour in. By the way - for once can someone (besides Matt Damon, Mark Walberg - both from Boston) do a decent Boston accent??? I don't know WHAT accent Leo Decap was doing. Also, one of least inspiring leading ladies of any movie, EVER. If the lead actress can't act, can't she at LEAST be good looking? Short Version - Save your money!",
498,29 October 2006,barone01,4, Another poor movie from Scorsese,"What an overrated filmmaker Scorsese is. I have just seen the film and I was tempted to quit all the way through. This film must be one of the worst film Scorsese has ever made. Worst than the Aviator and yes, even worst then the Age of Innocence, which had put to sleep. The problem it seems is that Scorsese does not know anymore what makes a good script. The script here is simply terrible. It seems a patched up affair of ""yeah I like this lets put it in"" or ""yes this looks good, lets do it"". The plot does not follow any logic and worst of all the film and its characters are totally unbelievable like the police shrink who is supposed to love Damon's character and then suddenly, oops, has a quickie with the other ""rat"" in the film DiCaprio's character, what a small world we live in, eh? Then of course, everybody plays double games, everybody is corrupt and so on all for the sake of convenience and because it sounds good and NOT because the script demands it! The script looks as if it has been written by a film school student. Then of course we come to Scorsese handling of the material and that of course, disappoints too. For the first half of the movie we hare subjected to a mean loud disco music which make the dialogue barely audible but is the overall feel of the film which lacks any class and timing, which is what you would expect from a filmmaker who goes by the name Martin Scorsese.There are simply a ton of bad film-making decisions in this film, too many to tell, think of the final rock song in Gangs of New York, totally out of contest and multiply it by ten. I only save the cast, here Scorsese has cast everyone competently and they all perform to a very good standard for the top actors that they are. My only doubt there being the casting of Walberg in a role where I would have seen better suited an older actor. The soundtrack might do good business and no doubt people who like mindless violence and no plot might find something in this but otherwise don't bother. Not a good movie.",

500,10 October 2006,Vinegaroon3,5, Bloated....overly long....but decent,I do not understand some of the raves about this movie. It was simply an average to slightly above average 90 minute thriller stretched into 140 (or thereabouts) minutes.,
501,18 October 2006,peterportez-1,7, Why a meaningless and unbelievable subplot?,"I must have read a dozen reviews of ""The Departed"" by professional critics. No one, however, has pointed out the utter meaninglessness of the 20-minute subplot--quickly discarded--involving the selling of mysterious microprocessors to agents of the government of China. It's beyond belief to ask an audience to believe that a local mobster into loan sharking, drug dealing, and the usual local mobster fare would delve into far murkier international intrigue. I guess Scorcese must have had second thoughts, too, since this whole sequence was dropped like a hot potato, not to be mentioned again. Further, and oddly, too, the agents of the Chinese government are seen speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin.",
