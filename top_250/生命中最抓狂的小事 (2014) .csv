1,11 February 2018,gogoschka-1,8, The Edge Of Reason,"Hilarious and very, very black comedy consisting of six episodes about people who get driven to the edge of reason (and a little beyond). The acting and writing in this gem from Argentina are superb, and the beautifully photographed segments keep you thrilled and unable to guess just what crazy turn they will take next. A wonderful joy of a film for film lovers with a rather twisted sense of humor. 8 stars out of 10.",r
2,20 July 2018,perica-43151,10, Brilliant,"Perhaps the best omnibus dark comedy ever made. This movie is funny, it explores some of the darker parts of humanity but it does so with so much wit and intelligence. It was a great hit in South America, and understandably so. Despite dark and cynical take on the human condition, the movie is lighthearted and highly watchable, and uncompromisingly original.",e
3,21 May 2015,ahegde3149,8, Big things have small beginnings,"Never watched any Argentine/Spanish film before. Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.",v

Wildly original.,This Argentine film that found itself nominated for the 2014 Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award comes to us from director Damián Szifrón who has crafted a feature film comprised of a series of 6 vignettes/small stories about human beings from all walks of (Argentine) life who are all tested and taken to their limits ... until they finally lose control. While mostly disastrous the film is also WILDly thrilling and wholly original in its daring cheekiness ... as the film is a bitter dark comedy (with tinges of brutal drama).,w

9,12 October 2014,Blue-Grotto,10, Time does not heal all wounds.,"Time does not heal all wounds. One thing leads to another in six outrageous, hilarious and extreme stories of revenge. A jilted and emotionally volatile bride wreaks havoc at her wedding with an equally unstable new husband, a towing company hauls away one too many times the vehicle belonging an explosive expert, and two macho drivers – one in an Audi and the other in a pile of junk – go head to head with explosive road rage, among other delicious and fiery adventures. The utmost fantasies fulfilled, the extremes of emotions, and the riot of laughter that engulfed me from all sides, I cannot remember having such a good time watching a film. The director, who answered questions at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, said the film is about the pleasure of losing control and giving in to unrestrained passions. Is it ever!",w

11,3 January 2015,maurice_yacowar,10, Six stories of frustration leading to joyous revenge,"The Spanish title is more apt: Savage Tales. Six short stories show various ways in which savagery persists in the highest levels of civilization. The titles appear against a montage of wild animals. The twist is that here the savagery is celebrated not rued. Where civilization was supposed to free us from savagery, as in the American Western, here the savagery liberates the characters from their civilization. As director Damian Szifron told the Palm Springs festival audience, ""The theme is the pleasure of losing control. Releasing the beast.""",4

It works very well like that, lasting over 120 minutes that go by quickly. It feels very fluid. Szifrón's eye is very precise. You can tell everything was very well thought. I wouldn't say this is a philosophical film, but it is clever entertainment, that makes you think if this wild tales are actually that wild... Even though this stories are taken to the extreme, everything feels somehow possible when you look back. ",5

Revenge, Argentine style.","""Wild Tales"" (2014 release from Argentina; 122 min.) is a collection of 6 seemingly unrelated tales which all bear the same theme: revenge. The opening (pre-movie credits) tale is a classic: a woman strikes up a conversation with another airplane passenger and they find out that by complete coincidence (or not?) they are both acquainted with the same person. Then it emerges that several other passengers also know that person... No worries, I'm not going to spoil anything. This first (and short) story sets the mood for the movie perfectly, as we get five more vignettes that are all one better than the other. I can't decide which is my favorite, to be honest.",3

I recognized one of the actors on the poster and have generally watched a couple of Spanish language movies that knew how to hit the spot (if that makes sense to you). What I mean is: They know how to make a good movie.

19,18 November 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""Can't you see that I love you?""","If you consider the word 'salvajes' in the Spanish language version of this title, ""Relatos Salvajes"", it closely resembles the word 'savage' in English, doesn't it? That's what came to my mind, as the six unconnected stories in this movie could just as well have been titled ""Savage Tales"". They are all positioned at some level for a savage outcome, and some of them are ironically hilarious in the execution, especially the wedding story between Romina and Ariel that closes things out.",r

The movie is a satire of modern society. Cinematography is wonderfully executed by Javier Julia. Director/Writer Damián Szifrón puts together six different stories that all have nervous breakdown as their common theme. In one of the story, the lead is Ricardo Darín (the secret in their eyes), most of us can rate to the frustration he goes thru before his nervous breakdown. This movie is really about what happens when we let frustration pile up and everything becomes too much at some point. It's about when so much bad stuff happens to you. The acting, direction and cinematography were very good. The first story is the shortest n da best.",=

But when the 1st tale was approaching its climax, it became evident that many catchy moments would be waiting me... Some parts are less realistic than others, but definitely not airy-fairy, and smart dialogues with distinct performances paved the way for lots of giggling, moments with black humour, and some grisly recognition how easily a rampage can occur...

28,1 August 2015,gradyharp,8," Sweet revenge, or why we need Anger Management","Damián Szifrón is the Argentine writer director (with producer backup from Agustín and Pedro Almodóvar) who present us with a series of stories that present the human animal and how it reacts to stress: six dark stories, involving six savage situations full of revenge and the dark sides of human beings - dreadful revenge to hated persons, accidental or intentional, dangerous and unexpected arguments, misunderstandings, and horrid confrontations that permanently change the lives of people involved. The film is advertised as wildly funny, and perhaps if we all view human foibles and anger management crises as food for laughter then the term comedy is appropriate. What the audience sees are situations most of us confront daily (on a much more quiet level) – frustrations with politics, misunderstandings of conversations, immediate flash hate responses like road rage, jealousies mishandled, bullying – and because we can relate to each of these stories the film works.",r
29,29 August 2016,nicholasruddick,9," Forget Wild, These Tales Are Savage!","This is a very watchable and often extremely funny anthology of six short films. The dialogue is in Spanish, the director and settings are Argentine. The stories are all slightly-over-the-top-realism in the manner of Almodóvar tinged with the dark surrealism of the Buñuel of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. The scenarios are graphic rather than subtle, but they all work well most of the time, because most of us can identify with the main characters, recognizing how little it can take to shake us from complacency into violence.",v

31,23 April 2015,Kicino,8, Acting out our violence and soothing us amid our absurd reality,I usually develop headaches when I see excessive violence in movies. But Wild Tales makes me feel so good because I can identify with all the underdog characters who take their revenge to the extreme with very black humor. It just makes me feel exceptionally good and relieved. It is vicarious violence without having to pay any consequences! And those jerks really deserve what they finally get. ,
32,18 March 2015,bRAdY-01,10, Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood,"Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood. Simply the most refreshing and entertaining film that I've been lucky enough to watch since Nightcrawler...really it's that good. The darkest comedy you'll have the pleasure to experience. Ticks all the boxes, cinematic, a superb ensemble cast deliver in every short story, dead pan humour, intelligent, thought provoking, terrifyingly realistic, wonderful camera-work especially in the final story, with a couple of explosions and some (thankfully) subtle CGI thrown in to complete this masterpiece. Lovely to once again sit amid an audience all happily laughing out loud, without the need to lower itself to racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic humour, though the scatological humour is surprisingly perfectly appropriate and carefully framed to make the point without unnecessary vulgarity. Ten out of Ten. A new name to watch. Kudos to Damián Szifron.",
33,9 March 2015,lasttimeisaw,8," Six tales of ""Revenge""","With Pedro Almodóvar's name credited manifestly as one of the producers, viewers will not be too surprised that this portmanteau film from Argentinian director/writer Damián Szifrón is ripe with Almodóvaresque touch - six short, surreal, dark comedies, (most of them are) deeply rooted in the injustice presented in the current Argentinian society (however, it can be feasibly comprehended elsewhere since the situations are all the same), with a recurrent theme of vengeance flows through all of its components, as the pre-credit prologue named ""Pasternak"" glaringly sets the tone from an all-inclusive reprisal from an unknown man towards every single person who mistreats him in his life, it is absurdly implausible to effectuate such a scheme (too many variations are involved), but as the opening gambit and the shortest one, it effectively kick-starts the film with an offbeat grin beckons an unconventional wild-ride sinisterly awaits the audience, also it tells us revenge has no mercy at all.",
34,14 September 2015,Buddy-51,8, Creepily effective black comedy,"If you've been feeling a mite cocky about where your life is headed of late, you might want to take a gander at ""Wild Tales"" for a much needed reality check. This omnibus Spanish feature, sharply written and directed by Damian Szifron, offers a series of very dark, very disturbing and sometimes very humorous vignettes, all centered on chance (and not so chance) encounters that go awry in unexpected and often tragic ways. The movie makes it clear that, while you may think you have control over your life, in the grand scheme of things, you're really just a pawn subject to the whims of other individuals, a soulless bureaucracy or, most chillingly, a cruel and mocking Fate. However, in two of the cases, the participants do manage to wrest control back from the outside forces and determine the course of their lives - to some extent, at least.",
35,5 March 2016,Quinoa1984,9, aka 'One Thing Leads to Another till BAM' - the comedy!,"I'd like to imagine that if Luis Bunuel's grandson (or maybe grand-daughter, who knows) had the same temperament and filmmaking go-for-broke sense of death-defying comedic satire, and grew up on a diet of Tarantino scripts, he/she might make something like Wild Tales. Or perhaps there's also a touch of Kafka to some of this - people who are put into completely insane situations that start from something typical (a guy who flips off or a guy getting flipped off while driving, or a guy getting his car towed), or not so much (a groom's infidelity discovered by the bride right in the middle of the wedding reception, or a negotiation by rich men over how to save a kid from going to jail for running someone over).",

39,5 February 2016,deloudelouvain,7, Six short stories that make a good movie,"When i read it was going to be a movie with six short stories I was worried because almost all the other movies with short stories I saw before are just too boring. You never feel satisfied with short stories like that but in Relatos Salvajes you don't get that feeling. Every single story is fun to watch. They are all with a bit of violence , but that what's make it great. Watching people loosing it. I thought all the actors that participated in this movie did a great job. I didn't expect to be this entertained but at the end I was certainly pleased that I watched those short stories. Two hours of entertainment that flew by in a second.",
40,3 June 2017,MDCRubenGonza,10, Excellent Movie Making,"This is an excellent piece that will entertain you from the very first second to the last. I am looking forward to seeing this movie again with someone that would appreciate it. While it is completely in Argentine Spanish (which is great for me as I am a fluent Spanish-speaker) it has subtitles which are excellent. The combination of acting and story are truly magnificent. Comparing this movie to a Tarantino film is inaccurate, however, this is better than Tarantino. Tarantino's films are mostly satirical. There is no satire in this movie.",

43,3 May 2015,BhagavathyPadmanabhan,10, Wildly Entertaining,"WOW!.Whew! Did I see a movie?. Or witness different real life incidents with exclusive inside preview of why these happened?.Yes and it was exquisitely done. Six Tales - referred in the Argentinean language as ""Savage Tales"" may not refer to the tale itself as savage. The plot itself is very simple - revenge (savage revenge!) - the sudden impulse to give or take back in equal or multiplied proportion what was done to them. Anybody can do that - not necessarily a poor man in the street but can be a ultra modern civilized being in a perfectly civilized and urban setting!!!. There you go. But to what extent people go to extract revenge in a sudden impulsive movement?. And that is intriguing and deeply introspective. David Edelstein a film critic mentioned about this movie - ""I'm guessing that the oldest subject in literature isn't love or war or the struggle for survival, but revenge."". This movie is about that and a thoroughly entertaining one at that. From the very first tale of the flight travel scene where everyone is shocked and surprised after gradually learning something till the last tale where the bride and bridegroom undergo the ""till death do us apart"" ceremony - it's a wild journey - edge of the seat engagement. My favorite Ricardo Darín as Simon the demolitions expert is a treat to watch.",

One of the best films I've seen in a while. Yes, it was nominated for for a foreign language Oscar but still, it's virtually unknown to the wider audience. Is it just a conspiracy to keep the tedious mediocre mainstream productions front and center or what? Anyway. Great film, highest recommendation.",
46,2 April 2015,themadmovieman,9, Shockingly violent and darkly hilarious,"This has to be one of the most shocking and blackest comedies of all time. It's basically not a comedy, although there are a lot of laughs, thanks to the insanely surreal situations that unfold here, as well as the ridiculously exaggerated violence that will make you laugh, but also shock you to the core. However, it's the thrilling stories throughout this film that will leave you breathless at every second, because it's just so unpredictable and so tense every step of the way.",
47,23 August 2014,tin257,10," ""All may lose control""","It's hard to review an unconventional movie, because this one is sort of six movies all in one. Relatos Salvajes (Wild Tales) is about six different and independent stories with one thing in common: the limit of our patience, or like it's tagline says...""All may lose control"". Ordinary people that find themselves in awkward situations they didn't look for, and that's the beauty of this movie. It's almost impossible not to feel identified with one of the characters, with one of their situations, despite the awkward moments they struggle that in some passages make us feel uncomfortable. And the merit of director Damián Szifrón is to tell those stories with an exquisite combination of intrigue, suspense and a remarkable and effective dark humor. The acting, editing, photography and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla are all ingredients that give extra points. You'll get out of the cinema talking to each other which tale you enjoyed the most and reviewing some of their hilarious scenes.",

Six outlandish stories are gathered together here, and each of them has a similar superior quality in terms of production values, cinematography, and acting.

51,6 April 2015,richardmarkham42,9, The absolute definition of black comedy,"Maybe I was just in the right mood after a frustrating, wasted day, but this wonderfully irreverent portmanteau movie hit the spot for me. In many ways it took me back to the days of Bunuel. The format means every story has to set its scene fast and be told with economy and unusually there is no weak link here. Most of the tales keep you guessing right to the end in a Twilight Zone kind of way, whilst you are being fed the best in cinematography and acting. There are several standout bravura performances, most notably from Ricardo Darin (also brilliant in ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" a few years ago) as a mild-mannered engineer driven to extreme measures and Erica Rivas, in the climactic section, as a bride who reacts badly to a setback at her wedding reception. If you are easily shocked, keep clear; otherwise, be prepared for a terrific ride. I already envy those who don't know what is coming next!",

Each one has it's own distinguishing characteristics; but the funniest is the final one, a story of the ultimate wedding from hell. There's nothing too weighty here, but the acting, direction and timing are impeccable throughout, and the stories seem well-grounded in Argentinian society, yet universal at the same time. Great fun!",

If you enjoy sharp social critiques about what drives us crazy in modern society, this is for you. There was also some not very subtle swipes at the upper classes and some commentary about how corruption is so normalized in Argentinian society. Despite being bleak, the movie was visually appealing and had a great soundtrack that did not overwhelm. You will find yourself laughing at some things you hope nobody else notices.",

We rail against the politicians who misgovern us, the bureaucrats we tangle with, or simply against a world that does not always support our desires. Most express their anger in socially acceptable ways, others do not. It is the others that are the subject of Argentine director Damián Szifrón's (On Probation) Wild Tales, six unrelated stories filled with dark humor, stylized violence, unhinged emotions, and unexpected twists in the Twilight Zone tradition, tales that reflect the insanity of contemporary existence.",
60,13 November 2016,sweetelands,9, Wonderfully entertaining with twists and unconventional style,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Went in blind not knowing what to expect. The movie centers around 6 separate scenes dealing with anger. They are all thoroughly engaging, making the viewer sit on the edge of their seat with anxious expectation of how it might end. Extremely clever and get to the real core of the key characters. You feel like you know this person or have met someone just like him/her. What stands out for this film is the intense emotion (without unnecessary drama), just real life expression of how the mundane can turn crazy. Often there is a twist or two hidden into each story which adds further delight to the story. Overall this movie is one I will certainly recommend to friends and continue to stay with me , especially the motor car story",

""Wild Tales"" (R, 2:02) is complete fiction, but is strange enough to compete with any truth you may have seen portrayed on film. Still, the word ""strange"" doesn't adequately describe the things that happen in this movie. ""Wild"" really is the best adjective for the film's content. The wildest part of the whole thing is that anything and everything portrayed on the screen could actually happen. In fact, some of it did. The film's opening scenes depict a scenario that is uncomfortably similar to an infamous real-life tragedy that took place in early 2015. ""Too soon,"" is the phrase I heard one woman whisper to her companion after the movie's opening sequence. It may seem that way, but this film was released in Argentina and shown at several film festivals around the world well before the tragedy to which I am referring. This just goes to show the plausibility, if not the truth, behind the stories in this film. Yes, that's ""stories"" – plural.",

Engaging throughout and entire film; well shot and performed with convivial dialogue. Thoroughly dramatic as well as humorous this film will keep you excited throughout, no doubt. An interesting blend of characters as well. To be able to create six funny, intense and ironic stories and combine them in one is really the work of a master director.

66,17 March 2015,vsks,9," What Happens When You Really, REALLY Lose It!","This 2015 Argentinian film, directed by Damián Szifron, is a collection of six unconnected short stories, with both comic and catastrophic elements and carrying the tagline ""we can all lose control."" The six very different stories describe ""how I would extract my revenge if only I had the nerve."" The excellent ensemble cast keeps the unexpected happening . . . as people go to the surreal brink of absurdity and tragedy—and keep going. They carry out the vengeful urges we all feel in moments of betrayal, in flashes of road rage, facing overwhelming temptation, or confronting mindless bureaucracy. The first very short tale involves a casual conversation between two airplane passengers, strangers to each other, who happen to discover they both know a would-be musician named G-- Pasternak. One is a woman who once broke up with him and the other, a classical music critic who savaged Pasternak's early work. A passenger sitting in front of them turns around, saying, ""Pasternak?"" She was his elementary school teacher, and says he certainly had problems. After a few more people who've wronged poor Pasternak pipe up, the music critic stands and asks, ""Is there anybody on this plane who does not know Pasternak? And who paid for their own ticket?"" There is not. I leave the rest to your imagination. And his. The funniest story involves an explosives expert trying to reason with the local parking authority, and one of the most satisfying has a bride take her revenge on the groom who cheated on her. It's a wedding no one will ever forget! Said Eric Kohn in indieWIRE, ""While adhering to an internal logic that makes each punchline land with a satisfying burst of glee, the movie nevertheless stems from genuine fury aimed a broken world."" Be sure to catch the opening credits, where the names of key cast and production crew members are shown with photos of wild animals reflecting on their personas. The director, I noted, was a fox. An Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film last year.",
67,21 November 2014,billion_mucks,7, ¿Main Course or Six Appetizers?,"There is much to praise about ""Relatos Salvajes"", and some in less extent to criticize. The positive in this episodic weaving of tales has most likely been said and repeated: stories are engrossing, ultimately effective in their message and of brutal pace and delivery. But what subtracts the movie of it's peak is the format. Granted, the format IS the movie; but we've seen coral stories work much better with the thematic cord weaving it into one common paste without abrupt cuts (Crash, Pulp Fiction). The division of short stories can be as rewarding as it is conflicting: some stories are better than others (which ones are subjective to the viewer, you). This results in a roller coaster in which one cannot settle comfortably. The better stories need more time and the worst ones have too much of it.",
68,18 January 2015,luissi,10, Highly Recommended: Wild Tales,"Wild Tales is the best film I have seen in a long time. The script is so clever and unique that is a must see for movies lovers. What is the border between tolerance and barbarism? We can all loose control in just one second even in the most ordinary situations. Action lovers will enjoy the ride more than romantic audiences since revenge is at the center of this master piece. In my opinion, this is the best Argentine Film in decades and a box office record in Latin America and Spain. Even Almodovar brothers are the producers the film has a unique style that is not crazy but real. Get ready for a different kind of movie that will take you out of your seat and even we shouldn't laugh about it ...well I can guarantee that you will. Clever mixed of comedy and drama that will make you think again and again and even change behaviors after you give it a thought.

They are very funny and even hilarious but also rather terrible and although splendid even impressive there are something that you almost wonder can get any worse. The first, even before the credits, is very short and relates the problem of a plane in the air. The second part is fun, but of because who may be of death and the next one rather longer segment of two in cars have an argument (I would certainly say). The next two of involving cars, one a bomb, a parking and another bomb and the other, possibly the least best but okay involving a boy's son and a hit and run with dreadful (but till funny) actions. The ending is possibly the finest section of the wedding reception that is extremely entertaining if not to say uproarious.",
73,28 February 2015,billcr12,8, Revenge is Sweet,"Wild Tales is just that, a six story anthology dealing with revenge. The first and shortest is my personal favorite, is fairly simple. A passenger on an airliner engages in a casual conversation with a man who turns out to be a classical movie critic. They discover that her ex boyfriend was a struggling musician who was ridiculed for his lack of talent by the critic. As the flight continues, as others overhear the first two talking, they all share a link to the failed musician. The ending is great; funny and sick at the same time. Story number two concerns a waitress at a diner who serves a customer who in the past has caused her much misery. He is a nasty politician and, oh boy, does she serve justice. Number three is universal to anyone who has driven a car, as I have, and suffered road rage. An arrogant jerk in a new Audi is driving down a road when he gets stuck behind an old car weaving back and forth. As he is finally able to pass, he curses out the other guy while giving him the finger. A flat tire puts him in a bad situation, as the other man catches up and does things that can't be described in a nice way. Again, a good ending. Short number four is another common theme, a man fighting city hall, in this case a tow truck which costs him both time and money. He fights a losing battle until he uses his expertise from his job to get even. Number five is different in that revenge is not the theme here. A young man comes home distraught at the fact that he has run over a pregnant woman and left the scene. The wealthy dad schemes to hide the accident by using his money and bribing several people. A lesson in greed is the moral. The final segment is a huge wedding party where the newlywed bride discovers that her husband has cheated on her with a guest at the reception. All hell breaks loose, and my least favorite ending. Overall, a good way to be amused for two hours and a 8/10.",

86,2 April 2015,oscaralbert,6, When does a film's self-fulfilling prophecy become a crime . . .,". . . on the part of the filmmakers, and what should the penalty be? It's clear that the German airline co-pilot who crashed his Airbus into the Alps on purpose this week probably saw WILD TALES first. It may well have been on a date the night he knocked up his friend with the job formerly called ""Stewardess."" You might say, ""So what, let people watch whatever flicks they feel like seeing."" But I say, now that we know that major airlines bend over backward to keep medicated psychotics in their cockpits, the world's movie-makers must not put graphic depictions of airliner suicide missions into these suggestible cabin crew members' heads. As I've written here before, Quantum Physics and String Theory tell us that ANY story shown on the Big Screen has an 83% chance of happening in Real Life later--usually within 12 months of international release. If nobody ever left the movie theater AFTER watching flicks such as WILD TALES, worrying about what's up there on the screen would be a moot point. But most people DO leave, and too many--such as the German suicide pilot--become Hell-bent upon integrating what they see in the multiplex into Real Life.

Szifron is brilliant as a narrator, the screenplay is excellent and for the most part very well acted. Dark, funny, cartoonish. The road rage episode owes a lot to McLaren's ""Neighbours"". Very original and striking, should be very successful. Szifron's strong suit is, I think, not so much the plotting but directing actors. Darín is, as usual, so good you do not notice he is acting. Rivas, in the last episode, as an angry Jewish bride is absolutely sublime. And the fat cook in ""The Rats"", the cafe episode (maybe the least successful but still good), with just one look lets you know that she is a danger to all things alive. Also, it is impossible not to identify with the characters and root for them...Great movie. Go watch it.",
90,22 April 2015,FilmCriticLalitRao,4, Wild tales : A good collection of crazy stories by Argentine director Damián Szifron !!!!,"Any viewer can have issues with a portmanteau film as there is no guarantee that all viewers are going to appreciate all the short stories depicted in a film. Wild tales is a good example of a portmanteau film with six tales which are more than merely being wild. These are the tales which are about situations which might have something in common with a lot of other countries and cultures. For example : everyday situations like corruption, traffic jams and road rage can be understood much better in Asian societies than some European countries. This is something which does not reduce the intrinsic nature of 'Relatos Salvajes' being an indigenous Argentine film. This is a positive quality about a film which has the ability to remain local while making attempts to make its presence felt on a global level. Most of this film's tales are based on the relationships shared by opposites which one finds in all societies namely rich versus poor, honest versus dishonest and strong versus weak. What is remarkable is that at least three stories have been able to deliver strong messages based on one of these opposites. This is the reason why 'wild tales' has fifty percent chances of being liked by viewers as its remaining three tales are not so powerful to impress viewers. Lastly, it is for an individual viewer to decide which three tales suit his/her tastes and personality.",

99,4 March 2015,Sergeant_Tibbs,8, Lives up to high expectations.,"The person going the most wild in Wild Tales is writer/director Damian Szifron. His vision is no holds barred as he explores six individual stories of rage going too far. They're surreal, heightened and mean-spirited, but they have a delicious dark sense of humour that speaks true to the ugly side of the human condition. Granted, the first couple are quite simplistic, but each story gets better and better as it goes along, growing in scale. All its brilliant contrivances are amusingly poetic, smirking with great dramatic ironies. But the stories aren't thought- provoking by living in isolation. They're deep rooted in class conflict and other oppressive factors of society. It speaks to a restless Argentina and Szifron's Wild Tales is incredible at bringing it to life. It does have a couple of clunky moments where his ambition is beyond his execution, but this all hints to his potential, and Wild Tales is a damn fine passion project for his resume already. ",

116,3 January 2016,luigibarlassina,9, A very entertaining movie that makes you smile intelligently,"The movie is a satire of modern Argentinian society that can easily be expanded to other countries. 6 very well acted and directed short stories have a common a desire of revenge against what they perceived, rightly or not, as a big or small injustice against them. All the episodes are an exaggeration of real life circumstances that all of us have been in (revenge against somebody who mistreated you, against a criminal, against the government's injustice, against the arrogance of some individuals and against a disrespectful partner). The dark hyperbole that permeates all the short stories gives the movie a very tragicomic vibe. 1) Acting: very well acted throughout, with a top notch performance by Ricardo Darin and Erica Rivas. 2) Directing: very entertaining and fluid, especially in the last short story. 3) Screenplay: short dark stories are not new in the Latin cinema, especially in the tradition of Italian movies in 60s-70s (""I mostri"", ""ieri, oggi e domani"", ""I nuovi mostri""). However, even if the formula lacks of originality, the short stories are engaging in their plot and they are very well built and concluded in the time allocated 4) Quit fitting especially in the episode of the ""road tale"" and memorable is the ""titanium"" opening in the last short story. 4) Overall: a very entertaining movie that makes you smile intelligently",
117,16 December 2018,vivianwu-32929,10, An absurdly crazy film,"How should I begin to talk about this delicious Argentinian film without spoiling all it has promised? Wild Tales is a black-comedy anthology film consisting of six distinctive stories directed by Damian Szifron with one consistent theme: revenge. In the 21st Century, most people live begrudgingly having to repress themselves, but some do explode. And this is the film about those that explode.
The film begins with ""Pasternak"", a shocking start to a two-hour roller coaster ride. The beautiful runway model, briskly boards a plane with the ticket fully paid by her company. She walked right into a surprising reunion. It seems that everyone on the plane knows her ex-boyfriend, Pasternak. More than 30 000 in the air, what could they do?
The next tale takes us deeper into the joy of vengeance. ""The Rats"" sets in a small diner on a rainy night. The waitress recognized the new customer to be the loan shark that destroyed her family. And he is now running for mayor! Back at the kitchen, she is content to just repress her anger, however, the old cook has other ideas. Why should ""bastards run the world?""
The ""Road to Hell"" pushes the film to a climax. A case of road rage between the rich Audi driver and a redneck driver of a slow-moving truck. This part contains absurd violence.
""Bombita"" tells the demolition engineer's misfortunes that has started when his car keeps getting towed from the streets where there isn't a yellow line. His struggle to fight the corrupt towing company was fruitless. He'll have to use his own knowledge as a tool of redemption.
However funny the previous tales were, no one would be laughing in the ""The Deal."" A rich couple woke up to find their pampered son shaking from the hit-and-run in which he was the driver. They try to get the gardener to take the fall for a hefty sum. The justice isn't served in this ugly tale.
The last tale, ""Till Death Do Us Apart"", is absolutely brilliant finish to the film. It is startling, but also the most glorious of all. Set at a lavish wedding, the deliriously happy bride Romina, with her husband Ariel, celebrates with a hall full of family and friends. Until Romina discovered that Ariel has cheated on her - then all hell broke down.
Any of these short tales could have been shot separately and would each be brilliant short movies. But together, a brilliant movie was created. I do urge you to watch this absurdly crazy film.",

You don't need to know anything other than that if even that when going to see this film. Throughout the film there's 6 very clever stories that unfold in a brilliant and darkly comical way. If your a fan of dark comedies then I highly recommend this one to you, I for one love dark comedies and I found myself laughing out loud at a couple times. One of my favorite parts was the beginning because it perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film, I also like it because of how quick it sets itself up.

Here the links between each tale are subtle genius and as a whole it plays beautifully. Also rare is how well the dark comedy translates from a non English language culture, so universal are the human emotions on display. A perfect blend of drama and pathos across the board. I'll definitely be watching this again and recommending it to people for many years. Well directed, written and acted. Each scenario far fetched yet thoroughly believable. A strong 8/10.",

124,13 January 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A dish best served cold.,"'Wild Tales (2014)' is an anthology of six entirely separate short stories, which are only connected by their loose themes of revenge. Each film is longer than the last and, generally speaking, more chaotic, too. They're separated from their peers only by a few frames of darkness, leading to surprisingly cohesive overall affair. Of course, the movie as a whole doesn't really have an arc to it and, as such, it isn't a hugely affecting experience in retrospect. However, it's incredibly engaging in the moment. It's an enjoyable time throughout, with each of its stories being of a similar quality. They're an odd mixture of societal unrest, melodramatic drama and unflinching violence, usually escalating to unpredictable extremes with blackly comic undertones. Their cinematography is fantastic, too. It's hard to separate them, in a way, but they're also decidedly distinct from one another. The overall film truly is just a compilation of them. That, obviously, isn't a bad thing. Though it doesn't really have a lasting impact, the movie is a unique, well-made and entertaining affair right from its opening moments. 7/10",

It did not win, but the very fact that it made it to the prestigious Final Five ensured broader success and world-wide distribution. Some may say that the film was conceived with an eye to the Oscars and festivals circuit, written in a manner that takes much from Almodovar, adds a touch of Tarantino and includes just the needed elements of local color and the gallery of fine actors to allow it to win almost all possible awards in Argentina. Almodovar actually co-produced the film, and his influence is hard to contest (I do not know how much he was involved in the making though). Yet, the wild tales brought to screen by director Damián Szifrón in this film have a quality of their own, a specific grin superposed upon the human approach and the social engagement that characterizes the best South-American films, whatever genre they belong to.",

And mind you, all these are situations that may occur to any of us which is what makes this movie even more interesting. There where places where i felt guilty about laughing but we always laugh at Tom & Jerry which is an entire show where a cat tries to murder a mouse. So i guess i felt guilty here because the characters felt so close and relatable . They say that deep down, people find violence fun and the makers of the movie have fully exploited this innate quality that we all possess.

If the film ended after just story 1, I would have gotten my money's worth. That's how great this movie is!

It starts off with a fantastically strange tale in an aeroplane that sets the tone. From there, the short films get longer and more varied. The second tale is a dark moral dilemma showing the plight and power of everyday people. The third tale is the funniest one, showing road rage gone wrong. The fourth tale is my favourite, a realistic tale of an engineer getting back at an abusive towing company. The fifth tale shows a troubling tale of corruption among the rich and famous. The sixth and final tale was too insane for me and seemed contrived, which was a let down. Ultimately, a theme of intense revenge pervades all of these tales which expresses itself in a different way.",

It is an anthology consisting of six individual pieces themed on rage and revenge. Anthologies, in general, are helmed by two or more directors who contribute individual pieces to the final movie and by this very structure, there is a loss of congruence among the individual pieces. However, Wild Tales, is a rare exception to the aforesaid pitfall as Damián Szifron, who has written and directed each of the six shorts, strikes a fine balance among them and has pruned off almost all flab from the proceedings which engross the viewer in their taut storylines.",

141,21 February 2017,sol-,7, Savages,"'Relatos Salvajes' - or 'Wild Tales' as it is better known - this Argentinean film spins six stories showcasing how wild human beings can become when stressed and vengeful. Best described as a dark comedy, the events at hand often seem outrageous until one realises just how tense the characters are, and all the tales other than the fifth one deliver laughs in the face of tragedy and misfortune. The initial sequence with a 'Twilight Zone' air is by far the best chapter and yet it is sadly over before the end credits roll. The last two stories also run too long, exhausting their premises quickly. The scattered memorable bits and pieces of 'Wild Tales' are, however, endlessly powerful. As mentioned, the first tale is the best with a mysterious plane flight. A follow-up tale in which a waitress cannot decide whether to poison a gangster's food is equally intense and a third sequence with two deserted highway drivers has the biggest laughs. The fourth tale involves bureaucracy gone mad and features the most relatable protagonist. The fifth sequence involving a covered-up hit-and-run is the weakest, lacking the comedic air of the earlier segments, and while comedy comes back in full force for the sixth tale of a wedding gone awry, the chapter is a little on the long side. If hardly perfect, 'Wild Tales' is well worth watching. The quality of the tales vary, but they overlap magnificently well thematically, and per as the opening credits over wild animals, the film intelligently explores how we all have the capacity to release our inner animal instincts in the perfect storm of circumstances.",

153,8 July 2015,Seraphion,8, Wild and crazy roller coaster ride,"The movie consists of six different pieces, each with its own strong and unique story. One common thing in all the stories is that they'll blow your mind away. I really like how the script of each story plays on the flow and duration as to avoid the viewer's anticipation rate ruining the build-up. The first story is quite quick though it builds up slowly and then rapidly escalated into suspense. The second and third stories followed almost the same formula although the duration gets longer each time the movie changes its story. But the last three stories are made to use more duration and are more intricate than the earlier ones. Yet they still possess the same unpredictability level, which is very nice. The story gets predictable only at the very last moment, and even that kind of predictability can only be seen by experienced movie goers. And yet the movie closes itself with a totally different ending for its last story. The acting overall is a great job, but moreover the directing job is of a high level of mastery.",

It's crisply and cleanly shot throughout, and the filmmaker shows a rare feel for how to not only make comedy land, but also to make it actually feel cinematic too. Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Argentine writer-director Damián Szifron allows it to sit until it congeals in the dreary six-part anthology Wild Tales.",

This reminded me of that Italian movie,HUMAN CAPITOL, also about a 2nd degree vehicular manslaughter hit-and-run case. I like the way Almodovar places a 'throw-away' episode first( only about 6-8 minutes long?),which shows a woman passenger about to embark on a routine flight(south America?)from Spain(Barcelona?),& soon engages in conversation w/ the other passengers, only to find out that they are all talking about a loser they once encountered,Gabriel Pasternak,who, shockingly is actually on board as well!The estranged male stewardess locks himself in the cockpit(overpowers the crew?) & proceeds to 'throw away' the entire 150 passengers on board,as the plane falls to its doom in a Argentinian suburb(?).THe episode closes w/ the shocking sight of a plane crashing into a elderly couple's backyard swimming pool,& then the film credits begin,WILD TALES...( this short episode recaps,or should I say prophesizes the later horrible GermanWings flight 9525, where Pasternak is replaced by the real life co-pilot,Andre Lubitz who threw away 150 passengers by flying plane into side of a mountain.

As I'd not heard of the film before, I stayed till the end, but I'll be pleased when the current fashion for nihilism dies a death and we can move on. When revenge and misery can be celebrated as enthusiastically as this film's popularity would seem to indicate, it doesn't bode well for society as a whole.

In one film, the waitress in a smalltime restaurant contemplates spiking a politician's french-fries with rat poison, because she knows he is a masquerading gangster. In another, a demolition expert detonates a car park because he is angry with the city's extortionist parking system. Yet another film portrays macabre road rage on a spectacular road winding through the desert. And the final showpiece among the six is a black comedy triggered off by the bride discovering her soon to be husband's infidelity. Other than insane impulsive rage, there is no common theme bundling the six films together. They expose a flaw in the way our brains are wired and the dangerously thin line that seems to separate sanity from insanity. Many of us would recollect similar situations from our personal experience, when we managed to pull back from the brink. The characters in the film's six stories are not so successful and the consequence is destruction and death, which we relish vicariously. A hint of redemption is offered as a ray of hope in the last narration. This oddball of a film chokes us with laughter and therein lies our salvation.",

Most delicious of all, however, is the laughable irony that underlies all of the tales. From beginning to end, some of the characters think reason will save the day, but it never does. Instead, even in the cases in which the consequences are as severe as can possibly be imagined, violent and uncontrolled passion has its rewards. Rarely does one see such a defense of emotions at the expense of reason, but ""Wild Tales"" makes us feel, and perhaps even reasonably conclude, that passion, whatever its dangers, is a vital part of human existence.",

Now, about this film. It's different from what you normally see, because this isn't the typical narrative/3 ACT structured movie we all usually see. It's comprised of 6 short films all with the same themes of vengeance and violence. Very dark humor, for the most part, other than mainly one story that was pretty serious throughout.

Time will fly and eyes will grow, jaw will drop, and tears will flow. This movie has achieved for me something only a true Greek drama can. It has borough catharsis back to the cinema, but in a really funny and a really clever way, and with the benefit of repeating it 6 times over. Why is there no more movies like this ??? I presume, because it's such a f... hard thing to do. Watch this movie. You will regret it only if it's your 13'th time. Maybe not even then :)",

254,27 July 2015,noname0302-767-262110,9, Tales from the crypt lives again,"The very dark humour, the irony, the chaos, even the length of the stories. Everything point to one thing: Tales from the crypt. The only difference is that here, we don't have any supernatural. Also, in Tales FTC, usually someone or everyone has to die. Its a rule of somewhat. Here, its not necessary. Sometimes people die, other times they don't. Completely unpredictable. My favourite stories are the first one(most creative one) and the last one(at a wedding we all want everything to go perfectly. What happens when nothing does?). Some stories are on the level of a mediocre TFTC episode, but most are very good. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes dark humour. ",

Enjoyable, interesting and ''wild'' short stories with ups and downs from one to another. My favourite ones are the first one ''Gabriel Pasternak'' and the road fight between the ''Audi guy'' and the ''Redneck''. Overall a fun movie to watch, totally recommended. 8/10",
259,11 December 2016,danagrilo,10, Relatos Salvages-Wild Tales a Master piece,"Wild Tales is the result of combining the best Argentinean director and cast. The film is portrait as a series of short tales that describe human nature in a crude, yet accurate and entertaining way. Each tale has its own set of actors with dramas and tales that disembody in the lost character's senses and control. Is a black humor, that may be difficult to understand for some foreigners. I haven't seen the version in English, but I'm guessing the translation is accurate, if by any chance you understand Spanish, I will highly recommend watching it in the original language. If you are not accustomed to Argentinean Spanish then it will be a good idea to use subtitles, because some verb's configuration are different.",
260,30 July 2015,yuri-feldman,9, Excellent,"Split into 6 short (~20 minute) stories, perhaps challenging the common notion of a movie in a dense modern style of short and fast, spans all that cinema has to offer really (hence classified as a comedy, drama and a thriller at the same time): those who look for easy entertainment will find a roller coaster of emotions, which can also be interpreted as grotesque humor. Those who want to dig a bit deeper might find a much finer line of humor tinged with sometimes bitter auto-criticism of the individual and the society (Pasternak, The Strongest, Rats, The Proposal), but above all - (deep buried) optimism and celebration and joy of living (Bombita, Wedding). For those who wish to take the most of this movie I'd suggest coming in a good condition to concentrate, and setting aside a couple of hours after the movie to reflect and discuss.",

Outside the American circuit, Argentinian movies are a good option for no boring movies and they have excellent actors.",
266,15 July 2015,walker-rise,9, Six really great short films packaged together with the common theme of revenge!,"This film is from Argentina and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. I am usually not a huge fan of Foreign Films, but this one is actually really good. The movie is essentially six short films played back to back, all with the common themes of revenge and distress. The fact that the stories are only connected by their theme would normally have annoyed me, but the stories are extremely good. After each story the viewer is not only enthralled by the climax, but is eager in anticipation for the next one. You find yourself asking how can the next one possibly top the previous, but it always does. The stories get longer and more detailed as they go along, which allows the viewer to get much more involved with much increased character development coming in the later ones. ",

276,6 November 2017,jesszewczyk,9, Revenge and comedy rule this movie.,"""Wild Tales"" (Relatos Salvajes in the original) is by far, one of my favorite movies. The six combined stories that compose this amazing cinematic experience - ""Pasternak"" (Pasternak), ""The Rats"" (Las Ratas), ""The Strongest"" (El más Fuerte), ""Little Bomb"" (Bombita), ""The Proposal"" (La Propuesta) and ""Till Death Do Us Apart"" (Hasta que la Muerte nos separe) - , bring to life our deepest desires and craziest reactions when faced with typical everyday life situations. It also makes us wonder how the little acts and decisions can easily make things fall apart in a matter of seconds. Although all the short stories were written by the same person (Damián Szifron), they were directed and produced by different people, which gives this movie a particularity not commonly found in the movie industry.
