0,7 February 2004,Quinoa1984,10," an incredible directorial vision, and a devastating lead in Falconetti, make this one of the greatest achievements in all celluloid","Carl Th. Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release, it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.",/
1,2 August 2005,nycritic,10, When Film Becomes Transcendental Art.,"It so often happens that some films take the long way to achieve their status of classics and worthy of being studied, frame by frame, by movie lovers who believe in the power of raw performance and skilled direction of cameras to depict a powerful visual set of images. When one sees films like VERTIGO which barely registered with movie-going audiences at the time of their release but after restoration went on to become one of the best films of the last century, it only shows that film, as an art, doesn't need a golden statuette to have merit, and when it's done exceptionally well, it can be seen in any context and any time period beyond its release date and will still hold its audience in awe.",r
2,11 May 2020,Xstal,10, Overwhelming Masterpiece...,"I'm not sure what's more overwhelming in this film: the incredible cinematography, the phenomenal acting, the stupendous soundtrack, the fact it was made in 1928 and has stood the test of time so well or the despicable, unspeakable, hideous evil perpetrated by those in authority in the name of?",e

4,27 December 2004,GulyJimson,10, When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror.,"What can one say about this work of art that has not been said many times before by those far better qualified to explain both it's importance and place as cinema and art? I shall not comment on the greatness of the film's technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer's direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d' Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person. Transcendent because it evokes emotions and thoughts that I cannot wholly account for, or adequately explain.",i
5,10 August 2014,evanston_dad,9, One of the Most Formally Striking Movies I've Ever Seen,"Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is a film that feels light years ahead of its time. Lean and mean, focusing its entire narrative on the interrogation of Joan that inevitably lead to her execution by burning at the stake, the film is kinetic in ways that most films even now aren't. Composed almost completely of tight close ups, Dreyer and crew cut rapidly between disconcerting, asymmetrical shots, giving the film a breathless, anxious, nearly frenzied pace.",e
6,1 March 2005,looneyfarm,10, Devastating but brilliant masterpiece,"It's easy to overlook this movie. For modern audience and especially my generation (I'm 21), this movie is just close-ups of a crying woman and grumpy old men. But of course that's like saying Mona Lisa is just a picture of a woman, or The Last Supper is dudes eating. If you experience it with open mind, The Passion of Joan of Arc will give you one of the most profound visions of devotion, faith and martyrdom.",w
7,16 September 1999,judokid,10, timeless in every sense,"I saw this a few months ago on the big screen, just after Nosferatu, another silent classic. Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didnÂ´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.",/
8,11 March 1999,zeph-3,10, Falconetti's face is sublimely human,"I saw this film for the very first time last week and was so tremendously captivated by it that I needed to share this rapture. The innovative camera-angles, the close-ups revealing pain and spirituality. It elevates the human condition and the Art of film. I would love to be able to go on into the whys or hows or technicalities. But my words couldn't do the film justice for the imagery still overwhelms me.",r
9,20 June 2018,ferguson-6,8, silent masterpiece,"Oak Cliff Film Festival 2018
Greetings again from the darkness. It's a rare treat to watch a 90 year old silent movie. Especially in a remastered format. Especially on the big screen. Especially at a historic theatre. Especially with a nearly packed house. And especially with a live score! The 7th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival, held at the Texas Theatre (opened 1931), afforded just such a treat with its Friday evening screening.",w
10,2 December 2015,StevePulaski,9, A film so heartbreakingly realistic and brutally honest it might even bring tears to your eyes,"Part of what makes The Passion of Joan of Arc so bold and unflinching, for its time and its current state in cinema, is, much like its titular subject, how battered, beaten, and kicked around it has been in order to get where it is today. This is a film that, from its very inception, was a controversial subject that clerical authorities didn't want to be seen by a wide audience, for its portrayal of religion and politics. Nonetheless, writer/director Carl Theodor Dreyer pushed forward in a direction for a film on Joan of Arc that detailed the gap between religion and politics, in addition to insights into the complex of the fragile male ego that boasts assimilation and manipulation. After the completed and finalized print was lost in a fire, it was doubtful that a print even close to the original would ever resurface until one was discovered in a mental institution in Oslo, Norway in the 1980's. After some cleaning up and polish was added, the film was restored into an eighty-one minute cut, which is said to be very close to the original film's length and structure.",7
11,21 May 2004,edantes2000,10, Falconetti is amazing!,"A certain amount of credit must surely be paid to the director for the genius of 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.' The daring camera angles, use of incessant close-ups and peculiar authenticity all may be attributed to Carl Th. Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form of brilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer's gift to us of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should be acknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by the silent medium in which she worked, Falconetti's mere tilt of the head or gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak in Jeanne's native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguish which the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we are watching what the director said he had found; the martyr's reincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet the fact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet can not help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' and with each of many tears and inaudible sighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee Maria Falconetti's Jeanne.",8
12,12 April 2022,Wistfull,7, A milestone in film history,"Technically interesting, but lacking in storyline - they could have built the tension much better, I think. Maybe it would work better if I cared about religion. Also the recently invented close-ups were taken a bit too far, as it was difficult to tell who was who with all the monk men looking so similar.",6
13,15 November 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""You can claim that I am sent by the devil..., it's not true...""","When the list of IMDb's top films include multiple titles given to animated features and a fair share of movies that are just downright goofy (""Life of Brian"", ""Groundhog Day""), it's reassuring to find a gem in the mix like ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". Originally released as a completely silent film, I opted to watch it with the accompaniment of the 'Voices of Light' soundtrack, which renders the story in a much more spiritual manner.",9

15,31 December 2022,AlsExGal,10, Made me rethink what silent cinema could be,"This silent French drama from writer-director Carl Theodor Dreyer depicts the trial and subsequent execution of Joan of Arc, the 15th century warrior and religious icon. Her trial is fraught with political intrigue and the outcome is virtually preordained, yet she transcends her grim future and achieves spiritual grace. It stars Maria Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, Andre Berley, Maurice Schutz, Antonin Artaud, and Michel Simon.",3
16,30 November 2018,elo-equipamentos,9, The real history in every lines!!!,"As Carl T. Dreyer said the whole picture was made under old manuscript that was found in France, so Dreyer makes a detailed planning over it, even the sets were builded over some pictures as states in this files, Dryer also used a white color to suggest a Joan's pureness, l had many movies from Joan of Arc, this apart to be a silent movie was stunningly made by the old master, a remarkable performance of Maria Falconetti was another highlight, a timeless movie suitable for both kind of people as study process for believers and materialist, a true gem to mankind!!!",1
17,8 June 2018,gbill-74877,8, Watch it for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance,"Director Carl Theodor Dreyer created a unique experience with this film, employing low camera angles, unique editing, and a ton of tight shots on his actors to get an intensity of emotion from them, Maria Falconetti (as Jeanne d'Arc) in particular. The story focuses on just her trial and execution, which has the advantage that it makes the film taut and Kafkaesque, but the disadvantage that additional context would have told a richer story. Do we really see Jeanne d'Arc here? I'm not so sure, historical transcript notwithstanding, though I did find it fascinating that she refused to change out of her men's clothing. While performances are strong and the film is ahead of its time, the content is dark, and not particularly uplifting, especially if you're a non-believer. There is of course a universal theme in a righteous person standing up to persecution - being mocked, threatened, and tortured - but at the end of the day, it's simple Jeanne, believing she was sent by God, standing up against the established clergy, who, threatened by her assertions, believe she was sent by the Devil. The film never ponders whether both may be deluded, and concludes with her soul being protected by the flames as it rises to heaven. Watch this one for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance.",/
18,25 May 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, A contender for THE movie of the 1920s,"As much as I did love Metropolis, The Gold Rush and Faust(1926), The Passion of Joan of Arc is a contender for the movie of the 1920s, that's how amazing it is. It is an incredibly well made film, it draws on artistic styles from the Renaissance through to the avant-garde and with all the symbolic angles, zooms, tilts and pan shoots the photography is spellbinding and captures the authentic costumes, sets and scenery wonderfully.",?
19,6 April 2010,planktonrules,8, Brilliantly filmed but with an odd performance by Joan.,"""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" is probably the most famous work of Danish film maker Carl Theodor Dreyer. Unlike the typical biographical film, this one is based completely on the court proceedings in the trial of Joan--not some fictional or semi-fictional story written in 1928. This is pretty wild, as many historical films view truth as very flexible--with the real emphasis being on entertainment. If this means inventing characters or changing history--so be it! But, fortunately, not in this film! It's a history teacher's delight! When the film began, I sure was bowled over by the powerful soundtrack filled with Latin liturgical singing. While annoying normally, here with the intensity of the film and the subject matter is managed to work. In addition, the film is an artistic piece due to the director Dreyer's artistic vision. First, his choices of actors was truly amazing--as he chose some of the most amazing faces I've seen in a film--such character, such intensity and such acting from these people is truly amazing. Plus the camera pulls so much from the actors due to fantastic lighting and clarity of focus--you can even very clearly see the pores on many of the actor's faces! Second, unlike almost all other silent films and even sound ones, this one makes great use of closeups and inventive camera angles to heighten the intensity of the action as well as the impact on the audience. The result is a film that hits you in the face--hard, forceful and impossible to ignore. Especially strong in its impact is the execution itself--Dreyer chose to make incredibly vivid (so much so, some might find it very disturbing).",r
20,5 January 2023,arthur_tafero,10, Finest Silent Film of All Time - The Passion of Joan of Arc,"Renee Maria Falconetti would have easily won the award for Best Actress for that year, had the Oscars existed during this filming. This film would have been outstanding in any era, and her performance would have award-winning in any era as well. The cinematography is outstanding, and the close-ups are gut-wrenching, at times, for their emotional impact. The story of a young woman who saves France, and is then persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church is a well-known historical tale, but this film concentrates on her trial, not on her great accomplishments. And therein lies the great drama; how could anyone find fault with this saint? (and she was a saint in every respect). The film shows the heinous attitude of the church toward women and those they could not micromanage. A cinematic event.",e
21,4 June 2012,billcr12,8, Haunting Portrayal,"A fairly well known religious story, French director Carl Theodor Dreyer made The Passion of Joan of Arc in 1928. Because it is silent and in black and white, facial expressions via frequent close ups must convey the sincerity of the subject. Whether she was insane and delusional or was actually hearing the voice of God is up to the viewer to decide. I have to separate my personal views as a retired Catholic from my review. ",f

23,14 December 2005,EUyeshima,10, The Legendary Falconetti Anchors Dreyer Silent Classic,"I was completely floored when I first saw this movie in the basement of the San Jose Main Library sometime in the early seventies. The mesmerizing performance of Maria (RenÃ©e) Falconetti, filmed primarily as a series of brutalizing close-ups, is still the main reason to revisit Carl Theodor Dreyer's austere and claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. There is little provided in the way of background or context, as Dreyer made an intentional decision to use the original trial records as the basis of his dialogue. Using a minimum of sets, almost abstract in orientation, he uses the camera frame as his canvas by showing the bullying interrogation of Joan by her inquisitors in a series of face shots against a white backdrop. The actors had to use their make-up-free faces as their sole means of expression. There are never any establishing shots, so the viewer never knows where the characters are in relationship to each other. Instead, Dreyer uses dramatic camera angles to convey people's position in the story. As the film builds to its climax, graphic footage of Joan being burned at the stake alternates with sequences of angry French peasants being brutally driven out of Rouen Castle by club-wielding English soldiers. Many of the shots feel abstract and out of proportion to convey a world turned upside down.",=
24,3 January 1999,Huron,10, The greatest performance ever by an actress!,Dreyer's masterpiece is also Falconetti's masterpiece and the most powerful film role by any woman ever. Critics have said it for years and anyone who sees the film will know why. See it and it will remain with you forever. I saw it over thirty years ago and have never seen another actress come close to this role.,t
25,5 May 2017,Theflyace,10, Transcends all Generations,"Roger Ebert once said that ""to see Falconetti in Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is to look into eyes that will never leave you."" I cannot find a better statement for this miracle of a silent masterpiece. What has been mastered here is a view, taken from historical record, and put under a microscope figuratively and literally on screen to dive into the spiritual essence of destiny. This film is in a class by itself, and had a profound impact on this viewer.",t
26,9 March 2022,brogmiller,10, An inquisition of the soul.,"It is to be regretted that owing to defective equipment Carl Dreyer was unable to realise his film with sound as originally intended and that by the time the uncut version was finally released talking pictures were all the rage which meant that his masterpiece was consigned to the relative oblivion of art houses. Critics early recognised its qualities however and over ninety years on it remains an immensely powerful and mesmerising work which is difficult to define. Cocteau describes it as well as anyone by saying that ""it seems like an historical document from an era in which the cinema didn't exist.""",_

29,30 March 2007,Igenlode Wordsmith,7, Neither tedious nor a masterpiece,"I've heard that this film is notoriously unwatchable; I've heard that it is one of the greatest moving pictures of all time. Given my negative experience of other 'great experimental' classics -- ""Napoleon"", ""Metropolis"", ""Greed"" -- I had a suspicion that my own reaction might lie on the former end of the scale: but when the chance to see it presented itself, I felt I ought to take the opportunity. To further my cinematic education, if nothing else.",v
30,30 May 2005,cherold,7, over-rated but interesting,"It is often said that Maria Falconetti gave the greatest performance in the history of film acting in this movie. That's nonsense. First off, I don't believe anyone can be said to be the single best artist in any pursuit. Shakespeare is not really the greatest playwright to ever live. But now that people keep saying he's the greatest playwright ever no one has the nerve to suggest perhaps he's just one of many brilliant playwrights.",
31,26 December 1999,JohnSeal,10, A silent masterpiece,"I would be hardpressed to exclude this film from a list of the ten greatest films of all time. Every remaining frame of this once heavily censored film is perfect, and there are many shocking scenes of torture which are hard to watch even today.

It is of course in black and white. But the camera still catches a rather circular image with shades in the corners. But the shooting and the acting, the editing and the text are first class.",
33,20 June 2005,Galina_movie_fan,10, The passion of Joan of Arc - The face of Renee Maria Falconetti,"""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928) by Carl Theodor Dreyer is simply one of the greatest films ever - silent or no silent and what considered by many critics, the greatest performance by any actress on the screen. Renee Maria Falconetti, a French stage performer, was persuaded by Dreyer to play the Maid of Orleans even though she had no film experience. From her very first shot, we can understand what a visionary Dreyer was. The director asked the actress to crop her hair and to strip her face of any makeup. Filmed mostly in close-up, the agonized face of Falconetti's Jean, free of all cosmetic artifice, appears more moving and human, and expresses so many emotions that it literally stays in a viewer's soul.",
34,7 July 2000,peangel,10, Don't miss this movie!,"This is the most fabulous movie I have ever seen.I like old and silent movies, but I was completely blown away with this movie. It is unlike any that you have ever seen.Joan's acting is the BEST I have ever seen. It is so superior to anything being made today. One does not need special effects and computers  to make a great movie.And if any movie deserves that title this one does.I couldn't praise it enough. The direction and camera work is perfection. The way it is filmed with mostly head shots and faces you would think it would be boring.But it is the most alive movie I have ever seen and probably ever made.You cannot take your eyes off of Joan. She is mesmerizing.",
35,21 April 2019,pere-25366,9, Falconetti's breathtaking performance is undoubtedly one of the greatest the silver screen has ever seen," is simply outstanding in this film; playing the eponymous character who claims she has seen and been sent by God, she delivers a transcendental performance that is overwhelmingly raw and visceral. Shot predominantly in close-ups, the tight framing restricts us to narrowly focus in on her state of fear and immerse us right into the emotional turmoil through which she is suffering. POV shots of the French clergyman ingeniously add to this effect as we experience the fear of the dire circumstances through Joan's eyes. And the fact that Falconetti never acted again only adds to the eeriness of her performance. With cinematography that was way ahead of its time and an incredible score to boot, this is simply a masterpiece of cinema. Far and away one of the greatest silent films ever conceived.",
36,26 January 2010,Hitchcoc,10, Masterful Photography!,"Starting with Eisenstein's ""Ivan the Terrible,"" I began to be comfortable with these early films and their incredible focus on faces. This is like an 80 minute slide show, using some of the most wonderful expressiveness I have ever seen. I know this could be boring to some, but even in shots that seem repetitious, there are subtle differences that express the absolute summit of emotion. This story has been done so many times and it usually falls on the hopes of the character to express, usually in words, faith. Here Joan is so human and yet so saintly. She is devoted to her faith but also afraid. We need to remember that this person came from humble beginnings, unable to even read. Perhaps she was delusional. Personally, I have trouble with any of this, but she certainly could not be more heroic. When she recants her confession, she does so in the shadow of the stake. I was intrigued by the soldiers and the villagers at the end. Did this really happen? I don't recall this in other treatments though I may have forgotten. It is also wonderful that this film was restored. It is crisp and bright and needs to be to show every wrinkle of its characters.",
37,16 October 2002,Dockelektro,10, Overwhelming,"Strikingly beautiful, the movie delivers even if you see without any sound. Surprisingly simple (only a few scenes, most of the movie is made of close-ups and shot indoors) it has nevertheless the characteristic that elevates a director to the height of myth. And here the screaming yet peaceful expression of Maria Falconetti is pivotal - she conveys all the emotions that the viewer feels, and therefore nearly expenses the need of other characters in the picture. Magnificently shot, amazingly acted, this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, that has the power to make you really develop feelings towards it. Unmissable.",
38,8 July 2022,sudhakaranakhilan,8, A French classic,"While I read some of the books related to world cinema I was just stuck on one name because of the pronunciation of it. That name is Carl Theodor Dryer and it was quite alien to me because I was just introduced to world cinemas at that time. When checking his filmography The Passion of Joan of Arc stood at the top position and it is surely a classical work. The film is a silent one, just passed a year since the first talkie enter the cinematic field (The Jazz Singer) but this film has its soul in it. Dryer adapted the story from the transcript of Joan of Arc and he just fits it into the story which has cinematic appeal. The movie is like a congested one in the sense it has a lot of close-up shots which are repetitive in the course of the movie's progression. Dryer framed up the characters in particular spaces without any movement for them and did their performance within that space. The film starts with the trial of Joan by the church and then it shifts to the crucifixion or burnt up of her (in another way from the Passion of Christ). In the end, the movie changes its track and goes into a speedy mood. This is a worth classic and good study material for those who dreamt about cinemas.",
39,20 November 2007,Boba_Fett1138,8," The trial of Jeanne d'Arc, very close up.","when you think of a Jeanne d'Arc movie, you don't expect to see a movie based purely- and focusing just on the trial of Jeanne d'Arc. considering the entire life-story of Jeanne d'Arc, it just doesn't seem like the most likely and interesting thing to focus on. It however of course works well for a more deep, serious and realistic approach and or course also in an original way of retelling the story of Jeanne d'Arc. So don't expect to see a strong heroic female lead but a betrayed, broken, emotional one instead.",
40,1 December 2019,barisayhan,10, Epic and Impressive!,"I think this film is one of the most impressive films of silent cinema. The actress, who played the role of ""Jeanne d'Arc"", performed at a high level. Although the film is silent, the orchestral music playing in the background increases the power of the film. One of the main points that make the film legend is the use of a camera. Close-up is often preferred. These close-up scenes are like a cinema course. The camera angles used in the film are very brave and the reference point for someone who will learn the camera angles today. It was the right choice to tell not the whole life of her, just a small part of her life. It is impossible for even a stranger like me to be impressed while watching this film about a French and Christian cultural figure like Jeanne d'Arc. For those of you who don't know, I suggest you find out who Jeanne d'Arc is before you watch the film.",

One of the greatest silent films ever made and among the greatest films of all time. Moving, unforgettable, and Maria Falconetti is mesmerizing. She is incredible, and lights up the screen in every frame. This is a must see film for anyone seriously interested in film and film history. Visually it is a remarkable achievement, especially the frequent close ups. Well edited and a film that is not easily forgotten, thanks to the extraordinary vision of director Carl Theodor Dreyer. He has created a cinematic piece of art.",
44,7 February 2006,KingM21,10, ...and hope and faith...,"This silent masterpiece, based off historical records, reveals the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. It was wonderfully acted, with Maria Falconetti giving a particularly moving performance as the lead. And director Carl Theodor Dreyer really captures the detailed expressions and emotions of all the actors through a constant use of close-ups, which also added to the sense of distress and torment, and hope and faith, this picture intended to convey. The film is also quite stylish, with sharp editing, reverse camera angles, quick montages, and multiple instances of symbolism. Set design, or at least what was shown of it, was sparse but believably so, and gave several nods to German expressionism. The Criterion DVD does justice to this once lost work of art, giving us the option to watch it completely silent or with the Voices of Light soundtrack, an operatic orchestration inspired by the film, which I found to be very fitting. Also included on the disc is a comprehensive commentary track, a feature on the history and many versions of the film, and several other worthwhile extras. All in all, this is the best silent film I've seen and I'm glad I went ahead and purchased it.",
45,23 December 2012,rmax304823,8, Horrifying Masterwork.,"There's no doubt about Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" being a work of genuine poetry. Nothing like it had been seen before. The performances are nearly perfect, although Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc has few light moments, as you can imagine. Dreyer's direction was all new to the screen, mostly low-angle close ups. The set direction was similarly innovative. All the rooms are spare and brightly lighted. Even the torture chamber is clean and uncluttered -- no pots of oil bubbling over a fire, no hairy greaseballs going grimly about their tasks. We get a hypnotic glimpse of a spool of spikes whirling, and what appears to be some sharp and jagged farm implements hanging on the wall.",
46,17 August 2017,tyson-hunsaker,10, A must-see for any lover of silent cinema.,It's a true blessing that The Passion of Joan of Arc was not lost forever and was miraculously restored for the world to behold the incredible wonder this film is. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a French silent film based on the true story of the real woman by the same name who claims experiences of visions from God which angers the church. The film centers on the trial itself and ultimately her death at the stake. ,
47,5 April 2010,bkoganbing,9, That Male Attire,For those who have seen Ingrid Bergman and later on Jean Seberg play the maid of Orleans in other interpretations of the Joan Of Arc story you might well do to take a look at what the French themselves have with their national heroine. The Passion Of Joan Of Arc made at the tail end of silent films give an actress normally associated with comedy a chance to give an astonishing interpretation of the maid. It also gives us the only recorded performance of Maria Falconetti to treasure.,

Then while she claims to be sent by God and the English will be driven out of France, the close-up takes a lateral angle, more painful and sharp as a knife that hits the viewer's heart. The editing alternates impassive close-ups of the inquisitors and the juxtaposition of Giovanna's close-up with the close-up close-up of a guard, which appears zoomed in his terrible look in the car: this is particularly disruptive. The process continues and Giovanna's eyes are estranged as if she were looking at angels and saints for whose vision she is also accused. After the accusation of blasphemy continues to pray in ecstasy as ""The ecstasy of Santa Cecilia"" by Bernini. A friar thinks that Giovanna is a saint, but is taken away by the soldiers. Giovanna sees a cross in the shadow and feels comforted. She is not considered a daughter of God but a daughter of the devil and is sentenced to torture. Giovanna D 'Arco says that even if she dies she will not deny anything. The eyes are twisted by terror in front of the torture wheel and faint. Giovanna is taken to a bed where they are bleeding. Giovanna feels that she is about to die and asks to be buried in a consecrated area. Giovanna says it is not true that she was sent by the devil but that they were sent to make her suffer. In a close-up, Giovanna turns her head in this ascetic and suffering moment and a quick, alternate editing correlates her with close-ups and details of the inquisitors, like their mouth whose words depend Giovanna's life. Giovanna suffers the final sentence while an image of a worm coming out of a skull in the common grave contrasts with the intensity of her close-up. Giovanna embraces death and on the gallows says she accepts death with a good heart. Giovanna burns at the stake while devoted ladies cry in a series of close-ups. The crowd rebels against burning a saint and the soldiers attack the people, who flee in an alternation of close-ups, filming from the top of the crowd that escapes attacked by soldiers and the silhouette of Giovanna burning on the stake.",
51,25 December 2008,Chance2000esl,10, Amazing Photography Carries the Film and Heightens Its Impact!,"This film is amazing on several counts. First, the cinematography is mind boggling: we've got tons of extreme closeups, lots of low angle shots, pans and swish pans, even upside down shots. Dreyer is using the camera to tell the story of Joan of Arc's trial for heresy and her being burned at the stake. ",
52,25 August 2013,lreynaert,10, Revolutionary,"'Joan of Arc' is stylistically a key work in the history of cinema, through its combination of close-ups, camera angles, framing and movements of the characters and of the camera on this characters. Dreyer created a masterful visual sequencing with the movements of the heads inside the screen and of camera panning and tilting on these same heads (of the judges of Joan of Arc). This sequencing suggests an inescapable iron encircling of Joan of Arc (whose close-ups were filmed with a fixed camera) by her vicious judges. All these shots created the same effect as that of the painting 'Christ Carrying the Cross' by Jheronimus Bosch, where the serene face of Christ contrasts sharply with the ferocity of the visages in the crowd around him. The camera angles and the decentered and canted framing further accentuate the contrast between Jeanne's face full of grace and the grim facial expressions of her corrupt judges, a bunch of perfidious theologians and dishonest lawyers.",
53,4 October 2007,r-c-s,9," extremely good, artsy but dated movie","this movie's drawback is that it gives no background. We are thrown right in the middle of the action. Perhaps the director wanted the public to take its autonomous stance, but when you start watching, you must either like/believe Joan or not. The quality of the film is excellent; by all means it might have been shot in the 1950s. Acting is very good for what it is (EG no outside action but a young woman tortured and then burnt alive ): the first few seconds hinted at Falconetti being a very brilliant actress; perhaps not the best of all times ever, but let's compare a few recent Hollywood big budget junk thrillers or psycho-movies to boot and this ages-old movie ends up winning. Scenes are careful and camera work innovative. ONE BIG GOOF: around the time Joan is taken out to be burnt, we see a priest WITH GLASSES. Now spectacles were centuries ahead of Joan's time. I tend to regard this movie as high theater on film, rather than a ""movie"". THE MESSENGER tries to psychoanalyze Joan too much, making her look like a complete fool. But face it, after all these centuries she is still a hero not because she might have (or have not ) heard god's voice (plenty of charlatans and hallucinating faddists claim they do everyday right now ), but because a young, illiterate peasant virgin could actually kick the enemy's hides and give her king a crown, being ready to die burnt alive to stand for her ideals. I wish I had a fraction of the balls she had, period. One might or might not sympathize with France, but her lesson is a lesson for everyone.",

57,12 September 2022,CinemaSerf,7, La passion de Jeanne d'Arc,"Maria Falconetti is superb as the eponymous tortured soul betrayed and tried for heresy in 15th century France. The history is well known, and Carl Theodor Dreyer sticks fairly faithfully to the more established, traditional, chronology which leaves us, the audience, to focus much more on the wonderfully emotive, gritty and poignant efforts from the cast and the wonderfully creative talent behind the camera. The combination of innovative, intimate and intense photography coupled with the beautifully expressive facial expressions from Miss Falconetti; the subtle but potent brutality of her persecutors - personified well by Eugene Silvain's Bishop Cauchon but also well exemplified by the cold and soul-less panel of judges all make this an effective and chilling film. The score - semi angelic, frequently intimidating but always powerful helps create an atmosphere that genuinely makes you feel fear and trepidation for this young woman, a pawn in things she little understands, but sticking faithfully to her beliefs of divine intervention and pureness of spirit. That emotional link is contagious, and even as a man of little faith myself, I found myself feeling an overwhelming pity for this person caught up in a trap of very much earthly ambition and deceit. It's a tough watch at times, especially as the chronicles remove even the slightest of chances for this woman. It is also pretty short - and that helps keep that momentum moving really well; there is no time for extended and sprawling cinematography to lessen the impact - it's a film about humanity, trauma and fear; and takes some beating...",

The condition of the film looks crisp and perfect. It is based on the trial transcript of Joan of Arc. The film starts with Joan in prison. The religious authorities question and berate the young girl. They bring her to the torture chamber. At the breaking point, the priest guide her hand in signing a confession. She is eventually burnt at the stake. RenÃ©e Jeanne Falconetti stars as Joan. Her big eyes glow with passion. She is a bit old to play the teen martyr. Otherwise, this is an impressive acting performance from the silent era. The constant use of closeups is quite compelling. It's almost a piece of painting or art.",

62,9 January 2004,desperateliving,10, 10/10,"Carl Dreyer presents us with one of the greatest tests of an audience in the history of the movies. He forces us to look at Joan's face in a hundred fragmented close-ups, gaze into her steely eyes permeated with God's destiny, never sure of our surroundings. He makes us those that would judge her, gawking at her facetiously. She's the greatest angel we've ever had, and Dreyer doesn't make the mistake of turning her into a device for sympathy: when she bends, it's not because she's weak, it's because she's overcome with God's power. As usual with Dreyer, his film is something that we reflect ourselves onto: are we Joan, or the onlookers? When Joan cries, do we blame ourselves?",
63,20 July 2020,MrLucasWarHero,10, True Passion and Genius,"This film moved me.
I mean, it really moved me. Witnessing the harrowing tale of this young, brave and feverishly passionate girl through the eye of ingenious director Carl Theodor Dreyer was so much more emotionally touching than just watching a film. It was a religious experience.
There is a fine line between madness and enlightenment. RenÃ©e Falconetti's performance brings that raw personage to life with an emblazoned look upon her face of the fervent young lady who has devoted her life to only God and expelling the English from France. Her gaze tells us that only she knows the truths that lie beyond the sight of mortal man and the complexity of her delivery makes it seem as if she also wonders why she should ever be put on trial for that which is an indisputable verity to her. Her gaze alone will grip you and hold you until the film is finished.
The cinematography of Rudolph MatÃ© is astoundingly beautiful. The way the camera surveys the male judges, creeps along the courtroom and stalks the townspeople truly brings the film to life. Joan of Arc often appears in closeup during moments so intense that we see the hope inside her eyes. The motley crew of priests with their politically motivated religious regime always seem to have empty space in every frame alluding to their lack of awareness.
We're there with Joan. We feel for her. We yearn to help her. But she does not want absolution from an unenlightened gang of men who know nothing of her struggles. She only wants the love of God. She shows us how painful it is to know truth and beauty and live in a world that seems to be blind to it.
Do yourself a favor. Watch this film and know beauty.",

In a medium without words, where the filmmakers conceived that the camera seized the heart of characters through their faces, to see Falconetti in Dreyer's landmark is to look into electric, almost extrasensory eyes that will never relinquish you. She also embodies Joan with an unrelenting monastic guilelessness, moving as if in a dream, her body language so slow and meditative. She answers questions in taut earnest.",

Bergman said it, Dreyer did it. In his film ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" he tells the story mainly through facial expressions. In this film their are no establishing shots, only close ups. Everything that could distract from the faces has been eliminated. No make up, a set consisting of only white walls (which in reality were painted pink so that the color in black and white would be right) , no music and last but not least a story that exclusively focuses on the trial of Jeanne d'Arc and not on the battles that preceded the trial. The Dryer film is something completely different than the ""Joan of Arc"" (1999) from Luc Besson.",

I've never seen any film, let alone another silent film, that sustains this level of emotional intensity for its entire duration.  The first ten seconds of this movie will show you why some directors chose to end their careers when talking-pictures became popular.  The expressions on the face of the incredible Maria Falconetti carry the drama in a way that no dialogue ever could hope to do.  My only warning is that this film is not entertainment; it is an overpowering work of artistic genius that could make a stone weep.  So make sure you are in the right frame of mind before watching it.",
69,7 February 2006,marissas75,10, Simply devastating,"In ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" Carl Theodor Dreyer elects to tell the story of Joan's trial not through action or dialogue (or title cards, as this a silent film), but through faces. His simple but mesmerizing technique is to place the actors in rooms with stark white walls, film them in extreme close-up, and assemble the film by alternating images of Joan with those of her interrogators. The bare white set contrasts with the actors' faces, which are filmed in such detail that their flesh almost becomes tangible, and reveals everything you need to know. The craggy, warty faces of Joan's interrogators suggest human menace and evil, without the actors ever assuming an overtly menacing expression.",

71,3 June 2001,EyeDunno,10, A silent film that speaks volumes (Criterion's Voices of Light version),"What a beautiful and yet startling movie. I am currently watching it on TCM (Turner Classic Movies). It's outstanding, from the acting and cinematography to the words and music (""Voices of Light,"" performed by Anonymous 4 which was composed by Richard Einhorn who was said to have been inspired by the movie). This is a gem that needs to be seen by real film buffs (who would opt to view the film without sound, as director Carl Theodor Dreyer preferred) and current directors and producers. When I first began viewing it, I thought it had been filmed very recently. All the techniques used, from the placement of lights and cameras to the intimate close-ups of the faces of actors are stunning, almost shocking. As a still photographer, I feel the camera work by Rudolph Mate is tremendous -- there were angles used during the filming of the 1928 movie that still aren't used today. It's so powerful yet also unsettling; even with today's cinematography, Rudolph MatÃ©'s lens forced the viewer to see the pain up close, the insensitivity of the judges and guards... MatÃ©'s compositions must have been kept off-center to give the viewer a sense of imbalance. And when the film climaxed, camera movements rocked back and forth, or were swept upside down and even trampled on.",

4. The cinematography is fantastic. The framing is incredible, and the zoom-ins and close-ups help to add so much weight to every scene.

6. The dialogue, although it's in written form to be congruent with the silent film model, is captivating, and almost ethereal in its structure and delivery.
7. The pacing is perfect, despite the limited setting and constricting plot. The movie never once feels tired or outstays its welcome.

What the ingenious Dane himself dubbed ""psychological realism"" and ""realized mysticism"" is a masterfully shot close-up feast generating an overwhelming flood of imagery, a lead that Dreyer called the ""martyr's reincarnation herself"" (the incomparable Renee Falconetti) and powerful re-enactment of original dialog transcribed at the trial in 1431. But it's also a forthright picture sans make-up, sound, not even a backstory is there, but all of it is lacking for a reason. ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is completely focused film-making, minimalism in its purest form, centering entirely on a core theme and thus radically eliminating all other elements that hinder the primary endeavor. Even the sets only seem to exist merely on the fringe of the spiritual drama and tragedy, which unfolds through the eyes of the actors via glimmers, flickers and stares. Confronted with piercing questions again and again circling like vultures above the torn state of mind of the famous maid, Joan's soul is revealed to us. Enlightened or a lunatic is not for the film-maker to decide. However, simplicity elevated to a film-making method makes our own observations a devastating and spellbinding journey at the same time, a journey into another world from where there is no escape. What we witness is indeed timeless mysticism founded in stark realism, and that's why it shakes us to the bone.",

I was not disappointed. This film had me hooked. It really showed the ordeal Joan must have gone through and also showed how, in all likelihood, no matter what she said, she was not going to be found innocent. Without one word, and only music in the background, this movie conveyed more feelings than alot of regular movies I have seen. I would recommend this film to anyone who wishes to understand her life, her faith and her amazing courage in the face of such adversity and the obvious hopelessness of her being found innocent. I would definitely watch this again, and again.",

110,28 February 2014,jboothmillard,8, The Passion of Joan of Arc,"From director Carl Theodor Dreyer (Vampyr, Ordet, Gertrud), this is a Danish silent film I was really looking forward to watching because of all the critical acclaim I knew it had, including of course it's placing in the 100 Movies You Must See Before You Die book. Based on the real authentic records of the historic trial, this film depicts the last few days of Jeanne d'Arc, better known as Joan of Arc (Maria RenÃ©e Falconetti), on trial for the crime of heresy, because she believed it was her mission from God to support King Charles VII and fight or lead in the Hundred Years War, the battle between France and England. In court she is questioned by Bishop Pierre Cauchon (EugÃ¨ne Silvain) and supported by some as a true saint, and she remains dedicated to her beliefs, and in her cell, while judges try to find evidence to convict her, she is interrogated by priests and attempts to convince her to change her views fail. These attempts include a false letter from the king, and she is denied a Mass, Jeanne does become visibly emotional during trial, with those speaking ill of her strong religious beliefs and the antagonism, she also faints at the sight of the torture chamber, but she does not give in to any demands of a change to her statements. However Jeanne is threatened with the penalty of being burned at the stake, and she finally breaks, allowing a priest to have her sign a document of confession, and she is given communion, but then again Jeanne recants and in the end as punishment is publicly executed in the courtyard at Rouen castle, burning at the stake while a crowd protests. Also starring AndrÃ© Berley as Jean d'Estivet, Maurice Schutz as Nicolas Loyseleur, Antonin Artaud as Jean Massieu, Michel Simon as Jean LemaÃ®tre, Jean d'Yd as Guillaume Evrard, Louis Ravet as Jean BeaupÃ¨re and Gilbert Dalleu as Jean LemaÃ®tre. Falconetti gives an extraordinary performance as the title character, you can see all the emotions in her face with the many closeups, it is the only role she ever had as well, this film goes to show that not all films need sound or dialogue when you have a magnificent leading performer, and there are some really good camera angles, zooms, tilts and pans that create the intensity, this really is a compelling and must see classic silent drama. Very good!",

Though SHE is the one eventually convicted and burned as a ""witch,"" her JUDGES THEMSELVES sport every shape and style of mole, wart, and wattle known to mankind, most of them in photogenic extra-large sizes! While Joan's suffering at the stake seems much more prolonged here in 1928 than in most subsequent film versions of her story (and the villagers' post-burning storming of the castle seems like something more suited to IVANHOE), Mr. Dreyer probably thought this was the only way to show how her earthly body could be purified after weeks of close exposure to such odious, Pustulent, venal, prevaricating, corpulent, chauvinistic, hell-bent air polluters at her show trial.

122,20 November 2019,davidmvining,10," Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made, Still","When a medium is only twenty years old, what does it mean to be called the best of that medium? When The Passion of Joan of Arc was released, narrative film was really only about 20 years old. It's seems like a paltry selection of films from which to pull the best ever. I suppose the closest corollary in my lifetime would be video games. Mass consumer video games seem to have a birth in the late 70s and early 80s. When a game came out in the late 90s and early 00s that was considered one of the best ever, at the time, how long will that opinion last? Will people who play games in 2080 still consider that game to be one of the greatest ever?
Such questions come to me when thinking about the reception The Passion of Joan of Arc received upon its release. I've read contemporaneous reviews that called it the greatest film ever made. Seems like a small feat when compared to a movie called greatest ever now, with 90 more years of films to deal with.
And yet, I don't think anything has changed about this film's place at the height of cinema.

The additional impeccable score acts as a guiding force that tethers the film together. It's all too perfect right here. Love the religious symbolism and god do I love the composition.

It has literally nothing to recommend it at first to anyone who actually expects entertainment from it. Jeanne of Arc is a fascinating character, but, frankly, showing a lot of pompous jurors and other court officals asking her questions and her just staring forward like a deer in headlights just doesn't work. It is true that some skill emerges if you wait long enough(The torture device, the revolt) but, frankly, I think it is a big mark against this film that we never see Joan doing any of the things that made her the important figure she is (lifting the siege at Orleans would have been nice, even if just in flashback for a few seconds)An insane person no doubt would be able to stand up to torture if they think they are in the right, so it weakens the image of Jeanne. I am not altogether sure that the revolt at the end was even real, and I am dead sure there are a lot of acronisms in it.

For this reason, most of my favorite silent films are comedies, because physical humor translates without anything spoken. I was quite worried when I started The Passion of Joan of Arc because it felt like so much of the movie was intertitles. With silent films I feel there is a tipping point where too many title cards start to pop up and my brain begins to think ""Maybe I should just read a book on this subject, because they don't seem to be utilizing the visual medium of film as much as they are just showing expository text."" Thankfully, this didn't last long. It seems the early scenes are designed to set up the narrative, so that the visuals can do the story-telling the rest of the way through.

From the first time you lay eyes on Falconetti, you realize that you're in for something special. I have never in my life seen an actor/actress express more emotion...with or without dialogue.  Falconetti demands your complete attention as she captures the martyr's torment beautifully.  A recent review on imdb claimed this film is depressing.  This may be true...but in a thoughtful way.  No, Dreyer doesn't explicitly *tell us* if Joan truly is a Saint.  The film would have been greatly diminished if he had.

140,16 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Faith for survival,"""The questions and answers between the judge and Jeanne are clearly recorded. After reading it, we will find a true Jeanne, a simple and humane young woman who removes her armor and died for the country.
This seemingly religious film has a very different narrative at the beginning. The whole passage does not involve the concept of God at all. Instead, it focuses on one word, that is, ""human nature"". Say it is the ""belief"" in human nature.
Over the past few hundred years, the image of Jeanne d'Or has long been mythical. She is a national hero of France and a goddess in the mouth of people. But it is ridiculous that such a Catholic saint with a strong religious meaning was due to political purposes. Burned to death for religious reasons. Such a fact makes people wonder: Is religion so ridiculous in some ways, and does God really exist? It can be said that at least in this film, the role of God is completely missing, and the close-up shots are very clear and belong to human faces. In the first half of the film, what we saw was just a face of a series of ridiculous interrogations, filled with desperate images of poor Jeanne, and the opposite, the laughter, ruthlessness and enthusiasm of most of the judges around indifferent. The atmosphere of extreme despair made people unable to catch a trace of God's existence. And halfway through the film, the three soldiers' ridicule and playfulness towards Jeanne reached its peak. The saint in the mouth of the people is being bullied like an ordinary prisoner of war, an ordinary woman at this moment. The crown she regarded as a sacred symbol was now reduced to a plaything above the sword in the hands of soldiers. When the only outside light on the floor was blocked by the shameless judges, all the divinities disappeared at this moment. In addition, in addition to a few distant shots of the perspective shots in the film, most of the angles of view come from the up shots. In other words, they belong to the angle of view that cannot belong to God.
However, when God seems to be gone, facing the persecution of power, is there no way as an individual, not so. ""True salvation is not a victory after fighting, but a strength and peace of mind that can be found in suffering."" So we saw in the second half of the film that the flinching, weak Jean was gone, replaced by a pair of stern eyes, an unyielding response, and a soul full of faith.
""I totally love and respect God with all my heart""
""He claimed that I was sent by the devil""
""That is not true""
""In order to make me suffer, the devil sent you""
""with you""
""And you""
This refusal, with all her power, sent out to the judges. It's just that this power does not come from the dead God, but from her own, from a person's inner, unbreakable faith. At this time, it is no longer important to whom the object of the belief is, and more importantly, this belief and the power it carries are burst out of a person and the heart of the person after the object has long been destroyed.
Although Joan of Arc had been shaken in the face of the upcoming fire punishment, it was the saint and the faith that never burned down in the fire. The director then expressed the scene that the French people were called by Jeanne d'Arc and immediately began to fight the soldiers, simply visualizing this power.
Since the two industrial revolutions, mankind has shouted the slogan of God 's death against the background of rapid technological advancement, but with it comes the heavy fall of souls from generation to generation, and the human spirit seems to remain after God 's departure A huge gap was added, and then a series of things that filled this gap added greed and sin that were left after the rapid development of many material civilizations. Maybe God is indeed dead, or not, but what mankind really lacks at this moment is not just an unknowable unknown force, but more importantly the faith, or rather, the faith itself.
Finally, the status of this film in film history is also commendable. Although the use of a large number of close-up shots is a reflection of the director's personal style, but the win is to win in the movie itself and the theme is very suitable. This film with almost no plot focuses more on the characterization of the characters, and the close-up shot becomes the optimal solution to achieve this goal under this condition. In addition, there is a very important point, the film was filmed in 1928, at this time, the sound film has just been born a year has not yet been popular. Instead of relying on the dialogue presented by the sound, the audience's attention is completely placed on the picture itself. The superb performance of the characters + the use of close-up shots + the clear-cut editing (the front and back contrast or the corresponding combination of pictures are used in the film many times The rendering of emotions) + the background music of the piano music constitutes the expression effect of the history of this vertical shadow. I have to say that this is really an art that belongs only to the silent era. The film fully embodies the unique charm of the film as a ""dumb art"" and truly achieves the so-called ""silent wins with sound"" effect.

The cast is fronted by Maria Falconetti, but also stars Eugene Silvain, and AndrÃ© Berley. This film has a very interesting history, including being thought to have been lost for 50 years or so. This was also Falconetti's first, and final film of her life. She lived for 18 years afterward, but she just never starred in any films again. It just goes to show that some of the best art or film is unsuspecting. I'm glad to say that this film is tragically beautiful.
Let me first address what makes this movie; Maria Falconetti. This is one of the best, if not the best performance I have ever seen. I might almost say the best because she perfectly uses her face to express all of her emotions. You know what she is thinking, what she fears, what she hopes. She stares at the ceiling as if she is pleading with god, trying not to question her faith. I could only ever imagine this film as a silent one since the performance by Falconetti is just so passionate and breathtaking. The other performances are also good of course too, especially the young priest who has a very memorable scene with Joan. In other words, the performance from Falconetti and company is worth it in itself.
Secondly, the cinematography and photography went absolutely hand in hand with the performances. There were many shots where I got goosebumps, or where you could pause and write an essay about that still image. Almost every shot of Joan is a close up, and it works excellently. It just shows you don't need a big budget to get shots with such beauty and emotion.
The performances and cinematography are amazing, but all the other aspects are at least I would say ""good"". The story is pretty simple, but that is all we need for this experience. The pacing is just right, transitioning right when scenes would lose their light. The set's are I would say good for the time, but nothing spectacular, but it doesn't need that. Most of the music is harrowing but in a sense mystical at times. The only little problem I have is that sometimes solo male voices in the music kinda broke immersion for a second. This was only because they were so prominent that it took my attention off of the scene, instead of blending with it.
If you're reading this by now you're either really love it like me, or are very very interested. So all there is I need to say is that this movie is in the film hall of fame for me. It just left me thinking all night, and was a truly beautiful film. It also showcases one of the best performances in film of all time by Falconetti. May she rest in peace.",

147,8 March 2009,gentendo,7, Standing for Something,"The Passion of Joan of Arc is a deeply moving story about the last vindictive trial of Joan's life before her martyrdom at the stake. Joan's story is uncannily similar to the story of ChristÂboth were viewed as extremists; both were thought to be a threat to political power; both were told to deny their beliefs by a group of tyrannical clergymen; and both were ultimately murdered for their convictions. Joan, like Christ, becomes more and more at a loss of words as she is vehemently interrogated, knowing full well that her words are futile and that death awaits her. Her silence, in many instances, parallels the silence of Christ and is perhaps the most powerful testimony she gives against the brooding Englishmen who enslaved her.",

At first, she is enlightened, sassy and doe-eyed, then after several interrogations, threats of torture, a real bloodletting (actually an extra was used for the stabbing), and having her own hair clipped off to the roots, her eye lids eventually droop until she is barely squinting.

The primary challenge being the decision of whose version of history is to be told. Another of the monumental challenges facing the filmmaker is deciding what resources to use in the design and execution of the film. By the late 1920's, advancements in cinematic equipment and technique were becoming more refined to include many of the basic cinematic innovations that are commonly used today. Careful filtering of different styles over the course of several decades led to these refinements. However, when it comes to methods of creating personal style, there are always those who want to spend time reinventing the wheel or those who decide that they know better than those that came before them. This often leads to artistic revolutions that last a short time before dying out and the art reverts to the basics.
