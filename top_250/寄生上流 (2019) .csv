0,5 July 2019,Jeremy_Urquhart,10, One of the best films of this decade,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.",/
1,6 October 2019,jtindahouse,8," You name a genre, this movie covers it","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.",r
2,25 August 2019,nehpetstephen,10, Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""",e
3,1 November 2020,Leofwine_draca,10, Thoroughly entertaining,"PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.",v

6,9 December 2021,boblipton,10, Thought It Might Win Best Foreign Movie,"When the buddy who got into college tells him he's moving to the US, and he's passing on the 14-year-old he's been tutoring -- just tell 'em you're enrolled in college, even though you aren't -- the son of a family so low class they've sunk through the foundation finds them very nice, very accepting, and very clueless. So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.",w
7,12 January 2020,impeyrules-54634,9, An original dark comedy about class struggles,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.,/
8,7 August 2020,Hitchcoc,9, Totally Unique,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.",r
9,16 January 2020,perica-43151,9, Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.",w
10,28 December 2019,CineMuseFilms,8, A black comedy on social inequality,"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.",6
11,2 July 2019,DJKwa,9, Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.",2

Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.,5
13,5 March 2023,avindugunasinghe,8, True Horror,"If any creation is able to make an unforgettable imprint of what needs changing in this world, that production has fully achieved it's purpose. Through precise acting by the cast the movie imposingly justifies the desperation of the neglected. A well written story with imaginativeness of the highest quality. Excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the society's core. Excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities. There's alot to gather from this movie and what's truly interesting when it's viewers turn to decide who the real parasites of the society are.",3
14,4 February 2020,Fella_shibby,10, Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.,"Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.

17,4 November 2019,jmholmes-73727,10," FUNNY, TURNS SUDDENLY TWISTED, THEN SAD","This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive.",/
18,7 May 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,10, Incredible.,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.",?
19,26 January 2020,classicsoncall,8," ""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""","This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.",r
20,15 October 2019,howard.schumann,7, Lacks any realistic human dimension,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.",e

24,5 December 2019,EdgarST,10, Family Affairs,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.",t
25,6 December 2019,TheVictoriousV,10, One of the decade's most clever and original,"South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision, on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.",t
26,26 February 2020,ajikude,5, totally overrated,Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.,_
27,21 June 2020,Waedliman,5, Neither fish nor foul,"I am not Korean and maybe I cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film, beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me. In some scenes I saw an actor or actress pretty weak, in the next rather strong. Sometimes I had the feeling they were no professional actors at all. And I can judge acting and I know that that was not on purpose. The camera work was good, I really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes, some misleading, others very clear. Would the storyline have been as thorough as that, this would be a great movie, in my opinion. But it wasn´t. None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments. The dichotomy of a society, here in lower class people and the rich, worked well yet a little stereotypical. The poor were poor but witty, the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive. Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down? No, it wouldnt, that´s what this film tells us. It´s a satire, of course. For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side, the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well-thought script. Like some others here, I don´t know why this got an Oscar for best movie. Was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win?",u
28,20 December 2019,jadavix,6," Poor pacing, too few twists, too unbelievable","I think there's a really good movie buried in ""Parasite"" somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.",r

Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.",
32,12 November 2019,kluseba,10, Food for thought delivered with exciting wit,Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.,
33,26 December 2019,MandalBros-5,10, A MUST WATCH,"Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen.
Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad.
This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast.
At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says ""You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all "".",

37,16 January 2020,michaeltrivedi,7, Great,"I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).",

Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever.""

A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020.",
41,14 November 2019,RforFilm,10," Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""","If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.",

51,26 January 2020,Pairic,9, Brilliant Dark Satire,"Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10.",

This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!",
63,26 November 2019,novacasa42,10, A Masterpiece/Work of Art.,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.
This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.

But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film.

69,14 January 2020,garethcrook,10, Perfection.,"There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year.",

I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking.

76,30 October 2019,theredsky,10, Parasite Review,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.",

I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite.

82,22 November 2019,b_velkova,1, What's more disgusting than actually being disgusting?,"A family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of. The inhabitants of the house, on the other hand, are so incredibly stupid that they don't notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell. But the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell! A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB...
It's not just a bad story, no, it's actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn't make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I'm supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn't like them either, I don't see what's so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them ""lovable"".

It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well.

The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film.

Some sloppy writing for instance. The Kim family is drunk in the Parrks home..All of a sudden they become sober. They throw glasses and bottles on the floor, then its cleaned up with no one cleaning it. When the two kids are under the ottoman hiding, theres no sign of broken anything. Also, the ex maid has been hiding her husband in the cellar for years (why) and she's been moving the big chest to get down there to care for him all these years. Then when she returns she can't open the secret door so the Kim family can see her. How did she manage all the years before this particular night. The film is very mean spirited and theres nobody to root for except for the poor man who gets killed. Again, sloppy writing. The premise is good but the execution is bad. Oh, and the young kid gets strangled and his head is hit with a large rock. He recovers with nary a scratch. Again, poor writing. Movie makes no sense. On the plus side, the acting is good.",
127,17 November 2019,RussHog,10, Great Movie,I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade.,

They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect.

But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws.

147,3 February 2020,MrPupkin,10," It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.","It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs. have-nots"" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time.",

161,3 February 2020,RhapsodyReviews,10, Modern Classic.,"Review:
'Parasite' is a black comedy-thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho.
I personally love foreign films, especial horror and thriller films from South Korea. I have loved every movie I have seen thus far of director Bong Joon Ho's and this is no different.
The film follows the members of a poor household scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.
The actors in this movie bring their A-game and showcase all different levels on the screen. There are all able to showcase their comedic side as well as darker capabilities when needed. This is the rare occasion when there are no standouts because there are on the same level. Just brilliant performances all around.
The story is so original and tightly executed. It may get a little confusing because things tend to happen quickly, and information can get lost. It is beautiful shot, this its camera angles and wide shots inside the house. It showcases different class types in society perfectly and how some rich look down on the poor and it gets under your skin.
Overall, the movie is great for those who don't mind subtitles. However, if you do mind subtitles or have not tried foreign film, I promise you that you're missing out on a whole other world of cinema. I was going to give this movie 4.5 stars because I didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon with people loving this movie, but it deserves more than that. It is an absolutely flawless film.

These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful.

The rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect. The wife is naive and lives in materialism. The father, a famous arrogant musician, isn't home much but there he is worshiped. They also have a young son who is trouble, as all kids that age. But the mother acts overwhelmed and thinks he's some kind of painter prodigy. That gives the tutor a chance to get his sister hired as an ""art therapist"" for the troubled son. So the sister impersonates an art therapist. When she's meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead.",

The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan.

The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards.

Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint.

I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea?",

Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings.

231,17 November 2019,jg_1977,10, The masterpiece of cinema 2019 desperately needed,"There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own.",
232,7 November 2019,trelerke-politics,10," instant classic, this generation's Rules of the Game","As Jordan Peele is to race, Bong Joon-ho is to class. He creates strange, shocking scenes and stories from the seemingly mundane. A fancy house with an underground, with an underground prisoner. This is about how human civilization is the Parasite that drives everyone absolutely crazy. There will always be those few who essentially live off everyone else, the main point though, is we all suffer, maybe there is no solution but it really is this ugly, ultimately. The pin-head wife lives in oblivious vapidness, going on about the swan formation of tables for her spoiled son's birthday. A birthday party called the day after a hellish flood, well, at least a hellish flood that drives everyone in a working class ghetto to an evacuation center. Sewage backing up, blowing out the toilet,it's like the last scenes of the movie Titanic, except far less tidy, while the rich family enjoys the rain on their mountain top mansion. But far more is happening in a very small space, the con family is trapped under the coffee table as the rich couple watches their son's little Indian idyll play on in the Teepee on the lawn in the beautiful rain. (this focus on using American Indians as the spoiled child's play, forcing the fraud family to participate or else, is a masterstroke, as the play became real, toy symbol turned into actual violence). Switching back in time, the fraud family and the underground family essentially fight to the death. Bong Joon-ho mimetically has above ground and the underground and the naive disgust the wealthy have for how the poor smell. It's a little over the top, but in a way that is Brechtian, in showing the contradictions of our materialistic existence. Major props to Bong Joon-ho, it will be a classic.",

This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words.

Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie!

244,3 February 2020,tomfeller,9, Story of two Korean families,"This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film.",

The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core.

261,1 December 2019,roundtablet,5, mediocre and forgettable,"Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.",

If you do not know what it's about, it's to your advantage. Enter with a blank mind, and watch it before everyone starts casually throwing the plot and ending around. If you're still reading this, though, I can tell you that it definitely deserves the praise it's been getting. Korean cinema has been overlooked for a while, and Hollywood is finally catching on. Korean cinema has so many great films with unique twists that Parasite gets lost in the sea of them, but compared to all the other Oscar-nominated movies this year, it's a standour-yes, because it's a foreign film, but also because it's not in your face and the same old period, war, biopic, Hollywood-loving-Hollywood movie that seem to get nominated year after year. It's more a subtle, pensive, edgy yet equally humorous and entertaining film that caters to both critics and audiences alike. The cinematography, direction and script are the crowning jewels of this film, but apart from externals, I think this movie deserves more than one view because a lot of themes has surfaced and requires a more in-depth analysis. The characters and their motivations can also be studied. It's a movie you can watch with a bag of popcorn and/or one that requires complete and undivided attention. If you're still reading this, then SPOILER ALERT for you before I write my next line:",
266,4 February 2021,montferrato,1, Neo-Marxism and Inverse Snobbery,"Repulsive story, highly prejudiced. The movie deals very unsuccessfully with the topic of social class struggle. Basically, the movie offers a violent tale of resentment and inverse snobbery. The rich are stupid and undeserving, the poor are a brotherhood of crooks, etc. It both denigrates rich and poor at the same time. It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation.
Repugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices.
Not surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes. These awards are clearly political. Cinematic Quality has nothing to do with it. All this hype furthered my opinion about the inherent detestability of this very bad movie. Overrated is an understatement. Sick film, sick story. We live in decadent times. It is obvious.",

TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years.

I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay.

Films wrest for their spotlight via the award season. The media chimes in with their own ceremonies and ribbons.

It's win was a watershed moment for filmmakers everywhere. It's a shot in the arm for original storytellers in a time that seems dominated by Disney related properties and remakes.

288,4 February 2020,kager-69310,10, Fantastically Flawless,"One of the best movies i've ever seen. This movie is full of wonderful surprises.
The scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as it's overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in Mr Parks house. Also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satirical(laughed out loud). I have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movie.It also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the Park family although they are deceiving them. The whole movie took me by surprise and I didn't see any of it coming; it's really clever. I laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so. The director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off. I also have to admit I was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out, i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed. It's a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality, meritocracy, social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you don't have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie, this movie is for everyone.

I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose.

A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power.

Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically.

312,12 January 2020,Nahid_15,9, Simple yet realistic,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense.
The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously.
What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently.

Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured. Parasite is truly a different film, with semi-realistic events. Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film.

Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion.

323,17 September 2020,EVON1TY,7, So over-rated but it has a good storyline.,"One of the most over-rated movie of last years. Rated as 30th best movie of all time? It can be in 150 but no more. Not that realistic (not because its comedy style, because it has wrong parts), detailed and effective storyline. It has wrong parts that could not happen, the nonsense parts I mean. I also watched Memories Of Murder, not so different than this movie, but Parasite is so over-rated. Over-rated on websites and Academy Awards.
I don't know how can be this movie the first Best Picture winner with foreign language. I know the Best Picture awards are not quite very well chosen. But we have seen amazing tens of movies from Italy, Spain, Turkey, Japan, Germany but none of them won the Best Picture in 100 years and this one won?

It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be.

The housekeeper kept her husband down in a secret dungeon and would bring him food every week and the rest of the time just ignore the fact he is down there by himself. The poor family couldn't even fold a pizza box then all of a sudden they are master con artists overnight. Then the guy in the dungeon goes berserk and starts stabbing the con family and no one seems to care about stopping him not even the family he is after - they let him attack the mom and they don't even try to help her. The husband just watches him attack his wife and doesn't even try to help. Then instead of attacking the attacker, he runs over and kills his boss! It make no sense whatsoever.

334,7 February 2020,tyelder,10, An Original Work of Art,"Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.
This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great.
Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies.
Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven.
Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall.
Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles.

Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be  ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get.

You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar's Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs. Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn't available anywhere locally. But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad.",
371,13 February 2020,bock_g,10, That's entertainment.,"Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment.",

376,9 February 2020,dannyrovira-38154,10, A NEW MASTERPIECE,"Bong Joon Ho's absolutely brilliant and powerful masterpiece is a sheer work of cinematic art. It tells the twisted, funny, and ultimately tragic tale of class discrimination and greed. About an dirt-poor Korean family that lives in cramped half basement level apartment where drunks regularly piss and throw-up outside their window. The out of work father Kim Ki-Taek, played terrifically by Song Kang Ho, helps his wife Chung Sook, well played by Jang Hye Jin, and his two children, son Ki-Woo and daughter Ki-Jeong, superbly played by Chi Woo Shik and Park So Dam, fold food boxes for a pitiful low-wage, but that all is about to change and a sinister plan is about to come into play, when Ki-Woo with the assistance of of his sister who creates a fraudulent diploma which helps him secure a job as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the super wealthy Mr. Park and his naive wife, Yeon-kyo, marvelously played by Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong. Miss Kim is so impressed by Ki-Woo's teaching skills that she mentions to him that her younger son needs a tutor to improve his art skills, so Ki-Woo recommends an art tutor which unbeknownst to her is his sister Ki-Jeong. What follows is the escalation of the Kim family's nefarious scam as they slowly make the Park family replace their household servants, beginning with their chauffeur, who is replaced by K-Woo's father, then they replace their live-in housekeeper, with Ki-Woo's mother. The Kims have now thoroughly invaded and occupied the Park's home without them suspecting anything, but this insidious situation will soon turn dangerous and deadly in a truly shocking climax. This amazing film is a slow burn in the beginning as the story unfolds but once the Kims are in the Park's home the film becomes an engrossing and breathtaking dark drama with some wicked humor. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Bong Joon Ho who was first Korean filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Gorgeous cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and a captivating Oscar nominated Original Screenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Jin Won Han, impressive Oscar nominated Production Design by Ha-jun Lee and Won-Woo cho. A new classic that is nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture. In Korean with English subtitles.",

Then it gets all whacked. And the son should have been killed by the force of trauma from the scholar stone that was supposed to be for good luck. Too many plot holes, like how could the family move back into that crappy apartment? Wasn't it condemned after all that flooding? Acting was superb but the violence at the boy's picnic was gratuitious and unnecessary. I'm sure some love this movie and want to see it again and again but it was rather dark and depressing.

The poor and clever class and the wealthy and not so bright class are both painted a little broadly and predictably for me.

Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"".

Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations.",

What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending.

With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes.

Directed by Bong Joon-Ho
How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film.
Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner.
Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo.
The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller.
Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality.",

It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed.

I just don't see a rich family instantly hiring four new employees without thoroughly checking them out first, this would never happen anywhere in the world. The first half was intriguing, and I began to think if they are a family of skillful grifters, then they wouldn't be living in a basement. I began to wonder if these people were family members at all or just a random assortment of con men who got together and pulled off cons, that would have been a neat twist, but no it doesn't go in that direction. Then I thought that the rich family would turn out to be parasites themselves, which would have been intriguing, but it doesn't go in that direction either. For some strange reason there's a violent attack towards the end that doesn't fit in with anything else that happens in the story up to that point, it's just random and there's no cognitive flow or context or continuity to any of it, it's just a disconnected series of events.

Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective.
Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure.
Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience.
No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards.

Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window.
The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT?
Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time?
For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre

It wasn't for everyone, though. Both films are 'so metaphorical' as ""Parasite"" protagonist Kim Ki-woo likes to put it. But different strokes for different people, no? Certainly, the metaphors aren't on vacation this time around, it's just that they learned to profess some subtlety. As back then, Bong pulls out all the stops in ""Parasite,"" and while the former picture's literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline, the new approach is hard to skip. It takes on the shape of a pitch-dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts. One might as well let one's self get immersed in it, enjoy the ride and laugh along, relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field. ""Parasite"" comes across as less pretentious, settles on the more down-to-earth (pun intended) side of things; it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror, is whimsical, ironic, even cynic at times; and it substitutes CGI for clever story-telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision. In short, ingredients for a less in-your-face, decisively creeping-up-on-you kind of comedy drama of caliber, falling into line with Bong's other early outstanding effort ""Memories of Murder.""",

REVIEW
As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience..

I'll be honest I was avoiding this as I kinda knew going in it was probably going to be depressing and horrifying. There's a running theme in the cinephile community that Korea has it's genre of film, unique unto itself. In Hollywood, films often go through 5 or more drafts that start with big amorphic ideas and edge closer toward crowd pleasing sometimes until they're just 90 minute commercials for the lead actors career. Korean film seems to lack that filter of cost X audience X test screening -+ = blah blah blah. They take big ridiculous ideas and drive them towards the powerful nebulous first draft finish line no matter how emotional draining or traumatic. In a word, Korean cinema can be very ""dark"".",

However, like with parasites, the Kim family couldn't help but to gluttonously take advantage of their situation until the only way out was through drastic measures. What I found most interesting however, is the end of the film. The son seems to have a change of heart, and decided to create his own fortune rather than rely on others.

480,24 October 2019,peeedeee-94281,3, What's that bad smell? Unfortunately the bad script and mediocre directing.,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I didn't read too much about it, but watching the trailer and having seen this director's previous work 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer', I was expecting something in the horror/sci-fi genre. But that's not what this movie was.
Sadly, whatever message the director Joon Ho Bong was trying to convey, it was lost in the tonally uneven mess of a script and direction, that starts off as a light hearted comedy, but then drags down into a dark and depressing disaster.
When the movie starts, we are shown a working class (more more like poor) family, the Kims, who seem to be hard on their luck. We see they work together folding pizza boxes (i don't see how the fumigated boxes were still good), to earn a few bucks.
Anyway, luck falls upon them when a friend of their son hooks him up with a sweet tutoring gig at the home of the Parks. And as the movie progresses, the members of the Kim family slowly insert themselves into aspects of the Parks lives.
Now, I think the intention was to portray this as some sort of social commentary and class struggle. But it definitely doesn't come across like this at all. All we see is The Kim family using tricks and deception to get their way, while the wealthy Park family, while a little naive, is portrayed as actually fairly nice. They don't mistreat any of their workers, they don't even do background checks on the Kim family (who are masquerading as non-related individuals). The father seems to be hard working, but is willing to take time off, along with the whole family, to take the young son out camping for his birthday.
The movie then takes a dark turn when we find out the husband of the previous maid was living in the basement of the home. Not as a prisoner, but of his own choice, to evade the law. Now, this turn of events is NOT a twist. I was expecting the twist to be more like it turns out the original architect/owner was locked down there, and the Park family was also a bunch of imposters.
Anyway, this movie devolves into scenes of violence where the Park father is killed, and really, I don't get why he had to die. His only crime was he didn't like a particular smell. It wasn't a metaphor for poor people, because poor people probably don't like smelly people either. It just seemed like the whole basement bunker/garden bloodbath was shoehorned in for the little 'twist' ending where we see the lights flickering on and off in the house because that's where the murderous Kim father chose to hide.
The whole movie premise was just bad, one dimensional characters who we never learn anything about, so we don't feel any sympathy, except maybe for the Park family who were too nice for their own good.
This movie really doesn't deserve the high praise it's been getting. It's a clumsy effort that doesn't execute it's themes very well. I just gave it a 3 because it's pretty to look at and some of the dialogue was funny. But as a whole, it's an unrewarding experience to sit through.",

It's problematic though that such talented grifters would be living in such a disheveled, shoddy accommodations almost as if the director scripted it that way for dramatic effect and the father's outrageous behavior at the end seems a little overall the top without real sense of consistency with the storyline, except again to adhere to some dramatic script design to impress critics or audience members.

Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this.",

The plot is a unique masterpiece. Like most Korean movies, it is maybe not for everyone's stomach. It is a brutal, honest and a raw dark comedy, which has a deeper meaning that progresses throughout the whole movie and punches you at the end with a knockout twist.
It replicates the cold and honest reality of the outside world of poor and rich differences. So, whoever wants to experience a thrilling push of harsh reality, packed into a metaphoric world of class diversity and the struggle between them, has to see this movie.",

These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes. Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own. In the end, we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives. Quirky, but interesting.",

This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I'm a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled.

I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story. The movie also suffered from a severe case of ""tonal whiplash"", meaning the tone was all over the place.

Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great.

This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.",

This movie is simply amazing. You see this movie and you immediately feel and think ""masterpiece"". It is funny, dramatic, thrilling, scary, thought provoking, intriguing, depressing, it is everything one can expect from a movie. This premise kept taking many twists and turns I was never confused.

561,7 March 2020,aidanratesmovies,10, A Truly Remarkable Work of Cinema,"With a fantastic cast, fabulous sense of direction, and a truly wild sense of storytelling, Parasite checks all the right boxes for a best picture winner, and proves to be something truly new, by also relying on things found familiar. The main cast is truly spectacular, with Kang-Ho Song and Cho Yeo-jeong providing for the best of the supporting performances. The dialogue is rich and relatable, and the humor in the film is well executed and surprisingly often. The film's pacing is by far one of its most brilliant remarks, with you never truly feeling bored throughout the almost 2 and a half hour runtime, and thoroughly entertained without. The film simply never stops, it doesn't shy away from different styles and genres of storytelling, but embraces them as one story and does it so cleanly, it truly is quite impressive. The cinematography is outstanding, with some truly beautiful visuals and captivating points of view. Though there are many interesting twists and turns that you may never truly see coming, the film can be a bit predictable at times with certain situations, and makes the film seem slightly less special in doing so. In the end however, Parasite is yet another brilliant work from Director Bong Joon-Ho and is one of, if not, the best work he has made to date.

Indeed, this balance between light and dark is probably its best aspect. The piece delivers moments of humour alongside moments of horror, each as genuine as the other. It's always entertaining, whether comedic or unsettling, and it's very well-made, to boot. Interestingly, the focal family aren't really all that empathetic once they start taking things a little too far, attempting to usurp the innocent and hard-working staff of the rich family they're 'scamming'. This isn't really detrimental, though. It's a distinct decision meant to keep us questioning who is really in the right, no matter whose perspective we're in. What it also does, however, is somewhat dampen the impact of the picture's proposed theme. Its comments on class perhaps don't quite come full circle - at least, not in the way you'd expect. Another issue is the fact that the initial protagonist sort of gets lost once his family moves further into the picture, but this isn't detrimental as the flick plays out in an ensemble fashion and the initial lead still gets a decent amount to do. Each member of the focal family has a decisive personality and their dynamic is believable. For me, the movie's second half - marked by its biggest tonal shift - isn't necessarily as successful as the first, despite it being the 'real beginning' according to director Bong Joon Ho. Of course, the film is always compelling. It's astutely crafted, too. Despite a few issues, it's an entertaining experience throughout. It's fantastic. 9/10.",

I believe it is not coincidence that while we are witnessing demonstration all over the world caused by ecenomic disparities, a movie like Parasite ( also we can add Joker) is publishing. Parasite is brilliant class struggle movie.
Fim starting with a lower class family who are living in a high class family's house as parasite. After the end of the movie I started to think that both family was parasite. Rich family, who are enable to handle daily difficulties, is in need of labour class. And Kim family using their need by cheating them.
Things I like:
#Park family's wannabe, American and the Indian references
#Elevation allegory between houses of the families and the social classes
#Rainfall sequence (Masterpiece directing !!)
#Wrestle of cockroaches to keep the house and the owners of the house does not aware of what is happenning.
#Below the coffe table scene
#Production of sets
#Rising of tension until the birth day party
#Smell of poorness",

Both families? When the rain comes and floods the ""poor people"", the rich family can only say how pleased they are to have the rain.

So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a ""social comedy"" though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the ""golden palm"" and a lot of ""oscars"" (despite critics' grumble - what so many ""oscars"" given for...).

However, I was disapointed when blood began to flow everywhere unnecessarily, without serving any purpose. I am not a Tarantino's fan, that's for sure.

I didn't get the numerous multiple genres from this that others have claimed it has. It's effectively a crime flick with a poor family conning a rich family with some social commentary thrown in. I suppose the ending is a bit more thriller/horror.,

661,24 November 2019,Alexander_Blanchett,8, One of the best screenplays of the year,"Original, entertaining and very well drafted film. It nicely mixes comedy genre with drama and delivers a quirky protrayal of class differences.
The concept works and could be placed in many societies. The characters were extremely well written and developed. Generally you care for them from the beginning and they keep being investing through the whole film. Bong Joon Ho newest film really captures you and is quite though provoking in general. The acting is very solid with the best performances coming from Kang-ho Song and Woo-sik Choi. The rest of the cast does marvelously as well.
The setting is nice, offering the audience very nice and believable sets and beautiful pictures. Bong Joon Ho's direction is constantly good as he perfectly understands his characters, their motivations and generally gives the film a very nice flow you can easily follow and he makes sure you never lose interest in it.

But no, the dad was hard-working, creating jobs, spending all his available time and money with his family. The man did not abuse his employees, he did not use cheap labor, did not force anybody to work in unhealthy conditions getting huge profit in his pocket.

The rich guy who seems nice enough, but just the mere smell of the poor, or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions ... it's a fantastic characterization, and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid's birthday party.

I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win.

Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense.

There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all.",

Films such as ""The Way Home"", ""The Handmaiden"", and ""Train to Busan"" are indeed great within their respective genres, and are testaments to South Korea's rising acclaim in world cinema. Parasite is not on the same level as the aforementioned titles. Instead it is quite typical of mediocre SK movies - choppy, childish at moments, and the dialogue isn't highly cerebral. It wasn't great nor was it bad. I'm not sure what all the hype was about with regards to it deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture either. I think people in the United States simply haven't seen enough SK movies to truly appreciate the breadth of cinematic entertainment that SK has to offer. Perhaps with Parasite, it must be the novelty of glorifying criminality in a very conservative society that's piqued critics' and American viewers' interests. Yet, this concept is nothing new in SK films.",

Director Bong Joon-ho has been hard at work over the last 20 years, helping craft films that are thoughtful and horrifying. Movies like The Host (2006) and Snowpiercer (2013) give a sense of his artistic style. Parasite merely takes his ability to shed light on class conflict and molds it into a masterpiece that's half heist-comedy, half horror-drama, and all suspense.

742,8 June 2020,coasterdude44,10," Multidimensional Cinema, the next step in Filmmaking and Visual Storytelling. An impeccably Surreal-Absurdist Drama Comedy","I have watched this film a total of three times now. First time with English subtitles and twice without. I have absolutely no idea what this movie is supposed to mean, but it feels like two social classes clashing against each other in a very strange yet interesting house.
I'll admit that I have never seen a Chinese or Korean made movie until now and Parasite is the first film I've seen from Korea, but the sheer artistic direction and enigmatic structure of it all is incomparable to any other film I've seen come out of the year. A very select few movies that come to mind that has a plot structure or story direction style that I can relate or reference this
I can only guess what the main theme or score of this movie is supposed to mean, I am listening to the music of the Blu-Ray menu as I'm typing this, trying to decode meaning from the notation structure of the short yet extremely memorable of this song. I'm still trying to decipher what emotion the theme is trying to convey. Could you say the film has a serious tone, it is hard to say?
The movie definitely has a serious tone, with a very strong burst of violence in the final 15 minutes of the movie's running time, but the theme is surprisingly happy and carefree, even joyful, yet overshadowed by an ever lurking hint of sadness, that never lets go. The sadness melancholic feel of this movie is always present throughout, despite the emotional rollercoaster this surreal absurdist - drama/comedy film only known as ""Parasite"" takes you on
This short theme is actually very true to emotion in real life. Melancholy can never fully be escaped from in so many facets of life. True happiness can only be achieved in fleeting moments and sometimes only in short bursts only to fall back into a stabilised state of emotional equality that is where most people reside in most periods of life. Never truly happy yet not depressed or sad. Simply reasonably content.
The third light at the top of the stairs meaning to me is the unstoppable and indescribable drive to try and achieve a higher state of happiness beyond normal human comprehension. An emotional ascension, which can also be heard in the main theme is you really start to sit down and think about the music in the film, and start mulling over the notes in your head and how they really make you feel. How does the theme make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Melancholic? Confused? Joyful? Maybe all at once. Maybe none of these emotions are good enough for you anymore. Did you ever think to yourself that you deserve a higher state of feeling that you always wanted but could never grasp?
If there is such thing as an afterlife or heaven, how would the souls that live there feel like. I would expect It would be a higher state than what most of us experience in life.
The rock to me is the object in the movie that symbolises the emotional weight which all the characters revolve around and are effected by which also radiates a strange gravitational like force that influences them, kind of like Sauron's Ring from LOTR but in a different way.
The true form and meaning of happiness is something that is always in my mind when I think about this movie. What is happiness even supposed to mean and who out there is brave enough to say that modern society's definition of true happiness (whatever the hell that is supposed to mean) is just simply not good enough. The man in the basement is an enigma. He is a man trying to create and send a message of how to escape the confines and prison of being trapped inside the normal comprehension of human emotion. The balance between Joy, Depression, Melancholy, Depression, Fear and True Happiness.
He cannot accept that true happiness, at least the way he feels it, is the best and highest form of happiness that a human mind can achieve. The three lights symbolise an upward stairway for the emotional mind. Emotional intelligence followed by ascension to a higher state of feeling and sustained happiness.
Parasite also touches upon Schizophrenia is some parts and offers a quick window into what it might be like to suffer from Schizophrenia. The definition of Schizophrenia itself is simply ""a breakdown between thought, reason and emotion""
Funnily enough this movie is split between three genres. Absurdist/Surreal Comedy and Drama.
The movie feels oddly split which is a purposeful directing choice which is the most obvious thing that you take away from this movie. The film could have been called ""Split"" to me and still would have not lost any of its impact, but unfortunately ""Split has already been taken by Shyamalan.
Something of a parasite is formed in this movie, but what it is I still have no clue. Parasite IS going to be one of those movie's that is going to become exponentially better the more times you watch it which will not lose its interest, charm or unique appeal with repeated viewings. The film truly feels multidimensional in its direction and communication of its ideas that leaves massive room for the viewer to make their own interpretation of those so-called ideas and messages in the film. The movie at times has a very enigmatic feel, reminiscing of certain video games like Myst, Riven, Portal and Abduction. Parasite is an experience that is going to mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people
Anyway, what do I think of this movie in terms of quality? The answer is simple. 10/10
This to me is minimalistic yet multidimensional filmmaking at its absolute finest and I really have no issues or gaping flaws that I have to say about it, It's pretty much as perfect as a modern movie gets and transcends so much that has came before it. I loved it. I loved every single goddamn minute of it and I don't even understand what I watched or even why I enjoyed it so much in the way I did. If you didn't enjoy it that is totally fine as well. It's one of those movies that is not going to be everyone's cup of tea and that is also okay. But to me, Parasite is the next step as we are beginning to experience a new advent in visual storytelling. This does feel like merely a prototype that will be improved and expanded upon by Boon Jong Ho. If anyone who might be reading this who worked on the movie, well done. I mean it.
Anyway, just watch it if you have not already. It will be one of the fastest and most interesting 2 hours you will have this year. Watch it without the subtitles first, then watch it with subtitles on. Also try to watch it in a theatre with Dolby Atmos if you get the chance. I currently have not, but I'm sure I'll see it in a theatre somewhere since this still hasn't been officially been theatrically released in the country I live in.
Also, I want a Parasite themed rock birthday cake XD",

I love the idea of infulltration and contrast in this movie, the idea of contradiction is very prevelant and very well done. This also has one of the tightest screenplays I've seen in a very long time, every single peice of dialouge contributes towards which every setpeice they are trying to sep up. The humour of this movie was absolutley spot on too, delivering clever and defining moments for almost every charcter.",

Wow just wow. Everything in this movie is just so damn captivating. Parasite was directed Bong Joon Ho and man....you sir...take a god damn bow. This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you laugh, cry, get scared, have chills, etc. name any genre and it is all in one. That's why I love it so much it all the genres of any movie and it is in this film just as one. The cast were phenomenal and fantastic. I didn't get to see this in theaters.... and boy does that suck. I loved it so much 2019 had the best movies I have ever seen such as Joker and 1917.

It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape.",

The rich surface is glamorous, behind the drug, the children are rebellious and morbid, and the poor put down the patience and expose the hypocrisy of the face. Who's not a parasite?

I was really excited about that film. Now i am disappointed and wondering why people are so blown away by it. Its okay to watch on a sunday afternoon, but not more at all. I get that there is an underlying critical depiction of the korean two-class-society (that i as a middle class western can not really understand) but the storyline seems to far fetched and the behaviour and dialogue of the protagonists are not convincingly crafted.

Sadly ending of the movie just takes this film downhill way too fast and the final 20 minutes or so is just odd and disjointed. What happens to the wife, daughter and son who lived in the house? what about Min? Surely he returned from his travels? It's like the writer had the perfect idea all the way up to the killing off of characters and then didn't know how to tie up the loose ends. They instead just play on the political message about the gaps in wealth and class which is why I think this film appealed to the Oscar's.",

It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres.

The money was the iron, and it smoothed everything out.
They surf the Internet, live in basements, and do whatever it takes to get a job.
Just when you think they're bad enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they're not the worst, there's worse.
If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you. If you are poor, there must be someone poorer than you.
The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into groups.
The wall stood immovable despite the wind, sun and rain.
Mr And Mrs Park look silly, but they are getting richer.
The Kim family is brilliant, but they still can't turn over.
