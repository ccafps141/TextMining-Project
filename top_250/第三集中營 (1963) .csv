The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.",/

3,27 December 2011,planktonrules,9, Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...,"I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love ""The Great Escape"" as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.",v

It's partially based on facts adapted by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett from a bestselling written by Paul Brickhill . The continuous escapes have caused the Nazi staff ordered 'putting all the rotten eggs in one basket' as the prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp . It deals with hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel air officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of secretly digging an underground tunnel and the last one deals with spectacular breakout and effort the approx. 70 escaped prisoners throughout Germany trying to make their bid to freedom , including an impressive motorcycle pursuit in charge of iconic Steve McQueen for one of the best action sequences in years .",e

But I've been going back and watching all the old classics and The Great Escape is one of the best ones I've seen so far. The movie is not only wildly entertaining throughout it's nearly three hour duration, but shows some actors who went on to become famous for other roles in decades and generations to come. Granted, I am speaking from the perspective of a different generation of moviegoers, which is why I know Charles Bronson more from Death Wish than this film, or James Coburn from films like Payback and Affliction, Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis and Richard Attenborough as John Hammond from the Jurassic Park films.",4

It should be noted that this isn't just a Steve McQueen movie (although he is bound to be everyone's favorite character), but this is an ensemble piece with great performances by Richard Attenborough, James Garner, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence, and Charles Bronson.

15,25 December 2005,bas-21,10," Great Escape,Great movie","This must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the first time,in I guess 1987,a BBC Christmas broadcast,I was captivated by this brilliant piece of work. In the years after,I probably have seen it a ""million"" times,owning it on VHS and DVD,and still watching,whenever it is broadcast,in the original language. Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a good length,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance is brilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,Richard Attenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest roles Donald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn't historically accurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn't matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and their guards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I will not repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will capture you,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. There is excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion. See it,you will not regret it.",2
16,19 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of the all time great war movies,"I cannot dislike The Great Escape, with its great cast, anthem-like music score and of course its attention to detail. The film is brilliantly shot with beautiful cinematography, and of course the music score is great, very iconic. It may be a little annoying to some people, as the theme is repeated over and over again, but there is something triumphant about it so I find it hard not to like it. The script is great, but it is the cast and the attention to detail that sticks in the mind. This escape yarn has everything from collapsing tunnels, probing searchlights to the classic movie image of Hilts attempting to escape to freedom on a motorbike. And then there are the characters, for example we have Donald Pleasence's timid forger, James Garner's smooth-talking scrounger and most obviously Steve McQueen's super cool Captain Virgil Hilts. Garner, Pleasence, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough and Charles Bronson fit their parts perfectly, but for me it is McQueen's movie. Overall, The Great Escape is quite simply great, one of the all time great war movies. 10/10 Bethany Cox",6

18,17 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Film Has Slowed With Age, But Still Merits Praise","Although I still like this film - and proudly own it on disc - I have to admit it was a disappointment seeing it after a long period of time had elapsed between viewings. When I saw this in the theater in 1963, I thought it was spectacular. Later, when it came out on VHS, I thought thought it was good but the longer the years go by, the slower this film gets and it doesn't have the hold on me it once did. Part of that is that movies are faster- moving nowadays.",?
19,1 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,10, A real classic,"THE GREAT ESCAPE is director John Sturges's follow up to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and if anything it's even more epic than his classic western. Once again we have an all-star cast taking place in an action and suspense-filled story, this time about a jailbreak from a prisoner of war camp in Germany. Despite an incredible running time, this film is enjoyable for every second of screen time; it has humour and heart in spades, and of the huge cast, nobody puts a foot wrong. I think Steve McQueen steals all of his scenes here in a show-stopping role, but others like Richard Attenborough and James Garner are more quietly determined while Donald Pleasence and Charles Bronson are the most sympathetic you'll ever see them. A classic and worthwhile tale is told with the budget to tell it properly and the production values are quite brilliant throughout. It's an unashamed fist-thumping classic and a film I never tire of watching; I love it to bits and can't say a bad thing about it.",r
20,24 January 2001,Mike-764,10, Aptly Titled,"The Germans open their new POW camp and send the invites to every British and American escape artist out there. So while waiting for their garden to reap a harvest, they all decide to tunnel out of the place. The tunnel is discovered, but they still have two other ones they're working on so they continue on, even though there are the problems of the forger losing his sight, and one of the tunnel diggers being claustrophobic. They dig out but find themselves 30 feet short of the forest they were going to escape into and the Germans pick up their trail. 3 POW's make it out, 23 are captured and returned to the camp and the remaining 50 are executed. Based on a true story ( with some factual errors, and influenced by Jean Renoir's 1937 film, Grand Illusion ), this film moves very quickly with an adventureous pace and well acted roles, particularly Steve McQueen as the American motorcycling hotshot, Richard Attenbourough as the escape team head, and James Garner as the scrounger. Rating 10 out of 10.",e
21,9 January 2021,gbill-74877,3, Off in tone,"This film may be based on true events and for that the people it's based on have my utmost respect, but this dramatization felt incredibly phony. It's true from the moment the Allied soldiers arrive, are allowed to mill around, and one grabs the top bunk in his sleeping quarters with the glee of a kid arriving at summer camp. There's no feeling that they are worn down, demoralized, or scared for having been in the hell of war and are now captured - they're all squeaky clean in their normal uniforms (not prison attire), show a lot of bravado, and sass the German officers, who are in turn only a slight step above the hapless Colonel Klink from the old TV show Hogan's Heroes. There is no menace or violence from the German guards, and the demeanor and dialogue from everyone rings false. Steve McQueen breaks out his baseball mitt and starts tossing a ball around for Christ sake! I like him in other films but he's awful here, and he's not alone. A dapper, freshly coifed James Garner shares a cigarette and light small talk with an amiable German guard before picking his pocket. A jug of moonshine is made and an American flag is raised before a patriotic parade with fife and drum is led around the compound. It's all ridiculous (true story, bulls***!).",f
22,18 September 2008,qormi,5, Hogan Never Had It So Good,"This film had a stellar cast, and most of them delivered. The score was unusually cheerful and eerie, too. A strange combination. In reality, allied POW's in German detention camps were treated with contempt and without mercy. What we have in this film, however, are a bunch of guys who act like they belong in a country club. The country club/summer camp they reside in is a fun place, except you'll get shot if they catch you climbing the fence. That's it - no mention of the terrible brutality these guys actually endured or the fact that they were given barely enough food to live on. No mention of the atrocities regularly visited upon them by their Nazi captors, including beatings, executions, and forced marches. Instead, we get gentlemanly or comical Germans who seem to actually care what the POW's think of them.",_
23,3 June 2007,thinker1691,10, Escape and the Cooler King,"Back in 1963, a war film arrived on the silver screen which set the standard for all dramas which followed. True there were other great war films such as The War Lover and Twelve O'Clock High, but none of them became the launching point for so many of Hollywood's great screen stars. Paul Brickhill wrote the original true story upon which this film is based on. Furthermore, with Elmer Berstein's rousing musical score, this movie then becomes nothing short of genuine classic. The saga of ""The Great Escape"" is wound around the actual war time experiences of American and British Airmen, who'd been captured and sent to what the German High Command called 'An Escape proof' prisoner of War Camp. Upon seeing the assortment of Hollywood elite, one can not expect anything but great drama and action adventure from the entire cast. Steve McQueen, who plays Capt. Virgil Hilts, ""The Cooler King"" leads an all star line up which consists of James Garner as Hendley ""The Scrounger"", Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, James Donald as Group Capt. Ramsey ""The Senior British Officer"", Charles Bronson is memorable as Danny Velinski ""The Tunnel King"", Donald Pleasence as Blythe, James Coburn as Louis Sedgwick, David McCallum as Ashley-Pitt and Gordon Jackson as MacDonald. They are imprisoned and guarded by Germany's elite guards, commanded by Col. Von Luger (Hannes Messemer) who has been personally selected for the task. Since it's inception, this film has garnered a commanding cult following. It's status is notable as the vehicle which literally propels McQueen up into his stardom. *****",=

I have seen it many times since but not on the big screen. It was meant for the big screen!  It's on my top five list along with The Sand Pebbles. It's a great movie about hope and freedom and man's responsibility to his fellow man.  These men are all near saints; James Garner insisting on Donald Plesence making the escape, Charles Bronson fighting his claustrophobia. Steve McQueen is the star among the stars, not merely because of his motorcycle skills but for  his attempt to save a life and for bringing  the game of ""off the wall"" to the masses.  :-)",t

As you might expect, they try to escape. Repeatedly. Giving the prisoners a lot of time to meet without supervision, the Germans may be foreshadowing the ""Hogan's Heroes"" TV series that poked fun at this film. Top-billed is super-cool Steve McQueen (as Virgil Hilts). He's always earning himself solitary confinement. You'll notice Mr. McQueen looks sharper coming out of ""The Cooler"" than he does going in, sliding his jacket down the wall of the cell without fear of scratching the leather. That's cool...",t

Virgil ""The Cooler King"" Hilts, trying with several other POWs to escape from a Nazi camp, he tunnels his way to coolness. Of course, he isn't the only character. There's visually impaired Flight Lt. Colin ""The Forger"" Blythe (Donald Pleasance), action-ready Flight Lt. Bob Anthony ""The Scrounger"" Hendley (James Garner), flippant Flight Officer Louis ""The Manufacturer"" Sedgwick (James Coburn), Flight Lt.

35,9 January 2013,ironhorse_iv,9, All Hail the Cooler King!,"The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, ""Big X"" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), ""the manufacturer,"" makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is ""the tunnel king"" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), ""The Cooler King,"" whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.",
36,4 March 2017,zkonedog,9," One Of The Best ""Caper"" Films Of All-Time!","Film-making in the 1960s was a different exercise than it is today. It was more about ""putting on a good show"" and appealing to a wide audience instead of focusing on certain key groups. Back then, families went to movies together as ""outings"" and the movies were required to play as such. Sometimes, this leads to strange casting and watered-down plots. Other times, you get a movie like ""The Great Escape"", which combines perfect characters, music, and an intriguing plot to produce a masterpiece of its time.",

38,28 September 2004,aquaman-7,10, Absolutely Awesome!!!,"The Great Escape is a classic war movie with plenty happening in it. It just so happens that it is my all time favourite having seen it 60 times since it first was released. Steve McQueen , as Hilts, was the driving force behind this movie. He seemed to tie everything together between the American and British prisoners especially in the scene where they were celebrating the 4th of July with the drums and good ole fashioned American moonshine. The Great Escape contains one of the most famous movie scenes of all times when McQueen has half of the German army chasing after him while riding his motorcycle trying to jump the barb wire fence to get to Switzerland. All in all, The Great Escape had a cast of actors that was so strong that it was a wonder they got this movie made in the first place with all of the egos involved.

43,10 February 2022,VikingBurialService,7, 40 Minutes Too Long,"Perfect, until it got to the last quarter. The movie sets up this dramatic question of ""Will they escape the prison Camp?"" The first 75% of the movie is great, in that it shows the prisoners trying to do that. But that question gets answered when a subset of the prisoners does escape. The last 25% suddenly jumps to the various escapades of the prisoners trying to get out of Germany. It feels like a 5-minute epilogue - drawn out to 45 minutes. The whole tone of the movie shifts, with the Nazis becoming crueler, and most of the prisoners failing. It feels like the screenwriters decided to take on the final part so they could film in cool setting and add cool stunts.",

What a cast! Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence, Steve McQueen,James Coburn,James Garner, Charles Brosan and David Mccallum. Most of these guys before they got famous as well. One could spent hours creating spy and western connections between the cast. The movie builds up suspense well. You really want them to escape from that camp. Unlike most war movies, this movie actually injects some humor into it.(the moonshine scene a good example)The European scenery is beautiful. It's quite heart wrenching with the escapees get killed or sent back to camp. I'm really glad Hollywood didn't sugar coat it with a happy ending. It would have destroyed the drama.

48,30 November 2007,chrichtonsworld,10, A masterpiece,"This movie was so different then other war movies. It actually showed what happened after soldiers got captured by the Germans. I like the fact that they not depict all the Germans as bad human beings. And that they made clear that there was a distinction between the German army and Hitler's force. Most of the regular army weren't too glad with Hitler. And that fact is not shown too often in movies. ""The Great Escape is a real visual treat with an all star cast.The all star cast (Steve McQueen,James Garner,James Coburn,Charles Bronson and many others)bring the characters to live and make everything very believable. It is fun to see them do everything they can to escape their prison. Escpecially when it comes to Steve McQueen. The scenes where he returns to his cell playing ball after another failed attempt in escaping are classic. Overall the balance between drama,comedy and action is perfect. ""The Great Escape"" is a masterpiece.",

So they secretly dig a tunnel to take them beyond their prison camp's borders. Yet that's only one component of the escape plan, which also requires forged documents, civilian clothing, and tons of luck -- all of which they managed to scrounge up against incredible odds.",
51,3 September 2019,jamesjustice-92,7, Beginning of an era,"I've been meaning to watch ""The great escape"" for a very long time but just couldn't lay my hands on it for some reason - the fact that I've heard so much about this movie and how culturally significant it is to the world of cinema, prevented me from watching it, in fear that I wouldn't like it as much as the rest of the world. So the time has come and I did watch it.
Begins very slow and builds up for the most part for ""the great escape"" itself this is really a waste of a movie: almost non of the characters have a true indentity, a simple background story, even the main characters don't have a decent amount of dialogues - they are simply put there to dig, do the things they are ought to do. I've expected more from a high calibre actors like Steve McQueen or James Garner (whose performances are great by the way) but they all wear the same faces in the movie. The music is good though and even though it doesn't exactly fit to the plot and the place it is set at it makes it all the while a pleasant watch. With ""The great escape"" I'd say the era of so called blockbusters have began when the plot stopped playing the fiddle and the couple of big names thrown can make a difference in the pockets of those who had done the movie. Overall a good picture but nothing more and nothing in between to make it a great one.",
52,4 January 2011,Red-Barracuda,7, A good tragic war-adventure with a few faults,"The true story that The Great Escape is based on is indeed a remarkable one. It's certainly one of the key reasons that this war film has attained such a level of affection over the years. Although, it's ultimately hardly a happy story seeing as many of the participants never made it out alive. This is, for me its greatest trump card. As The Great Escape is essentially a tragedy dressed up as an upbeat war-adventure. It's an unusual combination but it works well. What has made the film so popular is no doubt a combination of this tragic true story with the rousing escape scenes, the all-star cast and the famous music. It's a war film that doesn't really have a lot of action; it's more of a character-based drama for the most part, so the people depicted here are fairly well-drawn. Although it does have to be said that the characters are not faultless – James Coburn has truly the worst Australian accent I have ever heard, Charles Bronson's claustrophobia on the escape night is a tiresome addition to his character seeing as he was instrumental in actually building the tunnel, while Steve McQueen's character came across a little too devil-may-care to be entirely believable - the scene where he knocks over a guard with no repercussions at all was just stretching believability too much for me. In fact, overall, the film made the prisoner-of-war camp out to be a very lenient place indeed, where the inmates were seemingly at liberty to show blatant disrespect to the Germans, and were able to run rings round them quite easily. Now it may be that these details are based on reality, I cannot say with any certainty but I do have my doubts and I think that Hollywood has simply sugar-coated this side of the story. Nevertheless, despite these drawbacks The Great Escape remains an engaging film. Most probably, this is mainly due to the incredible cast at its disposal and a few iconic scenes. But also the simple fact that it's a great story.",

61,27 May 2016,Emmanuel_S,10, An Escape to Remember.,"The Great Escape is one of those films that you could watch time and time again and still love even more with each viewing. Imagine a movie where you would put all the greatest movie stars of their Era in. That's exactly what they did here! The Great Escape is, in my mind, the greatest War movie of all Time. Add to the stellar cast, a score by Legendary Hollywood composer Elmer Bernstein and there you have one of the greatest War movie themes of all Time. A theme with a tune so catchy, so memorable that you might find yourself humming and whistling it as you go through your day. The Great Escape is basically the story of POW during War time in their Nazi detention camp. And what are, not just POW but the best POW, up to in their enemy detention camp? They plan their escape. An escape so ingenious that it involves digging three tunnels at the same time underneath and through their camp to the wood outside. In the main role we have Hollywood Legend, Steve McQueen as Lieutenant Virgil Hilts, a hot shot American pilot who has only one idea in his head, escaping! One of the most interesting scene for me was at the end, when Hilts, recaptured again, is about to be put back in his cell inside the cooler. There you have a German guard ready to put our hero, who incidentally is the personification of the perfect Aryan (according to Hitler), blue eyed and blond hairs, into his cell. As the guard closes the door and walks away from Hilts'cell, he hears the noise of Hilts' baseball bouncing off the walls, back and forth into Hilts' baseball glove. He pauses for an instant as if to ponder whether what he is doing to the embodiment of the perfect German specimen is wrong. He lowers his head, then walks away with his head held down as if to convey that he realizes that what he is doing is indeed wrong and that he could never break Hilts' strong spirit. I highly recommend this all time Classic for all, a masterpiece!",

The tone and atmosphere seem off from the start as the prisoners arrive, swagger about and case the POW camp like they own the place and ultimately they do. It seems more like a summer camp; everything looks too bright and clean including the prisoners who never have a hair out of place. The film is about as persuasive as Hogan's Heroes and arguably less entertaining. There is no real suspense or tension until the end and the film and characters have no depth. In no way does this film compare to Stalag 17 (1953) or The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). At 3 hours long, I found the film tedious and talky.",

71,2 January 2010,johnmschofield,10, The classic war film which still looks and feels amazing nearly fifty years after it was made,Like a lot of other reviewers I always like watching this film and look forward to seeing it because for me its like watching it for the first time. The whole look and feel of the film is unique not just because most of what takes place in the film actually happened but its that indefinable something which sets it apart from most other war films. Yes there is a cast list to grace any film creation and it is clear that a lot of attention was given to make it as 'authentic' as possible but there is something there which I can only describe as magical. It seems that in order for the American viewing public to pay and watch this film the nationality of some of the cast was changed but in my opinion the changes only add to the films atmosphere. What I find stunning is that it also seems that in the real life escape preparations 600 men were involved for well over a year. How secrecy was maintained by so many for so long leaves me in awe of the discipline and the planning which must have taken place inside a prison in a the middle of a war. Yes all in all this three hour film is impressive in every way and for the first time viewer please let me reiterate most of what takes place in this film actually happened. Once seen never forgotten is how I would describe this film.,

73,11 October 2002,CharltonBoy,7, Hardly the great escape!,"The Great Escape is a film that everybody raves about and looks back at with rose tinted glasses . Having seen this for the first time in 20 years i think this is a good film but maybe overrated simply for the fact the ,one , it is way too long at 2 hours and 45 minutes and secondly there are so many silly moments they could never have happened for real. ***** SPOILER ALERT******** It looked like a holiday camp to me with all the prisoners mixing with each other at any times they wanted. They could treat the guards with distane and could get hold of anything they wanted.Why get shot escaping, just stay there and enjoy it until the war is over. Why put all the top RAF escape's in one camp? Surely you would split them up.The Comandant and guards looked like the most inept German soldiers i have ever seen in a war film. Why call the film the Great Escape ? It was hardly great. only 25 escaped and 50 were shot dead! James Coburn's accent was laughable too. Having said all that the film is still ok but mainly down to the musical score by Elmer Bernstien. The music makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up because it is so rousing. Only one other musical score is better than the Great Escape and that is the one for The Magnificent Seven and that is Elmer Bernstien's work too. Steve Mqueen has an aura about him too that not many actors have ever possesed and it is such a shame that he died when he did. 7 out of 10.",

76,25 July 2019,truemythmedia,10," Give 'em Hell, boys!","The escape itself happens a little more than halfway through the film, and most of the rest of the movie focuses on the allied trying to evade capture. The men are mostly spread out at this point, and some of them are captured almost immediately, while others give way to a much better chase. As these scenes played out, I kept thinking back to the first meeting between Attenborough and the German officer, and how Attenborough insists that it's their duty to make the German's lives hell. That's what this movie is really about. Even though some of the prisoners do escape, that wasn't the entire point. The point was to make the German soldiers hate every waking moment of their lives, and in that, the allied soldiers succeeded admirably. I think that's why I liked this movie more than even ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", the only other comparable POW camp movie I've seen. ""Bridge"" is a fantastic film filled with wonderful high adventure, but this film isn't about blowing up a bridge or accomplishing some great task (though if they'd all escaped that would've been something great indeed), this movie is just about sticking it to the oppressive powers with everything you have; it's about fighting what's evil even if the only thing you can do in the long run is irritate it and make it more angry.

Movie Since ""Stalag 17!""","Director John Sturges had been struggling for eleven years to produce a movie based on Paul Brickhill's non-fiction bestseller ""The Great Escape"" (1949), an autobiographical account of one of the largest Allied prisoner of war break out attempts in World War II. An Australian Royal Air Force pilot, who had been incarcerated in Stalag Luft III, Brickhill documented the escape of 250 British POWs to tie up German troops behind the lines. The plan involved the digging of three tunnels far beneath the ground to avoid sound detection from microphones buried in the earth. The POWs considered every angle of this massive enterprise. Tailors converted uniforms into civilian clothing. Forges duplicated passes, permits, identity cards. Not only did the tunnels have to be excavated, but the POWs also had to dispose of the soil without arousing the suspicions. Brickhill participated in the two-year long escape plan and served as the man in charge of the security stooges who shielded the forgers from the German security guards that acted as 'ferrets' trying to flush out escape attempts. British South African pilot Roger Bushnel, head of the escape committee, envisaged taking out 250, but only 76 managed to getaway before the Germans discovered them. Eventually, only three escaped, while the Germans recovered another 23 men. The Gestapo captured the remaining fifty and Adolph Hitler ordered them executed by firing squad. ",

85,8 February 2011,EijnarAmadeus,6, No great escape.,"THE GREAT ESCAPE is another overrated ""classic"" that somehow seems to stumble along film history on its good reputation. Very little about it is great, as the title suggests, and so one sits through 170+ minutes only partly enjoying the company of POWs in a Nazi camp. A Nazi camp however that's pretty far removed from anything I've imagined, heard or read about German Concentration Camps during WWII, as the film portrays it as quite a relaxed and sunny condition. The characters we're in it for are a bunch of guys that tods along happily enough aiming to escape, and while there are several neat moments among them, one character seems unclear; Steve McQueen's Captain Hilts, if not a weird character, certainly an annoying performance by McQueen. Through the hours of planing the escape, the jovial and cheerful mood of the film helped me get through it, and as we're headed out at the end I felt disappointed, as the supposed great climax is somehow disjointed and lackluster.",

Then add the cinematography, great Elmer Bernstein score, screenplay, and direction. The visuals, acting, and action are all first-rate. These are the ingredients of a fantastic film. With plenty of humor and suspense, this is a movie for everyone to see at least once. However, even repeated viewings don't diminish this film.",

This is not for the whole film and the horrors of Nazi Germany and WWII are in full display here but much of the film is fun rather than dark.

89,16 September 2007,rickhavoc1,10, One Movie That Should NEVER be Remade!!,"How could any movie maker even CONSIDER doing a remake of this all-time classic? It would be as great a travesty as some musical group thinking they could record a better version of ""All Along the Watchtower"" than Jimi Hendrix!! Just look at how awful the remake of Rollerball was! This is one of those movies that stands the test of time as it is, and just can't be outmatched. How could any present-day actor top the cool performance of Steve McQueen? Or match the intensity of Sir Richard Attenborough? Or the quiet desperation of Donald Pleasence, who actually WAS a POW? Or the cockiness of James Garner, who used his experience as a scrounger in Korea to make his performance more realistic? Or the ingenuity of David McCallum? Or the realism of Charles Bronson, who, with his Polish descent, makes his portrayal of a Polish, (NOT Russian), flier so true to life? Or match Angus Lennie's portrayal of a man being pushed over the edge of insanity by long confinement? Or match the combination of coolness, ingenuity, and frustration of James Coburn, who actually did a convincing Aussie accent. Pay attention to the scene where he shows Big X, (Attenborough), his ingenious air pump and air ducts. Watch his face when, right after Big X tells him ""good job"", he tells him to ""Have it installed by tonight."" That's great acting! Why can't Hollywood realize that we're getting fed up with an endless stream of remakes that just don't hold a candle to the originals? There are so many stories from WWII that haven't been brought to the big screen. *RANT* What's wrong with some of these people who complain that the conditions in the camp aren't realistic? WERE YOU THERE? It is a well documented fact that the Germans, especially the Luftwaffe, were very careful to follow the rules laid down by the Geneva Convention in their treatment of British, French, and American POWs. It's also a fact that Luftwaffe officers felt a kinship with other fliers that transcended wartime enmity. For instance, when Douglas Bader, (the man who was famous for flying with two prosthetic legs), was shot down and captured, he lost one of them bailing out. General Adolph Galland, who was in command of the fighter arm of the Luftwaffe, notified the British of his damaged leg and offered them safe passage to drop off a replacement. They also became friends after the war. (Read Reach for the Sky: The Story of Douglas Bader DSO, DFC. by Paul Brickhill and The First and the Last: Germany's Fighter Force in WWII by Adolph Galland) So the depiction of the treatment of the prisoners in the movie WAS accurate! To my knowledge, the ONLY Luftwaffe officer to be tried for war crimes was that fat fool Hermann Goring, and it wasn't for anything he did as commander of the Luftwaffe. Putting him in charge of the Luftwaffe had to be one of the biggest blunders Hitler committed! As for the guard's seeming ineptness, I guess you weren't paying attention when Big X told the POWs to set up a system of watchers to signal whenever a guard or a ferret got close enough to see or hear anything. Or to all the scenes showing all the diversions the prisoners used to distract the guards. It's also factual that the Germans allowed prisoners to keep their uniforms and badges of rank. This was intended to make escape more difficult, for one thing, and the Germans had enough problems with shortage of resources for another. *END OF RANT* All in all, watching this movie will be one of the most enjoyable 2 hours and 52 minutes you'll ever spend. There's just NO WAY anybody could ever do a better remake of it, and it would be as big a blunder as the one I mentioned above to even try! 10/10",
90,4 August 2016,KineticSeoul,7," Inspirational filmmaking, but a bit boring from time to time.","This isn't the most exciting or suspenseful escape movie. I was actually a bit bored from time to time while sitting through this one. But I do have respect and appreciation for this ensemble piece that is based on a true story. And how it tried to stay true to what really went down. I was surprised though at how it goes in a more civilized and whimsical direction despite it being a P.O.W. film. Even the intro music is whimsical and is very iconic to the point that there has been a lot of parodies done with that music. The main reason I wanted to check this movie out was because it is on the favorite movies list from some of my favorite directors. I can however see how this movie inspired some of the other directors and how they borrowed certain ideas from this movie. Maybe it's because the director decided to take more of a upbeat approach to the story. Since the cinematography and camera-work seems to be done from a distance to get wider shots, which sort of takes away from the tension and excitement. But maybe it was to get all the characters in without leaving anyone out. The running time is actually quite long, almost hitting the three hours mark. So a better editing and tightening of the script would have made this film more effective in my opinion. This is a P.O.W. movie the whole family can sit through without it offending anyone. Although the kids will most definitely will get bored sitting through this one. Overall, this was a fresh take on this genre and I didn't mind sitting through it. It's a movie that gives ideas, but just isn't something I would want to re- watch immediately.",

It is basically all about prisoners in a German PoW (Prisoner of War) camp trying everything they can to escape, e.g. hiding in trucks with trees in them, dressing as Russians being released, and many other attempts. Then everyone has the idea of a tunnel, but to make certain they can still escape, they make three tunnels in different locations with different names. Eventually after long hours of digging, keeping quiet, and diversions, they do manage to succeed in getting at least 70 men out, but some are killed, and the ending is a very amusing one.

My parents always brought me a blanket so I could sleep in the back seat, but I stayed up for this one. The cast is excellent, with many memorable characters. Steve McQueen is at his peak, along with James Garner and Richard Attenborough. Based on a true story, a group of POWs from many allied nations plan a daring tunnel escape from a German camp. We see them plan, prepare, and dig the tunnels (3) as they elude detection from their captors. I have only one issue; the conditions of the camp are presented as a little too pristine, not dirty or squalid as in other POW movies like Stalag 17 or Von Ryan's Express. The prisoners here are always well fed and well groomed, with cleaned and pressed uniforms. But that can be overlooked because overall, the movie is excellent. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueen's case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. All in all, a WW2 epic.",

99,25 November 2002,garp15,10, Great movie!,"This movie could easily make my top 15 of all time.  From what I have read, it was QUITE realistic.  Several of the British officers that were actually there went to the site in Germany when it was filmed.  When something was wrong, they spoke up and got it fixed. (This has been on the History Channel several times.) There were almost no Americans, if any, at the time of escape.  They had been moved to another camp only a couple of weeks prior to the escape. Many of the prime characters were based on actual people, most notably Attenborough. I also read the book (about 30 years ago) in high school pm which the movie was based.  They had photos the Germans took of the tunnels. The movie was incredibly accurate. The tracks, the air pumps, lights, etc. It isn't the movie that was amazing, it was what the prisoners did. As far as how the prisoners were treated, for the most part, relatively well.  The death rate in a German POW camp was about 1-2%.  In a Japanese prison camp, about 35% of the Allied prisoners died, due to murder, torture, disease, starvation, etc.  The Luftwaffe, headed by Fatso Goering, guarded Allied airman because Goering had a weird sense of camaraderie with fellow flyers.  The Gestapo or SS are the ones who shot the 50 prisoners.  These war criminals were later faced war crimes trials. This is one hell of a movie. But find the book yourself.",

It is the kind of sacrifice that my generation just didn't ""get"" and now that I am older have the utmost respect for. The generation that fought that war is truly the great generation of the 20th century. And one of my biggest regrets ever is that I did not watch it that night with my dad. It would have been a great bonding experience and maybe I would have gotten even more out of it watching it with someone who was actually in that war.

111,15 August 2020,dfloro,8," A very good ""guy's movie"" that's too long","I know dudes that would give this movie a 10/10, but I have to subtract just a couple of points: one point for its duration (just short of 3 hours), and one point for (appropriately, of course) not having a single female character in it! Don't POWs receive cards/letters from home and have flashbacks re: wives or girlfriends? How about a Rita Hayworth wet dream? Nothing? Really? OK, then. So let's talk about what's right about it. First is the iconic performance by Steve McQueen as ""The Cooler King."" My wife never liked McQueen, unusually I think, because of his too-cool demeanor and a face that betrayed little or no emotion. I tried to explain that's what guys LIKED about him, because we admired/envied him those qualifies, but she didn't get it. Note that McQueen insisted on the motorcycle scene, both so he could jump the fence (himself, of course) and also be filmed in costume as one of the Germans chasing him (also himself)! My second favorite part of this movie is the relationship between the James Garner & Donald Pleasance characters. The former grows to admire Pleasance's nebbish ""Forger,"" and the latter is inspired to display unexpected bravery in the very difficult circumstances in which they both find themselves. As is usual for them, British actors McCallum and Attenborough do bang-up jobs, too. Although never a real fan of Bronson or Coburn, I find myself liking them better here than in ""The Magnificent Seven.""

I remember wondering when I first saw this as a teenager why the Germans would allow a person in solitary confinement to have games to play.  Now I know 39 years later; they wouldn't. Considering how heroic the actual events really were it is shame to see them made to look so cartoonish in this vehicle for Steve McQueen.  Good thing for him the German's didn't know what was being planned in all those private POW rooms available to those crazy flyboy prisoners.  I noticed on the DVD box someone called it the greatest World War II movie ever made.  If it is then I guess the WW II veterans I talked to were really embellishing how tough it was.  I am not completely panning this movie because it is fun to see some very good performers in their younger years (I gave it 5 out of 10).

Hilts isn't the only prisoner who wants out, a few others hatch a plan to get 250 men out in one night.  How its executed is a stroke of pure genius and skill.  The movie has a vast variety of characters who are allowed to show their feelings, which is a nice touch.  There two characters who make solid examples and I cared for the most.  One is Colin Blythe (the late Donald Pleasence), a gentle Brit who specializes in forging names and goes blind.  The other one in Danny Willinski (Charles Bronson), a Russian who excells in digging tunnels and tends to get rattled.

Rarely in a war movie are we shown the prisoner's point of view after a long time in captivity.  The detail that is shown in this film about the escape process and all the people, thought and preparation that is involved will mesmerize you.  And, if you can't get enough, then I also recommend Jean Renoir's French film, The Grand Illusion, which is similar, but not nearly as good as The Great Escape. After seeing The Great Escape, you'll want to run out and rent anything that stars Steve McQueen.  And you will never forget this movie--I promise.",
131,22 July 2006,Robert_duder,9, Strange feelings about this film...read on...,"How can a film that I first of all never saw until yesterday, that I laughed at in the first 45 minutes because of inconsistent, unrealistic and blatant comedy and scenes, be a classic that by the end of it all...I absolutely was in love with?? This film has some magical powers and one of those powers is an ensemble cast that when spoke about really gets the short end of the stick. Steve McQueen is always hailed as the story and his name is always attached to this film and yet he isn't the star. He's a big part of it sure and his name was the big attraction back in 1963 but what makes The Great Escape is the incredible ensemble cast that each play their vitally important role and create these memorable classic characters. The problem with The Great Escape is first and foremost...it's not really a Great Escape. Fifty Men are shot and killed, and what like one man finally escapes and possibly not even him?? 250 Escape (although it looks more like 50 TOPS when the Escape finally happens,) and all of them are recaptured and the film ends where it begins. It seems so anti climatic. On top of that is this truly a truthful look at a German POW Camp in Germany?? These men arrive at the camp looking Healthy, vibrant, strong, clean cut, and professional to a place that is better than Summer Camps that I went to. Gardening?? Baseball?? Cooking?? Drawing Classes?? Ummm...yeah...I admit I was never in a German POW Camp but I'm regretting it now having seen these wonderful conditions. Yes I know it can be argued that one man is shot trying to escape and later on the Gestapo murders 50 escapees but their time in the camp prior to this is pretty nice. The Germans practically hand them the tools and time they need to prep for escape even after knowing that the men are going to attempt escape they are hardly guarded, never looked in on and are allowed everywhere within the camp and left alone frequently. It's absurd!! So all this being said why am I thinking about the film right now and how incredible it was and how it's now one of my favorites?? MAGIC!! The film a cold hard classic and it just embodies, action, comedy, real characters that are brought to live with some great performance.",

149,5 April 2006,Hitchcoc,8, It's Great Escapist!,"I guess we can all call Hollywood to task for its war movies. Until recently, they were pretty sanitized. Did you ever see a John Wayne movie where his buddies were beheaded or dismembered. People die in a nice peaceful way, usually throwing their arms in the air, slinging their guns behind them. We don't even see the wound. When ""The Great Escape"" came out, this was pretty much the case. The other prisoner of war movie to gain popularity with the general population was ""Stalag 17"" with Robert Ryan as the bad guy. Does it matter. If we are going to stretch reality anyway, can we make our Germans the way we want them. We can make our allied prisoners experts in various types of demolition and subterfuge. With that understood, we now create a magical effort to fool those bad guys and make a grand escape from the prison camp. The writers did a nice job, building suspense and anticipation. Enough roadblocks are thrown up to make it fun. And, of course, this is a real prison camp with real guards and real bullets. No one should look at the ripoff mentality of ""Hogan's Heroes"" and think that there is a comparison. As one writer said, the Germans would not have been too happy with what was going on and wouldn't have been so careless and so dumb. Nevertheless, like any adventure movie worth its salt, this is great fun.",

This is a historical and well-known fact, and we can even visit the camp, which has been preserved. But don't expect this film to be a faithful reconstruction of the facts, because it is not. The film abuses of creative liberty and much of what we see in the film was invented or restructured.

156,8 March 2003,pchemoc389,10, A classic moment for the stars,"Apart from the fact that it was a unique and great adventure epic, The Great Escape made important contributions to the career of a number of American and British male stars and would-be stars.   This was due in part to director/producer John Sturges' particular intuition for the choice of actors and to effective, well-balanced characterizations which served as vehicles to several their players.  Interestingly, none of the film's performers were big stars at the time and only McQueen, Garner and Attenbourough were well-known leading men.  Primarily, the movie of course launched Steve McQueen to major stardom, only a few years after Sturges' The Magnificent Seven established the actor's lone hero persona on the big screen.  McQueen stands out as a daring and cynical individualist, who appears unmoved and downright impertinent when being thrown in and out of the prison camp's cooler, and culminates in a classic motorcycle chase. But in a somewhat less glamorous manner, James Garner arguably gives a superior performance as the ""scrounger"", the prisoner gathering most of the essential materials of the escape through his wit, relaxed charm and resourcefulness. McQueen's admittedly impressive characterization sometimes comes a bit too close to parody and spectacular heroics, in the end lacking some credibility.  Garner, on the other hand, manages a more subtle, understated humour, not distracting from the seriousness of his work and the stakes involved in the escape.  Meanwhile, Richard Attenborough is also excellent as the mastermind of the escape, forcefully portraying a man convinced of his mission and ready to make sacrifices and ruthless decisions to achieve it.  From the rest of the cast, Charles Bronson probably stands out most, projecting strength and determination as the head of the tunnel diggers, while towards the end, effectively conveying a vulnerable, tortured side of his character (even though the fact that the ""Tunnel King"" turns out to be a closet claustrophobic stretches credibility somewhat).  Donald Pleasance gives some outstanding pieces of acting when his character gradually turns blind before the escape.  The evolution of his friendship with Garner provides an interesting plot and character development, as Pleasance's traditional British ways and habits contrasts amusingly with Garner's easy-going and open American style.  James Donald also does very well as the senior British officer, providing thoughtful, sensitive and self-effacing leadership.  The other protagonists do not have sufficient screen time to make their characters more than moderately interesting, but  James Coburn shines as a brash Australian who ends up escaping on a stolen bicycle, David McCallum has some brief but noticeable moments, particularly when disguised as a German civilian during his escape, and Gordon Jackson gives some bright support to Attenbourough, providing a human touch to balance the excessive seriousness of the latter's character.  The attention spent to the fate and personality traits of all these characters, enliven by the engaging and usually flawless acting of the players, had much to do in creating and maintaining the interest of The Great Escape, making it a lot more than a big and exciting action film.  For McQueen, Garner, Attenborough, Bronson, Coburn, Pleasance and McCallum, The Great Escape represents some of the finest moments in their long illustrious careers.",

From bouncing the baseball in his cell to the edge-of-your-seat motorcycle stunts he steals the film every time he comes onscreen. The plot is based on a real life escape from a German POW camp in WWII and follows the group who hatched the plot from it's inception to it's aftermath.  Other notable performances include Donald Pleasance and the even a passable role from James Garner.  Not to mention Sir Richard Attenborough, Charlie Bronson etc - the list seems endless.

Some, tongue in cheek situations, that keep the pace of the film from being too serious. A wonderful, and eclectic cast of characters comprise the film, and they all seem to work well together. There isn't that awkward pairing of actors that don't play well off each other, like so many of todays Hollywood output. You have accomplished foreign actors like Richard Attenborough, and Donald Pleasance, who lend a credibility to the film. And then you have some rather brash, unpolished, but extremely talents yanks, like Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn. They have a playful quality about them, they come across as the young braggarts, a bit loose with their approach, but a nice contrast to the stiff regimen of the British army. This film uses the escape, not so much as a central focus, but rather more like a centerpiece. A thing of beauty and and great effort, but something that will oftentimes get overlooked due to the playing out of the occasion. The performances here overshadow a quite riveting story (based upon a true life happening), about a daring escape plan hatched by the allied prisoners of a German P.O.W camp. They see themselves as contributing to the war effort by creating as much chaos and havoc as possible, naturally this will be brought about with an escape of a great number of prisoners, they plan on two hundred, and the subsequent search by the German army for the escapees behind enemy lines.

If you think about it, escaping from a POW camp and getting recaptured at the end after following the details of the escape for nearly three hours is a bit of a cheat.

But once they start escaping, the suspense builds as you would expect. That was my favorite part of the movie, since it lasted at least half and hour yet I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. But it was the ending that I felt was the best part from a historical standard. The ending sadly contains 50 of the prisoners being shot by the gestapo with many other returned to the camp. Even Steve McQueen's Hilt goes back in the cooler where he started, making for an anticlimactic ending. However, this shows how much the filmmakers cared about historical accuracy.

It is not a war film. It is an ESCAPE film. They are trying to ESCAPE from the war, along with other things they are also trying to ESCAPE from, such as the wire, the feel of endless isolation in confinement, the guards, not being able to see their families, their jobs in the ""Big X"" organization, etc. The reason that I said that they are trying to ESCAPE from their jobs in the ""Big X"" organization is because would you rather be doing your job in the ""Big X"" organization, or would you rather be at home with your family, in your own country? I would rather be at home with my family, in my own country. I like how the prisoners are always prepared for when the Germans come and the prisoners are working on their escape. As soon as they see the Germans coming their way, the prisoners sound their alarms, and BAM! they have put everything back to normal, and you could never have told they were planning an escape, unless you searched the place, which the Germans never seem to think of doing. Also, it works the same way when the Germans leave the room- BAM! they have their forged papers, or tools to work on the tunnel, or fake uniforms, out and working on them. AMAZINGLY PRECISE! It seems ironic to me that MacDonald(Intelligence), played by Gordon Jackson, warned another escapee that he had to watch himself with the language, he said this during the time for the preparation of the escape. But later, when MacDonald and Bartlett are boarding the bus, and the German officer says ""Good Luck"" in English, MacDonald says ""Thank you"" in English, also. Then MacDonald realizes the mistake that he made, and because of him, they both have to run, then they get caught, put in a truck, drive out to the country, and get shot down by murderous German officers. Ironic, isn't it? MacDonald warned somebody else about not making a mistake, and then he got caught because he made the very same mistake!",

A Must See!,"""The Great Escape"" is one of those classic movies that parents seem to have a tough time getting their kids to sit down and watch it with them.  Now, with that in mind, I am a 16-year-old male.  I first saw this movie about three years ago when my mother managed to sit me down and have me watch it, and I LOVE this movie! There's really nothing bad you can say about this movie.  It starts off a little slow, but before you know it, you become very intrigued in the story. And before the process of the escape even began, I became very interested in the characters themselves.  Bronson's character, for example, probably received most of my sympathy throughout the film, because of his claustrophobia. This movie did a excellent job of forcing the audience to become involved in the characters before the initial escape even began.  And when that moment came, I was just as interested then as I was in the beginning of the movie. Great action sequences, too, even for an older movie.  And, as far as the acting goes, there were good performances all around (even by Charles Bronson!).  If you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY recommend it!  And, if you have kids in their teens, have them sit down and enjoy it with you. Hey, that's what happened in my situation, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  10/10!",

But everything was just too easy, again something of the sixties films.

I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four.

Was all the effort worth it? The film tells the more or less true story of British prisoners in a World War II German POW camp. The prisoners considered it their duty to try and escape, to confound and harass the enemy. But what would it take to consider the operation a success? The plan was to bust out 250 prisoners. Sounds great. But it wasn't as simple as digging a tunnel and popping up on the other side of the fence a free man. Once you exit the tunnel you're in Nazi Germany with the Gestapo hot on your heels. For all the incredibly hard work that went into the digging of the tunnel getting out of the camp was always going to be the easy part. Getting out of Germany was the hard part. And for all the meticulous planning that went into that part of the operation there was always the sense that might be a hill too high to climb. And if that effort failed the consequences would be dire. Was it all worth it? Was it really such a great escape after all? ",

211,3 May 2020,jayjaycee,9, Charismatic cast in a stylish and elegant story,"""The Great Escape"" is a 1963 war adventure drama directed by John Sturges starring Steve McQueen and James Garner. Just like I am a sucker for space dramas and westerns, there is also another subgenre I like to visit from time to time: prison break movies. Even though I haven't seen the TV show of the exact same name, I still can claim that I have seen enough to consider myself a fan of the genre. From Stallone's pseudo intelligent fun flick ""Escape Plan"" to Eastwood's all time classic ""Escape From Alcatraz"" I have seen most of them, but only after getting deeper into the 1960s and making enquiries about a cinematic era that now belongs to one of my favourites, I stumbled over this essential entry as well. Since Frank Bullitt himself stars in the leading role, I could not wait to check it out, but since the film amounts to almost three hours of runtime, I haven't had the time to give it watch earlier. Now that the pandemic still incapacitates any form of social life, and I am stuck at home I thought it was finally time to get down to it and see McQueen and his fellows trying to escape. It was probably the best idea I have had in the past few weeks, because even with this epic duration I wasn't bored once while watching it. Also, you know you are watching an iconic film when you recognize the main theme even if you haven't seen the film ever before, but several homages and parodies. It immediately got me in the mood for what was about to come and what came then was simply splendid. Director Sturges managed to assemble one of the most charismatic and at the same time talented casts I have ever seen in a film. Aside from McQueen you got James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence and even a surprisingly convincing Charles Bronson. Those are only the biggest names and it doesn't change the fact that every single actor, from leading role to small supporting role was absolutely charismatic and authentic in their own unique way. Since the film is based on spectacular true events that took place in a detention camp somewhere in Germany and the fact that I am German myself, I was simply impressed by the extreme authenticity this film offered. Not only was the setting atmospheric and true to the story (it was actually shot on location in southern Germany), it was such a delight to see that they casted actual compatriots in the respective roles. What many from outside of my country probably aren't able to evaluate is how brilliant the pronunciation of every single actor was. Of course, it was easy for the German native speakers to deal with their mother tongue, but it was impressive how all the anglophone actors proved their certain skill. For example, I never thought I would see how a young John Hammond diverts suspicion from himself by fluently phrasing that he is not an Englishman (""Ich bin kein Engländer!""). The other way round, it was not less impressive how the Germans proved their skills in the English language and the fact that they all of course had a distinctive accent made it even more suave. No, this film doesn't lack credibility in the slightest and it is only one small aspect of the greatness that unfolds in the following hours. Aside from this, it was extremely fascinating to see how the film establishes its characters. Even though I was mildly confused by the fact that McQueen's Hilts is in the cooler most of the time and plays only a small but significant role (hence the nickname ""The Cooler King"", I guess), I think it was quite an achievement how this film handled so many different characters and made me sympathize with every single one of them nevertheless. Every one of them got his bit of spotlight in the process and I loved to see them planning their next big escape. To the last man, every single one had an individual personality and played an important role in this ultimate master plan. Let's put it this way, they all lived up to their nicknames. What did the Luftwaffe expect from putting the best and most infamous jailbreakers together in one prison? Appropriate behaviour? Hardly likely. Of course, they do what they do best and begin planning already on the day they arrive. Considering how they elaborate a strategy you can see that they don't do it for the first time. The most outstanding aspect about the whole plan though is how highly sophisticated it is. From start to finish its elaborated and calculates any form of hazard and advantage. It is this extreme dedication, this extraordinarily high love for detail in both the plan and the screenplay that depicts it that make this film so incredibly entertaining. It is remarkably well paced and allows the viewer to dig into the story and the characters without letting it become too boring. Furthermore, it fortunately features enough hazards and dangers that threaten the execution of the plan so that it never loses its tension and doesn't proceed too easily. While it spends the first two hours on depicting the elaboration and execution of the plan, the last third shows how the lucky few escapees try to deal with the last steps of their flight, outside of prison walls and barbed wire. Believe it or not, in this final act the individual fates differ extremely from case to case and with the Gestapo and SS on their heels it even creates some extremely intense scenarios full of suspense. The work of several weeks might be shattered in the matter of seconds and the characters do their absolute best to not get caught and the enemy is so close to busting them several times. The scenarios cannot be any more differently packing. For instance, while the situation of Bartlett and Mac is more of a stealth mission, Hilts literally goes full throttle and involuntarily embarks on a reckless motorcycle pursuit over green meadows (and border fences). Thus, the film offers an extreme range of emotional scenes in the end, going from suspenseful and quiet sequences to action packed and loud scenes over the whole course. On top of that, it also includes some instances of subtle humour and even a few seriously sad moments in the end. Is this film perfect then? Close to, but if there is one thing, I am not hundred percent satisfied with, it has got to be the general handling of the prisoners by the German soldiers. The leadership lacked this specific authority and brutality and the lightness it shows was a little weird to see. I mean, you have dozens of the most infamous breakaways cooped up in one camp and their leader officially stated that his men are trying to escape on every cost. Considering this, the security precautions were ridiculously low and the routine inspections fairly rare. Just like they wanted them to try to escape in some way. Well, but that's only criticism at the highest stage, as it still worked out that way and didn't disturb the narration in any way. All in all, this film is an authentic and atmospheric entry to the genre and knows to entertain in many ways, thanks to one of the most charismatic and talented casts, an ingeniously written screenplay and plot and a moody cinematography and an iconic score and main theme. It delivers a historically accurate and massive fun for fans of the genre and offers a lot of brilliant ideas to keep your attention during its fairly extreme run time. I personally haven't felt bored once and it flied by without letting it become any less entertaining. It is grippingly narrated, stylish and elegant and probably the ultimate prison break movie if not the greatest escape film of all time. Splendid!",
212,21 March 2021,briancham1994,8, As great as the title promises,"This film is a great account of a historical prison escape during World War II, filled with a variety of memorable characters and plots. It is heavier on the escapist entertainment than the heavy drama found in more violent works like Schindler's List. While there is some suspense and violence, it is never very brutal and is aimed for a general audience. The conditions in the camp itself are surprisingly lenient, with the prisoners allowed things like sharp metal tools and chocolate; even more surprising is that this part is historically accurate as well. Within these confines, we follow the exploits of some brave and plucky men as they try their luck at various plans and plots. ""Luck"" is the key word here as this is not embellished heroism; there are plenty of failures and setbacks. Even once they escape, there are daring escapades trying to get across Germany and into Switzerland where they will find freedom, and most of them do not survive. This sense of unpredictability keeps the audience on their toes as we want to see these relatable figures make it all the way.",

Humor is something rarely seen in a war movie but director John Sturges does a great job of inserting comic relief into the film.

If it means thwarting the Nazis in the process then so be it. It plays out under a banner of surprisingly upbeat, somewhat comical, borderline happy-go-lucky entertainment – it seems most of the characters held within the prisoner of war camp, which we spend most of the film's runtime within, are quite enjoying trying to escape; frustrating the Nazi officials; repeatedly risking their lives and, oddest of all, spending time in a small concrete six by four hole which is named 'The Cooler'. War films demand conflict, and they usually demand a certain sense of action spectacle which, handled, correctly doubles up as the film's bloody and unappealing warfare; The Great Escape appears to want to have it every other which way. Here is a war film that has so much fun for its first hour and a half that when the time comes for its character to bolt for the blue, it isn't sure how to deal with some of their expeditions into the wider unknown and flits uncontrollably from ups to downs, morphing its atmosphere rather uncontrollably from terror to tragedy to excitement to relief and then back again.",

As an Englishman, every time I hear the theme tune, I can't help but smile, and think of Steve McQueen on his motorbike, Richard Attenborough and his crafty ways as ""Big X"", and the rest of this rare cast that made this picture truly special. It captivates the audience and holds you in suspense and enjoyment unlike few other war films ever could. But more than anything, this movie influences all who watch it. It makes you think about the reality behind the spectacular story, and makes you want to return and watch the whole experience time and again. A masterpiece and true classic.",
225,25 December 2013,l_rawjalaurence,8, Archetypal Prisoner-of-War Drama,"Over the last half-century THE GREAT ESCAPE has established itself as THE prisoner-of-war drama for future directors interested in the genre to emulate. There are other films which can compete for this title (Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 (1953)) is a good candidate), but John Sturges' film simply gets everything right, from the ensemble cast to the locations and Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme tune. There is no need to rehearse the plot; rather we should pay attention to the way Sturges creates character cameos to show how the escape was essentially a team effort in which everyone - regardless of rank or nation - played their part. Donald Pleasance's Blythe (""The Forger"") proves exceptionally adept at his task, even though his myopia hinders the escape when it actually takes place. Charles Bronson's Danny (""The Tunnel King"") becomes almost paralyzed with fear when the time comes to escape; it is as if he cannot contemplate the prospect of life outside. Even James Donald, as the SBO (Senior British Officer) has his part to play - although not actively involved in the escape - he knows how to manage his German captors. The set-designs (Kurt Ripberger) and photography (Daniel L. Fapp) are wondrous; we get sense of the claustrophobia of the prison-camp, which is only exacerbated in the tunnels; this is contrasted with the wide expanses of the Alps as the fugitives make their futile bids to reach the Swiss border. While there might be some slightly jarring elements (James Coburn's Australian accent is rather eccentric, to be polite), THE GREAT ESCAPE is nothing less than a timeless classic.",

We had film shows once every 2 weeks and the most popular were always of the patriotic kind like Zulu or The Guns of Navarone but when The Great Escape came along I was hooked and the entire school was in uproar and cheering when Steve Mcqueen hurls his motorbike over the barbed wire ( The single most memorable and exciting scene from any film ever!!). Being involved in the film industry I was very excited back in 1995 as part of the VE day celebrations to give a special screening of The Great Escape at a Big Screen Cinema and have as a special guest speaker a former prisoner at Stalag Luft 111 in 1943 and involved in the actual escape plans, Mr Alan E. Bryatt.  As a piece of entertainment he agreed that the film was excellent and in many ways quite accurate (although the actual escape took place in snowbound conditions!)

The movie is about a true escape from a POW camp during WW2. The movie was star studded and well done and I think the characters that I adored the most were the James Garner character and the Donald Pleasance characters as they just brought a humanity to the screen. I liked the fact that the movie was full of character and had a sense of hope in it as the prisoners tunnelled out yet if I did have a problem with the movies it was with the Richard Attenbrough character and his cohorts as the leaders. I found they did nothing in many regards while everyone else was working hard with the tunnel while their characters just did squat. I was not sad to see them shot but was saddened when Donald Pleasance character died and that is because they were unlikeable compared to the rest.,

Each scene is a brilliantly shot masterpiece and each character earns a soft spot in my heart (apart from the Germans). There is no bad scene in this long film and I think it is deserving of most epic war film with many other brilliant war films. But I do not want any greedy movie maker to look at this film and think of a sequel because I do not want anyone to touch this film. I highly recommend it for ages 10 and over.,

233,16 May 2005,Cristiano-A,7, Thanks to the Fifty,"The movie dramatizes the true story of a great escape of POW's from the Stalag Luft III camp in Upper Silesia, today Poland, during WW II. The script was written by James Clavell (Shogun, Tai-Pan) based on a novel by Paul Brickhill. The plot of the film is a little bit romanticized but nevertheless truly to the facts, and so it is a homage to the airmen cruelly executed by the Nazis. The movie is largely benefited of the participation of a set of known actors which do a very good job. The director John Sturges sets a light tone, with a lot of humor, smoothing the film, considering the cruel destiny of the fugitives. We can divide the movie in two parts. On the first, we see how the escape is planned and all the details of the preparation of a such a huge escape are presented: how to build the tunnels, the forgery of the documents, the making of the civil clothes, and so on. On the second part, we see how the fugitives try to get to a neutral country and the different approaches tried for each one: robbing a motorcycle and running to the frontier, traveling by train to France, going on foot sneaking through the fields, etc. Finally, I think that the scene of the execution of the 50 fugitives chosen is particularly touching and we feel grateful to the courage of these men, who fought the Nazis till the end.",

241,11 January 2000,elgee,9," Sturges, McQueen and Co. at their best.","This Film should stir the passions of those that have an affinity with War Movies, with it's telling of the struggle for life and, freedom in one of Germany's P.O.W. Camps in the Second World War. It's not factually correct, some items in Paul Brickhill's book which the film was adapted from were ignored or glossed over, and other events in the Movie which had little to do with actual happenings in the Compound were added by Hollywood, and it's mandatory penchant to entertain. Who cares!! The Great Escape is a great Movie, superbly directed by John Sturges who also skillfully gleaned the best out of the many Stars he had around him at the time and on the payroll. Certainly he was responsible in helping Steve McQueen perform one of his best screen roles as Captain Virgil Hilts, the gung-ho Airman delighting in upsetting his captors who took their work far too seriously, continually asking the mischievous one to spend time in their Cooler. Sturges manages also to capture the many nationalistic traits of the men in the Prison, showing us the stiff upper lip of the British chaps, the laconic Aussie, played brilliantly by James Coburn, the smooth talking American scrounger played by James Garner,the fierce independence of one of the tunnel diggers Danny Velinski, played by Charles Bronson and, of course the Camp Kommandant, Von Luger, ( Hannes Messemer ) expressing typical German efficiency but, perhaps wishing like his prisoners he'd rather be somewhere else. Elmer Bernstein's music also played it's part in making the Movie the success it is, with different mood and tone attached to pivotal scenes such as the opening sequences, the building of the tunnels and eventual escape, and the final stages of the show when we see the lucky ones on their home run. The Great Escape......is a great experience.",
242,7 May 2017,beresfordjd,8, How many times can one see it?,"The Great Escape is a great film. The main problem with it is that in the UK it has been shown on TV probably twice a year at least since it's first TV showing - in fact it seems like more. When it is on I, for one, usually try to avoid it but if I do catch 5 minutes then I am hooked all over again! The cast is wonderful, a mixture of real stars and character actors. Although it is a long film the pacing is superb and the viewer's attention is held throughout. My favourite characters are played by James Garner, Charles Bronson, James Coburn,Richard Attenborough and James Donald. Steve McQueen plays Hiltz the cooler king in his usual laconic, comic style but I find it annoying considering American POWs did not make such a huge contribution to escapes like these. It was great to see so many actors from The Magnificent Seven (another awesome favourite of mine) back on screen and directed again by John Sturges - he knew what he was doing in casting.",

Directed by John Sturges,whose film credits include Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Ice Station Zebra (1968). In World War II,Mr. Sturges made documentaries and training films while enlisted in the US Army Air Corps. His exhaustive research and attention to detail are certainly on display in this film. Because of his success with The Magnificent Seven,he was able to convince MGM to undertake this monumental project. After much negotiations, he was able to convince his star from The Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen,to come aboard for this film. McQueen was reluctant to do another war movie, and only accepted the part if a motorcycle chase was wrote in exclusively for him. Sturges agreed, and the chase toward the end of the movie became one of the signature highlights of the film. A little known fact is that during the chase McQueen, through the magic of editing, was also used as one of the German motorcycle riders,thereby creating the unique circumstance of McQueen being pursued by himself during the chase scene!

260,1 June 2008,film-critic,10," Out you escapees go, through the door or out the window...","""The Great Escape"" works for two reasons; these are two elements that have been argued time and time again, only to come up for air once in a blue moon. This film works, and nearly demands repeat viewings, because director John Sturges has complete and utter confidence in his actors, and secondly, it works because the script is kept so simple that the final act seems to come from nowhere. It is the classic bait-and-switch routine pulled off with such grace and delicacy, that I nearly missed it myself. Sturges makes this feature work because of his cast, his star-studded cast that is bigger than belief, yet so grounded, one would think that this was everyone's first feature. Amazingly, in one film, one can witness the emotion of Charles Bronson, the loyalty of James Garner, the leadership of Richard Attenborough, the fear of Donald Pleasence, the cunning of James Coburn, and finally the patriotism of Steve McQueen. Let me say this again, in ONE film, you can see all of this  and so much more. Not only do you see these great qualities come out with full force, but each actor works with each other to build a comradery, to make this film work  there is no stress for screen time, they all are eager to make cinematic magic  and it shows. One could speak for hours about this cast; it is half of what makes this film work. It is the cast that keeps you glued to your screen. It is the cast that makes you want to view the next minute of the film. It is the cast that holds this film together  but there is another big part  the script.",

As an adult I see that they didn't really show any of those aspects of the war and made the POW camp seem . . . Not so bad. In addition to having plenty of humor, it does also have moments of sadness and suspense and scenes of death, but on the whole handles those elements with a light touch and never lingers on those darker scenes.

The entire movie seem to be constructed to build the ""hero"" characters portrayed by McQueen. There're so many people here proclaim this is Steve McQueen's best work. Well I am not very familiar with Steve McQueen, but his acting job, while completely competent, sure is nothing to write home about. The entire movie is unnecessarily lengthy and drawn out while at the same time completed devoid of the spirit of the brave men keeping their fight going even under imprisonment. It feels more like a teen schemed, prank fest than a epic tale of heroism. Someone here stated this is as much of a WWII movie as ""Saving Private Ryan"".

McQueen is exciting to watch here, because of everything he is NOT doing. When he IS moving, the stunts on the motorcycles are infectiously fun to watch for those who admire sheer physical agility and absolute passion for speed. It is the underdog we root for, the great cunning plan to escape that we want so much to work. And even when it does not go quite as planned, there is still the Cooler King, dreaming up another plan.",

The producers of this film put together a stellar cast of actors that, if you are 35+ years old will be recognizable as top movie and television stars.  The movie itself is superb.  A great story, well acted and directed.  Based on a true story, but obviously fictionalised, the movie focuses on characterization and plot.  You care about these people and what happens to them.  If you can only see one movie about allied prisoners during wartime, see this one.",

It's been so well put together, and i've heard that it's so close to the truth- that any closer and it would be classed as a documentary. The line up of actors who star in this movie are amazing. Firstly, Steve McQueen, who is in my opinion the finest actor to have ever walked the earth. (Just remember, any movie that stars Steve McQueen is a must see.) Although the entire cast were outstanding, Steve made the movie for me. He took a leaf out of his own past and brought it into the character (Captain Hilts), making the audience automatically feel a connection with Hilts. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, James Donald, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence, to name a few made the movie what it is-an unforgettable classic. For anybody who has not yet seen this movie- where have you been all these years. I'm only 18, the movie was made years before i was born and yet (living the world we have now) i find this 60s classic at the top of my list. Watch it, pay attention, it's amazing!",

I can see how he coudl have been viewed as cool, but the story behind the film seems, to me, mediocre at best. The music is well-known and enjoyable, but the story of the film could have been a much deeper statement about the futility of war, and what does it end up being? A place to watch McQueen showboat. My opinions could be totally misplaced here; but I did not see anything spectacular about this film. Stalag-17 seems a much greater film with a similar story.",

After watching the movie, it suddenly hit me that there were no female actors at all, which only strengthens the fact that this classic succeeded in giving a supreme plot without relying on strong sexual scenes (or violence for the matter) like so many of today's films do. The film also delivers some very excellent views at the antagonists of the story, which in turn strengthen the overall view of the main characters. Steve McQueen is brilliantly funny and remains the King of Cool (or ""King of the Cooler"" in this case!), and as always, I found myself cheering for James Coburn.

This doesn't happen every day. It's hard to believe how well The Great Escape has held up after all these years. The cast is phenomenal, the characters are very likable, and the story is engrossing. With such a long runtime, we get a chance to really get to know a lot of the characters. There are so many who play an important role in this escape attempt from a German POW camp. They turn prison escaping into an art form. It's fascinating watching all that goes into it. Oddly enough, this is the most lighthearted World War 2 POW film I've seen. There isn't much suffering shown. The prisoners are of good spirits throughout most of the story and the prison guards aren't so cruel as we normally see from such movies. It really makes you wonder why these characters are risking so much to escape. But when the time to escape comes, it's indeed suspenseful, and the suspense continues building from there. Trying to escape a German prison is one thing, but trying to escape the German occupied territory is quite another.",
286,9 March 1999,Dr.Mike,8, An almost great film,"The Great Escape has all the elements needed for a great Hollywood film, but it falls short of perfection.  The acting, direction, photography, and especially the music are all compelling, but the script comes up short.  It is very difficult to believe that prisoners of war would constantly be so cavalier about everything.  The film creates a bunch of fun but ultimately trivial characters that inhabit an all-too-unreal prison camp.  While they cover slightly different ground, Grand Illusion and Stalag 17 both are superior films for presenting a more balanced view of prison life.  In spite of the poor script and silly characterizations, the film does have many merits.  The European locations are wonderful and look fantastic.  The score is riveting.  And the cast provides an informative glimpse into Hollywood, 1963.  This is one of the last great studio action films.  Soon, films that some of the stars of this film are in, like Bullit and Death Wish, would replace the WWII film as the action/adventure standard.  The world was moving forward, away from the patriotism and myth that surrounded the second war.  The great legacy of this film is that it provides one last look back into that lost world and shows why it was so compelling to Americans.  Soon after the film's release, JFK would be dead and Vietnam would be reality. The Great Escape could not have been made in 1969.",

However, the truth is there was no such character/person as Capt. Hilts. Steve McQueen's character never existed. The famed motorcycle chase in the film never happened. It is true that thousands of Germans (not ""millions"", as actor Charles Coburn later told during the film's Special Features interview) were used to track down the 76 (not 79) who escaped.

From here on in the plot wastes no time in getting to business, and the resourcefulness and willpower shown by our main characters throughout is captivating. From what I've read, the events depicted are fairly historically accurate and I find that amazing. By the time the iconic theme music plays at the film's close I had laughed, cried, fallen off my seat, and everything in between.

Henry Birkland, Wally Floody and Tommy Thompson are heroes and great Canadians and I, among others, did not know their names until watching a documentary on the great escape. It is a shame that Canadians have been so downplayed in the role of winning the wars that have occurred in our past.

The same motorcycle was later ridden by Henry Winkler as Fonzi. ""Shashank Redemption"" was great escape movie but it was not during the war (courage of one man over many men) and it was based on Fiction. The fact this movie has stood the test of times because of the unsurpassed endurance, patriotism, ingenuity and positive spirit in the group of men for whom nothing was impossible. Even though this movie had no women (except in the train and public spaces) it was universally liked by men and women unlike other prison movies and all Nationalities. The only anti-climax is Hilts character played by Steve Mcqeen should have escaped (since 8 POW's did escape) since the saddest part was seeing him back in the ""Cooler"" (The Gestapo who shot the fifty men, were later hunted and killed by the British Intelligence and of course Germany lost the war.)

It has a good plot but with a tragic ending and despite what people say is based upon a true story. What makes The Great Escape such a good film is humour of the men as they try to escape and the constant belief that they would eventually be free. This movie is a prime example of the undying spirit of human beings, even when facing the worst. Although some of the acting can be a little bit ropey and whenever I hear the theme tune I can't help but be reminded of it being chanted on the terraces of stadiums, I would say that the great escape is well worth watching. Steve McQueen gives a classic performance as Hilts which sometimes overshadows the performances of the other actors. Charles Bronsen and Donald Pleasence give a touching insight of the problems that they face while trying to escape and the death of Donald Pleasence's character brings a tear to the eye.",

The mix of derring-do and comedy takes on a shadow with Bartlett's arrival, and then goes a shade deeper with the death of Ives. By the time the men are machine-gunned down in an open field, the tonal shift has moved deftly to the other end of the spectrum. The making of moonshine, and the reaction of the brewers - three simple 'wows' - is a masterclass in economy in scripting.

If you watch this movie you may find yourself saying ohh.. that's where that came from (in reference to any number of movies and TV shows that have paid homage to this movie including say the Simpsons). The whistled theme is just awesome something I have whistled since I was a kid. The movie is true to the original true story. It is very well acted. Exciting from beginning to end, and does not have a happy ending (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Well why not because sometimes it is more about the journey in life than the destination, and the creative forces and sheer will of these men to escape from their German captors makes for great movie watching.

325,3 January 2006,Graunch,8, A good film,"From what I have heard from actual POWs, this is a reasonably accurate portrayal of what it was like to be held in a POW camp run by the Luftwaffe. ""Firm but fair"" on the whole. And far better than the alternative, i.e. being held captive by the Gestapo or SS. The Great Escape is a true story that has been doctored for Hollywood. There was an escape from Sagan camp, and 76 did get away. Of these, 3 made it to freedom. The rest were recaptured and fifty of them were shot by the SS on Hitler's orders; in groups of 2 and 3 though, not in the more dramatic mass-shooting we see in the film. Big X (Attenborough) was named Bushell, not Bartlett, and in fact there were no Americans in the camp. Garner and McQueen were included for box office appeal. Also, all the prisoners in the movie are in their late 30s and upwards  in reality almost all of them would have been closer to 20 than 30. But, once you acknowledge that the movie is not a 100% accurate depiction of what happened, but simply an enjoyable film based on the true story, with some invented motorcycle stunt work thrown in for good measure, you can sit back and enjoy, and feel admiration for all those who fought on the winning side in that cataclysmic war for the survival of freedom.",
326,22 April 2023,timothywalton-31924,8, Solid entertainment,"Prisoner of war movies are mostly sombre, serious affairs, as the stakes involved are literally life and death. The Great Escape proves that they can also be absorbing, engrossing, and dare I say, wildly entertaining. The Great Escape succeeds at least partly because of the breadth it offers. The entire escape process, from planning to execution is shown, and so is the full escape- Just escaping the POW camp hardly counts as a true escape, the full escape involves getting to neutral Switzerland also. The film is hence quite extraordinary in devoting one full hour to track the prisoners after their escape from the camp and their outcomes. This helps offer lush, beautiful photography of the Alps, the quaint German towns, and of course, Steve McQueen riding a motorcycle. This also gives an extra serving of suspense, delivered on top of already tense and riveting sequences earlier in the POW camp. Despite this, I have to say the film is still too long- a good half hour could have been trimmed from the escape planning scenes, as the film lags and gets a tad monotonous near the middle. Overall, I think the film could have leant more into the adventure aspect it portrays in cutting some run time from the comparably dull planning sequences, though even without these cuts, the film still manages to be a wildly engrossing, entertaining work.",

328,8 December 2009,tjsdshpnd,8, A great thrilling experience....not to be missed,"I am watching quite a few 'Escape' movies recently and nothing gets better and bigger than this one. Based on a true incident about Allied Prisoner's of War's planning mass escape mission to flee from German POW Camps, this movie takes into account all the pre and post escape incidents. The POW Camp is also known to be escape-prone and it will take something big and special to flee from there. The prisoners present in the camp are also veteran 'escapers' who are given specific jobs for the escape. For example, one is made a 'Forger' who creates false ID's, another one is made the 'Tunnel King' who will plan a tunnel long enough to get out of there . There is also a separate story of Captain Hilts (Mcqueen), an American who at the beginning tries to get out on his own but then joins the rest of them due to circumstances. The movie can be divided in two parts, The initial part shows the planning and digging of the tunnel and the second part shows the post-escape incidents. The second part is stretched a little bit IMO and the editor could have come in handy here.But the movie is a great thrilling experience nevertheless.",

330,21 May 2023,lippylip26,8, A good movie sadly let down by total false facts,"Please don't get me wrong here
The movie is very good - for Escapism value
The acting is superb and they did create a sense of accuracy and tension
HOWEVER
a lot of the story is pure Hollywood Gump
The basic facts are correct
There was THE GREAT ESCAPE
76 people did escape
They did create the three tunnels
Some of the people who did participate in the Great Escape are faithfully represented why others were just put in for entertainment purposes especially Steve mcQueens role and antics
That it pure Hollywood imagination
It is highly recommended that before watching this movie you watch the documentaries on the Great Escape FIRST
All available on You Tube
After that watch the movie
It will give you a greater and deeper perception on what actually happened
By watching the documentaries first you will see very clearly what actually happened compared to what they show in the movie
Warning SPOILER ALERT for some of the facts
The escape took place on the coldest No night of the year 35 degrees F
The whole area was full of snow
American participation was very limited - the way the movie shows the story the Americans carried the day and the British were just side decorations
It was so cold that night they battled for an hour to open the tunnel so that the escapees could get out of the tunnel
The one tunnel was blown up and accidentally blew up the Hut it was under
They never knew where the tunnel started
It was only when the breakout tunnel was discovered that a German went down into the tunnel and went through it then banging on the other end to alert the Germans where the tunnel started
There was actually a fourth or fifth tunnel (can't remember exactly) called George and it was not discovered until much later - the one documentary - The attempted excavation long after the war to locate the three tunnels that the fourth tunnel was discovered
That tunnel never went out of the prison but in - towards the Armoury
It was feared that the Germans might try kill all the prisoners before evacuating the prison so they tunnelled towards the armoury to protect themselves
The germans blew up all the tunnels so proper investigation could not be fully achieved
In the excavation of the site they found many artefacts that were used before during and after the Great Escape happened including the tube radio they used
That radio was returned to the man after the excavation that made the radio.",

I really didn't enjoy this movie and I had some interesting parts but I just had a such a hard time trying to watch it finish the movie with the almost 3 hour run time on it I just recently picked up the 4K release of this movie and I really enjoyed the quality of the picture sound acting and everything else but like I said something was just there that kept on dragging off of me. Going into it I didn't know really many of the actors and I don't remember bits and pieces for my first time watching this and I can see that like I said the performances were great including the performances from some of the main cast including Donald pleasence and Steve McQueen rest in peace. I think that the idea was really strong and I feel like you had it all in there and I would like to go back and watch it another time one day but maybe when I have more of like a free day off of work to watch it instead of watching it and bits and pieces like I had to watch because like I said it felt like a dried on and on for me but I still gave it a good rating cuz of so many great things about this movie.,

Their egos do not collide but instead collude to inspire, depict and create one of the finest historically accurate films of all time. Suspenseful and exciting, this movie is similar in scope and powerful effect as ""The Magnificent Seven"" made three years earlier with some of the same cast members. A charismatic nostalgia envelops me whenever I view this film. It is a good feeling that takes me back to my youth and to what I perceive as ""good times."" The screenplay in this film is powerful and thoroughly rewarding. There is heartbreak at the end but there is also triumph displayed in the will of man to be free at all costs. ""Give me liberty or give me death."" Every actor is high profile and they live up to their reputations in each role as they ""execute"" them perfectly. A gripping film that leaves you on the edge of your seat as Steve McQueen adds heart-pounding excitement in his nearly successful escape attempt. Everyone and anyone can enjoy this film.

To this then eight year old, Virgil Hilts was a hit and the center of the movie and the escape. Since that time I have seen the movie a half dozen times on television and recently on DVD.

When I watch any movies from 1960s, I always expect depth of dialogue to be something that we highly lacks in modern movies. But unfortunately, this particular movie didn't give me that vibe. On the other hand, POWs in Germany where not treated as humanely in Nazi Germany as it is depicted here. That is why some scenes were somewhat disturbing.

It was really a British twin motorcycle disguised to look like a vintage 1940's German Army BMW motorbike! The vehicles used by the Germans were real vintage 1940's cars, trucks & motorcycles which were repaired to working order to add realism to the script.

Steve Mcqueen is unbelievably good as Hilts, and the script is written in a historically accurate way that puts other war movies to shame. Interestingly, another movie that I very much enjoyed starring Mcqueen, Papillon, has a very similar plot. Also, if you enjoyed the cast of The Great Escape, I would highly recommend The Magnificent Seven. It has absolutely nothing to do with WWII (it's a western), but, ironically, it has 6-8 of the same actors from The Great Escape playing major roles.

Even so, for all of their brutality, it is surprising that the Nazi's did actually take prisoners. The conclusion to the conversation is that the commandant wants the prisoners to comply but because the prisoners are the enemy then it is their duty to escape. I liked the movie: it was tense but it was also funny. Steve McQueen's character was the one that added a lot of life to the movie. He was the one that came up with all of the bright ideas to escape, and the one that was always caught and put into the cooler. He actually seemed to spend more time in the cooler than out of it....the movie also portrayed the brutality of the Germans. Even though they did seem to look after the prisoners of War, the ones that continually escaped were simply gunned down by the Gestapo. They had become sick of this escaping POW's so they warned them that if they were caught again then they would be shot. The Gestapo made that promise and they kept it. It still seems very harsh, but this was a war and no matter what the Geneva convention says, there is no rules in war and the allies were just as brutal as the German's were.",

Stevie Q's in-the-end futile bike ride is now part of cinema legend and become iconic, and he sure looks good. However, for me the honours have to go to Richard Attenborough as Sq. Ldr. Bartlett or 'Big X'. I'm going to push the boat out here and say it's his 'iconic' moment on film - even apart from 'Pinky' in 'Brighton Rock'. Attenborough is the driving force of the story. All the other characters are as wooden as the huts (hey, I know it's not Shakespeare) but it's through him that we are reminded that there is a war going on and it's not pretty. We are introduced to all the other various prisoners as a hotchpotch of the usual suspects (so to speak) but before Attenborough even says anything we immediately realise the brutality of the moment..his relief when the Gestapo leave the room is palpable! His conversation with the Senior B.O. is frighteningly stark; he is reminded that for the present the Luftwaffe control Germany's POW camps - not the Gestapo or SS. Big X looks mortified; to him there is no distinction, ""we're fighting the bloody lot"". It's this refusal on Bartletts part not to forget the reasons for fighting (and in doing so reminding the viewer) that keeps the rest of the film from falling into a litany of comic book capers.",

357,1 January 2014,moonrazer-487-184393,10, The Best War Movie Sound Track EVER,"I consider the decade of 1960's and a few years on either side, the Golden Age of the epic World War II movies. This era gave us Bridge over the River Kwai, Patton, Tora Tora Tora, The Battle of the Bulge (say what you will). There were some great scores that came from these gems but the sound track of the Great Escape is the one that pops in my mind (and maybe this is just me) when I'm doing something that may be of epic proportions. I think one of the things that makes this era so great is that many of the actors and production people involved were WWII or military vets themselves. Period vehicles and locations were still around in good supply as well. As our greatest generation passes so does the greatest generation of the World War II movie. I ended up watching these movies usually on TV as a kid and if they were on a weeknight I didn't always get to see the end. I remember watching this most likely as a two parter of Saturday Night at the Movies. This was an NBC show that would feature first rate movies within a few years of their theatrical release. This was before the days of home video. It memory serves me correctly the first part came on Saturday night with the second part the following Monday night. On Monday night when they started the movie I was able to record the opening score with a very primitive tape recorder and I've been hooked ever since. This movie has to be seen to be believed. The star power put together for this movie is incredible. I've seen a documentary on this that puts the whole movie in an even more epic light. Steve McQueen's motorcycle chase is in my opinion one of the top five chases ever put to film. McQueen's chase in Bullitt is another one. But back to the sound track, some of the most memorable are of course the opening convoy scene,the McQueen chase (one day he's going to make it, I just know it) James Garner and Donald Pleasance in their airplane escape (very sad at the end) and James Coburn in the rowboat.",

It is a film full of standout moments, none better than the beautifully realized motorbike chase sequence. This was apparently added to the film at the request (or demand) of Steve McQueen who wanted more screen time and has become one of the most iconic sequences in movie history. Of the many characterizations on screen and the production team there are two that stand out for me and lift the film from an entertaining war picture into a classic. First is the presence of Steve McQueen who oozes charisma in every scene. I cannot think of any other actor of any generation who could have been so credible in the motorbike sequences. Along with the chariot race in Ben Hur it ranks as one of the best action scenes of all time. Second is Elmer Bernsteins incredible score. People mostly remember the Main theme but like the very best film music it has a rich and varied score which takes the viewer on an emotional ride and gives the film it's sense of pace and exhilaration. Way ahead of it's time. Listen to James Horners' score for Titanic and you can hear the influences. John Sturges was an underrated director and like a lot of the great new directors of the sixties, such as John Frankenheimer and Franklin J Schaffner, the quality of his output fell dramatically towards the end of his career.",

This has got some of the coolest acting around. Steve McQueen is one amazing actor and he gets to do his thing here. It is actually kind of hard to describe easily what Steve brings to this movie. Granted, he is a main character, but there are plenty of those running around in this film. Steve though, stands out above the fray, at least in my book, and you root for the guy to get through what he has to do to get by. But being in a German prison camp can't be easy. These actors are pretty good at getting that point across, in spades. Life is tough behind barbed wire with marksmen watching over every move your making, or at least they are trying too. Thankfully, the Germans are not always as attentive as they should be. Sit down in a comfy chair, put your seat belt on tight and hang on, especially once Steve gets some horsepower under his butt.

Yet is has far more accuracy to the real story than is given credit and remains an entertaining romp with a great cast, many displaying very subtle realistic traits of behaviour. Most of the characters are true to real people or are composite representations of such people. Many of the negative comments here pick on rather trite issues and often present so called factual errors that are wrong themselves such as: 1 The prisoners wearing uniforms rather than overalls - they did wear uniforms. 2. The apparent relaxed atmosphere of the ""Nazi"" camp - not all camps were Auschwitz for goodness sake and the Luftwaffe camps were noted for having remarkably better conditions and allowed plenty of leisure activities and scope for the cleanliness observed (food supplies as in many camps was sporadic but not severe until close to the war's end) 3. The fact that Coburn, Bronson and Garner were included for a American audience (alongside McQueen) playing commonwealth servicemen - only Garner portrayed a ""commonwealth"" serviceman, and did it rather well, as the Aussie. Garner was a US member of the RAF's Eagle Squadron and Bronson was from Poland Furthermore while no Americans escaped many did in fact work on the tunnels, Bronson's character was principally based on a Canadian who was transferred prior to the escape but artistic licence is OK.",
371,3 June 2023,petraedlbacher,10, Uplifting and moving WWII drama,"I've just seen back to back some of the most influential WWII war adventure movies of the 1960s, namely Where Eagles Dare, Kelly's Heroes and The Great Escape. Of these, The Great Escape is by far the most superior effort. It's a movie that presents some relatable characters, funny and touching moments, drama and tragedy, and all this based on true events (though the characters are fictional). It's an inspirational tale about a group of very different men with different talents working together for a common goal. The tone constantly shifts between comedy and tragedy, but does so in an admirable way, rarely feeling off. The film features a great ensemble cast with 'the king of cool', Steve McQueen, at the helm. It's wonderful that many of the characters are developed in a way that makes their struggles more relatable. A highlight was the unlikely friendship between James Garner's American trickster and Donald Pleasance's soft-spoken English birdwatcher characters. I also very much appreciated that for once, the Germans were not just bellowing villains, but some of them emerged as everyday people caught up in a terrible regime, characterized in a nuanced way. A movie for the ages!",
372,11 February 2012,hallywall10,8, Great escape,"This must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the first time,in I guess 1987,a BBC Christmas broadcast,I was captivated by this brilliant piece of work. In the years after,I probably have seen it a ""million"" times,owning it on VHS and DVD,and still watching,whenever it is broadcast,in the original language. Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a good length,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance is brilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,Richard Attenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest roles Donald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn't historically accurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn't matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and their guards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I will not repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will capture you,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. There is excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion. See it,you will not regret it.",
373,27 December 2021,jeffschwartz-31809,8," Great entertainment, but elements not realistic","This is a great movie for entertainment, with lots of great actors, and some excellent scenes, my favorite being the motorcycle scenes starring Steve McQueen. One of my biggest peeves about this movie is the unrealistic way that the German officers and German soldiers act around the prisoners of war. Generally, the Germans allow the prisoners of war far more freedom and far more respect than is realistic. In addition, in many scenes in which an escaped prisoner is being apprehended or is already under the custody of the German authorities, the German authorities are not aggressive in any way, do not point their guns at the prisoner under arrest or custody, do not put them in handcuffs, allow the prisoners close contact with officers, etc. This is not realistic.",
374,8 January 2006,bpickar,8," Very entertaining war movie, but looks dated",Just saw this for the first time last night after hearing so many good things about it over the years. My initial impression was that this is so far from what you think of when you think German POW camp that it bordered on the absurd. But then I heard that indeed the Luftwaffe ran the camp and their camps were much more humane than the Concentration Camps that have received much more attention.,
375,8 April 2023,mirandathomas-2134,7, Good prison film,"THE GREAT ESCAPE is director John Sturges's follow up to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and if anything it's even more epic than his classic western. Once again we have an all-star cast taking place in an action and suspense-filled story, this time about a jailbreak from a prisoner of war camp in Germany. Despite an incredible running time, this film is enjoyable for every second of screen time; it has humour and heart in spades, and of the huge cast, nobody puts a foot wrong. I think Steve McQueen steals all of his scenes here in a show-stopping role, but others like Richard Attenborough and James Garner are more quietly determined while Donald Pleasence and Charles Bronson are the most sympathetic you'll ever see them. A classic and worthwhile tale is told with the budget to tell it properly and the production values are quite brilliant throughout. It's an unashamed fist-thumping classic and a film I never tire of watching; I love it to bits and can't say a bad thing about it.",
376,15 February 2012,raghavo_vijayam,9, Great movie for the THE GREAT ESCAPE,"The Great Escape... A great incident which may have shook the confidence of Nazi POW camps. The strangest thing about the escape was it was not exactly an escape but an attempt to distract the Germans from the front. Now when it comes to the movie, it is pretty obvious that it will not be same as the true incident. But the film adaptation was good. A balance between reality and entertainment was well maintained. The movie only shows what an average audience wants to see and feel i.e. entertainment rather than making him revolve around the minute details of the escape. So I would say it was more a movie less a documentary. I wouldn't say great but all the actors have done justice to their parts. It was really nice to see acting skills of a great film maker Richard Attenborough as the Master Mind of the plan. Steve McQueen as a notorious American prisoner who made several escape attempts did a good job. Charles Bronson was as usual calm and composed I doubted whether he would panic during the escape but yes did justice to his role as THE TUNNEL KING.",
377,18 March 2021,irv24,9, Classic All Star Cast,"Simply put one of the best movies Ive seen. Based on a true story, you cant stop wanting more of the action. Steve McQueen is at his best. Charles Bronson us made for this roll. Goes on and on. Enjoy.",
378,20 April 2021,nicolasewaldvogel,9, Timeless classic about the cameraderie and bravery of these POW's,"Watched it to check it off my list of classics was surprised how much I enjoyed the film. The casting and score stand out to me aa truly great. A life-affirming story about friendship, endurance and freedom.",
379,12 December 2021,chienmag,9, It's McQueen vs McQueen!,My favorite bit of trivia from that film is during the motorcycle chase with the Germans chasing Steve McQueen one of the Germans on a motorbike chasing him is actor Steve McQueen doubling for one of the stuntmen.,
380,11 January 2023,floydpangas-47676,4, Bad Expectation,"More of a The Not So Great Escape. Good beginning but bad ending. Although even if it was base on true story, but if you are planning to have a great escape, you might as well make it worthwhile not making up hope that ends up in a tragic way. Otherwise it is not really called a ""Great Escape"". Funny thing about it is that they have at least 70 men minimum who had 'great' ideas but ended up failed most of them. It is like being outsmarted by the movie Escape From Alcatraz which only had 3 men and yet end up successful towards their escape especially at a maximum prison cell. This is a no-brainer.",
381,25 January 2010,rspen46-644-775845,10, Excellent Must see,"I am glad the previous reviewer wrote about the history of stalags and escapes to help straighten out some of the people that did not believe this really happened or some of it, it's like the Battle of the Bulge movie, it was based on history but it has many flaws, like the tanks in it, by the end of the war, there were not enough German Tanks left in running condition to make a movie, so they use what they have, but that does not mean the movie and what is in it, did not happen.",
382,25 May 2013,drew_wallner-275-558371,8," Good, Not so Bad, and just a tad Ugly","First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true ""stinker?"" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.",
383,25 September 2012,c_e_barton,9, Instant Classic,"The Great Escape is among one of my personal favourite films and something I will always consider to be a must watch for history buffs. This movie is topped off with a cast of stars who deliver nothing short of an amazing performance. I find myself drawn into the emotions of the characters every time I watch The Great Escape. From the start of the film, the audience is drawn in with the catchy theme song as we build an opening and develop our characters. As the film moves forward, the audience may find themselves drawn deeper into the characters, much as I have. The performances are so amazing, the actors alone make it a film worth checking out. Combined with the brilliant true story this film is based around, it becomes an instant classic. Although I feel this film is grossly underrated in todays media, it is a film that will always be a classic and something that anyone should watch if they have the chance.",
384,24 April 2016,annettesheline,8, True...this happened.,"My father was imprisoned there as a Prisoner of War. It was one of several Prisoner of War camps he was placed in. He served in the Canadian Army. He survived the Great Death March ordered by Hitler. I'm sure their confinement was much more difficult than this movie conveys. Just the same I'm grateful that this movie was made and has kept alive the amazing efforts of those who when they enlisted signed an agreement that they would do all they could to attempt an escape if captured. They have found several of the original tunnels and they invited all the still living original diggers/ escapees to return to view the findings and to fill in the gaps as to what the archeaologists had retrieved from the exposed tunnels. It's on ""You Tube"" I believe. These men have become WW II heroes in many eyes, mine included.",
