1,9 December 2020,auuwws,9, Million Dollar Baby,"A very sad movie, Frankie and Maggie's relationships are very beautiful and it was like the relationship of the father with his daughter. The story of the film was very beautiful and the directing in the film was excellent and the acting in the film was great among all the heroes of the film Maggie's death was sad The effect of her death on Frankie and his retirement from training made me very sad The film He deserved all the trophies he won",r
2,21 August 2010,namashi_1,8, Superb!,"Clint Eastwood is a legendary film personality. I am a great fan of his. As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. 'Million Dollar Baby' is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!",e
3,28 November 2005,claudio_carvalho,10," Unforgettable, Touching, Human, Realistic, Sad, Spectacular Â– One of the Best Dramas I Have Ever Seen","Yesterday I finally saw the great Oscar winner of 2005, and I can say that ""Million Dollar Baby"" really deserves the awards of best film, director, lead actress and supporting actor, and even the prize of lead actor in the hands of Clint Eastwood would not be a mistake of the Academy: Ben Kinsley and Jamie Foxx were great, but in a whole I would have given the award to Clint Eastwood.",v
4,20 March 2005,marcosaguado,9, A Punch In The Stomach,"I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",i
5,3 August 2011,planktonrules,10, This film made me think...,"The SPOILER from ""Million Dollar Baby"" is perhaps one of the least best-kept secrets in movie history. Most people know what the big twist is in the film, but in case you are one of the few who doesn't know what it is, I have marked this review as ""contains spoiler""--just in case! This film was directed by Clint Eastwood and he also directs--and he has an incredibly great track record over the past couple decades in these capacities--such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Gran Torino""--so I knew I had to see this film. I am very glad I did...though I must admit it tore me up emotionally watching the movie. This is not a criticism, but actually a complement. That's right. Too often, movies have nothing to say and don't take any risks--and this film clearly takes risks and has a lot to say. So, when a film like this gets me crying, it's not at all a bad thing.",e
6,8 January 2006,lavatch,8, Swank! Eastwood! Freeman!,"It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged ""Million Dollar Baby."" ",w
7,30 December 2004,jotix100,10, Big girls don't cry,"If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk, to see ""Million Dollar Baby"", perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood is past year.",/
8,15 April 2011,ezlidblue-1,10, Swank gives the performance of a lifetime!,"I didn't view this film until today because I simply wasn't interested in women in boxing; however, I wish I'd seen it years ago! Hillary Swank can never make another film and this one would be her crowning glory. It takes you on a wild ride of emotions from the beginning and Clint Eastwood's curmudgeon self is part of it all. Naturally, the ""voice of God"" in Morgan Freeman is there to explain it all and give some meaning to what each of the characters fell. By now, everyone knows the ending but I still won't spoil it for late-comers to the film like myself. I do believe much has been made about it and it's unnecessary. Yes, you will be torn about what is morally right but you can certainly understand how Eastwood's and Swank's characters feel! Please see this film. You will understand pugilism more than ever before and you just might see some of your own self in the film! It is well worth the time!",r

10,30 January 2006,nycritic,10, Another Subtle Story by Clint Eastwood,"Three people carrying their own injuries and baggage meet and form an unlikely friendship that slowly becomes familial. Frankie is a man who has lived his entire life in the service of boxing but for reasons left unknown, has an estranged relationship with his daughter, so he has little else to do but be at the boxing gym and train. Eddie is one of his better boxers, a quiet man who can still throw a punch, and who lost an eye in an ill-fated match. Though these two men have a close-knit friendship Frankie still bears tremendous guilt over Eddie's loss. And now, a girl of all people -- Maggie -- wants Frankie to train her. She has nothing going for her, she knows it, and boxing is a way out. While at first Frankie sees no future for her -- she's 31 and has no experience -- he gives in and decides to train her to become the best female fighter ever... until tragedy arrives and gives their lives an unexpected left turn that will change them forever.",1
11,29 July 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Inspirational and hard-hitting*no pun intended*,"Of course, I must see ""THE BEST PICTURE OF 2004!"", I think every movie fanatic has too. Man, cry me a river, this was a good movie! I have to admit, I had my doubts. I'm not really into boxing movies, exception: Raging Bull. But so many people told me that this was a great movie and it was. Hilary Swank, what a performance! This movie makes you feel as if anything can happen. ""I got what I needed"" she says to Clint Eastwood. Clint and Hilary together were absolutely perfect. They made a great team. Clint really did a great job expressing his doubts at first but believing in Hilary, it was truly inspirational.",0
12,30 January 2005,poetellect,10," Intoxicating, Brilliant, Inspirational, and Multi-Layered- what films are meant 2 B","Wow- what an incredible movie! There are so many layers to this film, one could almost see it 4 times and get something new out of it every time. I loved first and foremost its message that we create ourselves through our drive, loyalty, ambition, dedication, and work. Secondly, I love its insistence in the good of the American Dream, and I loved its excitement and beautiful, touching message toward the end. A movie about violence and ambition that evolves into a movie about love, hard-earned sacrifice, and doing something meaningful with one's life. Grade A entertainment with a beautiful message to boot! Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood should both win their second Oscars for their contribution to cinema.",1
13,16 December 2004,tkwh,10, It's a knockout ...,"Flawlessly written, acted and directed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is being hymned and wreathed by the critics as the best film of 2004. They're absolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The Boxing Ring As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywood itself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP, GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY, ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood the actor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beaten presence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness, Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to and disappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-floored square ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confront their various demons, battling for both victory and personal redemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improving on its source material without betraying the concise but compelling situations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's short stories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusive score is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls and lost causes. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not only the best film released in 2004 it is also the most fully realised and richly textured major studio movie of the decade.",0
14,25 January 2005,ferguson-6,9, Lemon Pie and Yeats,"Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise this gem of a film is! I had to force myself to go after the nominations because the trailer was SO BAD. Hilary Swank is totally believable as the trailer park trash dreamer who wants so much to be a professional boxer. The great Morgan Freeman brings elegance to his role as a former boxer / now wise janitor and Clint's gym. Freeman again proves he is the best movie voice over working today (see ""Shawshank Redemption""). ",2
15,30 October 2005,MinorityReporter,9, Genuine emotions!,Or at least it seems like genuine emotions in this masterpiece of a film which incidentally is Eastwood's best drama so far and considering how good Mystic River is that's saying something. The storytelling is both fluent and well paced and all actors involved deliver some of their best work so far which is mainly because Eastwood is so good at bringing out the best in his actors. I think people who have watched this film and Mystic River will agree. Eastwood is a no-nonsense story teller and cuts right through to the bone which means that there aren't many subplots and this is a really good thing in this film because the main story doesn't need a large number of subplots to steal away attention. Also at a running length of 2 hours the film would undoubtedly have been too long if Eastwood had added any more subplots.,3
16,25 April 2009,gigan-92,10, One of Clint Eastwood's Best Works,"This film is one of Clint Eastwood's best films ever!!! The story is simple but draws you in and never let's go. The characters are simply too thrilling. Hillary Swank steals the show a bit with a sad and brutal story of a very tormented woman's life with incredible power. Enough to bring viewers to tears in fact. Morgan Freeman is great as a supporting actor and he definitely deserves some recognition for his performance. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an Oscar for his excellent directing and own spectacular performance. His role was perfect, creating a strong yet vulnerable character people will embrace. The climax will touch you as his character is given a choice that decides life and death. The score is moving in itself and I simply love this film.",4
17,15 March 2006,Nazi_Fighter_David,10, Eastwood stands as a challenge to his conscience when he finds the correct answer in his heart,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of three different charactersÂ… Actually, two of them, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Scrap Iron (Freeman) are pretty much mirror images of each otherÂ…",/
18,23 February 2006,Hitchcoc,9, A Story of Redemption,"When you make a film with characters, true characters, you have won half the battle. The characters in this film are on a crash course with emptiness, until they find each other. The tired, stagnant life of the Clint Eastwood fight manager, Morgan Freeman, who has sold his needs to watch his friend, and, of course, Hillary Swank, who is trying to find someplace to keep her from ending up like her trailer trash family. If one were to simply look at the plot, it would seem pretty trite. Girl wants to be a fighter (a contemporary possibility; her gender really isn't important), manager hasn't had a fighter in years (he is a curmudgeon who sees the negative in things), and the talent will out. But then the element of tragedy rears its ugly head, and the plot becomes more complex. But it is the characterization that wins the day. We get to know and love these three people (actually a fourth; a young boxer who continues to get the crap beat out of him but who provides another example of what we should be. It is, of course, ultimately about love: love for self, love for others, and love for why we are put on this earth. I was really moved by this film. It is a masterpieces of redemption and will. It is about victory through pain.",?
19,9 July 2022,sydmwswy,9, Not hard enough,"This is the fifth best film of Clint Eastwood, the expert director of cinema. No matter how much we watch this movie, we cannot get enough. But this is not the proof that this movie is perfect. The completeness of this film happens when the reality in the situation it is in is harder, crueler and more crushing.",r
20,26 February 2007,view_and_review,9, Fighting in and out of the ring,"Clint Eastwood is really making his mark as a director. In fact, I'd say that he's an even better director than he is (and was) an actor. He took a seemingly slow, passive, uneventful tale of a woman boxer and made it into something deeply moving and mesmerizing. I was easily wrapped into the main characters as they were intriguing and the actors did such a great job. There are rarely fairytale endings in real life, and the writers should be credited for being courageous enough to explore and present a dark ending. We were swept from the joyous emergence of a promising young female boxer who was beating every opponent, to her sudden and tragic fall into the fight of her life on her death bed and the battle with the decision of euthanasia. This movie was so excellent because it could have just as easily been poorly done. With the wrong actors, or wrong director, or wrong writers, this could have been a long sappy drawn out tragedy. I extend my compliments to a movie that made a person that dreads dramas and romance actually stay locked in.",e
21,17 October 2010,Christian_Dimartino,10," If you weren't moved by it, you must be mentally challenged.","Clint Eastwood has been directing films ever since the late 80's and has won twice for best picture. The first time was for Unforgiven, which I have to see someday. The second time was for Million dollar baby, which I just finished today. For a while, I thought that Mystic river was his best. But after seeing Million dollar baby, it's official. This is his crowning achievement.",f
22,9 February 2005,Bolesroor,1," No, It Doesn't Work","*Spoilers Inside* (Please, don't read this review unless you've seen the film.) I saw Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" after hearing glowing reviews from critics and friends. I heard that it spun a story you thought you knew into new and unexpected territories. I heard it was magnificent. I was ready to love it.",_
23,23 March 2006,ldavis-2,1, Sucker Punch!,"900 years ago, the Britons invaded Ireland with the intent on eliminating the Irish race. Those who weren't enslaved were killed. Irish women were forcibly mated with Scottish men so that they would bear Scottish children; their descendants are the Protestants in Northern Ireland. I mention this to give an idea of how utterly insulting it is for a person named Maggie Fitzgerald to be ushered into an arena with bagpipes! But, hey, why do you expect her Gaelic-reading trainer to be up on Irish history when he doesn't even notice that her robe should read ""mo chuisle,"" not ""mo cuishle""?",=
24,15 August 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, this truly packs a punch,"Calling ""Million Dollar Baby"" a boxing movie would be like calling ""Star Wars"" a space fantasy. Only ""Rocky"" has ever reached this quality. Hilary Swank gives a performance beyond what anyone could ever imagine as destitute waitress Maggie Fitzgerald, trying to make something of herself as a boxer. Clint Eastwood gives probably his best performance ever as trainer Frankie Dunn, trying to reassert his worth by training Maggie. Morgan Freeman is also amazing as co-trainer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, seeking a new direction in life.",t
25,5 February 2005,blanche-2,9, a knockout punch,"I grew up watching Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates on ""Rawhide."" Who could have imagined, looking at his unlined face and watching his easygoing manner, that he would ever have developed into the filmmaker that he has? Though we should have known Clint was something special - in those days, it was nearly impossible to move from a hit TV show into films, as the typecasting was even worse than it is today. But Clint did it.",t
26,25 September 2005,lastliberal,9, The story of life in the trenches,"It is a good thing I did not read Salon.com's review of Million Dollar Baby before I watched it. They derided it by stating that ""Clint Eastwood's boxing movie floats like a lead balloon and stings like a dead bee."" Well, I remember watching a lot of boxing at the National Guard Armory in Tampa 30 years ago, and I can assure you that this was not a ""boxing movie."" The boxing was incidental and only provided the backdrop. This was a story of dreams and failures, of backstabbing and cruelty, of wanting more than life gives you, working for it, and then having some slime ball steal it all when you are not looking because of jealousy. It was about those who take and never give, like the people who grabbed FEMA money in Miami for a hurricane that never came near them. It was the story of life. Real life in the trenches, not life as experienced by those who never worked for anything. It is not about Bush's or Kerry's life, it is about you and me. In that, it succeeded beyond all imagination and I plan to watch it again.",_
27,18 August 2005,MovieAddict2016,9," ""Overrated""? Nope. It really is one of the year's best films.","A lot of people were disappointed by Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (at least those I talked to) and said it didn't live up to the critical hype.",u
28,10 February 2005,FreddyShoop,1," Completely OVERRATED, and often clichÃ©!","Don't get me wrong, this movie is o.k. But it is completely overrated by professional and amateur movie reviewers alike. It is NOT the best film of the year, but it probably is in the top 10.",r
29,9 September 2005,Buddy-51,9, beautifully realized drama,"The thing that strikes you the most while watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director. Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations. In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.",v
30,30 January 2005,sol-,9, My brief review of the film,"A powerful boxing film, it is such a good watch because it goes much deeper than just being about boxing. It is very deeply involving and gripping, and it is likely to even encapsulate viewers not interested in the sport. Swank is excellent but it is the acting from Eastwood that stands out the most, full of realistic emotion in this gritty, authentic tale he has filmed. The film nevertheless is imperfect, outstaying its welcome, having a few medical flaws and some real weaknesses in the plot. It is perfect viewing otherwise however and such a potent experience tooÂ… insomuch that the flaws of the film do not detract very much. It is just a shame that this film cannot be discussed much further without telling how it ends. It deserves to be talked about.",
31,10 February 2005,callanvass,10," A Deeply Disturbing,Haunting, And Depressing Boxing Film, And It May Just Be The Best Film I Have Ever Seen!","This is going to be very hard for me to review but i will do my best. A Deeply Disturbing, and depressing,boxing movie, and it may just be the best film i have ever seen!. The Performances, are incredible, just incredible,, and all 3 of them deserve Oscars, especially Swank!. It's Moving, touching, disturbing and extremely sad. You grow so attached to Swank's character, since she is so incredibly likable, and what happens to her is not right!. Hillary and Clint's Chemistry is simply amazing, they had a special bond,as for Maggie's Mother, You will hate her, , and want to slap her silly, for being such a bitch. However it depressed me big time, and it's not easy to watch (2nd half anyway). there are lots and lots of disturbing images, that will haunt you , trust me., In fact The whole 2nd half is haunting. The Direction is absolutely, incredible. Clint Eastwood, is brilliant behind the camera, nothing fancy, but the film does not need it, still it's brilliant, all the way!.And that score, is simply awesome!. The Acting Is absolutely incredible,with No Doubt Oscar winning performances from, Swank, Eastwood,Freeman. Hillary Swank, gives one of the best performances, ever!, she is so incredibly likable, i have never grown, so attached to a character before, she's so adorable, lovable, and what happened to her, it tore me up,however i don't want to ruin the film so that's all i will say.However it is indeed one of the finest performances ever in a movie. Clint Eastwood, is just as good, he is an incredible actor, his character is meant to be rough, and gruff, but he really has a heart of a gold and i enjoyed the special bond/chemistry him and Hillary had.Morgan Freeman is absolutely, fantastic here as always, and was a great narrator, plus, i loved his character. Jay Baruchel, is good as Danger, and was harmless, plus he gave me a few good chuckles. Lucia Rijker, plays one of the most despicable, pieces of trash i have ever seen, she did her job extremely well, but i just wanted to strangle her(literally). Margo Martindale did her job extremely well as the hate able, uncaring mother. Overall , i was simply, blown away by this movie, and it's one of the best movies i have ever seen!, There is absolutely no excuse, for you not to see this film! , i have never been affected by a movie this much! . ***** out of 5",
32,9 January 2005,aharmas,10, exquisite and delicate work of art,"Usually there is so much hoopla surrounding films that come at the end of the year, and 80% of them are disappointing when they finally screen. Some of them flying by in colorful shells with technical wizardry but little emotion. Others manage to touch the soul and teach us how to confront the wonderful mystery of life. Eastwood has put together a sensitive study of damaged souls and hope. He gives an opportunity to appreciate life and not to give up in the pursuit of our of dreams.",
33,16 December 2004,jt1999,10, Best film of the year.,"This is the best picture of the year -- and Eastwood's finest since ""Unforgiven."" With ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood has crafted a powerful yet tender story of ambition and remorse, of fearless fighters and broken hearts. ",
34,10 October 2020,AlsExGal,6, Old fashioned boxing story with a modern twist,"Eastwood plays the owner of a gym where fighters train. Hillary Swank is a 31 year old waitress trying to become a fighter. At first Eastwood discourages her due to her age and lack of technique, but soon he is training her and she starts to have some success. The relationship becomes much more than that of a trainer and fighter as she takes the place of the daughter who won't speak to him and he takes the place of her family that only cares about what's in it for them. A tragedy occurs that causes Swank to ask Eastwood for a favor he feels he cannot grant.",
35,26 April 2005,dbdumonteil,10, long live Clint Eastwood!,"Hardly one year after the shady ""Mystic River"" (2003), ""grandad"" Clint Eastwood changes mood and perseveres with ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), an unusual film about women's boxing which presents none sign of quieting down from the former cowboy and ""dirty Harry"". He once said about his movies that they had to be before all: entertaining and compelling. Given the commercial and critical enthusiasm of his work, he well fulfilled his pledges.",
36,11 January 2005,larryg5,10, Excellent,"The movie is excellent. Hillary Swank deserves to receive the Oscar for her performance. I haven't seen much of her lately and am so glad that she was picked for this movie. She seems a natural for this role. Like she didn't even have to act, she just let her own emotions take charge. She stole every scene when she was on. Clint Eastwood is one heck of an actor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years old and hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition he deserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listing of viewed movies last week. I'm concerned the subject matter is too deep for most people and it will be pulled to make room for some lame-brain movie like Fat Albert.",

Also, I never intend to throw in spoilers, but in evaluating the film with total honesty, it's sometimes necessary to do so. I also don't believe in plot summaries, as you can read hundreds of them elsewhere on this very site. In some ways, this evaluation reads best if you've already seen the movie. One or two more notes: I came into this film, as always, wanting to love it, and hoping to be transported, and at times it did take me for a good ride. Also, I happened to love Mystic River, the last directorial effort by Eastwood (Frankie),I could probably listen to Morgan Freeman (""Scrap"") do a voice-over of The Congressional Quarterly, and though I never saw Boys Don't Cry, I am convinced there is an earnestness and an inner beauty to Hilary Swank (Maggie) that impresses me. Okay, on to the evaluation:",
38,9 January 2005,jessie-39,9, How can a movie or a cast be any better?,"2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and I. Million Dollar baby is a sure fire Acadamey Award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win. Everything about this movie from the writing, directing, acting and even the music by Clint Eastwood is brilliant. Hillary Swank is once again one of our best actresses.. Don't know why she doesn't make more movies and do some as a ""real lady"" which she certainly is. Her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role. The chemistry between her and the fabulous Clint Eastwood who I believe is past 70 years old is wonderful. Clint is simply great in anything that he does, from those old spaghetti westerns, to Dirty Harry to the comedies, acting, directing, singing, you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else. He is a fall back to the greats of Hollywood goneby. What can you say about Morgan Freeman. I can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied. He is mesmerizing with his tones. As an actor, he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting. He is one of the finest actors in Hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber. He is great as the go between with Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank in this movie and he does it with such ease. I would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves.",

40,28 July 2012,classicsoncall,10," ""Girlie, tough ain't enough.""","If there's a film that can rightly be called a masterpiece, this would be one. The acting, directing, cinematography, story telling, pacing - it's all superb with a terrific cast that grabs you from the opening moments and weaves it's magic right through to it's tearful conclusion. I'm coming to the realization that Eastwood as a director is now a master of the craft. ""Mystic River"" and ""Gran Torino"" are thoughtful and provocative films in their own right, and ""Million Dollar Baby"" is right up there with them as virtual capstones to a stellar Hollywood career. A world, no, an entire universe away from the uncredited actor who made his movie debut in ""Revenge of the Creature"" way back in 1955.",
41,15 February 2005,Galina_movie_fan,6, My handkerchief stayed dry.,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a plain and predictable movie which was confidently directed, and has three very good performances. I just cannot believe how many clichÃ©s it's got - the estranged daughter of Frankie (Eastwood) to whom he writes every week and receives every letter back not opened. This device was used for Freeman's character's narration - in the last scene of the film we realize that he was telling the story to Frankie's daughter to convince her that her father was a good man. The main character, Maggie the waitress (Hillary Swank) eating table scraps and counting pennies, makes a long trip to LA to be trained by Frankie to became a boxing champion - why is she so determined to have him as her trainer we'll never know. Her conversation with Frankie when she remembers her father and her dog, Axel that was put asleep when became sick - kind of lets you know what to expect in the end. The ominous descriptions of a German champion Billy the Blue Bear, ""the dirtiest killing machine"" - you know what will happen way before the movie takes it turn. It should've ended just after the turn with Maggie's death - the final round of the movie is despicable in its manipulation. It is hard for me to believe that Maggie practically fall apart from the lack of the proper care - it was shown that way to squeeze as many tears from the audience as possible. What it squeezed from me was anger and burning desire to hiss ""Die already!!!"" It is also quite predictable that all members of Maggie's family are the crude caricatures. By the way, her sister does not look like a redneck girl who keeps having babies and cheats on Welfare but this is a small detail. Final heartbreaking scene between Maggie and Frankie - in her last moment he told her what Gaelic phrase 'Mo cosÃºlacht' means and of course, it should make the audiences cry even harder. But if you think of it, Maggie had the robe with the sign for months, her many Irish fans kept greeting her with this phrase all the time - and she never was curious enough to find out (through the dictionary or just by asking any of her fans) what it meant. Again, it is a small detail but I hate to be manipulated by the cheap tricks and the movie has lots of them. Oh, I almost forgot the mentally retarded boy in the Frankie's Gym whose only purpose to be in the gym and in the movie was to provide a triumphant moment for Freeman's Scrap and the comical relief exactly in the right time.

It seems like the only part of movies people talk about is the ending, even in crappy movies. Supposedly, prints of Hide and Seek were sent out without the final reel, so no one would know the ending until the time came (as if anyone cared). Remember the furor around The Sixth Sense's ending? Everyone knows it now, and if you're not careful, you'll uncover the ending to Million Dollar Baby-a true shocker, if there ever was one. It's unexpected, realistic, and powerful.

He portrays the retired boxer and now trainer, Frankie Dunn. He has not seen his estranged daughter, Katie, in years. He persists in writing to her weekly, but he never receives a response. He is associated with Morgan Freeman's character, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, also retired and suffering from the loss of his right eye from an earlier fight. The real star of this picture is Hilary Swank who gives a very believable performance of a moderately young female boxer to be. She aches to be trained by Eastwood's character, and finally earns the right to do so. The emotional and complex ending is too overwhelming to describe in this brief epistle, and one should not spoil it for the viewing public. Suffice it to say that you should bring your box of tissue, and chew on the meat of this drama for a long time after it is ended on the screen. It deserves as many thumbs up as it can get.",
51,29 January 2005,meeza,8, Don't Get Boxed In! Check This Baby Out!,"Millions of critics have been enraptured by the sheer emotional impact of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"". With ""Mystic River"" and now ""Baby"", critics that were once ""unforgiven"" to Clint because of such clunkers as ""Blood Work"" & ""Bronco Billy"" are now in awe to the Clintster. Not that Clint cares about that sort of thing so much because in his eyes those pundits should really be called ""The Witches of Eastwood"". ""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, an impecunious waitress who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. Maggie is on a relentless pursuit to have a surly old trainer named Frankie train her. Maggie works out in Frankie's boxing gym everyday in hoping to persuade Frankie to be her hit-man. Frankie is played by none other than Eastwood himself. To be ""frank"" with you, I admired Eastwood's straightforward acting work here, but do not think it deserved a Best Actor Oscar nomination. However, his direction of ""Million Dollar Baby"" was worth its price. His attention to detail and framework was of the technical knockout variety. Moreover, the movie's startling emotional turn midway in the narrative is one of the most profound plot-twisters that I have seen in film in a very long time. Morgan Freeman plays the assistant gym sidekick to Frankie who he himself plays an imperative role as the overseer & narrator of the story's dramatic chops. Freeman is an acting legendary God in the business; he did play ""God"" in ""Bruce Almighty"". However, his work here was poignant but not of the Best Supporting Actor nomination weight-class. The heavyweight of ""Million Dollar Baby"" is Hilary Swank. She delivers passionately blow-by-blow. Her lauded performance has been recognized by numerous critics and my scorecard also shares that exact sentiment. She is the frontrunner for the Best Actress Academy Award. If Swank wins her second golden boy, Hilary will be living large in the ""Hollywood Hills"". Paul Haggis' screenplay does possess a heartfelt punch to it, but it felt lightweight at times in the church scenes. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is somber and it's unlike your typical boxing movie, but those are no reasons why you should throw in the towel for ""Million Dollar Baby"". Spend a few dollars and check out the ""Million Dollar Baby""! **** Good",

Story is about Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who is a boxing trainer and cut man who runs a gym in Los Angeles but he also attends mass and writes letters to his estranged daughter. Living in a room in the back of the gym is Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman) who was a fighter for 23 years and lost an eye in a bout that Frankie worked on.

54,24 March 2015,brchthethird,6, Three excellent central performances elevate a clichÃ©d story,"Clint Eastwood must have gotten soft in his old age. While this isn't necessarily a criticism, MILLION DOLLAR BABY walks a fine line between emotionally powerful drama and sappy, overly sentimental melodrama. Fortunately despite the predictable plotting and clichÃ© dialogue, it has a trio of excellent performances that keep it out of the kitchen sink. Front and center is Hilary Swank as Maggie, a down-on-her-luck waitress who aspires to be a boxer. Her performance is what really makes the film work due to her irrepressible spirit and down-home charm. Clint Eastwood also does an admirable job as Frankie Dunn, who reluctantly (""I don't train girls"") takes a role as Maggie's trainer, manager, and mentor. And then there's Morgan Freeman, one of Frankie's former fighters, and who also co-runs a gym with him. I will admit that his presence in the film adds some depth as he is a connection to Frankie's past, but I didn't feel like he was integral to the story. Still, he had one of the film's best scenes when he shows that despite losing an eye (and being old), that he still has ""it"" in the ring. Beyond these three central performances, the film seems content to stick to the tired sports movie formula of having a older mentor train a younger up-and-comer, at least for the first 3/4. Despite the film having been out now for over 10 years, I still won't give away the sharp turn the story takes. At that point the film becomes something else which is more obviously heavy-handed and didn't quite work for me. It also doesn't help that the film strongly hints at the outcome very early on, robbing it of a lot of the emotional impact. And that is actually my biggest problem with the film. Not content to let the performances and story stand on their own, Paul Haggis (a producer/co-writer) insists on holding the audience's hand throughout the entire film. It didn't work for me in CRASH, and didn't really work for me here either. Still, Clint Eastwood manages to elevate the material to the point where I didn't hate myself for watching it. Overall, the three central performances are enough to loosely recommend this film, but just be aware that it is somewhat heavy-handed and relies a little too much on genre clichÃ©s.",

Hillary Swank is very good, but her character moves from amateur boxer to championship contender while showing practically nothing in between. Clint failed to impress me with his performance (and I am a Clint fan), and Morgan Freeman continues to be highly overrated.

60,9 January 2005,cocoshell,9, One of the year's best,"Clint Eastwood just won't give up. Like good wine, the older - the better, Clint just keeps delivering unforgettable moments to movie lovers willing to grasp his world of human heart. ""Million dollar baby"" is not a movie for everyone. Many people will see it just because the trailer looks like one of the sequels in ""Rocky"" franchise, the only difference for boxer being a girl. How wrong. The first half of this masterpiece gives us a graceful insight into the lives of our heroes, all carrying some sort of emotional/physical wounds. Just when you think the movie is slipping into clichÃ©' territory of Mr. Eastwood makes a U-Turn and the next moment you're embarrassed for even coming up with the thought. Pure and simple this is a film about friendship, redemption, value of life, perseverance and above all love. Love in this film is stronger than religion, stronger than life itself, stronger than all the secular things. Eastwood shows us that love is God, however cruel his works may seem. Performances are pure brilliance : Hilary Swank shows once more that she is probably the greatest actress of younger generation. If there is justice, she will bag another Oscar. Eastwood adds such a depth to the thick-skinned but fragile Frankie Dunn that I cant't see anyone else doing it better. Morgan Freeman is exquisite as well. His soothing voice as a narrator and a mere glance at his face blows you away. For anyone who's looking for moving emotion in a movie and not just 2 hours of popcorn fun, this is a gem not to be missed. Back to back with ""Mar adentro"", ""Million dollar baby"" is the best movie of 2004!!!",
61,27 February 2005,rainking_es,8, Clint will never let us down!,"There's something that characterizes Clint Eastwood's films: he usually makes a nice movie out of a simple story. Anyone else would have converted Million Dollar Baby into such a TV Movie or something, kind of a ""Karate Kid"" mixed up with a moral conflict. Nevertheless Eastwood has a steady hand, he's tough when he thinks he has to, and he's spectacular when he thinks the story can afford it. Once again he plays the lead role: the cynical-skeptical-heartless old man unable to feel anything for anyone Â… till he finally does. Someone will say Clint Eastwood can only play one character; OK, maybe that's true: but he is the best playing it. Hillary Swank makes a great job, bringing to life that white-trash-boxer-aspiring (the first time she participates in such a nice project since ""Boys Don't Cry"").",

The character's developed throughout the film and the actor's portrayal of them made the characters believable.

In a sports culture that spits out phrases like ""second place is the first loser,"" Maggie realized that no, she didn't lose: she just forgot to protect herself. Far from feeling sorry for herself, she marveled at the ride she had: traveling the world, being featured in magazines, hearing people chant her name (or at least that name that Frankie gave her). Wow. And when she faced her biggest test, and worst opponent, she stood her ground. Like a prisoner of war defying her captors, she regained her self-respect.",
65,20 April 2005,ClaytonDavis,10, Million Dollar Baby (Top notch),"First let's start with the undeniable respect for Mr. Clint Eastwood. Producing, directing, and starring in a film is a lot on anyone's plate but Eastwood shows effortless masterwork. Clint Eastwood gives the performance of his career even better than his other Oscar nominated performance in ""Unforgiven."" His voice hasn't been raspier and we've never seen him so bare in character. His scene that proves the worthiness of the performance is his scene when he's in the church crying. There's no performance in 2004 that shows more nakedness and more emotion than that of Eastwood's. Hilary Swank also gives a performance worth remembering. Her character of Maggie is entirely lovable and believable at all times throughout the film. You love her from the very second you get your eyes on her. The real triumph of her performance is the entire last 1/3 of the film. From the moment of her being paralyzed you feel every bit of pain she feels and every tear she sheds you shed with her. She completely embodied herself into the character. Despite the breathtaking performance I still wouldn't give her the Oscar for the 2nd time. The nomination nonetheless was very well deserved. Morgan Freeman was one of the most overdue actors working today prior to ""Million Dollar Baby."" The performance was very good but not one of his best. His win was a celebration of all his fantastic films that went unnoticed by the Academy. (The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, Street Smart) He is a very talented man showing many ranges in his impressive career from drama to comedy and back to drama again. You can't help but love ""Scrap."" Every line Freeman delivers in the film either gets a laugh or just utterly scene stealing from his co-stars Eastwood and Swank. If it wasn't for his overdue status going into the Oscars I wouldn't of gave him the Oscar. If were going on solely performance Clive Owen from ""Closer"" definitely out-did him. Nonetheless Freeman's impressive career made him the prime candidate of winning his long overdue Oscar. Clint Eastwood directs this film to utter perfection. Its dark lighting gave the exact mood of each scene and beautiful musical score is remarkable. He is truly one of the most gifted people in Hollywood. One underrated performance of the film goes to Jay Baruchel who plays Danger Barch, the wannabe boxer. His character is like the others likable and I feel he was the true breakthrough of the film just like Thomas Guiry was last year in Eastwood's nominated ""Mystic River."" ""Million Dollar Baby was a pleasant experience and if it doesn't beat on your heart's door than there's no heart in there at all.

67,31 January 2005,zetes,7, Probably wouldn't crack my top 50 of 2004,"I don't understand all the praise. Sure, it's a pretty good movie, but it's flat, obvious, and not at all memorable. Eastwood's last film, Mystic River, was ten times better. Hilary Swank plays a boxer who persists in trying to get trainer Clint Eastwood to make her his student. He finally does accept her, especially after his friend, Morgan Freeman, who works as a janitor in his gym, convinces him of her talent. Most of the movie is a pretty straightforward boxing drama. Swank and Eastwood become each other's surrogate father and daughter, both making up for lost loved ones (Swank's father is dead, and Eastwood's daughter refuses to talk to him). The final act adds a tearjerker. There is also a poorly developed subplot about a few of the regulars at Eastwood's gym. It's slow, but mostly entertaining. Swank is good, but nowhere near the level that she hit with Boys Don't Cry. It's impossible to believe that Eastwood got nominated, especially over Paul Giamatti for Sideways. His direction is fine, but he can barely speak. Plus, he's so old it looks like his skeleton is trying to escape from his body. Morgan Freeman isn't especially great in his supporting role. He can't speak clearly, either. He narrates the film, and it can often be very hard to understand him. Million Dollar Baby is worth seeing, but it certainly isn't award-worthy. 7/10.",

70,28 February 2005,tnrcooper,9, Excellent film from a true Renaissance man,"Congrats to all responsible for the film. I'm writing this a couple hours after Oscars finished- yup, that's right, it's now 2008. Nah seriously, this is an excellent film. One wouldn't know what the film was about from the previews. Not that one should. Nevertheless, typically accomplished work from Clint. And this time, he wrote the music too. If he could film the movie and be in it at the same time, he could cut down on salaries to people by minimizing the number of people in the production. All that said, Morgan Freeman is excellent, though really the Oscar is a bit of a typically Hollywood, guilt-ridden, let's-right-wrongs Oscar. That being said, he's one of the best, and he's as good as ever. One's tempted to take him for granted, he's that good. I think I'm going to have to go back and see ""Unforgiven"" again to see him collaborating with Clint again. Hilary Swank is excellent. She didn't deserve the Oscar, I'm sorry. Obviously, much of the Academy hadn't seen ""Vera Drake"" or she wouldn't have gotten it. I haven't seen ""Maria Full of Grace"" so don't know how that lady's performance measured up. All that being said, Swank really is a very talented actress. The film itself, well, some nice elements to it. Swank conveys winsomeness and determination as well as any actress this side of Jodie Foster. The characters tend toward stock, but really, they are nicely colored to the point that the story is not disabled by their blandness. Clint takes what might be a straight-forward sports biopic and makes it something so much more. This is a very enjoyable movie.",

72,1 February 2005,curtman2,10, Eastwood TKO,"Grizzly, testosterone-driven Clint Eastwood hits the emotional juggler in a film that succeeds as a simplistic, yet profoundly meaningful and poignant masterpiece of the human soul and spirit: of coming out from the hollow shadows of apathy and defeat to realizing our ambitions and giving our best to fulfill all that we've been given in life. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a mirthful and uplifting journey as well as a brutal and harrowing wake-up call: it bleeds with compassion for its characters, each representing a slice of the ""hard-knocked life"", and delivers many eclectic punches yet never holds back on its powerful theme. The acting here is impeccable: Eastwood delves inside the troubled and ostensibly conflicted Frankie Dunn with naked solemnity; Freeman is portentous as always in his scruffy narration, astute observance, facetious relief and unwavering empathy; Swank, of course, the highlight of this remarkable film, is nothing short of marvelous and outstanding, channeling the deep-seated wounds, abjections, and ambitions of Maggie Fitzgerald as if this challenged life paralleled her own. The plot revolves around boxing, yet its underlying theme that rings deep and true for Maggie is survival through overcoming adversity and despair: we feel engaged in the understanding that whatever punches she releases, she is relinquishing her justified bouts against life with as much passion and vigor as she can stomach, which indeed is ameliorated by her ""boss"", trainer, and inspiration, Frankie. There is nothing more emotionally absorbing than rooting for a genuine innocent like Maggie who has somehow overcome neglect, discouragement, and poverty, in exalting herself as a champion in her ultimate, and single, passion in life. Not to be mistaken, the film also very much encompasses Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), who seems to bear enormous guilt and emotional distress that could perhaps be remedied in giving this ""girlie"" a shot in life, as if embracing Maggie as the daughter he never knew and always desired. The emotional intensity of ""Million Dollar Baby"" is virtually seamless and unequaled to anything I've experienced in quite many years; such as the aspiration that Maggie eventually realizes from her ravaged-turned rewarding existence, the emotional impact by the end is something one couldn't possibly anticipate, but almost definitely experiences. The veritable narration also resonates with many of the film's events, as if resounding themes, most especially: ""You can only protect yourself"" and ""Hold back too long, and you'll lose the fight"": it becomes heart-pounding and true beyond anything you can imagine... ""Millon Dollar Baby"" is one of the most engaging, invigorating, hearty, and harrowing films you will ever get the ""shot"" at enduring. Its climates of moral adversity, affliction, survival, and redemption culminate as one powerful, emotionally brutal ""knockout"" of a message and a masterpiece that is deeply felt and appreciated on nearly every level. Another note: the use of shadow and darkness throughout the character structure of the film is impressive and telling, serving to deepen the emotional subtlety of its core. Simple, yet hardly guileless, and resoundingly potent and true: this is one of the most fulfilling and affecting experiences delivered in cinema with one indelible mantelpiece of a message: ""Only you can protect yourself"": fight for what is within you, regardless if nobody's watching and only you can see it, and do what you must to fulfill your fervent, aching soul: whatever is infeasible to your surroundings can be achieved from one's impetuous direction, as Maggie Fitzgerald teaches us. Excoriation is not an option: it's either the shot that beats you or the shot that engenders you. **** out of ****",

I am one of those people with a conscience and this movie totally goes against my conscience. I will not spoil the movie for you and it is a fictional film about an aspiring woman boxer who knocks out opponents in the first round. And if you are like me.

This movie should not deserve even to a favorite, if only you know medicine, suffering, and torturing. There is a better ending, and it is definitely not this movie.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint's 25th directorial outing, and the 57th film he's acted in. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is advertised as a female ""Rocky"", with more focus on the boxing trainer. For the first two acts, perhaps, it is. The film follows Frankie Dunn (Clint), who is pursued by aspiring boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, in an Oscar-worthy portrayal). Frankie doesn't want to train girls, but Maggie is persistent, and Frankie eventually agrees. Frankie and his gym manager, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), train Maggie, who quickly rises through the boxing ranks. Maggie becomes a surrogate daughter to Frankie, who has a painful past with his own daughter. It's at the start of the third act that Clint sucker punches the audience, taking the film in a totally unexpected direction. After an accident in the ring, ""Million Dollar Baby"" switches from a female ""Rocky"" to a female ""The Sea Inside"".

Hilary Swank, (Maggie Fitgerald) put her heart and soul into this role as a prize fighter who climbs to unbelievable heights in the world of women boxing with the great help of both Eddie Dupris and Clint Eastwood,(Frankie Dunn). Frankie Dunn constantly has gone to his church and asked the priest many questions concerning the Catholic Faith and even runs into trouble with the Priest trying to understand his frame of thinking. Frnkie Dunn asks the priest a question that will change the entire mood of the film and put it into a very controversial film concerning Life or Death. Nice film.",

I say so in great sorrow, as I believe Swank is part of an elite list of modern-day actresses who truly lives up to the definition of acting. And boy can she act! Swank has that special ability to absorb herself into the role she's playing.

I knew the ending which is why I didn't want to see it. I didn't agree with it which is the only reason that I am giving it a 9. I found the relationship between Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank to be both beautiful, meaningful, and surprisingly platonic which is rare in movies today. There is too much focus on sexuality and this film lacks it completely. The relationship is more father and daughter than anything else. Clint's character Frankie Dunn finds a willing substitute in Hilary Swank's character, Maggie Fitzgerald. Her character recalls her father fondly in spoken memories only. She does not share the same fondness for her mother and other living relatives. Maggie follows her dream to box professionally which her mother disapproves. Maggie works hard, long hours of waitressing. She saves her pennies and even brings home scraps of leftover food. Hunger and poverty is never really talked about in films anyway. Maggie is a strong character who never gives up her dreams and she is loyal to her trainer, Frankie Dunn who learns to train her. The film's ending still leaves me asking more questions. I am not a person who cries easily and I had tears in my eyes. Morgan Freeman is also wonderful and deserved his Academy Award. In any other year, Clint would have won for Best Actor too and Hilary's performance is both heartbreaking and Oscar winning.

With Million Dollar Baby, however; that was not the case. Clint Eastwood's latest film is a powerful blend of believable characters and raw, gritty realism. The film benefits from Clint Eastwood's assured, no frills directing style immensely as it gives the film it's potent edge, and the lack of trickery ensures that our attention is never distracted from the characters and storyline. Clint spends the first twenty minutes of the movie setting the scene, which therefore allows the audience to get to know the score, before taking us on an emotional and physical roller-coaster ride through a myriad of emotions. This allows Eastwood to play with his viewer's emotions without the necessity to concentrate on the central theme of boxing - and Million Dollar Baby is all the better a film for it.",

Before going into this film it must be stressed that the film is not light even for a boxing film. At the end of the film there is no real hope left as we see the consequences of the events preceding. I am not a boxing fan and believe it to be a stupid sport where death lurks in every dark corner and whether Clint Eastwood is a boxing fan or not he deals with my problems with boxing in an intelligent and moving way which express the consequences of what can come from the sport. The direction from Eastwood is quiet and beautiful, something I greatly admire him for that is on perfect showcase here and in other films such as Letters from Iwo Jima and Gran Torino. There is a simplicity to this film which is both moving and harrowing. The acting is brilliant. Hilary Swank's ferocious intensity is perfect and she is the first character we connect to. She's an outsider coming into the realm of boxing just as the audience is an outside coming into the film. The film's narrator and supporting actor Morgan Freeman turns in another wonderful performance which isn't showy but is real and whole and Eastwood leads the ensemble in-front of the camera in one of his finest performances ever captured. His music is also beautiful as it too captures the simplicity of the story. At the end I just feel sorry for Cinderella Man, Ron Howard is probably thinking 'why did I have to release my boxing movie the same year the best one ever made was?'",

It isn't so much about boxing as it is about the emotional wounds they fight against. Questionable conclusion where a decision draws to hopeless speculations. Director Eastwood does a splendid job weaving the lifestyles and personal struggles using the sport as a backdrop. He often makes films regarding one's striving for achievement and the cost for such. His previous credits include Absolute Power and Play Misty for Me. Hilary Swank is fantastic as a waitress whose welfare drawn family discourage her. This is her greatest performance since Boys Don't Cry and she is a straight fighter all the way. Eastwood is always able to capitalize on familiarity by allowing viewers a glimpse into the character's mental sense of being. Morgan Freeman plays a former boxer who works for Eastwood in the gym. He narrates the film as an address to someone else. Other characters are either corny or annoying at best, particularly the meddling greedy family pretending to care. Well crafted film that will disturb some while compelling others. The sport of boxing is a metaphor for fighting to forgive ourselves for the past. Score: 7 Â½ / 10",

Clint Eastwood is great too, though the script relies a little too much on the crusty old men shtick, and uses Morgan Freeman in a way I've seen too many times to truly enjoy, narration and all. The depiction of the welfare family is a little cartoonish and the dialogue at times is mediocre, but those quibbles aside, my goodness, the film packs quite a wallop. I liked how each phase of the story gripped the heart in some way, and had genuine tension. I also liked how the backstory for Eastwood's character, his alienation from his daughter, is never fully explained.

105,4 February 2005,jon.h.ochiai,10, One in a Million,"Director Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is truly a moving and touching motion picture. Powerful. This power derives from amazing actors, an unflinching and uncompromising screenplay by Paul Haggis, and a master director at the zenith of his power. This is the best movie of the year, and Eastwood's finest work. His gift for simplicity and eloquence is absolutely stunning. In writing this comment and acknowledgment, there is apprehension that I may be missing the same respect and integrity that Eastwood has for his audience. The controversial attention given to the story line, which I will not dwell upon, is warranted-- I suppose. Ultimately, it is a matter of choice. And ultimately, regardless of the power of a movie, it is still a movie. That being said, Hilary Swank who inhabits the role of Maggie Fritzgerald, is my favorite all-time movie hero. Her Maggie has such an earnestness, a purity of heart, and spirit that are awe inspiring. Maggie goes after what she wants with everything she's got. Swank truly gives life and soul to Haggis's words and Eastwood's direction. Swank, aside from undergoing hard physical training to bring tough as nails Boxer Maggie to life, also tempers her with a genuine charm, especially when she breaks out a tiny smile that warms your heart. Swank deserves an Oscar for her performance.",
106,28 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Million Dollar Baby might seem like a formulaic sports film, but its core is full of emotion.","Sweet Jesus this was depressing. Like I'm talking soul destroying. The little tiny bit of happiness and glory is absolutely annihilated by the tragic third act. Just like a typical sports drama, a rookie wishes to become a champion (in this case a female) and so they train, win fights and compete in the title match. Yes, we've seen it all before. It's a formula that just works perfectly for the sports genre, so there is no need to alter it. Yet, Clint Eastwood decided to go that extra step further and throw in a plot twist that was ruined by the film's marketing. That issue aside, it was excellently executed and really does create an impact. This isn't just a story about winning boxing and becoming a champion. It's about pursuing your dreams and battling your own personal demons. Trying to make something out of your life. Two juxtaposing personalities makes this abundantly clear. Frankie Dunn gives people opportunities and strives for perfection whereas Eddie Dupris lives his life in regret for not being able to achieve his life's ambition. Maggie comes along with the pain and loss of her past life and is able to connect with these two experienced yet jaded individuals that transcends their sorrow. Through sheer determination of the sport, they battle on together. Like a family they unfortunately never had. Using the sport of boxing, Eastwood turns a simple plot into a subtextual construct about inspiration. Very touching. All performances were outstanding. Swank, Freeman and Eastwood were phenomenal, could watch them all day. Eastwood's direction was incredible, particularly how he filmed the boxing matches. The shots are far away so that you can see the actors fight, as if it was a real boxing match. Paul Haggis' screenplay was sharp and rather cut throat. Eastwood's lines were quite savage which enhanced how fatigued he was. The third act's tonal shift may steer some away but this is a well crafted and well acted sports drama.",

Having previously seen most of the other nominees for best picture as well as the performances up for awards, I had no difficulty in figuring out how I would have voted if I'd been eligible. ""Million Dollar Baby"" was the easy winner, as were Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, and Clint Eastwood for best director. This is a small picture by recent Hollywood standards but it is worthy of every honor it received. The only wasted moment in the entire movie comes the near the end when the incompetent young boxing hopeful, earlier beaten to a pulp, returns to try again. I could have done without that. However, the basic story is told with rare economy. Contrast that with ""Ray"" which is distended and directed with monumental self-indulgence by Taylor Hackford, another nominee for best director. I don't know that I would have given the best acting award to Eastwood. Though he combines surface restraint and inner turmoil in a brilliant realization of the trainer/manager to Swank's Maggie, Jamie Foxx certainly had the showier role -- and he was quite good in it. For myself, however, I would have given the Oscar to Don Cheadle for his performance in ""Hotel Rwanda"" as the hotel manager who reluctantly at first but ultimately at great personal cost and risk saves hundreds from slaughter.

112,1 August 2005,hokiemo,8, Excellent Performances,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is perfectly cast --- the actors take on their parts and make them their own. The story is about a white trash girl, Maggie, who wants to make something of herself and believes that boxing is her calling. She seeks out Frankie to train her at the gym, but he refuses to take her on at first. At first you think Frankie's sexist, but his character is not that simple. The story builds steadily and you later realize Frankie has many good reasons not to train Maggie, but her spirit and dedication win him over eventually. Frankie ties himself emotionally to each person he trains and tries his best to make them champions. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Scrap the gym's custodian and his intelligence and ability to decipher Frankie even surprises Frankie. Scrap reminds me of a man I met one time at my company who earned a purple heart in the Vietnam War, but spent his days sorting mail in the mail room. Surely, this veteran had more to offer the world or maybe I just didn't understand that he had experienced and accomplished more than most people do in a lifetime. I think the situation is the same with Scrap -- being at the gym doing whatever is still immensely satisfying to him. How many people can say they'd want to live at their place of work like Scrap?! Hillary Swank is wonderful as Maggie and Clint Eastwood... well what's not to like?

Many of the characters are connected because of boxing. But through this the film reaches for so much more than simply telling the story of a boxer and her trainer. Instead, the film ultimately tackles issues of faith, love, life, fate, will, strength and ultimately asks one of the greatest questions of all: what does it mean to live? That's not to say there aren't any clichÃ©'s in the film. As hopeful Maggie Fitzgerald goes against all odds to reach her dream of fighting for the world championship there is a hint of familiarity in her efforts that comes in the form of Rocky or real life boxer Jake La Motta (spotlighted in Raging Bull.)

Well but is this movie really about boxing? I don't think so, I mean, in my opinion boxing is here a mere pretext to tell a story about love, friendship, dedication, will strength and fighting spirit for an aim. The main character is a boxer by chance as she could be a soccer player, a singer, a dancer or a pianist. And this is also the story of a false hard hearted guy who loses a daughter and meets another to whom he can give his fatherly love and get it returned. This movie is made with a, shall we say, atrocious realism both visual and psychological and the acting performers do their best to express it. The outcome, though caused by a fortuitous (or not?) fact, inserts itself totally in the atmosphere created by the two main characters (or three if we consider that the old ex-boxer is also a catalyst of the whole process of events, playing a fundamental part in the consciousness of the other two and acting somehow like their counterpoint).

His sidekick is Morgan Freeman's Eddie, he's the man that runs the gym, an old boxer himself that clean the floors, do some plumbing, give the boxers some words of wisdom when they are in need of it and so on. Into this gym trip's Hilary Swank's Maggie, energetic and determined to go as far as a title shot. What she also wants is Frankie to manage for her so she can get the proper training, but Frankie is made of the old school and that don't involves training girlies. But with her rock hard determination and maybe with some help from Eddie they can wear old Frankie down.",

Not Gladiator, not Chicago, not A Beautiful Mind, not even The Return of the King. All of those films were notable for certain wonderful aspects, but in some way or another, they just don't reach the zenith of cinema that is Million Dollar Baby. I'll confess, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. That alone, however, isn't enough for me when critiquing his films. I liked Mystic River, but its third act was (to put it very kindly) weak. Unforgiven is a masterpiece of a western, but no Clint Eastwood effort that I've yet seen tears open its heart so honestly and nakedly as this film. This film is all about the essence of life and living, and the debate raged by Michael Medved and other political hacks cannot detract from its impact on any viewer. Beating Saving Private Ryan, it's the closest a film has come to making me cry in a theater. I almost did, and it's my own fault for not letting in enough, but that's beside the point. The point here? Million Dollar Baby is an excellent film, rich with character, plot, and unspeakable heartache. You have to see it immediately, and try to hold back (like I did) when Eastwood visits his priest the last time. I won't give away any more than that.",

125,22 April 2005,skcollob,9, Well deserving of its Oscars,"In a word this film is brilliant. The excellent script , the masterful direction and the strong performances catapult it into the higher echelon of Oscar winning films. The story centres around Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood , who was deservedly placed on the shortlist for Best Actor) a boxing trainer who has just lost his latest prospect to a rival promoter. Just before he is about to throw in the towel (or so to speak), he encounters Maggie Fitzgerald (an ambitious female boxer who asks Frankie to help train her). At first Frankie is not so sure ,he doesn't want to venture into the world of female boxing at his age. However Maggies drive forces him to take take notice . Soon afterwards he takes her under his wing and trains her for the big time.After a rocky start they become good friends , she even takes him to Missouri to show her mother the new house she had bought for her from the money she won in various fights and tournaments. However her ungrateful mother throws it back in her face leaving Maggie to seek comfort in Frankie. As time goes on she takes part in more and more fights and even adopts the Gaelic term Mo Chuisle (which consequently means My Darling). Very soon she becomes famous among the Irish supporters who fly the green , white and gold at every match.",

Instead, let's immediately assert that Clint Eastwood is a film master, and his latest, *Million Dollar Baby* (shot in 36 days!), is a masterpiece. I would not have thought it possible for him to follow up *Mystic River* -- perhaps the greatest American movie in a decade -- with another astonishing film, but he has done it. How? one wonders. The man's ongoing mastery is almost dismaying, in the same way that Michelangelo's incessant masterpieces must've disheartened artists who were 60 years younger than himself.",

He will make movies that you either love or you hate, yet they will have their impact. As much as I hated Mystic River, I LOVED MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Million Dollar Baby is by far the most brutally honest film I have seen since Monster's Ball or even Requiem for a Dream.

At first, Frankie is hesitant on training Maggie due to the fact that she's a girl and claims that girls are not tough enough. Morgan Freeman's character, Scrap, decides to help Maggie and angers Frankie in the process.

In this case, the done-to-death story-line is about a fighter who wants to get her shot at the title and the hard-headed trainer who reluctantly takes her on. Don't be fooled by the story-line though. This is no Rocky. Million Dollar Baby is to Rocky as a diamond is to some cheap quartz imitation.",
135,21 January 2006,dee.reid,10," ""Million Dollary Baby"" - a knockout","I'm amazed at the strength of this movie, ""Million Dollar Baby."" I'm also amazed at how far its director and lead actor, Clint Eastwood, has progressed as a filmmaker. (It's easy to see that his ""Dirty Harry"" days are way behind him.) Since 1992's ""Unforgiven,"" we've seen an insightful, straightforward way of storytelling from the actor-turned-director, who has developed the most unique talent of any filmmaker alive today, which is to understand his characters and present them in a significant, but not overstated fashion that brings about their emotions, pains, and successes. His latest film, adapted by screenwriter Paul Haggis from stories printed in ""Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner"" by the late F.X. Toole, searches the souls of three people in the boxing ring of life. The first is old and tired gym owner Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), the type of world-weary character Eastwood specializes in, who knows the ring inside-out and reads poetry in his spare time. The second is hillbilly (white trailer trash?) Maggie Fitzgerald (a knockout powerhouse played by Oscar-winner Hilary Swank), who thinks boxing is the only way out of her job as a waitress, which she has been doing since the tender age of 13. Frankie reluctantly takes her under his wing and their path leads her on an escapable course with destiny. She trains hard, sweats hard, knocks out the competition in one round for several bouts (a feat that embarrasses the daylights out of certain managers), and a chance at a title shot if she can unseat the brutal Billie ""The Blue Bear"" (Lucia Rijker). She makes a complete turnaround in character, going from bright-eyed rookie to seasoned professional, and the way the film tracks her progress is relayed to us beautifully. Lastly, there is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the story's narrator. Scrap is sincere in his narration in yet another world-weary manner like Eastwood and doesn't twist or play with his words to make points. As a former fighter who Frankie once trained, he's blind in one eye, out of the ring, but possess the wisdom worthy of one to tell a story like Frankie and Maggie's. It's not hard to see why Roger Ebert showered it with praise; nothing in his review convinced me he was lying. The raw power of ""Million Dollar Baby"" lies in the performances and straightforward narrative of the story, all of which I described earlier. It won four Oscars and two Golden Globes, though sadly enough the emotional score that Eastwood himself composed didn't win anything. This is the best movie about boxing and boxers I've seen since ""Rocky"" (1976). But right there is the distinction. ""Million Dollar Baby"" isn't so much about boxing and winning the title as it is a close inspection of the relationship of three different people. ""Rocky"" is about that one shot, that one chance to make something of yourself; this film is about living those dreams. ""Million Dollar Baby"" - a knockout.",
136,5 February 2005,cinematic_aficionado,10, Another Eastwood winner!!!,"Well I just returned form the cinema, and what can I say?? WOW!!! Captivating from the start and even though at some point it even made me believe it would be very predictable...I could not be more wrong.",
137,2 April 2005,MichaelMargetis,10, The Best Picture of the Year!,"On the outside 'Million Dollar Baby' seems like a boxing picture, but it's really a character study of the three characters involved (played expertly by Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman). Before I saw the film, I thought it was going to be a tacky and sappy girl boxing movie, but it wasn't. I find even after I've seen it, it's hard to convince people the film is not like that, and it's not a conventional formulaic boxing film like Rocky, but that it is something a hell of a lot deeper. After seeing the film for a second time, I found that it really has no weak points other then being a little slow towards the beginning (which was essential in order to tell the story correctly.) Clint Eastwood not only does an outstanding job directing this soon-to-be-classic, but he also produces the film, composes a spellbinding musical score, and gives his very best screen performance as Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck boxing manager who decides to take on a wannabe female boxer. Morgan Freeman provides us with a quiet yet extremely effective performance as Frankie's long-time friend and partner. Not only does Freeman play this part, but his character narrates the story, so the whole movie is told from this character's perspective. The on-screen chemistry between Eastwood and Freeman is too incredible for words, a chemistry that was only once before seen in 1992's Best Picture winner 'Unforgiven', that was also made by Eastwood. The best performance of the film obviously comes from Hilary Swank as the average trailer-trash restaurant waitress who's one true passion is for boxing. Swank delivers a tour-de-force performance, and along with Eastwood it's also her best on-screen acting performance. Ms. Swank knows her character very well, and it shows that she didn't just memorize the lines of the character, but she embodied the character. Overall, when you see the film you don't see the three actors, but the characters they portray. 'Million Dollar Baby' is my choice for Best Picture, along with the Oscars for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing and Best Original Score. However I think Hilary Swank shouldn't be awarded Best Actress, that title belongs to Imelda Staunton who gave definitely one of the best female performances I have ever or probably will ever see in my life in Mike Leigh's 'Vera Drake'. Grade: A (Review written 1/25/04; retrieved from metacritic.com ; screened at Harkins Cine Capri at Scottsdale 101, Scottsdale, Arizona)",
138,22 August 2014,manitobaman81,7, Good,"It's never boring. Eastwood is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. Here he has chosen to make a heart-felt, character-driven film. All of the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. But it is a true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people.",
139,18 June 2020,brett-76260,9, Awesome flick,I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Swank was perfect for the role and just did an outstanding job. Definitely Oscar worthy. If you haven't seen this its worth your time.,
140,8 May 2005,esteban1747,8, Is professional boxing a real sport?,"Since long time I am convinced of the need to prohibit men professional boxing, so for women it is much more obvious, and this film probably reflects much of our concern about this ""sport"" managed and ruled often by gangs. I still remember the Tyson-Hollyfield match, where Tyson finished biting Hollyfield's ear, ridiculous and anti sport behavior, but Tyson after sometime started to box again. Professional boxing destroyed several valuable boxers, among them Joe Louis, Kid Gavilan and others. Often you have an invented champion like Benny Parets in the 50s, who at the end was killed in the ring in a match with Emile Griffith. Parets was never a real champion, he was just the bait for a big match with Griffith, who was much better than Parets. Here the film goes around a girl of a very humble origin, with a family nearly illiterate and a bit wild. She wanted to help their relatives working and boxing, but her family wanted all money earned by her without giving any service to her at all. She (Hilary Swank) was persistent in her intentions to become a boxer, and was good under the advice of his trainer (Clint Eastwood), and got nearly all victories in the ring except one. The film plot is interesting in general, but I am asking myself: what happened to that wild woman boxer who did not follow the rules of the fight? The film never said nothing about her final fate, probably she continued behaving herself as she was. In boxing the spectacle is much more important than the human's life, the rules are made to see bloodshed, people falling down after several punches and agonizing. There is no protection to the man, at the end if he/she dies, who cares? These constraints are well shown by the film, which could have gone deeper into this problem, but probably Eastwood preferred to show some insides of this ""game"". It is not the first film about the problem of professional boxing, but it's the first one including women. Good acting of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, in fact both really were well awarded by their acting, Eastwood was also good but a little bit under the level of Swank and Freeman.",
141,2 June 2008,deltahotel,10, This film deserves every good thing said about it,"This has to be a 10. This movie never loses it's impact, emotion, or ""wow"" factor every time I see it. I almost can't say a bad thing about it. As for story and content, I'd probably give it a 9, but the powerhouse trio of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank push it to a 10. For one thing, I seem to enjoy movies that are narrated by one of the major characters, and Morgan does a fantastic job at this. It was just the right level of emotion to carry through the film. The boxing scenes were awesome!!! Clint Eastwood pulled off the perfect combination of hardened trainer and loving father. It was almost as if he had Maggie replace his daughter who would not talk to him. However, I must say that this is especially fitting for a boxing movie, two people need to be punched in the face. The first, and the most deserving of a punch in the face is Maggie's mother. She is a disgusting, lazy, selfish loser who wants to just sit and take handouts, living off the government while illegally accepting money and gifts from other people. Then she has the balls to hire a lawyer to try to take Maggie's money under the guise of ""protecting her assets."" Bullcrap! Also, to top it all off, when Maggie's family comes out to see her, they spend the day at Disneyland first! Some winning family she has. I almost cheered when Maggie told them all where to shove it. I really enjoy seeing stupid people like that get what they deserve. The second person that needs a punch in the face is the Blue Bear. The cheap shot she took cost Maggie her mobility and career, and eventually her life. We do not hear later what happens to the Blue Bear, but hopefully she was severely punished and banned from boxing. Somehow, I don't think so because she already had a reputation for fighting dirty and getting away with it, but I think I saw a hint of remorse on her face she she saw Maggie's neck break. All in all, amazing film, great music, story, characters, acting, awesome! See my profile to understand my rating philosophy.",
142,28 February 2005,univarn,10," Million Dollar Baby, so well crafted its perfect","This movie is not an action packed boxing movie, its not some random character drama. This movie is all of that and (no pun intended) a million times more. This film, directed by Clint Eastwood, is one of the best films I have seen in my life. It isn't original but this movie does such an amazing job of drawing you into the scenes and the characters and the fights that you will be cheering and crying throughout this journey. The best part is what you take away from this film, a mild sort of hope and despair. This movie blends it all so well that you get involved in the film and love every moment. The acting is some of the best of recent years and Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood all give powerful performances that are just involving. You really get to know these characters as the film progresses and the story opens up. I don't think there was any film last year that came even close to the level of perfection for this movie. Everything done by this movie was just on the dot perfect, and this is possibly the greatest film of Clint Eastwoods entire career.",

I've always admired Clint Eastwood's style and choice of films to make, his films are so human at the core and that's something that's sorely missed. Every time I see that Eastwood has directed a film, I am eager to watch it. The stories he chooses and the characters he shows are the essence of human everyday life; and as a result I can FEEL his films that much more. This time around, however, the simplicity and realness of the story was SO MUCH that I was almost numb after wards. Unlike Mystic River, which was more in-your-face, raw emotion that could be immediately recognized; Million Dollar Baby is so much more reserved, almost passive in telling its tale that all of its influence can't be initially taken in. Million Dollar Baby is so ""bare-boned"" it's almost scary to look at. It's so subtle that I didn't recognize the true beauty of it until further contemplation as I was leaving the theater.",

146,21 January 2005,the-movie-guy,10, Eastwood has made another great and touching movie,"Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old boxer, trainer, and sometimes manager who owns a boxing gym. Frankie has trained and managed a boxer for the last 8 years to a title fight, but he says he needs some more work, before he goes for the title. Frankie has been overprotecting his fighter, because he had a problem with another title fight many years earlier. The fighter drops Frankie and gets another manager. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) an untrained 31-year old fighter wants Frankie to train her, but Frankie tells her that she is too old and he doesn't train girls. Maggie begins to train on her own. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), an old boxer who lives in and looks after Frankie's gym, gives Maggie some tips on hitting the bag. Frankie wants Maggie out of his gym until he finds out that she has paid 6-months of gym dues in advance. Maggie trains day after day and finally gets under Frankie's skin. Frankie agrees to train Maggie, but she must follow his number-one rule, protect yourself at all times. Maggie begins to win fight after fight, and after 1-Â½ years, Maggie gets a title fight in Las Vegas for a share of a million dollar purse. Clint Eastwood not only stared in this movie, but also directed, produced, and wrote the music. The movie shows the determination a woman must have to fight her way into the male dominated world of professional boxing. Hillary Swank will surely be nominated for an Academy Award. The movie also shows the friendship and sense of family that is formed between a trainer and his fighter. You may shed a few tears at the end of the movie.

148,5 January 2008,tavm,10, Million Dollar Baby was certainly one of the best pictures of 2004,"I've now seen this movie twice. The first time was in the theatre after it won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Clint Eastwood), Best Actress (Hilary Swank), and Best Supporting Actor (Morgan Freeman). The last was hours ago on HD DVD with my parents. My dad thought it dragged a little while my mom thought it was about more than boxing and liked the slow passages. In between the drama with the three stars, there's some humor involving Clint and Morgan as well as with Morgan and some of the other boxing hopefuls including a really enthusiastic kid who initially calls Freeman the ""N"" word but says he doesn't really mean it. Morgan's character also narrates the story in what is revealed to be a letter to Eastwood's long-estranged daughter who we never see. The movie does take its own sweet time and makes Paul Haggis' dialogue shine throughout. Since I've only seen one of the other Best Picture Oscar nominees of 2004 (The Aviator), I can't judge if this was indeed the finest of that year. However, Million Dollar Baby was certainly one of the most compelling.",

It seems like in every movie he is great in. He is a terrific actor and he made this movie a plus. To me, he was better than all the actors in the movie, even Hilary Swank. The script was pretty good also and Paul Haggis is going to have a great future in his writing. The boxing scenes are quite intense and it makes you just want to get in the boxing ring and fight someone. That's what I like in intense movies. *Major spoiler ahead*. There are a few clichÃ©s though and I thought that the white trash girl who meets the old trainer and becomes great instantly, then gets hit and is paralyzed, but old trainer happens to pop up and kill her because she asked him too got a little to over the top and it just didn't get to me that great. I don't know but on some parts, it didn't quite get to me that good, like the ending. Overall, Million Dollar Baby was a good movie that had a big heart.

This is a drama that packs a punch. Clint Eastwood directs and stars as Frankie Dunn, a cautious and wise gym owner and former boxing manager. His gym is managed by one of his former fighters Eddie 'Scrap Iron' Dupris(Morgan Freeman). Their lives take on a new perspective when a thirty-something waitress Maggie Fitzgerald(Hilary Swank)comes to the gym hoping to find a manager and trainer to help her escape poverty by becoming a boxer. Maggie and Eddie are convincing enough to change Frankie's mind about training a woman for the ring. Maggie proves to have the determination and the punch to become an acclaimed fighter. The fighting scenes are well choreographed and exciting. This emotional, powerful story has an unexpected and heart rendering finale. Eastwood, Swank and Freeman are excellent.

154,26 August 2021,TheHonestCritic,10, This is one of those films that's worth much more than a million dollars. How does it hold up today?,"""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), this is one of those movies that epitomize the meaning of unpredictable. On top of that, it has found a spot on my top ten all-time saddest films list. ""Million Dollar Baby"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, a woman named Maggie is an amateur boxer who seeks the help of a reluctant trainer in the hopes of becoming a professional. It's about a simple as you can get, but for a story like this, it's warranted, as it allows for more character development. For the first half of the movie, it's kind of like a female version of ""Rocky"". Which, it kind of is, in a way. Then, there's a sudden twist that you will not see coming when you watch it. I certainly didn't expect it when it happened! That, of course made it all the more heartbreaking. I won't go into any further details about the plot, because I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who may not have seen it yet. But, let me warn you, that I suggest you have a box of tissues next to you for the second half of the movie and especially for the ending. That being said, I didn't cry when I first saw it. However, I suddenly felt my eyes water a little bit. That's saying quite a lot, especially from someone like me! If a film can make me almost cry, then it more than succeeded with it's execution. All of the acting is impeccable from the whole entire cast, they knock it out of the park! But, the best performances come from Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. They do a sublime job with their respectable characters! The best acting though in this movie is from Hilary Swank, as Maggie. In my opinion, I think it's her greatest acting performance out of all the films she's starred in. Hilary Swank is a great actress, and this movie laments that a thousand-fold! Her acting, as well as the others in the main cast, makes you genuinely care about their characters and want them to succeed at the end. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and give the film a stunning atmosphere. The lighting, in particular is very good. It highlights the emotions to full extent in the more serious scenes and accentuates how each character is feeling. All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack is a masterpiece and sets the perfect tone for the storyline. Aside from being the director, Clint Eastwood also wrote and composed the film score for this movie! How about that? Talk about full control! ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, quite simply, a masterpiece. It's one of those films that will leave you speechless when you watch it for the first time, or however many times you see it. Even though I know what's going to happen, every plot twist and moment is still a shock and the ending still moves me. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Million Dollar Baby"", what are you waiting for? Go see it today!

156,10 February 2005,rcavellero,10, Phenomenal... The best film of the year!,"So I decided to go see Million Dollar baby on a whim after it was nominated for best picture and boy was I disappointed with myself. For not rushing out to see this astonishing motion picture. Clint Eastwood becomes a master of film with the story of a struggling woman coming out of her youthful prime whom is dying to be trained by him for women's boxing. He's a scruffy old fashioned guy who doesn't believe in training girls and cares to much about his fighters to watch them get hurt, sometimes blocking them from excelling. She is basically defined by herself to be white trash she works very hard as a waitress by day and eats peoples scraps off their plates to survive. She saves all her excess money to train at the gym and for equipment. In some of the film's saddest and most powerful scenes she confronts her trashy family and they have not a thread of redemability. Hilary Swank remains in her finest hour here even after her amazing performance in Boys Don't Cry if she doesn't get an Oscar for this it would be crime. Clint Eastwood is a masterful director and a star he directs the film with passion and acts with conviction. the film covers extremely dark territory and still manages to find some light in it. never before has a film based on any sport including Rocky hit such emotionally depressing depths. That are as memorable as they are powerful, littered with the years finest moments and talent Million Dollar Baby is phenomenal it leads the pack for the bets film of the year! 10/10",
157,4 April 2012,buiger,9, Great movie!,"I basically agree with Ebert's and Berardinelli's reviews here. This was a very well made film about life, populated with real, flesh and blood characters. Apart from a regular, well developed 'boxing plot', the movie also poses a very difficult question about euthanasia, especially considering that this is a major US release. Eastwood answers it bravely and in a manner that will not be seen everywhere as being politically correct.",

159,16 August 2005,DJAkin,10," Move over Rocky, Maggie is in town!!","This was a great movie. I loved the way Clint and Morgan bickered all the time. Of course, nobody can narrate as good as MORGAN FREEMAN!! he is the master of it. Clint delivers more than the goods as the coach of the female Hillary Swank!! Hillary was actually really cute in this flick and kept calling Clint Eastwood BOSS. I was afraid that at one point, she was going to punch somebody out of the ring. If she had DONE THAT, then whoa!!! I loved that dude DALLAS who was retarded. He was innocent and although he called Morgan the N word, Morgan kept being nice to him. Oops, his name is Danger, not Dallas!! Look for a great cameo in the audience during the last fight from Blues Sarceno as a boxing fan. Also, look to get mad at the stupid fat mother!! I hate her so much. She is a fat cow.",
160,29 January 2005,tiggermagoo,10, Fight movie with a wallop of a punch to the gut!,"Million Dollar Baby just came to our fair city this weekend, so I had to go see it. I'm leery of seeing a film when my expectations are so high, it's usually a letdown. Not in this case. I left the theater over an hour ago, and my eyes are still puffy and my nose is still stuffed and running. This is Clint Eastwood's best performance since playing Bill Munny in Unforgiven. In this movie he plays Frankie Dunn, a grizzled old fighter who now owns a boxing gym and trains young fighters. Morgan Freeman is perfect in the role of his sidekick, another old ex-fighter, taking care of the gym for Frankie, while Frankie takes care of him, for reasons that become known during the film. Same type of role he had in Unforgiven as Ned Logan. But the person who really shines in my opinion is Hilary Swank. This film is going to get her noticed. She was good in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and OK in ""Insomnia"", but in this she is simply terrific. She talks Frankie Dunn into managing and training her, against his better judgment, a decision that will have lasting consequences on his life.",
161,12 February 2005,ikanboy,8, Manipulative? Yes. Great? Yes.,"The critics who haven't liked this movie have called it manipulative. Well, they're right! But who cares! Eastwood sucked me in so beautifully that I'm willing to let it pass. As has been said before there is a major shift in this movie that really changes it's message and, excuse the pun, is it ever a sucker punch! Hillary is great, as are Clint and Morgan. Clint even shows some chops as an actor. Sure he's still doing himself, but he really takes on the character. The movie doesn't come close to the depth or sophistication of ""Mystic River"". The story, or rather the two stories, are predictable. Will our spunky heroine win over the old grouch? Will she make good? Will we root her on? You betcha! It's corny but there's good corn and bad corn, and Clint pulls his punches enough ( I'm sorry!) for it to work as solidly good entertainment.",

Undeterred, Maggie joins his gym, hoping that he'll notice her and train. He is equally perseverant, knocking back all her requests to train her. However, eventually she wears him down and he trains her and manages her fight career. Her career goes very well and she now has a shot at the WBA title.

164,6 July 2020,h-28658,8, Deeply depressing but beautifully acted.,"You may think that this is a generic sport movie, but it isn't, and not just because the ending is unforeseen; in technical matters I'd say that it's a masterpiece because everything it sets up has an incredible payoff meaningful to the plot, but in all honesty it's because you can sense the care that everyone put behind it",
165,1 March 2014,jackasstrange,7, Cringeworthy at times and brilliant at others,"Million Dollar Baby is a very inconstant film in quality terms. The start, I mean, the first twenty minutes of film are full of over the top situations (such as the conversation with the priest scene), silly inane dialogs, and a weird voice over by Morgan Freeman narrating everything that happened in the film, even when wasn't needed at all. Yes, horrible way to start a film. I felt that the actors were very uncomfortable saying certain lines because it was truly awful. Paul Haggis, no wonder. The guy who wrote and directed the arguably most moronic and inane(and undeserved) Oscar Winner Picture ever(Crash). Clint's direction was really really good, because the film was brilliant since the 30 minutes and this 'briliantism' lasted until the final 30 minutes. Was really good. The main problem with this film is the quantity of unrealistic situations. A hospital would never allow a patient's leg gangrene, for example. The priest was also completely put of the reality in the film. These among numerous other problems. I could enjoy a lot this film, which is technically very good too, I think Clint and Swank gave their best performances in their careers, but there is way too many awful parts that can't be forgiven. 7/ 10",

I have to say, that when I bought the ticket, I was not so sure, a boxing film..mummy, I don't know.....but this is a boxing film that you should see and you'll be glad to see it. Yes, it's about boxing, but it's about life, love, a thrilling and heartbreaking movie. And Hilary Swank is outstanding, what an actress!! It's more than evident that she put her heart and soul into this demanding piece of work. I think she will have her second Oscar at home soon. Clint Eastwood is good too in his manager role, and the brilliant Morgan Freeman deserves the Oscar too. What more I could say, it's one of the best movies of 2004....go, see it and enjoy the show!!!!",

Most films these days are full of cheap, unrealistic visual effects, bloodshed, and gore, but ""Million Dollar Baby"" avoids these characteristics with such ease.",
174,16 May 2020,ssssgelojun,8, Million dollar baby,"It's hard to imagine that Clint Eastwood produced, directed, starred in, and even scored the film. It's even harder to imagine that the man was nearly seventy years old at the time. People of this age, in our concept, should have retired to the land, retired to the world, and this old genius is under high pressure, high intensity, painstaking, presented to us a so-called ""repression to the extreme"" film. I can't even express my admiration and admiration enough. There are no pretty faces, no fantastic special effects, no fantastic music, and even a handful of characters. But no one can deny its timeliness and unrepeatability.",
175,3 March 2005,Son_of_Mansfield,9, Clint Eastwood scores another point.,"If an artist's job is to get you thinking, then Clint Eastwood is just hitting his prime. Following up on the fantastic Mystic River, comes another complicated and emotional story about redemption that also is kin to Unforgiven. Million Dollar Baby, like Mystic River, strips away almost all gloss and flash to tell the story of an old aged boxer teaching a middle aged woman to box. Both looking to make up for past mistakes, they embark on an ultimately tragic journey. In the end they gain and then lose what they sought. I love Clint's elegant, slow storytelling. The movie moves along without the use of quick cuts or a pulsing soundtrack which would be expected from a sports movie. The ""lesson"" that it is better to have failed then to never tried played out by seemingly perpetual losers should affect anyone. The possible controversy over the ending is simple minded and probably forwarded by those who have not seen the film. I agree with Bill Maher. When someone has had such a life as to be admired and now is rotting away, it is more wrong to keep them alive against their wishes with machines. Not everyone can or wants to become a Christopher Reeve when placed in the situation that he so bravely challenged. This is just my opinion. The performances are commendable as well. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood have great chemistry playing some still very intimidating men, while Hilary Swank again brings a quiet dignity to a possibly flashy role. It is Oscars all around and while I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind should have won best picture, I think this is a worthy movie that justly wins hearts and minds.",
176,19 May 2008,jdkraus,10, No female rocky!,"Truly, one of the best films of the year of 2004 and one of Eastwood's best! I had an impression this would be just a female rocky, but I assure you, it is not. Hilary Swank won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance and Eastwood got well earned Oscars for director and picture. The acting, especially Hilary Swank is superb, including Freeman, who is in supporting this time (who also won). The music was haunting but great, there's offbeat humor, and some of the most important lessons everyone should learn. The only probably with this movie was the last thirty minutes of the film.

It holds our attention almost all the way through with its passionate storytelling. Swank and Freeman are both entrancing in Oscar-winning efforts and Eastwood is no less enthralling as Swank's grizzled trainer. Eastwood does not focus on as much the boxing itself, but the nature of the characters that participate in the sport. The only flaw is the murky, strange ending that does not sum up the film in the way our emotions want. However, 95% of this is excellent movie-making that challenges the viewer to think, not just watch and listen.",
185,19 July 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10, A metaphor of social life,"This film is beautifully strong but immensely cruel. The strength of the film holds in one single fact: anyone can always win one battle provided they are trained properly and they are managed properly. That does not mean they will win the world title but they can always try and win one victory. How far will they go, no one knows, no one can tell. Luckily, otherwise there would be no meaning in trying. But the cruelty is all contained too in one fact: the end of such a fight for the top title is lost sooner or later if the contender does not learn how to cheat with life and the rules or to be aware the other one may cheat with life and the rules and this contender must be ready to resist these attempts. And that's just what the ""boss"" forgot to teach his fighter. And she was the victim of the viciousness of the champion who did something wrong for the third time causing severe damage and eventually death. If you just concentrate on these two elements this film is a masterpiece that deserves all the prizes it got. If you want to go slightly farther and sort out other elements like the heavy reference to God and religion, you will fall into something very trite, like the priest advising the ""boss"" not to meddle with the fallen fighter's desire to die because then he, the boss, would not be able to come to terms with himself. This answer is so narrow-minded, so egotistic in the name of God. I respect the divine command not because I respect or fear God, but because my disobeying this command may make me unhappy. On these sides issues and questions Clint Eastwood is definitely less clear. But the cruelty of this boxing against all people involved in the business is mastered in an admirable way. You win or you die and if you lose you have to die, at least die away into non-existing.",

Eastwood has been one of my favorite actors for a long time, more so his new work in the last 20 years...ie: Mystic River, True Crime, A Perfect World, Absolute Power and so on. I think he has come into his best work in his later years. When accepting his lifetime achievement award several years ago he stated that his best work was still ahead of him and that was the truth!! Million Dollar Baby is the rarely told story of a female Boxer who has the passion and heart but lacks the training. Eastwood plays a rough and tough former trainer turned cut man who is so passionate about boxing and protecting his boxers and when one of his prime boxers leaves him for another manager his sense of responsibility is quite shaken. Enter Swank as the tough as nails Maggie who won't give up on trying to get Eastwood to train her despite his insistence that he ""doesn't train girls."" Her insistence and his lack of faith in his boxers causes them to team up and their bond becomes unbreakable as her intense spirit and his rough exterior but faithful interior comes together. Enter the incomparable Morgan Freeman as Mr. Scrap, the former boxer who Eastwood trained back in their hey day. Scrap has leaved in Eastwood's gym and cleans the floors and is just kind of there to offer wisdom, even when it's not needed. Like it or not, they are all each other has.",

202,24 July 2020,schroederagustavo,9, A very emotional film that hits all the right emotional notes.,"Million Dollar Baby was kind of falsely marketed as a female version of Rocky. It's really not that at all. It's many different things, a character drama, a depiction of the brutality of boxing (I don't think I've ever seen such brutal fights and sound effects for punches), a Cinderella story (at least, up to a certain point), a story about redemption, I could keep going. The main point is this: Million Dollar Baby is an excellent movie, Hilary Swank's performance is great, the direction by Clint Eastwood is awesome and it may be one of the most emotional movies I have seen in a very long time. The only very small nit-pick I may have with the movie is that at times (not always), Morgan Freeman's narration may seem a little too over-indulgent and unnecessary, even though at the end it's revealed that the whole time he was writing a letter to Clint Eastwood's character's daughter. There are times where I think the voice-over is not needed. But I think that's pretty much it, though. It is very good.",

204,10 January 2006,GOWBTW,10, Worth Every Dollar!,"Clint Eastwood is always at his best. This movie in my opinion tops ""UNFORGIVEN"", hands down. Yet, this is ""UNFORGIVEN's"" equal. Hilary Swank was great playing the heavily determined boxer. If it hadn't been for her tenacity, she would automatically given up. Morgan Freeman who worked with Eastwood in ""UNFORGIVEN"" is back with him. He's the more somber character in the movie, while Eastwood plays the harden one. Given the spot to teach Maggie the ropes of boxing wasn't all its cracked up to be, at least it was Frankie's first to teach a girl. Maggie(Swank) is nothing like her role Julie in ""The Next Karate Kid"". In that movie, she was surly. Frankie Dunn(Eastwood) is nothing like ""Dirty"" Harry, yet he displays some hardcore attitude in the movie which makes it watchable. To me, Maggie was the person who show determination, and receives inspiration from Frank, cause to him, he's reminds her of her late father. Since she has complete distrust in her family, she tries to give them what they needed, in return, they ended up being ungrateful, so why send them something? All they want to do is snuff it up. This movie also shows that even the gruffest of all grumps can have a softer side. And it's the first I've seen Eastwood get soft. AWWWWW! But Hey! This movie was no hype. It's a clear winner to me! 5 stars!",

Noting that Maggie's not really male, Frankie treats her with a lot of disdain and disrespect, but grudgingly - with the help of his canny janitor/man-at-arms, Scrap (Morgan Freeman) agrees to train Maggie.

He brooked no insult, pulled no punches and was always committed to (violent) action, regardless of the consequences. Through much of the late 1970's & 1980's, this act got a little worn out, especially in ""Heartbreak Ridge"" and the final two ""Dirty Harry"" films. But then in 1992, he did a movie with Morgan Freeman called ""Unforgiven"". In that film, his trademark machismo gained a new dimension as he played a man who is haunted by all the horror he has caused through killing, but who is simply unsuited for anything else. The movie was rightly hailed as a masterpiece and won Oscars for Best Picture & Best Director. Things seemed to be looking up for the re-invented Clint.",

In this case, it's Hillary Swank's character, Maggie, and it makes all the difference for me because I like a little estrogen in my films. The story is enthralling and character driven - with a focus on all three characters. Now some are very upset by the ending of the film but I felt complete empathy and so did Joe, who I had to basically bribe to see the movie. And he LOVED it. The direction of the film is perfection - Eastwood uses incredible shadow work and several styles that enhance the story so much, that I can't imagine any other director doing the film. While I saw some editing problems in Aviator, and some flaws in the directorial shots, I saw NONE of that here, and I've read Eastwood took only a little over a month to shoot it. Amazing!

As if Eastwood didn't have enough trust to the audience - he had to make all the father-figure metaphors, hints and parallels so evident... ""American Dream"", fabulous for a European like me, in this film becomes a probable option - maybe because the possible interpretations of the ""success"" that the film gives are not all too one-sided (see ""Scrap's"" or Danger's"" story, for example, although Eastwood is not resolute to explore the theme of a seeming failure as some sort of personal success to the end. At times he even lets us believe that what really matters is the ""title"" or having one's moment of glory. ) What I loved about the film was its anti-Hollywood features: minimalistic scenery, meaningful play of shadow and light - at times poetic and speaking volumes, when the faces emerge from the darkness, plus quintessential language (except for the ""psychoanalytic"" utterances, fortunately, not abundant in the film). Very interesting and deep study of the relationship between the master and the apprentice - subtle, complex, moving and, thank God, not melodramatic as the Hollywood filmmakers would typically have it. A good movie, amazing even for a European taste brought up on Kieslowski's or Stuhr's films...",

The movie is packed with human drama and a bit of comedy moments with one Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood at their best.

He is a fantastic actor, that unfortunately takes the occasional not so good script (can we say Dreamcatcher), but you give this man a worthy script, and he lights the screen with his presence! As for Clint Eastwood, this role for me is one of the most enjoyable I've seen him play recently. Of course, Hilary Swank as Maggie was absolutely fantastic! Her character was humble and gutsy, and she portrayed Maggie superbly! I can't recommend this film enough. Go see it now!",
220,19 April 2006,jboothmillard,9, Million Dollar Baby,"I watched this film some time ago, during college, I knew at the time it was a big winner during Awards Season, including the biggest prize at the Oscars, and I was happy to watch it again when Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Clint Eastwood (Play Misty for Me, High Plains Drifter, Unforgiven, The Mule) was celebrating his 90th birthday. Basically, Maggie Fitzgerald (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Hilary Swank) from Missouri works as a waitress. She constantly shows up the Hit Pit, a run-down Los Angeles gym owned and operated by the old, cantankerous boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Oscar nominated Clint Eastwood). Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses. Maggie works out tirelessly each day in the gym and gets some help and encouragement from Frankie's friend and caretaker Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman), who narrates the film. Scrap was once one of Frankie's star fighters, he lost his eye twenty-five years during a fight, ending his boxing career. Frankie is skeptical about women fighters and takes a conservative approach when training upcoming boxers. Frankie himself leads a lonely existence, alienated from his only daughter and having few friends. After much persistence, and following his latest prospect, ""Big Willie"" Little (Mike Colter), leaving to sign a deal with successful manager Mickey Mack (Bruce MacVittie), Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to Maggie's dismay. But when he learns from Scrap that she has been put against the best girl, he rejoins her in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. Maggie is a natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division. With Frankie's coaching she wins many of her lightweight bouts with first-round knockouts. Maggie earns a reputation for her knockouts, and Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her. Eventually, Frankie takes a risk by putting her in the junior welterweight class, where her nose is broken in her first match. Frankie comes to establish a paternal bond with Maggie. Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, which concerns Scrap, who arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack. Out of loyalty, she declines. Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win. With enough winnings earned, Maggie buys her mother Earline (Margo Martindale) a house, but her mother berates Maggie, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her. Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight for Maggie. He secures a $1 million match in Las Vegas, Nevada, between Maggie and welterweight champion, German ex-prostitute Billie ""The Blue Bear"" Osterman (Lucia Rijker), who has a reputation as an unpunished dirty fighter. After a shaky start, Maggie slowly dominates the fight, even Billie throwing illegal punches. The fight ends abruptly in tragedy when Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Before Frankie can pull the corner stool, which was inappropriately placed on its side, out of the way, Maggie lands hard on it (unconvincingly, which is a shame), breaking her neck. Maggie is immediately admitted to hospital but is devastated when she has been left a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic. Frankie experiences the first three of the five stages of grief: first seeking multiple opinions from doctors and being in denial, then blaming Scrap in anger, and later praying and bargaining with God. At her medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive days later only after touring Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood. With an attorney, they are concerned about Maggie's assets, wanting them transferred to them. She orders them to leave, threatening to sell the house and report them to the IRS for her mother and sister's welfare fraud if they ever try to contact her again. Days pass, Maggie develops bedsores and has a leg amputated following an infection. She asks a favour of Frankie: to help her die, declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. Horrified, Frankie refuses. Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly, attempting to bleed to death. The medical staff save her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts. Father Horvak (BrÃ­an F. O'Byrne), the priest Frank has harassed for 23 years, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes. Finally, realising Maggie how much is suffering, he sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Frankie comforts her before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline. He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character. Also starring Anthony Mackie as Shawrelle Berry, Jay Baruchel as Danger Barch, Michael PeÃ±a as Omar, and Riki Lindhome as Mardell Fitzgerald. Swank is terrific as the trainee fighter determined to make the big time, Eastwood is great as the grouchy washed-up trainer taken on her journey, and Freeman, with his distinctive voiceover, is marvellous as the old sidekick. It will appeal to those who enjoy boxing, and for those who don't it will appeal as a sharp, moving, and brutal tale, a standard underdog story with a shocking and emotionally devastating third act, a superb sports drama. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Paul Haggis (Crash, Casino Royale), and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score for Clint Eastwood, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Morgan Freeman was number 27, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",

Clint handles the characters extremely well and gives them each their moment in the sun.The gritty old feel of this film is perfect for it's style and the theme of boxing. Everyone gives great performances, unfortunately, Swank, doesn't deliver on the level of expectancy.

225,9 March 2005,moonspinner55,5, Ready-built for tragedy,"Story of a young, eager female boxer (Hilary Swank), her manager (Clint Eastwood, who also directed) and his assistant (Morgan Freeman) certainly impressed the Academy, winning four Oscars out of seven nominations. Eastwood's directing career has brought forth some very spotty pictures; when he loses his dryly-askew sense of humor, the filmmaker can get awfully one-dimensional. ""Million Dollar Baby"" comes ready-built for tragedy. It has sympathetic characters, strong performances from its cast, and an intriguing scenario that doesn't initially appear to follow a well-trodden formula. However, by the second-half, both Mike Haggis' screenplay (adapted from F. X. Toole's ""Rope Burns"" stories) and Eastwood's agenda have changed dramatically--from a character portrait into a wallow (it's never quite a ""boxing moving"", per se). Haggis seems to be saying that life is rough--for the girl, for her manager, for the assistant, and for the (God help us) mental kid who hangs out at the gym in a gratuitous subplot (designed to give mentor Freeman a few extra scenes). It's an occasionally unpleasant and queasy picture which skirts soap opera territory. Eastwood is an intelligent and caring actor-director (who also provides the somber, quietly effective mood music on the soundtrack), and yet the assembly-line progression of situations here are disappointingly trotted out. The finale is indeed moving, but the set-up for it is almost mechanical. ** from ****",

But I do make few exceptions and in rare cases they pay off, Million Dollar Baby is a fine example of this, it tells the story of a young woman who has a big dream to become the best at boxing. Sounds clichÃ© doesn't it? Yet, Eastwood gives a lesson in film-making, driven by a performance from Swank that has been burned into my mind for the foreseeable future. Swank's character Maggie Fitzgerald slowly grows into a capable fighter, but the fights feel like the side-story in this film about discovering how hard life can hit you(quoting Rocky here seems fitting). I cannot remember a film ending that hit me harder, I wept for a good few minutes and considering I'm not a fan of drama's and am pretty dried eyed, this should give you an idea of what to expect. But nothing will prepere you for this journey through the vivid and heart-breaking story of a young girl trying to make it. Supported by a strong cast including the man behind the scenes and legendary Freeman. This film is a must watch for anyone asking ""how could it be worse?"" Eastwood is about to give you a run for your money. I feel like movies like this will be missed, Cinemas are being flooded with superhero films, makes me wonder, Has the film industry taken a wrong turn? Sure an action-flick is great escape, but it feels so hollow when you see perferfomences like Swanks. Imagine being a fan of film and not knowing about this?

237,10 January 2005,zauis1234,10, Even Better After It Sits,"While watching this, I knew I was seeing a film that was completely engaging. It was paced really well and was top-heavy with wonderful performances. Eastwood is of the school of direction that favors substance over style, yet this film uses shadows and light as tools better than any film I can think of in the last 30 years (Since The Godfather). He also gives, here, his best performance ever. His is a risky performance, as an actor he pushes himself into emotional territory he had only touched on before. Hillary Swank is quite a bit of terrific, as well in a role that is solidly wonderful. She isn't stretching the same way Eastwood is, but is gritty and brave. Morgan Freeman is, like Swank, ""typically"" good, not reaching as far, but when you're Morgan Freeman, you really do not have to. The film is about choices and consequences, and, three days after seeing this, I cannot stop thinking about the implications of the last twenty-five minutes or so. The sign of a great film is what it does to you after it has a chance to settle in. On that basis alone, this ranks towards the top of a Master Director's list of Great Films.

244,9 January 2005,DeLaSoul,10, Amazing piece of cinema,"Million Dollar Baby is a magnificent piece of cinema. It's as simple as that, really. It came very close to eclipsing Sideways as my choice for #1 film of the year, but I thought it had a few very slight flaws that prevented that from happening. Baby is one of those movies that (literally, in this particular case) seems to punch you in the gut. Clint Eastwood's last picture, the also magnificent Mystic River, left me with the same powerful, haunted feeling that this film does. I'm still reflecting and contemplating ideals of the movie despite it ending an hour ago. A lion's share of Million Dollar Baby's success must go to lead actress Hilary Swank, who completely immerses herself in the role and gives the best acting by a lead actress this year. Clint Eastwood himself is also very strong, and Morgan Freeman gives the movie his usual dose of quiet dignity. The one thing in Million Dollar Baby that I could've perhaps done without is the portrayal of a mentally retarded wannabe boxer played by Jay Baruchel, who comes off as perhaps too cartoonish. However, it's only a small section of the film. Baby takes an unexpected twist in its final 1/4, and it's easily one of the most emotional and truly sincere sections of a film in a very long time.

From a technical standpoint, the movie is rarely better than mediocre. Yes, Hilary Swank's acting is fine as far as it goes, but very little is demanded of the role. Her character is basically a clichÃ©. Clint Eastwood is, as usual, Clint Eastwood (imagine a geriatric sad-sack version of Dirty Harry or nearly any other Eastwood character, and there you have him in this film), and Morgan Freeman adds little other than an unnecessary voice-over. The first act is both unrelentingly dull and unimaginative. It strives to come off as some sort of gritty, realistic slice of life, but with nothing but stock characters and dialog, it is doomed from the start.

It's like a darker, slightly harsher Aesop tale, with simplicity in its message ingrained into it, but with power none-the-less. I wouldn't say even after a second viewing that Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's latest film as one of the few remaining Hollywood auteurs, is one of his very best films (I don't know if I may be one of only a few that found Mystic River more shattering on the whole). Still, I think that at the least with these two latest films, Eastwood has reached on his own level the heights of one of his great dramatic influences- director Vittorio De Sica. His films were filled with an intuitive touch of humanity, observing where heart lies within people, and where it doesn't. Aside from the darker themes that the film brings up, it's also at the core a simple tale of those who observe who has heart, kindness, and who doesn't.",

This movie had all the earmarks of being another Rocky or even BETTER. But, somewhere Clint lost his vision on this movie. This film started out as an insiders look into the goings on of professional boxing. It was really interesting to see the skill and technical aspects of boxing brought out by an interesting storyline of a young girl, who is literally fighting her way out of poverty and trying to make a place for herself. Hilary Swank was fantastic in this movie, though most of her lines were standard Hollywood fair...she did the best she could with the script presented her. Her physical prowess was and is unbelievable...she really is a knockout. Morgan Freeman turned in one of his finest performances to date. His repartees with Clint were special. His compassion for the plight of his fellow boxers was special. He is totally deserving of an Oscar nod for this performance. Clint Eastwood as actor/director turned in his now stock old tough guy performance...Gunny Hightower goes boxing...same gruff voice that is supposed to have one believe he is an old lion, still ready to bite. Though his ongoing debate with the local parish priest was humorous. I didn't see anything special from his performance and found the Hightower experience annoying. Clint as director...oh my god. Your filming a boxing movie, that is really interesting, informative and realistic. Your in the squared circle, describing to those who are unaware, the sweet science of boxing, the subtleties and the nuances of balance, grace, defense, footwork, training, the usage of speed bags, the heavy bag...etc..then you tell the story of a women in boxing, a true advent of the awakening of the woman as athlete, in sports that were deemed for men only, and you tell it well. But, the dreaded 'but' word, you take a carnival, cheesy Hollywood spin on the sport you are so compellingly telling. WHY? WHY? WHY? Instead of showing a championship fight where a fighter can and DO get hurt, unfortunately, you disgrace the sport with a comedic mockery that is something you might see from a Hollywood B minus movie. What a schlockfest. Then the hospital scenes should have been saved for 'Snow White Goes to the Snake Pit'. Have you know shame? The despicable scenes in the hospital are too felonious to mention. All I can say is for the traumatized paraplegics that fight for their breathes every single second of every day. Praying for a miracle and that modern science can one day help them. For them you should be ashamed of your ending. I was sickened by this cheap, lowbridge schlockfestival. If ever you could wish for a Hays Commission...or someone to put smelling salts under Eastwoods nose...this would have been it. I don't normally write bad reviews for a movie, but one piece of cow manure like this is hoisted up as some pretense to wave the Clint Eastwood flag...shame on you. For this film to be placed in contention for an Oscar is a disgrace to the Academy and the awards they represent.",
266,29 June 2006,chuckdduck23-1,1, Best Picture? More Like BS Picture!,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be another Rocky, which would have been just fine with me. But instead, I was treated with a film that was nothing but clichÃ© after clichÃ©. When Clint Eastwood says, ""Girlie,tough ain't enough"", I just groaned to myself. He then says, "" I don't train girls"", you then just know he was going to train her. Also, any time that Clint's at church, you know why he's there. He pretends to be a pain in the ass, but really wants salvation from his isolation from his daughter. All of these build up to the title fight, where Hilary Swank is tragically injured. Also, not to be too big a nitpicker, but her opponent would have disqualified for punching her while she was down, no ref would allow that. Once the fight is over, the film absolutely goes into the ground for me. Hilary Swank is injured, her spine broken, along with her spirit. She goes through the motions, leaning to use a wheelchair, getting out of bed, etc. She then has a ""visit"" from her family, who just wants her money(clichÃ© alert!). The movie then just barely whirs along, until finally, just as Clint's character offers to get Hilary Swank a wheelchair, so she can continue on in life, maybe even go to college. Instead of accepting this kind offer, the writers of this film, decide it would be better for her to die just because she is disabled. The reasoning being, that of course, she can't do what she wants to do, so she should just give up. This attitude towards people with disabilities is a shallow one, that displays a lack of knowledge about people with disabilities. Even if she can't box, that does not give her the right to die. I have a disability that, in a way, i acquired during my life. This prevented me from baseball, my first love. But I took my new life, embraced it, and I now play wheelchair basketball for a nationally ranked team. This movie shows that people with disabilities are helpless, with nothing to add to society.

276,8 August 2022,daking88,7, Top performance by Eastwood,"Lint Eastwood gives the performance of his career even better than his other Oscar nominated performance in ""Unforgiven."" His voice hasn't been raspier and we've never seen him so bare in character. His scene that proves the worthiness of the performance is his scene when he's in the church crying. There's no performance in 2004 that shows more nakedness and more emotion than that of Eastwood's. Hilary Swank also gives a performance worth remembering. Her character of Maggie is entirely lovable and believable at all times throughout the film. You love her from the very second you get your eyes on her. The real triumph of her performance is the entire last 1/3 of the film. From the moment of her being paralyzed you feel every bit of pain she feels and every tear she sheds you shed with her. She completely embodied herself into the character. Despite the breathtaking performance I still wouldn't give her the Oscar for the 2nd time. The nomination nonetheless was very well deserved. Morgan Freeman was one of the most overdue actors working today prior to ""Million Dollar Baby."" The performance was very good but not one of his best. His win was a celebration of all his fantastic films that went unnoticed by the Academy. (The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, Street Smart) He is a very talented man showing many ranges in his impressive career from drama to comedy and back to drama again. You can't help but love ""Scrap."" Every line Freeman delivers in the film either gets a laugh or just utterly scene stealing from his co-stars Eastwood and Swank. If it wasn't for his overdue status going into the Oscars I wouldn't of gave him the Oscar. If were going on solely performance Clive Owen from ""Closer"" definitely out-did him. Nonetheless Freeman's impressive career made him the prime candidate of winning his long overdue Oscar. Clint Eastwood directs this film to utter perfection.

Toole's only novel, 'Pound for Pound'; but watch 'Million Dollar Baby', derived from an earlier short story of Toole's, and you enter exactly the same world, that of seedy gyms occupied by old men for whom life is boxing, and boxing is life. The twist in this tale is that the central boxer is a woman; although the meaning of title eventually becomes apparent in a way you don't at first suspect. However, I found the film a little short on back story, the lead male characters (played by director Clint Eastwood, and fellow veteran Morgan Freeman) seem weary without explanation; sighing, which both are good at, is not in itself a sign of profundity. And rather as it did in 'The Shawshank Redemption', Morgan's narration softens the movie, which in fact is surprisingly unvisceral for a story about fighting. Likewise, the issue of how a woman finds social acceptance as a boxer is skirted; Hilary Swank's character feels more at home here than she does anywhere else, although we learn nothing of how she came to discover that boxing was her thing. Of course, in many ways, this film is better for not being 'Rocky'; but I still wonder, did it have to be quite so low-key?",

How's THAT for bucking established trends? Here's to hoping that more films follow form now that there's proof that substance does mean something after all. So if you haven't yet seen ""Million Dollar Baby"", give it a shot. Wonderful, wonderful stuff sans all those trappings that have kept me out of first run theaters for the better part of two decades now. Sometimes they DO make'em like they used to. Enjoy!",

Brilliant.,"I must confess that I love this movie, but I dont watch it very often, because I always get really sad and emotional when watching this movie. So if you are in the mood for a really (good) tearjerker, with the best acting performances, with a sublime direction, beautiful photography and a story that will touch you deeply, then this is your pick.",
298,25 January 2005,MOscarbradley,8, A Classic,"The title is deceptive. It could be a Betty Grable picture - it once was a Priscilla Lane/Ronnie Regan movie - or a piece of show-biz hype about triumph over adversity. In fact, for it's first half that is exactly what it is and if the plot seems formulaic, Eastwood imbues it with such a feeling for character and milieu that clichÃ© is the last thing you are likely to think of. Then about mid-way it takes a darker turn. Guilt and redemption come to the fore and the up-beat triumphalism of what has gone before is jettisoned in favor of another of Eastwood's bleak studies of the American malaise. Not a bad thing given his skill in handling this kind of material, though you may come away from the film admiring it rather more than you actually like it.",
299,21 July 2005,jjo999,10, Earns a million stars!,"I do not know how to begin praising this movie. The plot was amazing and it goes very deep. The relationship between the characters is just so real that I felt like I was taken into the movie myself. I felt like I was there actually watching everything happen. I've never been interested in boxing, but this was okay because the movie was about so much more than the sport. It was obvious to see that Hilary Swank's character, Maggie was not a failure even though she wound up on the floor after fighting for the winning title. She won because she achieved what she wanted to achieve in life, and there aren't many people who can be satisfied with that. This movie can teach us all something about life and how to appreciate it and though many may find the message behind the movie clichÃ©, I don't think it could be emphasized enough since we all forget how to appreciate life over and over again.",
300,25 January 2005,sumsumng,10, excellent work!,Clint sure knew how to hit the audience unguarded.When I was watching the movie I was expecting an encouraging girl-dream-come-true story. But the ending was so astonishing and hurting.,

302,18 March 2005,andrew_garza,10, Swank's Most Powerful Performance To Date,"Swank has won critical acclaim for her role in Boys Don't Cry, for which she received a Golden Globe for Best Actress In A Motion Picture-Drama as well as the ever coveted Academy Award for Best Actress In A Lead Role, of which she beat out the amazing Annette Bening who was favored to take home the Oscar. Swank's powerhouse performance in Million Dollar Baby left me in awe. She is truly one of the most gifted actresses around and seems to deliver an artful kick in the ass if given the right script. She blew me away as Maggie Fitzgerald and truly deserved her 2nd Oscar! The scene where she is practicing in The Hit Pit on the night of her 32nd birthday was one of my favorites. Clint Eastwood gave probably the performance of his career and the ever graceful Mogan Freeman deserved his long overdue Oscar for his amazing performance and ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris...",
303,15 January 2005,Moovimn67,10, Wonderfully Brilliant Surprising Masterpiece,"To be honest, when I first heard about this movie and that it was Mr. Eastwood's next film venture, I was a bit skeptical. Even though I am a die-hard Clint Eastwood fan, even giving my son the middle name Eastwood, it sounded like a boring story and not up my idol's alley. Then of course, after watching the trailer, I became intrigued and then of course, after all the critical praise, became intent on seeing it soon. Trouble was, it was only playing at one theater in my area and a good thirty miles from home. Tonight, I decided to make the trip and boy my efforts paid off. This film starts out to be a great story and sweet, funny and visually stunning and then once it starts to reach it's climax, changes gears and goes another direction. I won't tell you where it heads, but suffice it say, this film was just marvelous. Also, be prepared, that if some films tug at your heart strings, it may be worthwhile to take some tissues with you. Just do whatever you can to see this movie, you'll be glad you did. Bravo Clint, All The Very Best And Many Years To Come.",

It's an unfortunate test really, because I love suspense in movies, but quiet true. It began when I first saw Apollo 13. I knew the history, yet i still sat on the edge of my seat, stupidly holding my breath, wondering if the crew would survive re-entry. Now a number of people told me how Million Dollar Baby ended, and dare I say it made the movie better in someways.",

It is one of the most impressive and intense that I have seen in a while and I believe that it couldn't have had any other destiny than winning the Oscar for Best Motion Picture, in that distant year of 2005.

Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood and last but certainly not least...Hillary Swank. I felt like I was ringside; hearing, feeling and impacting each element of the story. It was an education in itself at how moving cinema can be and how much trust it takes to immerse oneself and walk out totally satisfied that movies are still worth the money. Speaking and relaying thoughts without words is incredibly and masterfully done here. And for the viewer, this technique in cinema enables us to be drawn into the action, not just a spectator! THANK YOU - - to everyone involved in this heart crushing but worthy story.",

I came out with a new idea of what makes a great film a masterpiece. The acting is brilliant all around, the story is extremely captivating, and the emotions reach all time highs. This movie is wonderfully told and beautifully designed. This film should go down as one of the greats in the annals of movie lore. It is emotionally moving and stunning. The triumphs and sufferings of each individual character are heartfelt and understood on a deeply personal level. If there are only a few films that you could see, I would most assuredly recommend putting 'Million Dollar Baby' at the top of the list.",
312,21 May 2006,thecubanratio,1, horrible,"I thought this movie was absolutely horrible. There was no point of the retarded kid at the gym who kept on saying that he was the heavy weight champion of the world. That ruined most of the movie. It also didn't follow any real boxing rules. If that girl that she was fighting at the end would've really done that to her, there wouldn't have been just a little warning. She wouldn't have been allowed to hit that other girl in the sciatic nerve too. It would've also been the under card of a major mens' boxing match like a De La Hoya fight. Also, when her parents went to visit her in the hospital and one of her relatives said,""She has to sign it with her mouth"", it was just so stupid. The is movie was completely unrealistic and more like an assisted suicide movie then a great drama. I definitely think this movie shouldn't have won the best picture of year either.",
313,11 August 2005,Samualt,9, Very good movie about an aspiring woman boxer.,"This movie is really two movies in one. The first half is about an aspiring woman boxer and the problems she must overcome to get where she wants to go, and also about her trainer and how he gets involved with her. But the second half of this movie is the real drama, about how people affect each other's lives and how they find meaning by taking that one shot and how they face adversity. I would have given this movie a perfect ten but I was really in the mood for something a little more uplifting, instead of deep. Still, the acting couldn't have been better, the plot was interesting, the cinematography was good, the direction was excellent. Go see it!",

This is near perfectly paced old fashioned story telling letting the characters draw you in and utterly captivating you from the start. This film is quite slow all the way through but it is the story and the experiences the characters have that makes this film what it is. there are comedic moments in this film (danger....brilliant)and there is a real realistic portrayal of some families in this world, and the heart felt sadness you leave the cinema with is just, well simply put............devastating. all in all this film has it all.........please go and see it because its a feelin you'll not be forgetting for a long time indeed!",

The performances all around deserve noms, but Colin Farrel still deserves the win for actor. The story is simple, deep, but still interesting, and provides many humorous, dramatic, shocking, and entertaining moments. Much better then Mystic River, which was only worth seeing once, but this is a movie that will be remembered because you can tell Clint was passionate about it, very, and it comes into you. Its better then Rocky, so its the best boxing movie, even though there's only a total of about 20 to 30 mins of actual boxing, but even in that area it beats Rocky which had 1 fight only, the fights are sometimes funny, sometimes enthralling, and most of the time shocking. Ebert actually got one right this year, somewhat, he said this was the best film of the year, close, id say the fourth, Alexander, Troy, and Passion of the Christ are still the top three, for me, not for very many else, but i don't care, i like what i like.

So for this film to win me over, it had to be really special. And it was. One of the reasons for this is that although the film does show the positive aspects of boxing, it doesn't glorify it. You see everything â€“ the glory, the pain, the heartbreak, the feeling of belonging that is all some people have to hold on to. This film takes you on a real roller-coaster of emotion, taking you from the bottom to the top and back again.",

I'm not gonna bother tellin ya the plot or the surprise, ill leave ya to discover that on your own, though if you're payin any attention at all, I'm sure you'll figure out what all the controversy has been about long before the end comes, though being predictable never feels like a flaw with eastwoods movies. its not the end that counts, its the trail ya walk to get there.",

Everything about it is put together so as to bring about a story not just about winning at a tough sport, but connecting with others and building a better future for them. The narration by Morgan Freeman was good. He was a great choice for that and for his role as the gym's caretaker. Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman all do very well with their characters, and I'm glad that they've managed a boxing movie that did not have to rely on so many sequels to get the job done.

They all deliver true, emotional, and heart-wrenching performances that show how dedicated all actors should should be to their work. From watching the movie I realized how important my relationships with the people I love are and that my goals can be reached if I stay focused and work hard. I want to thank Clint Eastwood especially for pouring his heart and soul into this project. To everyone involved in the film, I hope you continue to receive all of the recognition you deserve.

Clint Eastwood proved again with this film that he is one of the great American directors, in a class with his hero, John Ford.

I believe Roger Ebert said(I could be mistaken there), in an analysis of great film actors, that Marlon Brando showed us all everything that could be brought to a film performance, that Paul Newman learned that from Brando, and then went on to learn what could be left out. Clint Eastwood learned from a lot of great directors in his days as one of the greatest movie stars in the world, and he's become one of the greatest directors we have, because he's confident enough, and disciplined enough, to know exactly what he needs to show you, so that you understand why the characters have made the choices they've made.",

What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his film-making techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in this acclaimed 2004 film, a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary.

The acting is superb with Clint Eastwood playing a bitter boxing trainer with a history involving something he regrets. Morgan Freeman narrates superbly just as he did in Shawshank Redemption, and as Eastwood's handyman does not take over the screen.

The three main actors/actresses, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood are at their best and make you forget you are watching a movie. I'm a fan of boxing movies, like the classic 'Rocky', and I thought it was interesting to see a boxing movie about a woman boxer. Hilary Swank clearly worked hard to portray this character and it paid off, she blew me away, I knew she was a great actress, but she just solidified herself as an actress that will stand the test of time.

Both usually try to teach 'deep' lessons while canonizing cardboard characters. This movie was incredible. Clint Eastwood does the nearly impossible. He tells a story well. Hillary Swank is nearly flawless (although I know southern Mo..and that accent is something else again...but it's no worse than the entire cast of ""The Aviator""). I think this movie is going to wear well...not another ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""Driving Miss Daisy"" that embarrasses with each future viewing, but instead it should become the kind of movie that most American directors have never learned to make. An aside: it was a 'movie day' for me and I paired this up with ""The Aviator"" Dicaprio was much better than expected, Cate Blanchette made the ""great Kate"" a real person and not a saint for once (and actually dared imply that she was a ham movie star, at that!..movie almost succeeds on that note alone). What fails is Scorcese. It's too long, too flat, too filled with terrible supporting acting (make Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin STOP...can they play anything else anymore????) Most strangely, for a lover of movie history like Scorcese, it's time lines are wildly inaccurate. I understand artistic license....but even the most casual of viewers of TCM would be confused by his chronology. For god's sake..Rufus Wainwright's flaying in the beginning of the movie???!!..It was like he threw the kitchen sink of 'hot' into the mix..and only managed to detract from a couple of decent performances. Please don't give him an Oscar for this....even he will regret it later.",

352,16 February 2005,Paradigm667,10, Brilliant Paintbrushing by Eastwood,"I hate to see everyone nitpicking at stupid details such as when Maggie goes down and hits her head on the chair, everyone is silent. ""In real life there is no way that would happen, fans would get up, throw things, the trainer would retaliate."" People, first of all, Eastwood isn't wasn't nor will he ever be a boxer. He could have chosen any sport or medium through which to tell his tale. Boxing and a woman just so happen to be great choices for a few reasons, #1 not everyday stuff (woman wanting to be a boxer) #2 great way to symbolize a desire and hidden feelings toward the unexpected for both the female boxer and the trainer. This movie was shot with such impeccable detail that you can bet 80% of most viewers have these things go unnoticed, and cannot identify them, yet almost all of these people are subject to the effect the cinematography has. THAT is truly brilliant. The subtleties like the noir-like voice overs and typical lighting (darker) and word choice in dialog esp between Swank and Eastwood as we see how Maggie truly loves her trainer as a father. And he the same. When Maggie falls down in the ring and gets injured, it is such a dark moment because Eastwood has realized the (in his mind) inevitable tragedy which he has led Maggie into. At that point in time, he already realizes retaliation would be of no use. I actually think that part is one of my favorites. Eastwood is so hit by the fall that he is already past anger and revenge. As if there was a part of him that knew this would happen and now he is feeling guilt and hopelessness. Its really an amazing scene. The filming of that scene also totally emphasizes his inner darkness and pain. This movie stays away from clichÃ©s and doesn't give the audience what it wants to see. It doesn't even deal with Maggies death in a ""noble"" way. Its very real. And that is shocking. This movie is 100% guaranteed to withstand the test of time. I don't know much about Clint Eastwood, but this is all I need to know. The man is brilliant. If you don't shed a tear in this movie, you have no heart. Swank deserves an Oscar, so does Eastwood for the directing. Freeman is the only ClichÃ© (the wise old has been black guy) but if you study his character closely you will see how he is actually not clichÃ©d at all. This movie is so powerful that you need a few hours to recuperate and that gut feeling you get during the movie sticks with you for days, and the appreciation will last forever. GREAT MOVIE.

At last crucial fight of Maggie she got hurt and made her to lying down in the bed. How pity! But my surprise, the real drama is just starting then and ends only in tearful eyes. I never expect such ending. It was a shock. That's why movie being different from others. It has two separate section first half is only boxing in pit and ring and rest second is in hospital.
Clint Eastwood has a brilliant and super acting as well as Hilary Swank too. Other is Morgan Freeman. Direction by CE is also superb.

His direction is just tremendous. I know his Oscar is awaiting. Acting-wise I think this was Clint's best performance. He rips the screen apart in every scene. He can be very humorous at times, and then he can be the total opposite, ""Stubborn-Old-Man"". His plays his role with ease. While best supporting actor award should be reserved for Morgan, cause damn he surely deserves it. He voice, his voice, his voice.There is absolutely no actor like him. He's just too natural. The show -stealer Hilary Swank gives a top notch performance. I know she worked day and night for this role to get in shape and learn boxing, but her role demanded way more than a few punches here n there, and she delivered.

Swank is a woman that I think we will see standing in front of that podium SEVERAL times in her life.

This ""Million Dollar Baby"", however, is not a comedy but a serious look at boxing. Maggie Fitzgerald, a young woman from a dysfunctional working-class family in Missouri, nurses an ambition to become a boxer. She asks Frank Dunn, a well-known boxing coach, to train her. Frank is initially reluctant to take her on, because he does not like the idea of women boxing and because he feels that Maggie, in her early thirties, is too old to take up the sport. Maggie is persistent, however, and Frank is eventually won over by her obvious determination. He accepts her as a pupil, and under his guidance she proves an adept learner. Soon Maggie is boxing professionally, and, after winning first few fights by quick knockouts, she wins the right to challenge for the world title against Billie the Blue Bear, a notoriously dirty German fighter with no respect for the Queensberry Rules.",

That's why his films are so good. He simply loves what he does........and it shows. He is a simple task-master but it works. What he lacks in talent he makes up for in grit, hard work, love of craft and determination for depiction of the truth in a natural way. He has a knack for simplicity and story-telling that is gripping and satisfying. He picks screenplays that are controversial and revolutionary and that require you as an audience to think and use your brain. He is not just there to entertain, though he always does that in large measure, but also to inform and to provoke one to thought - but rarely does he preach. He chooses themes that are often out of the mainstream, but can engage an audience so thoroughly with the universal emotions that we all share in our daily lives that he galvanizes large audiences into reactions that are at once massive but at the same time diverse in opinion. And that is precisely what Clint does here with great success. He does not give you a ""right or wrong"" to it. He just puts it on a platter for you to try it out and see for yourself what you think. I love Clint as an artist and so do many other people. This is a great film. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman fit into their roles beautifully and Clint looks good too.

Far from the cold hard look of it's Dirty Harry or Sergio Leone's westerns, Clint has become a man with a very personal and always emotional view on human relations. From the wonderful Oscar-winning Unforgiven, to the beautiful Bridges of Madison County or the powerful Mystic River, Clint Eastwood always shows us a human story with some unresolved, deep, old wounds from the past that haunt the characters throughout the entire movie. And he is always able to touch the most inner feelings of ourselves. Million Dollar Baby is probably it's most accomplished movie.

Eastwood is boxing club owner and manager Frankie Dunn, who has an untold past between him and his daughter. One day he meets Maggie Fitzgerald(Hilary Swank), who tries to make Frankie her boxing manager. During their journey to the top of the boxing world they become more of friends as anyone else can until a fatal injury that ruins Maggie's life. The film starts out very slow in the beginning. They should have shortened the beginning and beginned with the start of Frankie and Maggie in the boxing fights. I expected it to be a lot like ""Rocky"" with its joyful theme that comes on during the fights and training but I can't say that Eastwood's music is bad. It is more of a film for adults. The film nearly made me cry because of the subject matter. When Maggie died, the film changed its direction afterwards and we won't even know what happens to Frankie next. What made me nearly cry is the whole time that Maggie was in the hospital bed. I knew she was going to die anyway. Freeman does a great performance. The make-up is first-rate and the best(I think it is going to win an Oscar for that). The big part of the picture is Swank's performance. She is going to take the Oscar this year no matter what. Clint's direction and performance is good but ""The Aviator""s Scorsese and Dicaprio is probably going to win. The movie is good but i'll give it an 8/10.",

But, I felt the same way when I saw Mystic River and there certainly was no one in that film with whom I would say I might be in love. When I remembered Mystic River, things started making sense a little... In films like The Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood is making films that are the antithesis of standard Hollywood movie making.

Not only is it overrated, it is flat-out bad. Clint and his screenwriter, Paul Haggis, botch both halves of this manipulative story. The first half shows no respect or even knowledge of the sport of boxing. The gym scenes and training scenes are cursory at best and make Rocky look like the pinnacle of realism. Also, no amount of natural boxing talent allows a 130 pound fighter to pull of early round knockouts every time out. IT DOES NOT HAPPEN in men or women's boxing. But let's just say we can write off the boxing elements as Hollywood shorthand, the characterizations and dramatic thrust of the film are equally stilted and unbalanced. This film should be more complex emotionally than it is. The main characters are made to look way too righteous and everyone else is unfeeling scum, even the priest. How ridiculous is the white trash family caricature? Why does Swank have to fall at the hands of a sucker-punch by a monstrous cheater of an opponent? Do we really need to see Morgan Freeman knock out Danger's taunter? Of course we do because that's the kind of filmmaker Clint Eastwood is. He believes in stacked decks and simplistic portrayals of good vs. evil. Go out and rent The Gauntlet, Pale Rider, Blood Work, Sudden Impact, and other Eastwood films for more examples of his boneheaded approach to humanity. (Mystic River manages to escape ridiculous simplicity thanks in large part to the very talented screenwriter Brian Helgeland.) That kind of attitude can be fun, like in the Dirty Harry films, but in MDB it adds up to cheap, unearned pathos that is practically begging to be recognized by the academy as something important.

At first glance this movie seems like a typical boxing movie. This movie runs much deeper than your typical ""sports movie"". Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie, an aging fight manager, who runs a boxing gym in Los Angeles. Frankie goes to church daily for sins that are not quite known. With Frankie is his friend ""Scrap"", a former fighter that is blind in one eye, that has been with Frankie for several years. Frankie changes when he meets Maggie, a superb Hilary Swank. Maggie is a 30 something waitress who aspires to be a champion boxer. At first Frankie refuses to train Maggie. But Maggies persistence and attitude gives Frankie a change of heart. Frankie takes Maggie to the top and grows to love maggie. The movie has a lot of boxing scenes, but is more about the longing for family. In just over two hours Clint Eastwood creates a masterpiece of emotion and heart, with an incredible cast, and great dialouge. Clint Eastwood stars, directed and composed the wonderful score for this movie. People may think going into this movie that it might be another ""Rocky"". This movie has one thing a boxer really needs in the ring, a lot of heart.",

398,2 March 2005,kingbad,9," Small, beautifully-told, ultimately tragic","Easily the (latest) masterpiece of Clint Eastwood's directorial career, although, on the heels of Unforgiven and Mystic River, perhaps his best is still ahead. Powerful story of a determined young woman and her over-protective trainer/manager. Eastwood is amazing as the tough but fatherly Frankie Dunn, seeking redemption for some great, but untold, sin against his own daughter. Hilary Swank shines in yet another ""role of a lifetime"" as the doomed Fightin' Maggie Fitzgerald, who rises from an awful family life in the Ozarks to become the No. 1 title contender. Morgan Freeman turns in yet another wise sidekick/narrator performance; his role as ""Scrap Iron"" Dupri is strong, although not as memorable as ""Red"" Reddick in The Shawshank Redemption (of course, any time he's not stuck in another Ashley Judd movie is a good thing). SPOILER ALERT!! A lot has been made of the film's treatment of Maggie's paralysis after being injured in the ring, and her decision to enlist devout Catholic Frankie's help in ending her life. Politics aside, however, her choice was completely in keeping with her character, and shouldn't be taken by advocates for the disabled as some sort of approval of assisted suicide. In fact, Frankie's initial refusal, and agonizing decision to help, emphasized the difficult moral choices involved.",
399,15 August 2006,fullonrobotchubby,9, Eastwood's 2nd Best,"Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a long-in-the-tooth boxing manager and trainer who is too timid to allow his pupils to pursue the championship. As soon as Dunn loses his last protÃ©gÃ©, along comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, in her second Best Actress Oscar victory) into his gym, determined to be Dunn's next and first female boxer. After some nudging from his gym's janitor/companion and the film's narrator Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman, winning his first Oscar for a sub par performance), Dunn reluctantly takes young Maggie under his wing and finds the best fighter he's ever helped. From this point, I can't say too much more due to a major plot twist, but the film as a whole is a perfect example of the typical formula for a Shakespearean drama. Once again, my favorite scene is because of Eastwood's performance, about 15-20 minutes from the end, when the tough Dunn breaks down into tears in front of his priest, desperate for a perfect solution he ain't gonna get. Half a star is held back thanks to a pile of clichÃ©s like Maggie's pit bull of a final opponent, the bully of the gym getting his at the end, and Freeman narrating (sooo Shawshank). Besides that, holy McCuishle! If anything at all propels M$B into classics territory, it's the second act.",

401,14 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,3, Bad,"The problem is in the details. Every clichÃ© from ever boxing film before it is used, from the two versions of The Champ, to John Garfield films, to Jimmy Cagney's City For Conquest, to Kirk Douglas's Champion, to the Rocky films, Raging Bull, and the earlier girl fight film, Girlfight. Name a scene in this film and it's a clichÃ©. Eastwood's trainer, Franky Dunn, speaks in a hoarse, gruff manner like Burgess Meredith's Mickey from the Rocky films. Whenever his fighter, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), is losing a fight, Franky spouts a clichÃ© like, 'She's younger, stronger, and a better fighter than you. What're you gonna do about it?' Wham-bam- she knocks out her opponent. Dunn's lone employee at the gym he owns, the Hit Pit, where Maggie shows up in, is an old washed up, one-eyed boxer-cum-janitor (clichÃ©) played by Morgan Freeman (as Scrap Dupris), in another of his trite Wise, Old Negro roles. Freeman's character also narrates the film, punctuating the clichÃ©d scenes, cardboard acting, and all the rest with the most obvious of restatements of what we have just witnessed. Let's see- what other clichÃ©s? There is a retarded boxer named Danger (Jay Baruchel), whom Scrap takes under his wing. There is a cocky fighter named Shawrelle Berry (Anthony Mackie), who thinks he's hot. Of course, he beats the crap out of Danger, only to have blind old Scrap kick his ass with only a single punch. This pabulum that has nothing to do with the actual film's narrative, and serves only to give Freeman his Oscar moment, is almost as bad as the whole premise of the film- that anyone gives a damn about female boxing. To take the film's version of reality, one would think that female boxing is at the height of where male boxing was last century. Even male boxing is in the dumps. Female boxing is a joke sport- right there with obstacles course running with kitchen appliances strapped to your back. Perhaps the most obvious clichÃ© comes when an up and coming boxer of Franky's stabs him in the back to go with another manager, then wins a title.",

But then you have some more stuff that happens and the whole thing is put in a different perspective. Hillary Swank is pretty good, but this is Eastwood's movie, and not only because he directed. His performance is really intriguing, he's really just close to the stock character of the hard-ass trainer, but he's doing so much with it.

I felt like the movie was, at times, a little overly sentimental, it works for the most part but there are moments were it feels a little forced and that it could have been toned down a little, there should have been more scenes where the characters are genuinely happy in each other's company and there is no real drama, just friendship. The performances are outstanding, a movie like this could never have been good without stellar acting, and the casting here is perfect, Hillary Swank shines in every scene, and an Academy Award was well deserved to both her and Morgan Freeman, who isn't in it as much as Swank or Eastwood, but he steals every scene he has and his narration adds perfectly to the film's tone, and as for Clint Eastwood, this is without a doubt some of his best work as both an actor and a director, his character is flawed, angry, and very real, it seemed to come very naturally to him, all the emotion is evident in both his eyes and speech.

Actually, two of them, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Scrap Iron (Freeman) are pretty much mirror images of each other... Frankie owns a rundown Los Angeles gym where he trains up-and-comers... His motto for his fighters is ""protect yourself at all times."" Scrap is an elderly ex-boxer who helps out around the gym and keeps Frankie company... Frankie was the 'cut-man' in one of Scraps' fights that turned bad... Frankie still feels he's partly to blame... But 31 year old Maggie (Hilary Swank) is totally different... She works as a waitress but aspires to be a boxer... She is so poor that she has to pick leftover meat off her customers' plates just to have the energy to keep going... Maggie needs boxing to make something of herself and gain respect... When she first approaches Frankie, asking to be trained, he told her he never trains girls... She continues to hang around and after much harassment he eventually changes his mind... From there, we begin to feel some natural affinity between the two...To say more would be to ruin a lovely, heartbreaking film carefully layered with surprises... Beneath ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there is a love story... A deep love story between two people with scars in their lives... Both are haunted by family problems... Maggie's family, led by her opportunistic mother is alternately cruel and exploitative... Frankie has an unloving daughter he writes to constantly, but his letters always returned unopened, unread and intact... We never know what came between them...

Somehow, though, this stereotyping didn't bother me. The movie had a fairy-tale feel to it, which made it easy for me to ""suspend disbelief."" I found when it was all over that I wanted more. I'd spring for a whole movie just on Frankie Dunn (e.g. the story behind the feud between him and his daughter) or Eddie Dupris (such as his rise and fall in the boxing world, and why he too had so much passion for the sport, and how he maintained such a strong sense of morals and ethics through it all). I too thought there was no way that Maggie could've lost the fight after a sucker punch like that, so I refused to believe it, chalked it up to a lack of follow-up details, and moved on. I commend Hilary Swank for her outstanding performance; after all, to pull off Maggie Fitzgerald's passion for boxing, Swank had to be equally passionate about the role.",

His turnover from that legendary course of bravery in ""Unforgiven"", is now set up in the flat; not charming arena of boxing. But did Clint Eastwood make a movie about boxing? Yes, no. Boxing is the element of desire; uniquely secondary for the movie but primordial to the character of Maggie, to improve on conditions. The lesson moves in a dimmed world, where characters are incomplete and they found in another the way to complete themselves. Eastwood shows his capacity to create credible characters; no dimensional yet dorky and cartoonish heroes. The heroes in ""Million Dollar Baby"" are those we seem to know; but not entirely. The lesson is ""Nothing is beyond you"", yet I find amazing how a very fine script can adjust a story of Frankie's redemption and anger by a lack of communication with his daughter. The film is a calm spectacle of everyday heroes, of great performances (Morgan Freeman with age absorbs perfection) yet a very sour taste.

I really do think that's key. If you run out of ideas for one subject, you take another side and milk it as much as possible. Million Dollar Baby is its own special category. This movie teaches us that ultimately, winners are simply willing to do what losers aren't and that's what screams out a lot in the movie. This film has a lot of heart and pride, and it sure wasn't taken away by the acting or directing of this film. Million Dollar Baby shows the rough side of things to really get the mood going and the mood was set off perfectly. There was remorse, guilt and willingness to do anything all through this film.

When I saw ""Mystic River,"" I was amazed, and touched by it; however, I had read the book, so there were no surprises. After seeing ""Million Dollar Baby,"" today, I am compelled to admit that I have never left a movie in a state of shock. The irony of this film was so overwhelming and the message that it sent was so intense that I was almost unable to leave my seat when it was over. Never before have I seen the use of foreshadowing that was so refined that even when I thought I could predict the outcome of the story, I was wrong. If everyone connected to this film doesn't win an Oscar then the system no longer works. Hilary Swank could give Meryl Streep a run for the money. Clint Eastwood has surpassed Hitchcock when it comes to the element of surprise and story telling. Eastwood and Freeman were so finely tuned the score was hardly recognizable. And the title not only summed up the movie brilliantly but at the same time, bordered on being a misnomer. All I need now is to take a long recovery nap and then attempt to appreciate every day to the fullest. When this movie is released on DVD it should come with a set of emotional steak knives.",

It links with Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN in being about that too - forgiving yourself, not forgiving yourself, forgiving but not forgetting. The screenplay, which is mostly wonderful, has one or two moments, that's all, of clunkiness, in which it feels just a little bit consciously contrived. The only reason I mention it is because nothing else does feel contrived. The rest has the inevitability of the very best drama. Swank is magnificent. The film is superbly directed - the man is indeed a master. Just one example: think of all the overuse that slow-mo gets in movies today, and in previous movies set in the ring. In this movie there is only one moment where it's used, and of course its power is tremendous because of the general restraint. Go see.",

Second, in the Nursing home, if a monitor is turned off, an alarm goes off at the Nurses' station--that in fact would be how they knew that Maggie Fitzerald had bitten her tongue. Third, this Nursing home was allegedly providing good care; yet the gangrene-caused amputation would not have been needed if the patient was provided with appropriate exercise (e.g. Christopher Reeve). Finally, Frankie Dunn's fingerprints would have been on the breathing tube; the surge in adrenalin would have been discovered at autopsy, and he would then be a fugitive in a murder case.",

Through the spaghetti westerns, Dirty Harry films, war films and assorted thrillers, it would a daunting task to calculate just how many lives have been cinematically snuffed out by Eastwood's various alter egos.

Million Dollar baby was a great movie, very inspirational and many people deserve at least an Oscar nomination such as; Hillary Swank for her great acting definitely one of her best films and of course Mr. Morgan Freeman who shows why he is considered such a great actor who was also shafted for his acting in Shawshank Redemption(Tim Robbins also got shafted) Great Movie.",

Clint Eastwood got the award for director, sorry Scorsese! The only part of this film that kind of disgusted me was watching Clint Eastwood cry. Dirty Harry does not cry!

453,7 August 2005,pinochle67,9, Always appreciate the blessing in life,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting, with a few of mini plots surrounding the main plot. The tail of a boxing trainer who through experiences in life does not like to take chances decides to take one more. The trainer has not had contact with his daughter in many years and his continued pursuit of contacting her is constantly rejected. The movie just gives us a small piece of why the trainer's does not have a relationship with his daughter, but this let's the viewer ponder one of the many reasons it happened. He takes his big chance on a girl...who he would not train because of her sex for months. I get the portrayal as this is the relationship with his daughter he never had. The girl's family is lazy, greedy, self-centered people whose only concern with the girl fighter is how much money can she give them. So two peas in a pod are matched with each being quite stubborn. Somehow the relationship blooms. The cautious trainer and fighter take a great ride to the title fight. The end is one of those life searching decisions most of hope never to have to make. Yet a decision the trainer has to make...life or death. I strongly caution parents this film is not for children 17 and under. It is loaded with profane language. I would have rated the film R instead of PG-13 and if not for my TVG devise I would not have let my 13 year old watch.",

It is really a beautiful movie about simple, yet strong things such as: Bravery, determination, hope, trust, compassion and the greatness of giving it one last chance. the last 30 min or so, are very strong and surprising and leaves you with a feeling inside that tells you that this is not just an average movie. To those of you who have not watched it, go ahead and enjoy a special powerful movie, with a good performance by the young Swank, a powerful and worthy performance by the great Clint Eastwood, both as director and actor. And of course a sparkling great performance by our very own Morgan Freeman.",
455,2 February 2005,feminabiondi,9, What may have been in Clint Eastwood's character's past...,"He couldn't forgive himself as an ex-boxer for knocking someone out and either maiming or killing them. In the film when the priest says that for anyone to go to Mass every day for that many years he must be unable to forgive himself for something in his past. This also may explain why he holds his boxers back, i.e.,from a title match...not because he doesn't believe they can win, but more because he wants to be sure they are ready and won't get seriously hurt...he has seen a lot in his day and in his career and it has left him jaded and wounded emotionally. On the whole, I thought it was a wonderful movie; dark, like Mystic River, but very powerful. Hilary Swank's performance was great...I don't know how anyone can beat her for the Oscar.

But the beauty of this film is in Clint Eastwood. Like his later role in ""Gran Torino"", he plays an older man set in his ways and somewhat prejudiced who loosens up and becomes a hero of sorts.

Thats where she meets Frank played by Clint Eastwood who owns a boxing gym. She also meets Frank's longtime friend/partner ""Scrap"" played by respected actor Morgan Freeman who works at the gym. In one of the more touching moments in the film, Maggie offers to walk Scrap home at closing time, Scrap stops and turns his head to tell Maggie he is home as he lives at the gym in a room not much bigger than a closet.

SPOILERS... I couldn't see the entire movie. I did just so I would be able to write this review in peace and not think that I might have missed the overwhelming end of it. How can a movie which is nominated to whole kinds of awards can be so plain, predictable and stupid... The German B'atch takes a cheap shot and our hero breaks her upper back. On a personal note - It would've been better if she had died and the movie would've ended right there. I can't say how much I HATE those petty Oscar movies. a retardate boxer, a female trailer-trash super boxer who basically never loses, a black fighter who could have taken the belt and had lost his eye due to his pride, a gloomy coach and once again - the German boxer. When I saw that so many people gave it a 8 or 9 or even 10 in the rating chart I almost cried. how stupid can one get to be fooled by this so called movie. just because you see an eye sobbing movie you shouldn't rate it 10! Even if you do like this kind of pictures it still shouldn't get more than 4 or 5. I can feel it in my bones how the writer is thinking to himself how to make this movie more and more heartbreaking. I wan't to say to those filmmakers that killing the hero in a heartbreaking scene doesn't guaranty Oscar nomination, but I afraid I'd just be lying. on a final note - Stuppid Oscar season.",

Marty Freeman, Clint Eastwood and of course Hillary Swank are in all senses excellent actors, their delivery is impeccably smooth and almost close to perfection. It is not the acting that spoils the mood, it is the very tedious tempo of the film. Did you notice that sport films are mostly very boring? The acute, high-pitched and up-tempo sport scenes are intermittent with impossibly slow and boring ""real life"" moments, when we see that they are also people, that they have their problems too and so on. But, dear me, I always wait till these boring moments will be replaced with those sharp sporty scenes again.

As for MDB, its plot is full of clichÃ©s and inconsistencies that leave thinking viewers frustrated. (Judging from some of the reviews on this site it seems that I'm not the only one to have been mostly underwhelmed by this Eastwood amateurish confection.)

466,23 March 2012,simeon-james,8, Eastwood is incredible!,"Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts.",

Danielle Steele would have been embarrassed. The exaggerated caricature of the girl's white trash family would have ruined a good film, but in this one, I was past caring when they showed up and tried to trick her out of her earnings.

Ostensibly about pugilism, this is a film that considers euthanasia as its primary subject. The movie, especially its ending, is utterly implausible. One gets the impression that most people in Hollywood, who make films about boxing, have never attended a match or even seen a street fight.

488,31 January 2005,ilovedolby,10, Debatably it is the best film of 2004.,"It's hard to believe it, but Clint Eastwood has done it again. After 2003s ""Mystic River,"" he has managed to direct another powerhouse film, but this time about a young female boxer named Maggie played effortlessly by Hillary Swank. She is trained by a hardened, old school trainer named Frankie who at first does not want to be bothered with her since she is a woman and he ""doesn't train girls."" But after some persuasion, Maggie manages to get Frankie to train her and their relationship takes on a father/daughter dynamic. She is poor and far away from home and he has lost his daughter's love by some act we never really know about. They learn to depend on each other for strength and guidance. The love they have is deep and cannot be shattered. With his training and wisdom, Frankie gets Maggie to be a major player in the female boxing arena until she gets injured. It now becomes Frankie's job to look after her and to find a piece of family in the least likely of persons. Amazing performances by Swank and Eastwood, and credit must be given to Morgan Freeman as Frankie's gym manager/assistant and for his narration throughout the picture. Debatably it is the best film of 2004.",
489,18 June 2007,OllieSuave-007,6, Kind of Depressing Knock-Out Movie.,"This is an Oscar-winning film about Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress from a dysfunctional family, deciding to become a boxer. She seeks training from the experienced Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to coach her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). What we see is a lower-class woman beating all odds to be a boxing champion, thus earning her a career that would put her in a better place in society. Swank gave a committed and solid performance, knocking out her opponents one after the other. What I like about Morgan Freeman is that he is steady, calm, yet powerful and dramatic is his acting. Clint Eastwood portrayed Dunn as pretty tired-looking and socially retired. He doesn't have much spirit and zest, due to his character being shut out of his daughter's life - very powerful. Eastwood also did a good job directing. Unfortunately, the movie does get pretty sad towards the latter half of the movie and the events only add on to the depressing life of Eastwood's character. My favorite scene in the movie is when Freeman knocks out an opponent of one of his trainees, proving that he still got the zest after all the years.",

Great story about redemption, acceptance and friendship. The supporting cast was amazing but it's Eastwood and Freeman that deliver the chemistry.

Just when it looked like Maggie was going to ""have it all"", the lights suddenly go out (literally) when the opponent takes an illegal swing. Poor Maggie goes from independent/ambitious to dependent/helpless. Although, the tongue-biting routine reinforces that Maggie actually has NOT lost her will to accomplish what SHE wants. The character of Frankie is already at odds with his(?)God, so now the dilemma of whether or not to grant Maggie's final request. It was real; it was difficult; it was controversial. In the end, Frankie acted in the best interest of Maggie. Isn't that what assisted suicide is all about? Given the same set of circumstances, I would do the same as Frankie. Dr. Kevorkian is a HERO.

Unlike the villainous tragedy of Deniro's Jake LaMatta, though, Eastwood and Swank both portray tragic heroes who are beautiful in their dignified, but inevitably doomed struggle.

The boxing scenes are well staged. However, some of the characters are cartoonish and the plot is implausible. Maggie's family is portrayed as poor white trash without a single redeeming quality. It is hard to believe that Maggie, who is an angel, could have come from such a family. The plot device of Eastwood unable to connect with his daughter while building a relationship with Swank is too obvious. It explores some serious themes but treats them superficially. All in all, it is well-acted by the three stars but it certainly is not worthy of Best Picture or Best Director Oscar.",

I was particularly impressed by Morgan Freeman's performance and voice-over narration reminiscent of his great work in Shawshank Redemption. It could have been just a remake of The Next Karate Kid, but in the third act, the movie takes an unexpected departure from the Hollywood movie formula, which made me admire this film even more.

From the very beginning of the movie you already have an idea about what the movie will end like. But the good thing is that it ends differently, so quite surprising. I really liked the subtle way in which Eastwood handles the theme (especially from the moment that Hillary Swank seems to be paralyzed). I am sure the movie will win loads of Oscars. Fair enough. But the real reason why I write this is to let you know that there is a movie which is about the same kind of themes (controversial friendship, euthanasia), but done better than this done. It is called Simon and it is the Dutch nominee for the Oscars. People think the movie won't be nominated at the end because the themes are too controversial for the Oscar-jury-members. But if this appears to be the reason why Simon won't win an Oscar, than Million Dollar Baby doesn't deserve nominated either.

525,10 October 2005,Elendil87,9, a fine new addition to an American tradition in film-making,"Since the days of silent film and pioneer filmmakers such as DW Griffith, and the days of the Western and its main contenders like John Ford, and through the time of the gangster films of Raoul Walsh and the like, and until today, there has been a tradition in American film, a tradition of film-making and storytelling that chronicles the great struggle for self-fulfillment and achievement. In ""Million Dollar Baby"", we have a grand return to this form by Clint Eastwood, one of the quintessentially American filmmakers still working today. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is by no means a virtuoso film, or innovative in its use of the camera or cutting. Here is a film that sticks to tried and true methods such as continuity cutting, smooth tracking shots, and atmospherically centered and balanced mise-en-scene. The film establishes a true sense of place in the boxing ring, the gym, and the hospital. The camera takes us through the world revealing to us the truth of things rather than telling us the truth of things. The characters play out their interactions thus without stylistic interference. Indeed, Eastwood has mastered the Hollywood style. He has stripped it of all its commercial coverings, and shown us what American film-making is really all about: honesty. A character study of enormous depth that plays out in a tried and true narrative, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a hard nut to crack. It is a film about finding peace with oneself, about the generosity and determination of the human spirit. It is a film about the battles each of us fights but that no one likes to talk about. A great movie, it is about hope and redemption in the end. I was profoundly moved.",

Oliver Stone comes to mind. Excellent athletic acting by Hilary Swank. And Eastwood's acting is by now as professional as it gets. Same for Morgan Freeman. I'm sure everyone is aware of the ending by now, but I will follow the rules and avoid writing a spoiler. I wish that I had not known what was coming. I can imagine how powerful all that must have been to people who thought that they were just watching a boxing movie. While I may not agree with the politics involved, it was done powerfully, and relatively tastefully. While I enjoyed the film, I don't believe that it is the 61st best movie of all time.

He creates the atmosphere with lights and shadows in the gym and in hospital scenes. It's an old game that Eastwood plays along the movie. But he has another trick... A great storyline.

Politically, I believe in assisted suicide but that doesn't make it interesting cinema. I never really bought that Maggie would quit on herself without a fight. Where was the determination she showed in training? This is not to say that suicide under those circumstances is weak or cowardly. Not at all. But I think you would have to go through all the steps of grieving to get there. And if you had the personality of a fighter, it would take that much longer. And I'm also annoyed that as far as we can tell, those fat lazy hillbillies were going to end up with her money anyway, which nullifies the only stand she took after that last fight.

543,18 May 2005,Keirdance,10," A Wonderful, and Important Film","As I sat through ""Million Dollar Baby"", I was very pleased about the quality of the film as a whole. Then, the film took a dark turn, and it became a multi-dimensional film, one that I will never forget. The acting, writing, directing, music, and even the lighting of the film was perfect for what it was. I happen to agree with the choices of the characters of the film. Does that make me biased?, I don't think so, because if you really think about it, nobody wins. It's about bonds that we make with people. An unspoken love that we have for the people that we connect with in life. Clint Eastwood is a master. He has proved that throughout his career. With ""Baby"", he not only shows us his mastery as a director, but a spot-on acting job as the grumpy gym owner. This IS his masterpiece. Morgan Freeman is wonderful, as always as Scraps. I can't imagine the film without his narration. The film, though, belongs to Hilary Swank. She is both mentally and physically perfect for Maggie. Swank makes you fall in love with Maggie, makes you cheer her on in the fight scenes. Swank brings that character to life. She is honest in every way in her acting. I was sooooo happy when ""Million Dollar Baby"" won the Oscar for Best Picture. Thank You Academy!!! This is a beautiful, haunting film. If you haven't seen it yet, go now!",

Why wasn't the corner going nuts trying to get the fight stopped? Why weren't the -judges- demanding that the ref stop the fight? I know the movie is focused on other matters, but a just little bit of police action after the ATTEMPTED MURDER in the ring would have been nice. Why did her hospital-visiting mother say that she ""lost"" the fight? Why did Franky say she ""didn't win"" the fight? Are they saying she was disqualified for not being able to continue? Is this some kind of a joke? Am I missing something here? There must be a way to make the villain a villain without straining suspension of disbelief so severely.

""In real life there is no way that would happen, fans would get up, throw things, the trainer would retaliate."" People, first of all, Eastwood isn't wasn't nor will he ever be a boxer. He could have chosen any sport or medium through which to tell his tale. Boxing and a woman just so happen to be great choices for a few reasons, #1 not everyday stuff (woman wanting to be a boxer) #2 great way to symbolize a desire and hidden feelings toward the unexpected for both the female boxer and the trainer. This movie was shot with such impeccable detail that you can bet 80% of most viewers have these things go unnoticed, and cannot identify them, yet almost all of these people are subject to the effect the cinematography has. THAT is truly brilliant. The subtleties like the noir-like voice overs and typical lighting (darker) and word choice in dialog esp between Swank and Eastwood as we see how Maggie truly loves her trainer as a father. And he the same. When Maggie falls down in the ring and gets injured, it is such a dark moment because Eastwood has realized the (in his mind) inevitable tragedy which he has led Maggie into. At that point in time, he already realizes retaliation would be of no use. I actually think that part is one of my favorites. Eastwood is so hit by the fall that he is already past anger and revenge. As if there was a part of him that knew this would happen and now he is feeling guilt and hopelessness. Its really an amazing scene. The filming of that scene also totally emphasizes his inner darkness and pain. This movie stays away from clichÃ©s and doesn't give the audience what it wants to see. It doesn't even deal with Maggies death in a ""noble"" way. Its very real. And that is shocking. This movie is 100% guaranteed to withstand the test of time. I don't know much about Clint Eastwood, but this is all I need to know. The man is brilliant. If you don't shed a tear in this movie, you have no heart. Swank deserves an Oscar, so does Eastwood for the directing. Freeman is the only ClichÃ© (the wise old has been black guy) but if you study his character closely you will see how he is actually not clichÃ©d at all. This movie is so powerful that you need a few hours to recuperate and that gut feeling you get during the movie sticks with you for days, and the appreciation will last forever. GREAT MOVIE. MASTERPIECE.",

If you like your films character driven this is the film for you.

554,22 December 2005,mlscordia,9, this movie has deeply knocked out me!,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is far more than a movie to me: it's just a real piece of life. If you don't feel anything after watching it, you're either dead or lifeless. It's quite difficult to hold your tears back throughout its running time. It's full of sympathetic characters and it is, morally speaking, infinitely more complex than the greater part of current movies. This movie is not primarily about boxing. It's not an essay, it's art, a movie about human beings as close as I expected. It looks like a classic one, full-blooded movies which the characters, the director and the screenplay (regularly written by real writers) were a lot more important than special effects or box office. An interesting movie in itself, because of there are a lot of heartbreaking feelings inside. I have seen this movie several times. The first time I left the movie theater so impressed that I couldn't get out of my head for a while. That's why I bought its stunningly Original Motion Picture Soundtrack three months later. I recovered it on DVD as soon as it released to realize how endearing the relationship between the leading threesome was. Besides, they are losers but they fight to change their spells of bad luck with dignity. For example, Clint Eastwood's character doesn't stop sending letters to his only daughter in spite of the fact they are always send back to him over and over again. They don't lose hope because they insist on getting a second chance for themselves. Sometimes I believe that Clint Eastwood is not who he really is. Maybe he is John Ford reborn. He has taken from the everlasting master the style, the feelings and their reasons for I think old-time movies will never be forgotten. The future looks bright for Clint Eastwood. Even though he's a 75 year-old-film star he's at the top level of his profession thanks to his two latest masterpieces which have been a roaring success all over the world and has no plans to retire, anyway!",

I think that it deserves most of the awards that it won. This movie is about Maggie,a southern girl who works as a waitress and will take the leftover food from her customer and lie that it is for her dog because she can hardly afford anything for herself. Then she starts to want to box. In the opening scene you see her watching a boxing match. At the end of the fight she tries to talk to one of the managers of one of the boxers to see if he wanted to manage her. He denies her and then the next day she decides to go over to his gym. After she has been at the gym everyday and working very hard, Scraps, Morgan Freeman's character, comes and corrects her on some of her mistakes. Frankie, Clint Eastwood's character, finally manages her. You'll have to watch the rest to find out what happens next. This is a sad, happy, moving, amazing, and very unpredictable moving movie that shows how much effort and work you have to do to become a great boxer.

While not in any way a ""female Rocky"" (who'd wanna see that anyway?, and not a feel good popcorn flick, it's beautifully written, cleverly but simply directed and acted with true passion. To be a good boxing movie is tough, no sport has had more movies made about it, yet Million Dollar Baby succeeds with aplomb. Hilary Swanks portrayal of Maggie is full of joy and love for life, despite hardship, and this contrasts nicely with Eastwoods Frankie, yet ultimately he seems to find some joy in his relationship with Maggie. While not likely to make you smile all the way through, if you don't find yourself smiling a few hours after you leave, you may not have really understood the film, which is ultimately about what all good movies are about, the indomitability of the human spirit, despite the ending.

The two principals in question are aging boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood who also directs, and the aspiring female boxer he will soon train, Maggie Fitzgerald, played wonderfully by Hilary Swank. The only other character of any great significance, played by Morgan Freeman, is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Scrap, a former boxer himself, now helps Frankie with the operation of his rather seedy boxing gym. But perhaps more importantly for the film, Scrap serves as the narrator who tells us things about Frankie and Maggie that otherwise would have taken too long to flesh out.

Every time I am tempted to despair of the American cinema industry, along comes Clint with one of his masterpieces. In this film, he starred, directed and produced. He even composed the music ! Clint Eastwood has a gift for avoiding the typical Hollywood clichÃ©s and superficialities without sounding pompous and yet manages to reach the true depth of any given situation. His films avoids any distraction which would not help the story along. This film is long - over 130 minutes - but it seemed short to me. The very tragic ending of this film could easily have been mishandled, but Clint keeps it simple, concentrating on the essentials. For the first time in years, I admit that I cried. Eastwood also made me doubt for the first time about my moral positions on euthanasia. I am still against it, but readily admit that reality has a way of creating situations which are more complex than what a philosopher would imagine. The main actors, Clint Eastwood along with Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, are all simply superb. Now we expect that from veterans like Eastwood and Freeman, but Hilary Swank was an agreeable surprise, at least for me. She is a stunning actress and I hope she will be given other opportunities to star in quality films. Won't Hollywood ever learn ? Don't 'they' ever watch films made by Clint Eastwood ?",

I was very surprised at the interest it held from the very beginning. The acting was excellent & the characters fully believable while the story showed the results of determination & dedication. It is easy to see why Hilary won the Oscar for her outstanding performance. Seeing the background from where our heroine evolved adds to the degree of admiration at her determination & will power to succeed in a sport that is very competitive & one that by all reason she has passed the expiry date as she is competing with much younger fighters. The message here is strong also the message of faith in others as she fully believes that only one trainer is going to get her where she knows she is capable of being. People taking chances on others is always open to good interpretation & is very well done in this movie. Although a long movie it is very sad when the story actually ends. I have recommended this movie to all who will listen.,

This one hits you so deep in the gut(pardon the boxing pun) that once is definitely plenty. You will most likely never forget it. There have been only a few movies so sad and so heartfelt that the emotional chord it strikes leaves you in such a state you don't want to go there again. Kind of like a funeral for someone you loved. I sincerely admire Hillary Swank as an actress. Her 2 most amazing roles that both won her Oscars, have her dying in the end. She does it better than anyone. She has a humanity to her roles that reminds me of Audrey Hepburn at her best. The only other actress I know today that has this same quality is Natalie Portman. Watch her amazing performance at the age of 13 in The Professional. It is like she and Hillary are cast from the same amazing mold. MDB is a great movie. It may have an ending some may not agree is right, but it fits. It almost seemed like 2 different movies. A Rocky type of story at first, then a story about the issue of life.

The relationship between he and Swank is so believable. She becomes more like his daughter and he manages to make a star out of her. Freeman gives a Oscar deserving performance in his narration and acting as the boxer who's way of the world helps him see things that Eastwood cant or wont see. The direction is brilliant, everything about this movie makes me wanna watch it over and over. Touching ending that would even make Eastwood's character feel a little emotional. Full marks to the team who worked on the movie!",

It is a the law that a person on a ventilator can ask the staff to give them sedatives and pull the vent. The courts have upheld this. There was no reason Clint had to sneak in himself and give her a stimulant.,

593,21 March 2006,maxlebow,8, Just A Few Words,"This is a great film to see once. Acting by cast is always in the moment. Feelings evoked are operatic in scale, and humanely humble. Narration is authoritative, precise, and penetrating. The stories, by F.X. Toole, on which the film is based, richly reveal the true grit of human nature. The boxing is as good as that in Cinderella Man. That is good.",
