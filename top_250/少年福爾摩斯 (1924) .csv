0,13 September 2006,imogensara_smith,9, Through the Movie Screen,"Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this ""through the looking glass"" work, which examines the dream-like nature of filmÂ—or is it the film-like nature of dreams? ",/
1,17 September 2020,Xstal,8, Anything but Elementary...,"You can only marvel at the craft of Buster Keaton. The choreography and precision in coordinating these stunts and sequences would be astounding and breathtaking whatever period of cinema they came from but more so here as the medium was still in its infancy. For an imagination to conjure up such things, with the practice and patience to perfect them, can genuinely be considered genius. A performance by an absolute legend of silent picture perfection.",r

3,5 March 2006,up2u,10, A World of Possibilities,"Not only is this Buster Keaton's best film, but it is among the greatest achievements in the history of cinema, period. While it is not a feature-length film--and thus barred from most critics' lists of great films--it invented just about every single basic special effect known to movies (except for morphing). The story itself, about a film projectionist who desires to become part of the movies, and then does, by walking right onto the screen, made palpable the desire that we all have to be in the movies: To get the girl, to be an action hero, to outsmart the bad guys. Keaton invented meta-cinema before anyone even had a phrase for it.",v

5,8 January 2002,Damfino1895,10, A hard act to follow,"As I sat reading the other reviewers comments I wondered what I could add. Oddly enough I watched Sherlock jr only this afternoon, after so many viewings it still amazes me how far ahead of his time Buster Keaton was, often copied, rarely equalled never surpassed. I would hate to be the kind of movie fan who never watches silent or black and white movies (you'd be surprised how many there are). So if you are like that do yourself a favour, get hold of a copy of this movie and enjoy, it shocks me that films such as 'Something about Mary' are rated higher than this masterpiece of comedy, there is nothing wrong with 'SaM' even I laughed at it, but, watching it once was enough, however I watch Sherlock jr again and again in pure amazement at Buster Keaton and his cameraman, Elgin Lessley's achievements without the aid of modern technology, like most other's the scene where he dives through a window to reappear as a little old lady gobsmacks me, how did he do it? Keaton can only be described in one word, genius. I have to add that I have the Kino version on DVD with the appalling soundtrack, but, luckily I also have it with a more appropriate soundtrack, which is far superior and adds extra enjoyment to an already fabulous movie.",e
6,11 October 2020,AlsExGal,10, Very inventive short feature,"Sherlock Jr., is only 45 minutes long. It actually failed when it was released, but today it is considered ground-breaking. Keaton performs some stunts such as appearing to jump through a woman backed up against a fence that remained a secret for years. He also, at the beginning of the film, jumps into a motion picture that is running in the theatre where he works as a projectionist. Once on the movie screen, Keaton has to adjust his strategy as the scene changes from the front steps of a house, to the edge of a cliff, to a lion's den.",w

10,13 May 2015,JimDenney,8," short, silent, and really funny","My second silent film for the class that I viewed for my class was just as entertaining as the first, which was Charlie Chaplin's The Circus. Buster Keaton playing the role of the movie projectionist Sherlock Jr. was very entertaining. The story is simple, yet interesting and fun, and the movie comes in at much less than one hour, 44 minutes to be exact. While there are a few points in the movie that are disjointed and not as fun, overall you can stay engrossed enough until you get to some really cool and innovative special effects, which given the technological limitations when this was filmed in the 1920's are simply amazing.",2

12,3 September 2019,gbill-74877,10, Masterpiece,"Buster Keaton shows such genius in this film. It's a breathtaking moment when he walks into the screen for the movie within a movie, and one of my favorite in all of silent cinema. From there we are treated to lots of impressive stunts, many of which were quite dangerous, as well as nearly nonstop visual playfulness and misdirection. Loved the slick pool play too. An absolute gem.",7
13,29 December 1998,Taz750,10, Absolute Magic,The best silent I have seen yet.. Buster Keaton's a film genius for making a movie like this.. the scenes where the film surroundings change while Buster is in the film is hilarious and even seems hard to make as a realistic special effect today. His stunts are great and its amazing that he did them himself. They're all perfectly timed and done and look as hard as they must be. This movie is one of the best.. Not a single sound the whole movie and I enjoyed it greatly.. Keaton is without a doubt the best comedian.. better than Chaplin or anyone else.,1

15,5 June 2000,zetes,10, Almost certainly the funniest comedy I've ever seen.,"Yes, counting all the comedies I've ever seen, silent or talkie, this is probably the funniest. I was lucky (boy, was I lucky!) to see this in a theater with a live piano player. Ever scene is brimming with comic genius, cinematic inventiveness, and just plain perfection. I laughed almost nonstop from beginning to ending. Jokes that seem liked they lasted 10 minutes were funny for their entirety. After the performance was done, I think the audience clapped for 10 minutes, and they (the pianist and Buster Keaton) deserved at least that much, if not an hour more. 10/10",5

17,28 April 2020,sean-ramsden,8, Brilliantly Worked Out Gags,"Sherlock Jr. is one of Buster Keaton's best films, and possibly his greatest.

18,26 September 2008,Quinoa1984,10, one of the seminal Buster Keaton comedies,"Buster Keaton has cajones the size of watermelons. This isn't just to say in the stunts that he executes- sometimes, apparently, to great physical and personal risk- are at big comic peril, but that he's fearless with what he wants to try as a filmmaker and scenarist. Jokes that I thought would never really be fresh are taken in 1924 in ways I didn't think could be funny, but are. Take a small bit where Keaton's character (one of them, anyway) plans to sabotage a nefarious guy with a slip on the banana peel. For a moment this is groan-inducing, but watching how it's executed it becomes something really, really gut-busting. There are little bits like that, and then those huge scenes of choreographed mayhem: a blast by water after hanging off of a moving train, a chase through a town that includes a sudden chance of a road connected, jumps through small holes and windows at the nick of time that are half pure Keaton and half exciting editing.",?

Today we have few films that combine special effects with a riveting story. Some would say Star Wars did so, and I'd agree to a certain extent, but no movie that I've ever seen work a story integrated with special effects like this one. If you aren't as amazed by this tour de force as I am, check your pulse. You're dead.",e
21,2 February 2023,I_Ailurophile,10," Timeless & essential, a classic, must-see treasure","Whether it's a matter simply of preservation or also of restoration, the first aspect of the film to catch one's attention is how astoundingly crisp and clean the image is; I don't think I've seen ANY other silent picture that was so extraordinarily pristine. There's a small part of me that would easily believe this was actually made in at least the 40s or 50s, not the 1920s. That's before we consider, of course, the unmistakable visage of Buster Keaton in his cinematic prime, and all the joy that follows therefrom. The storytelling is simpler, and perhaps a little more kitschy, and so is the film-making, yet full of heart and good comedy that truly never gets old. We can always rely on Keaton for robust situational humor and delightful sight gags and performances, if not also outstanding stunts, and that's certainly what we get in 'Sherlock Jr.'",f
22,3 October 2018,weezeralfalfa,7, Keaton blurrs the distinction between movies and dreaming,"At only 45min., this silent comedy isn't that much longer than some 3 reel comedy shorts, yet, it apparently qualifies as a feature-length film. I don't see this film as being greatly superior to the many Keaton comedy shorts I've seen. .......It starts out very slow, with Keaton and his girl sitting together for an eternity, not knowing what to say to the other. Finally, Keaton gives her a cheap engagement ring. Keaton is a mere movie projectionist, who dreams of becoming a detective in the class of Sherlock Holmes........I thought the $1.00 bill caper was cute, if unrealistic. Keaton wants to buy a $3. box of candy for his girl, but he only has $2. Luckily, he finds a $1 bill in his sweepings, also being the theater janitor. Unluckily, a women comes, complaining she lost a $1 bill in the theater, and he gives it to her. Then, another woman shows up claiming she also lost a $1 bill in the theater. Keston gives her his $1 bill. Then a mean-looking man shows up wanting to look through his sweepings. Keaton hands him his last $1. bill, but he refuses. Looking through the trash, he spies a wallet with some greenbacks in it, and goes off with it. Keaton then spreads the trash out, looking for another wallet. But, of course, he doesn't find such. Thus, he goes to the store, and buys the $1. box of candy. However, he converts the $1. price tag into a $4, to impress his girl. But, this deception will return to haunt him........While Keaton is talking to his girl, his competitor(villain) , in the form of Ward Crane, arrives, in a splendid outfit, and bringing a bigger box of candy, as well as a more impressive engagement ring. Keaton is relegated to the hall. Soon, the girl's father reports that his gold watch is missing. The Villain slips the receipt for the watch he hocked at the pawn shop into Keaton's jacket pocket. Then, Keaton says he will act as a detective, and search every one. The Villain requests him to also search himself, and he finds the pawn receipt, which says $4 for the watch., which matches the $4 price tag on the candy box. Keaton is requested by the girl's father to leave and never return. ........Still imagining himself to be a detective, Keaton shadows The Villain, as the most likely suspect, in his mind. Eventually, he winds up in a boxcar, locked in by The Villain. Luckily, there is a hatch in thr roof. Just then, the train pulls out of the station. Keaton runs along the top of the cars to keep him near the water tower. When he runs out of cars, he jumps onto the tower dispenser, which lowers and begins to release water, which practically drowns Keaton(Keaton suffered a serious neck injury in this event.) . He then runs back to his projectionist job, where he soon dozes off.......Meanwhile, his girl goes to the pawn shop with the receipt and asks the pawnbroker what the man who traded the watch looked like. He was tall and had a black moustache, which fit the description of The Villain, but not Keaton. She was satisfied that Keaton was telling the truth that he knew nothing about the watch pawning........Some reviewers say they are confused which events take place in his upcoming dream, and which really happened. According to my notes, the dream begins about the 20min. mark and lasts until the 41min. mark, just a few minutes before the ending. Among other things, Keaton dreams he walks into the movie sceen and interacts a bit with the actors. Then, he is thrust into various odd or dangerous situations, in which his pose at the end of one situation carries over to the beginning of the next situation. ......He dreams that the Villain steals a pearl necklace from his girl's mother. He takes this to a shack where his confederate thieves hideout. Keaton shows up at the hideout. Initially, captured, he breaks loose, and grabs the pearls The Villain is dangling before him, and runs.........The next gag has Keaton cornered in an alley by several of the gang. He jumps into the belly of a tie salesman, standing behind him and disappears. The gang finally find him hiding behind a rotating section of the wood fence behind. He runs, and the gang chases him. A cop on a motorcycle appears and invites him to ride on his handlebars. Soon, the cop is bumped off, without Keaton knowing it, and the cycle negotiates around various obstacles without Keaton's help, until it comes to the shack where Keaton's girl is being held, where it rockets him into the shack, he hitting the guard. Soon, the gang arrives in a car. They trick the gang, and take their car, which ends up in a lake: just the top part, which sails a ways before sinking. Keaton wakes up, and his girl arrives to tell him she believes him innocent of stealing the watch.. The movie on the screen is about to end, with the man hugging and kissing the woman. Keaton imitates what they do on the screen , with his girl. The end.",_

While not stinting on extraordinary sequences of slapstick - the bicycle scene is justly admired and unsurpassed - it is the growing richness of Buster's persona, and the breathtaking analysis of the medium itself that today astonishes.  An anti-detective work ahead of its time, it both celebrates film as a repository of our dreams and desires, and critiques it for engendering passivity.  Crucially, it is very, very funny.",=
24,11 January 2022,springfieldrental,9, One of Keaton's 'Trickiest' Films,"In his earlier 1924 film, April's ""Sherlock Jr."" Buster Keaton came up with the idea of having his film projectionist character, through a dream, jump from a theater's audience into the screen, becoming an actor in the projected movie. Being in the movie gave the former vaudeville actor the opportunity to insert a variety of tricks he performed on the stage years earlier. His writers scripted a plot where his girlfriend's father has his watch stolen, and Buster's love rival frames him. As an aspiring detective, the film projectionist dreams of being the hero of the movie he jumps into. Perfecting each stunt required an inordinate amount of preparation time, so much so it took four months to film, double the normal Keaton production.",t
25,28 January 2010,TOMNEL,10," These jokes stand up 85 plus years later...despite it's age, this is a timeless comedy.","Director and star of this film Buster Keaton really knew how to get a laugh. This guy's physical jokes were really great, and instead of going for stupid over the top acting, he actually gives a fairly straight performance, relying on the wackiness and humor of the situation to provide his laughs. And despite being a black and white silent film, this thing still stands up today, and it's still genuinely funny!",t
26,2 August 2017,alexanderdavies-99382,10, One of many Jewels in Buster Keaton's crown!,"""Sherlock Jr."" is one of many masterpieces made by Buster Keaton and he established himself as a force to be reckoned with in the Art of Silent Comedy. Dare I say this but the best of Keaton narrowly surpassed the best of Chaplin. The story of ""Sherlock Jr."" concerns Buster who works as a projectionist at a small town cinema. He has dreams of becoming a detective and avidly reads up on the subject. Whilst projecting a film, Buster falls asleep and ""Sherlock Jr."" enters fantasy via a dream scene.There is some excellent camera trickery but I don't recall the exact details of how it was done. In this fantasy sequence, Buster proceeds to the big screen in the cinema and appears to enter the screen itself. It is a dazzling and original piece of filmmaking and I doubt if Keaton's rivals could have created this. Eventually and after he's awake, Buster has a chance to prove he can be a fully fledged detective. His attempts at tailing a suspect are absolutely uproarious. There is a chase scene involving Buster sat on the handlebars of a policeman's motorbike. The film isn't a long one, 45 minutes but it is an undisputed classic.",_

28,9 December 2006,Igenlode Wordsmith,8, Back to Buster,"Having consumed every on-screen frame of Buster Keaton I could get myself exposed to, from the good and the bad to the occasional cameo and the outright peculiar (yes, that would be you, Samuel Beckett...), I find myself in the position of starting to re-watch the films that I know -- and in the absence of a DVD player, that means seizing upon screenings as and when they show up! Having been subjected to various dodgy projections and mediocre musical accompaniments, I was beginning to harbour a secret, guilty fear that maybe Keaton's comedy, so skilled at taking an unsuspecting audience by surprise, might be lacking in replay value; having had a couple of disappointing experiences with films I'd originally reckoned to be among his second rank, I was getting a little paranoid at the prospect of re-viewing the ones I'd enjoyed the most in the first place.",r
29,28 August 2021,bretttaylor-04022,7, Very short but very good silent comedy,At just 45 minutes long this is more a long sketch than a feature film.

After being accused of stealing a watch he falls asleep at work and dreams of being in the movies. Full of hilarious stunts and catching out the villains without realising this is a very good short movie.,v
30,16 November 2012,romanorum1,10, Impressive Imagination: Movie-within-a-Movie Surrealism,"A timid young man employed as a ""moving picture operator"" (projectionist) in a small town theater studies to be a detective. He is not too attentive in his job duties. At a confectionery shop he buys his girl a one-dollar box of chocolates. At the house of his girlfriend, he gives her a tiny ring (along with a magnifying glass) and the small box of chocolates. Then his rival â€“ a cad with a mustache â€“ intrudes and cunningly steals a watch from the girl's father's jacket. He goes to the local pawnshop and uses the funds to buy Buster's girl a four-dollar chocolate box. Back at the girl's house, he sneakily slips the pawnshop receipt into Buster's jacket pocket. When the father discovers his missing watch and later the pawnshop receipt in Buster's pocket, he kicks Buster out of his house. Buster, though, shadows his dastardly man real closely until he is discovered and tricked by his adversary. Now we have one of the all-time classic movie scenes. Buster â€“ without a stunt double â€“ runs along the tops of moving train boxcars. He leaps and grabs the release cord of a large water tank spout, gets soaked, rides the water stream down to the ground, and runs away. Years later he learned that he had sustained a fracture of one of his neck bones. No wonder he had headaches! ",

Well what shall I say about it. I watched the best Charlie Chaplin movies without tone and colour and I really liked the Goldrush for example. But in comparison to this Sherlock Holmes Junior is just nothing. I quickly turned away and did something else meanwhile the movie run in the background. It's just not for me. I'm sure that some people will like the movie because they love this old pieces of art but especially younger people just like me will have some issues.

It seems Keaton was involved in almost every aspect of this film from directing and starring to filling in as a stunt double and he certainly knew what he was doing. He steals every scene and managed to make a film that feels truly timeless. We're approaching the 100 year anniversary and I'm sure people will still be talking about it in another 100.",
34,15 December 2018,patriciogl10,9, Magical.,"While this isn't even my favourite Buster Keaton film, it is still groundbreaking material. In a time period where there were endless possibilities because films were relatively new, Buster was exuding creativity, most notably from a technical standpoint. There are many stunts on this film that account for his ingeniousness and inventiveness, for example Buster leaping through the body of his assistant, Gillette in order to escape the gangsters; the 'movie within a movie' part which was absolutely brilliant; the motorcycle stunt which was
phenomenal; to name a few, I mean Buster was an incredibly talented performer, you could even say he was a magician, for the work he did on this film feels ethereal, dream-like and magical, even though it is essentially
a detective story. Or better yet, a story of an enthusiastic man who dreams of becoming a detective. He is kind of sloppy and above all things, he's been blessed by luck.",

45,20 September 2012,ChristophCinema,8," Short, Silent, and Satisfying","""Sherlock Jr."" is a movie that isn't very strong in story, but makes up for it in comedy. The story is a simple mystery (nothing groundbreaking), but the mystery isn't the reason to see this movie. The reason to see this movie is for Buster Keaton. His stunts are so incredible (even by today's standards) and perfectly paced that you're not only laughing, you're also on the edge of your seat. The highlight of this movie is definitely when Keaton falls asleep at a movie theater, and he dreams that he's in the movie that's playing. This is one of the most imaginative scenes in movie history, and many fantasy movies afterward probably took a lot of inspiration from it. To me, this is Buster Keaton's best film (even better than ""The General). It perfectly showcases everything that made Buster Keaton great; from his stunts to his perfect timing, there is not a dull moment in this film. This is a film that shows exactly why Buster Keaton is one of the greatest movie stars for not only his time, but for all time. ""Sherlock Jr."" is often overshadowed by other movies of its time, but it's one of the best films the silent era has to offer.",

Watch it in slo-mo on your VCR.  It will astound you.",
47,3 April 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," Elementary, my dear Gillette.","It's a strange choice to have most of the story be housed within a wish-fulfilling dream-sequence but, thankfully, Keaton pulls it off with style. See, while the most entertaining aspects of 'Sherlock Jr. (1927)' are, indeed, found within this, frankly, loosely-connected segment, it's the bookending 'real-world' sections that hold all the real narrative weight, as limited as it may be. Without these parts, the picture probably wouldn't be as good because it wouldn't get you connected to its almost instantly likeable protagonist and you wouldn't really have a nicely set-up - though, admittedly, poorly paid-off - conflict to be concerned with. Of course, there is an argument to be made that the affair could have been set entirely within the dream, thereby being a more wholistic film with the conceit that Keaton really is the world's greatest detective. Nevertheless, what we have is a fantastically fun, effortlessly endearing silent action-comedy that moves at a break-neck pace (literally) and is stuffed with more blink-and-you'll-miss-them stunts and special (practical) effects than you can shake a stick at. Seriously, some of the stuff here is almost certifiably insane and Keaton shows it all off so casually, to the point where it just seems... well, easy, I guess. It most certainly isn't. The amount of practice, acrobatic skill, technical knowledge, teamwork, ingenuity and just sheer daring needed to pull even the simplest of this stuff off is nothing short of staggering. You're often on the edge of your seat just watching the shot, hoping Keaton will be okay. In this way, the excitement isn't overly 'manufactured' - though, it obviously is to a degree. The gags aren't just impressive and nerve-racking, though, they're also often funny - whether it's because of their joke-like structure or just because of their straight-up originality. You'll often laugh at the simplest of things, which is a testament to the brilliant physical acting on display. The flick, which plays out like one of Keaton's more traditional shorts (for the better), also moves quickly enough that its story doesn't wear thin, even if it threatens to, and you'll never be even close to bored. It's just a joy, really. 8/10.",

This being a silent film, I did not expect to enjoy it, but I actually did. the music adds so much to it, especially emotion-wise. It allows the audience to feel what the characters are feeling and gives us a sense of what is going on in their head, and perhaps examples of what they might be saying. It allows for the imagination to take the reigns while watching and go along with the story in your own head.

In terms of the story itself, Sherlock Jr has many interesting concepts. It seemed to me that Keaton's character's life was intentionally made somewhat dull and boring so that the action sequences when he slipped into a dream/the movie he was screening (Another brilliant scene, perfectly set to the sound track of the film) would seem even more thrilling. The 'love story' seemed to be more of an overarching plot that sandwiched the real story and provided an interesting beginning and a happy ending.

It also means that on the occasion of said centennial anniversary the film will again be shown at movie theaters, which is not a bad thing at all, even if I cannot agree with the fact that this is rated so highly by many that it still sits comfortably inside the imdb top250, in fact is even inside the top200. Not by much though. It is maybe the shortest film there as it runs for 44:33 if I am not mistaken and this only reaches full feature territory by a minimal margin of three seconds if we look at imdb rules and standards. Without these, it could not have been included. But yeah, let's look at the basics here. Needless to say that it is in black-and-white and that the star and driving force behind the project is lead actor Buster Keaton. I like him at least as much as the more famous Chaplin and the less famous Lloyd perhaps who were the defining stars of this film era. Arbuckle too, but he got ousted, still a very underrated talent.

74,28 May 2011,tavm,9, Sherlock Jr. is one of Buster Keaton's most creative of his movies,"Today was my off day from work so I decided to take advantage of that by going to the Baton Rouge Gallery Center for Contemporary Art to watch their first of their Movies & Music on the Lawn monthly series of what is being referred to as ""Slapstickers"" which would devote the last weekend of each month-until October-to a silent comedy classic of various comedians of which this particular one was the first. Since I wasn't a member of the BRGCfCA, I had to pay $5 for the admission but the experience of sitting on a bench during a cool breeze at night while enjoying a $4 slushie drink and seeing many other groups having their own picnic on the ground while viewing was well worth it. And the live accompaniment of a local band called The (New) Zeelanders-with their electric guitar dominating much of the score-brought a fresh perspective to the happening. Before I review the movie proper, I have to admit to being a little self-conscious when I laughed loudly at many of the scenes since the audience didn't seem to laugh as much or at such a volume as I did but then maybe I would have been accused of doing it too much or too loud by some. Anyway, this was indeed mostly hilarious from beginning to end especially when Buster Keaton found himself in a movie as scenes keep changing. Other highlights include whenever he was on that motorcycle on the handlebars and he kept acting normally not knowing the driver had fallen down during the chase before narrowly avoiding many vehicles and disconnected bridges and especially that whole trying-to-but-keep-on-failing-to-kill-Buster-as-the-title-character by the butler and Keaton's rival. One more thing, if I hadn't known about the ending by reading an earlier book that showed photos of that particular sequence, I probably would have been just as surprised as he was when that happened!

No one was expecting magic tricks, special effects, and inventive storytelling that would influence filmmakers 90 years later.

Title represents a sense of being an amateur measuring himself with private eye Sherlock Holmes. A daydreaming film projectionist is fired when a necklace is stolen. Falling asleep he dreams of his lady love, bad guys, and astonishing visuals as when Keaton enters the screen to solve the plot. Hilarious moments include lost money in trash, a motorcycle sequence where Buster Keaton loses his driver, and a window escape that has him in drag. Exquisite timing as Keaton is at the mercy of good luck particularly during a fatal game of pool. Kathryn McGuire plays the standard female whose purpose is to be a potential love interest. Ward Crane as the Sheik is hilarious as he attempts to steal away Keaton's love interest, job, and dignity yet it backfires. Erwin Connelly as the evil butler is another great foil as he follows orders and falls victim to the laws of slapstick. Screenplay is creative within all the physical hijinks but the payoff is Keaton's signature stamp of humour.

Like Bill Murray or Bob Newhart, Keaton's humor is based on perfectly timed lack of expression, which can convey more than anything said or done by a more animated comedian. Unlike those other stone faces, Keaton is also an action hero, constantly jumping off cliffs, hopping moving trains, riding the handle bars of a speeding bicycle, throwing himself through windows, all without the aid of a stunt double. The seamlessness of the camera trickery is mind-blowing, and the post-modern breaking-the-fourth wall philosophy has been the subject of an entire book published by Cambridge.

(It's 44 minutes long.  A frame more and it would not have been as good.)  Buster's comic timing is impeccable.  Also, his stunts are dazzling.  In fact, Jackie Chan once said Buster Keaton was his personal hero.",

I enjoyed how the plot grew more throughout the movies and there were all these obstacles (literally) that Sherlock Jr had to overcome. I like how the suspense was being built up when Keaton showed the audience the different ways the bad guys were going to try to murder Sherlock Jr, but nothing seem to work because as we find out later in the movie, he already knew what they were up to. I also liked how we were in the loop for the most part and saw the point of views of the different characters throughout the movie. All around is a quality silent film.",

He works clumsily as a cinema projectionist, but instead yearns to be a detective, not unlike the great Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's riveting tales.

Buster Keaton's most radical (and, in many ways, most astonishing) comedy transforms a simple, Harold Lloyd-inspired wish fulfillment scenario into an almost surreal exploration of film reality as seen from the inside looking out. The film-within-the-film gave Keaton a chance to play with some experimental camera tricks and visual illusions, often ignoring the storyline altogether, and leading many hack intellectuals to later cite the film as an avant-garde think piece. But what all the egghead analysis fails to mention is how funny it can be, and the range of humor is often startling, even by Keaton's inventive standards. Included, among other choice moments, is a wild ride on the handlebars of a runaway motorcycle; a unique game of billiards, with Buster never quite striking the booby-trapped 8-ball; and a throwaway gag the comedian actually broke his neck performing, the fracture going unnoticed for several decades.",

The story is terrific, the stunts are marvelous, and Buster is himself in this classic. A great ending which raps up a perfect comedy, Buster also has a great scene with hidden meaning. Like Chaplin, leave it to Buster to have a side note in his films. While Buster is sleeping and dreams that he's on stage, he finds himself jumping from scene to scene. Buster makes a point that while on stage, the actor remains himself, while in film, the stage is not always what it is. Making a point between the difference between the theater and film, Buster tells the audience that the two arts differ. Am I right...........?",
110,8 March 2018,pdortic,10, Buster Keaton does it again!,"What a movie! Now silent movies may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this is a must see. The character are able to convey emotions throughout the whole film through exaggerated facial expressions and actions. 
Young ""Sherlock Jr."" is a role that catches the eye of the viewer in many ways. As the main character you follow his character as he is tries to impress his lady, gets framed, and has to work his way back to the clear in the eye of the justice. 
Even though this movie was created in 1924 the movie effects are great. This can be specifically seen when Sherlock Jr. goes into the movie being projected and actually jumps into the scene. The scenes then rapidly change one after another, but as Buster Keaton is a great actor he doesn't miss a beat. These movie making skills can be seen again when the projectionist is asleep and even though his physical body is still hunched over on his stool, he multiples and a double version of him can be seen on the screen.
This is a spectacularly made movie and I definitely suggest this to anyone who is looking for a romance movie, a comedy, or just a well made movie.",

113,14 March 2017,framptonhollis,8, a love letter to cinema and creativity,"The brilliant Buster Keaton has always remained my favorite of the ""silent clowns"", mainly because of how much he mastered the art of intense comedy. In ""Sherlock Jr."", there are many moments of intense comedy; for example, the entire segment in which he is at a pool table, seemingly unaware that one of the balls is an explosive. As he continues, the scene gets more and more funny, as well as intense, as he keeps missing that one specific pool ball in ways that are practically impossible. His unawareness of peril provides both laughs and gasps in equal measure, which makes it all the more funnier. If the audience was laughing along with the film while Keaton was in an extremely safe situation with no steaks, then they would not only be less engaged, but less humored. When comedy appears in an intense situation, it is all the more comic, which is what Keaton was able to showcase throughout his entire career, and in this film especially.",

A great director and comic actor. Don't forget that on silent movies the words were replaced by physical gestures and attitudes in terms of expression. And then there were no special effects or computer work which means that all accrobatic and physical violent prowesses and deeds were done by the actors themselves or by double stunts.
This movie tells the story of a poor film projectionist at a movie theater who dreams to become a private detective and studies lessons for that on a book. Meanwhile his rival to his girlfriend frames him into the theft of her father's watch which gets him into serious trouble. In the meantime he fells asleeep during a movie projection and dreams that he is Sherlock Jr, a famous detective, mixing up the story of the projected movie and its characters with the real story in which he and his rival are envolved.

Buster Keaton makes a brilliant move in ""Sherlock, Jr."" He starts the film with a situation of everyday confusion. This on its own is filled with subtle, constant, and finely crafted comedy within the context of events the audience will care about.

This movie is just more than fantastic it is just flawless with its humour, its direction but also its use of technical cheats to make it look as if Keaton is for example jumping into the cinema screen or the camera work of a rather famous motorcycle scene and it's great to see in a movie made in the 1920's.

While it was cheesy at certain times, it was still very much a classic love story. Too often nowadays I find that that cheesy comedies have no story or plot and rely entirely on comedy. Which is often times bad. Sherlock Jr. however integrated comedy into the narration of its story near flawlessly. I was also struck by the innovation of Buster Keaton. Due to the lack of special effects, the movie had to come up with more interesting ways of surprising the audience to both keep them engaged and make them laugh. They couldn't just add anything they wanted in an editing room. Having said all this however, I think it's a good thing that the movie only has a 45 minute run time, because I think that cheesy/slapstick comedy is only funny for so long. On the other hand, if the movie was longer, maybe Keaton would've just come up with some other crazy things to wow us.",

Most of Keaton's silent output is great but even by his impeccable standards, Sherlock Jr. goes beyond the call of duty. It's more surreal and avant-garde than his other work with Keaton plays a wannabe detective who gets to go into the cinema screen and live out his fantasy as a great detective. Like an audience member watching a movie, Keaton's character gets to escape the real world and be what you can't be in real life.

135,28 May 2020,krational66,7, Classical Film,"Old films, especially these silent films. Rely on the actors' physical movements to show the plot. So it is far beyond the superficial performance level of today's beautiful women and beautiful men.
Especially in that era, many aerobatics also made us amazing today. The plot of riding a motorcycle on a motorcycle is more alarming than the current theme of speeding. I don't know how it was shot. Especially the idea is really unique. Even the actions of Jackie Chan, a juggler, can't be compared with this old movie. It is simply playing in the sea and the sky.
The efforts of small people may be a kind of heroism. American films basically have this theme. They do n't have the same celestial theme as the celestial dynasty film. It is only the life of the individual and the pursuit of the value of life. Perhaps this is the essence of American culture. Only by guaranteeing each individual can we guarantee the creativity and vitality of a country, a society, and a nation.
So watching American movies sometimes feels more direct. It won't let you thank Dade for a big brother. Individuals are individuals, without the pressure and sorrow of being attached to a certain social authority.
Therefore, whether it is success, failure, dream come true, or illusion. American films are all manifesting the publicity and striving spirit of this physical life.

Making it so that it comes off his hand and onto the boss's foot. Loved it.

The movie projectionist's desire to be a detective brings us through visual scenes with music to understand his passion. The movie kept my interest because from the scene changes you never really knew what was going to happen next. From the beginning of the film until the end, the music used throughout the film helped the audience connect with the scenes and feel what was actually going on. I didn't quite understand the image scene changing from cliff to jungle to sea etc. I thought from those that it was to portray how he felt at that moment about becoming a detective. There are some funny parts of the movie that takes you away from the direction of what the main character is trying to become. There are also some parts of the film that I didn't think went with the plot, which made me lose a little interest from time to time. The parts of the film when the detective went to the house and was playing film was very interesting. I showed us that he was a good detective because he was aware of what the other men were trying to do to him. Then later in the movie, towards the end, he used the #13 cut ball to get rid of the police.

They were able to focus on certain aspects in different scenes and they found a way to make special effects look so realistic. Buster Keaton was also a star in this movie. His character is corny and lovable, while also being very intelligent and shows how he refuses to give up. Sherlock Jr. has many humorous stages while following a story line that would be watchable for years to come. This film is easily one of Buster Keaton's most amazing films, and greatest achievement.",
161,5 February 2015,lhug74,7," Sherlock, Jr.","I enjoyed this movie just as much as I enjoyed the circus. Who knew silent films could be so entertaining. Sherlock Jr. started out a little slow for me but it didn't talk long for me to be interested in it again. I thought it was funny and entertaining. I liked how he was trying to save up his money to buy the girl he liked some chocolate but couldn't afford the one he wanted because he only worked at a movie theater and dreamed of becoming a detective so he changed the price on the box from one dollar to four dollars. I felt bad when he was framed by the other man who was interested in the girl he liked too. The other man stole the girl's father's watch from their house then went and pawned it and bought her a gift with the money. He makes it look like Buster Keaton's character is the one whole stole it so he is banned from the house even though he didn't actually steal the watch. When he returned to his job at the movie theater, the movie showing was one about a theft who stole a pearl necklace. He fell asleep at the theater and dreamed that he was in the movie as a detective and ended up beating the real thefts and saving the girl. When he woke up, the girl was there to apologize because her and her father found out that he wasn't the one who actually stole the watch. I liked the ending how he was doing everything to the girl that the actor was doing to the girl he liked in the movie that was playing but he was confused as to what to do when the movie flashed to the future and the two had a family of their own. I think some of the camera work in this movie was advanced for it's time. For example, when Buster Keaton falls asleep and a ghost of him comes out and walks away. I thought that part was pretty cool considering when the movie was made. I really liked this movie and thought it had an exciting and interesting plot.",
162,30 January 2019,htimme,9, Dreamy and a little sad,"Personally I really enjoyed the movie. It was funny of course, but I was surprised by how well they created the dream effect. The sequence where he falls asleep and travels into the screen and then subsequently is transported into random environments felt very much like a dream. The music surprised me as well, although it was probably added later, it made the movie feel much more dreamy. I thought the scenes when he's hiding and running from the criminals were very clever. Overall a very enjoyable movie even thought it was a little sad at parts, the ending was good",
163,2 February 2016,c-fronk,7, A comedic take on detective stories,"Sherlock Jr. is yet another impressive silent film. The stunts and effects were remarkable and never failed to entertain. Some of the cuts seemed a bit odd to me, but they did not take away from the rest of the performance. The action is fast paced, with many comedic points. The music exemplified the mood of every scene, and really complemented what was happening on screen. Buster Keaton delivered an engaging, lighthearted performance. We are able to feel for his character in several scenes, but he also makes it easy for us to laugh. The story itself may seem simple at face value, but the technical aspects of the film were breathtaking, given the time period. Definitely a great film to refer to those new to the realm of silent films.",
164,21 March 2023,samarlocrossley,9," A seamlessly crafted, yet easy to watch slapstick","I give this movie a 9-star rating, not because of its importance in cinema, and not entirely due to the story, but because - put simply - it made me laugh. Sherlock Jr.'s bits, body language and general comedy allow it to rival, even outperform modern slapsticks and physical comedies before even beginning to look at the story. My experience with older comedies is limited mainly to Chaplin, as I am sure is the case with many rookie film enthusiasts; this did not worsen my experience whatsoever. I was surprised to see how different the styles were, and how both this comedy and Chaplin's have very much their own identity. I loved many of the scenes in this short film, and my laugh-to-time ratio was higher than city lights (not to take away from that incredible artwork). I don't want to spoil anything, but I will point out that this film is a meta-commentary on cinema as a medium, and shows this in a beautifully effortless manner. The editing was outstanding for the time (I assume), and the exciting scenes gave me more of an adrenaline boost than nearly any action could. It's not that I don't care for modern cinema - that is frankly untrue, but commentaries frequently seem to be more effective in older, often silent films. This - I believe - is due in part to the very nature of silent films. These words may have been uttered by many before me, but a good silent film would be only held back by dialogue. Upon watching this film, I believe I see why Chaplin chose to keep creating silents long after their peak. This all being said, I am sure many will struggle to enjoy this film, but as my introduction to Buster Keaton, I think this film has served him well.",
165,3 February 2016,j-goslin,9, A Major Accomplishment for the Silent Film Industry,"With this being my second time watching a silent film I cannot help but to admit I was amazed yet again. Although some may find this film hard to follow because of the lack of dialog, I found it to be relatively easy with the help of the occasional cue card when necessary. I also found it interesting how the filmmakers used the effect that drew focus to a particular section of the cue card image. This is something that we take for granted in modern cinema but makes such a difference when dealing with silent films. The cinematography was fantastic as it followed all of the action and makes the viewer feel as if they are actually there following along with the story. The use of wardrobe and props was also very well done in this film and helped to enhance the plot and give indication of the time period in which the film took place. I thought this short film was very well done and is definitely worth a watch!",
166,25 March 2022,emircihanalper,9, How did they shoot this movie?,First of all; it is simply a wonderful cinematography. I can see and understand how stunts are done today (with cautions) but how in 1924? I think they had simply risked their life for a movie. It is stunning to watch very well choreographed stunt. I am saying choreography but it is simply give your life into cinema.,
167,14 March 2014,ctladybird,7, A lighthearted homage to the great detective,"While the most spectacular thing about this short film is the part where Sherlock Jr goes into the movie screen in the day dream sequence, I found this short film quite charming. The music definitely sets the tone as lighthearted and comedic and the acting is good. I find the film trope-y but given that it is from 1924 you could say it sets the stage for future short films of the same ilk. The Daydreaming hero, the sweetheart, the villain, and the protective father type. All of these come together in a wonderful conclusion, the girl saves the day. I really appreciate the history of films and where cinema is going today. Very cute film.",
168,21 December 2006,jackstrebor,9, Impressive physical stunts and gags,"""Sherlock, Jr."", a 44-minute black and white silent comedy film starring the genius antics and directorial vision of Buster Keaton is a film definitely worth watching. Knowing that this film was made in 1924, well before digital manipulation, makes the physical stunts and gags very impressive to watch throughout. For all Charlie Chaplin fans out there, Keaton is just as good as him in this slapstick performance if not better.",
169,12 September 2012,foxhunter25,7, Very Entertaining Movie,"Sherlock Jr. is a great silent film, released in 1924. Buster Keaton both stars in the film, the projectionist/detective, and directs it. The movie never has a dull moment, there is always something going on. In the movie Keaton does a great deal of stunts. Some of the more extravagant ones are done in the movie-in-a-movie. This movie-in-a-movie mirrors what is going on in the characters' real life. Each character is more elegant and their role more exaggerated. The music played a key role in setting the correct atmosphere for each scene. The screen editing was done very well for the time period. I thought this movie deserved a 7 out of 10 because it was very good and entertaining but it wasn't the best silent film.",
170,8 October 2012,alwaysdubbin91,8," well done, Buster.","this film is about a young man who aspires to be a detective, and solve real crimes. but he is stuck cleaning and working the projector at a theater until he falls in love with a girl and her fathers pocket watch goes missing. he gets hot on the trail of the thief and figures everything out. but in the mean time there are lots of very funny little misadventures along the way, including Sherlock Jr. being somewhat transported into a movie on the projector screen with some special effects that i have to say are extremely impressive for their time. the movie has a fairly interesting plot, but the way it was executed is really what makes it a great film.",
171,25 January 2013,Taffyta,10, Great story!!,"I was very impressed by the cinematography! I did not expect all of those special effects from such an old film. A couple of the little tricks in the beginning were funny, but then there were the more difficult ones. I couldn't understand how they did it! Then there was the perfect timing between all of the segments of the motorcycle scene. It was very well done and very amusing!",
172,30 March 2014,Dollardave86,9, Buster Keaton's finest,"In addition to Chaplin as being one of the greats in the silent film era, you must not forget to mention Buster Keaton as well. Keaton's comedic performance in this one was superb, especially the gag with the dollar bill. Keaton played a movie projectionist who,falls asleep and starts dreaming. The film also displayed a funny detective bits, where Keaton tried to follow clues he learned from his book, to solve a missing jewelry situation. The editing that was done in the dream sequence remind you of the flashback technique, where you are shown what happen previously or something you want to happen. The great thing about the film was, anyone could watch it and find it funny. The music helped describe the emotions that were being felt in each scene.",
173,3 October 2008,chrystiscott,9, The Best of the Three?,"I am a die-hard Keatonian. I love Lloyd and Chaplin, don't get me wrong, but Buster Keatons films remain the most enjoyable to me. He, his movies, and his humor is more translatable for today than the other two. Will how-did-they-do-that's ever go out of style? And trust me, there are some of those moments in this movie. Keaton, conditioned by the vaudeville acts of his childhood, is actually on those handlebars alone, no film tricks, he goes through that window and appears on the other side in a dress, HE JUMPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF HIS ASSISTANT. What do you expect though, Harry Houdini was a family friend and a fellow act on the Keatons traveling show. You will watch, pause, rewind, and watch again a few times during this movie, trust me. An excellent start in some ways to the ""Silent Slapstick"" genre, but in other ways, a bad start - you may begin to make unfair comparisons to other movies of the same persuasion. Kino has released all of his work, so if you want more Buster, it's there for the taking. Also, if you can get your hands on it, a special that ran for 13 episodes called ""Hollywood: A Celebration Of The American Silent Film"" in 1980 on the BBC has many clips, both video and audio (gasp!) of Keaton, plus a biography. For where to go from Keaton, try Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times and Gold Rush, Harold Lloyd's Safety Last! and The Freshman, and Keaton's former partner 'Fatty' Arbuckle in any of his shorts that you can find (and while you're at it, thank him for giving Buster his shot at making movies). Also try W.C. Fields, and Max Linder's shorts, if you can ever find any (and for a tragic story, read his biography.)",
174,9 September 2014,gcappadona,7, Sherlock Jr. Review,"Buster Keaton's 1924 silent film, Sherlock Jr, has a way of instantly drawing you into the film from the beginning! It starts off showing Junior rummaging through the garbage outside the theater looking for money. The scene keeps flashing from the local store, to the theater. Junior wants to buy his girlfriend a box of chocolate to impress her and her family. The comedic part of this scene is that when he finds a dollar bill in the trash, to his luck, this old woman comes crying back to him saying she lost her dollar bill. He asks her to describe the dollar bill (also a very humorous part). In the end of the scene since he is such a kind man, he attempts to give his own personal money away to those who claim to be missing theirs.",
175,6 September 2014,shavonnacroley,10, Very interesting...,"So I just watched this film, it was great. It was very interesting to see the main character act out some of the more dangerous scenes though I believe one was of multiple photographs; this being the scene when the main character was on the motorcycle. In a way I'm shocked to see that it was an action film. And I say that mostly because it seemed as if the characters were daredevils. Sherlock Jr. hit the ground so many times, climbed and also jumped from so many high points like when he was on the roof and he grabbed onto the white and red gate. It all was so dangerous and he could've been easily hurt. The film was also funny, I loved how it went from one scene to him imagining this huge scenario in his head. It's something we all do everyday and I guess it was nice to see someone's played out even though it was a fictional character. My favorite scene has to be the closing scene. I thought it was so funny to see Sherlock acted out scenes from the movie playing in the theatre. He mimic it perfectly with the exception of the awkward kiss ha. In all, I loved it! I highly recommend this film to everyone... I wish there was a part two because this one was great.",
176,23 September 2015,kanosphere,9, Sherlock Jr. is a great film,"I felt as though Sherlock Jr. Was perfectly paced and not only enthralling, but that it was written both well, and with a lot of thought put into it. It's a bit simple, but only for the present day. Otherwise, Sherlock Jr. was spectacular.The story was excellent and original. Even in present day I haven't seen a similar plot that captures the essence quite like Sherlock Jr. had. It also provided a neat little spin on a popular name and genre, without totally leaning against it, or taking too much from it, but also providing it's own originality. All in all, Sherlock Jr. is an excellent film that not only made more than the most out of the barriers presented to it at the time; but also excelled because of them.",
177,21 March 2018,reekacampbell,10, Quirky and funny,"This movie was very delightful to watch even though it was a silent movie. The plot was well put together even though at some points one felt as if Sherlock would have no chance at the girl or proving that he were innocent. This made me pity him, but also respect this character as he was quite a determined man. In the end, Sherlock does win the girl however, who realizes that he was innocent and went back to him at the theatre. This leaves the audience with the idea in the back of their minds, that things can actually work out no matter how dim or gloomy the chances may seem.",
178,15 October 2014,jferraro3,6, Sherlock Jr.,"What I really enjoyed most about this film was the use of the soundtrack. The music was very interesting and easy to listen to. The soundtrack is what made some of the scenes for me. It helped make the scenes feel okay with the lack of dialog or noise for that matter. It was impressive how they used the soundtrack for every little change up in a scene or to show you the emotions each character was trying to express better. The actors movements and interactions with one another in this movie were hilarious. I found them to be so entertaining the was they have to dramatize every last detail to get their point across. This was an overall very shot film but got its point across. i think the actors were excellent in expressing everything they had to without sound, making this movie still watchable and entertaining to someone like me.",
179,27 January 2015,MC_Barton,7, Deadpan physicality,"Sherlock Jr. is a treasure that sticks out in the historical film archive for its complex plot and dangerous stunts that were enacted by Keaton himself. However, that is all the film has to offer. The element that enhances the movie is also the element that makes it predictable. Keaton's stunts are death-defying and are truly amazing, even by standards today. The problem is that there are just too many of them, it depreciates the value of each successive stunt. The final complaint I have is that, unlike Chaplin's movies, these stunts really don't give the movie any charm. Nonetheless, the movie is a great watch and still is pretty humorous, all while staying a much appreciated step away from modern comedy.",
180,27 January 2015,hagen2357,7, Sherlock Jr.,"Buster Keaton stars as a goofy movie projectionist who's biggest wish in life is to be a detective. The opening credits to the movie contain a proverb stating: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both."" Throughout the movie, Keaton further proves the proverb to be true which provides significance to the movie. While working at the movie theater, he neglects some of his responsibilities because of his obsession of wanting to be a detective which lands him in trouble. On the other side of the spectrum, when he is trying to focus on being a detective, he knows he still has responsibilities at the movie theater which tie him down. The only place where he seems to find success is in his dreams. Along with a good plot, a great deal of significance in this film occurs with the special effects while Keaton dreams. Of course in today's cinema, the effect of having two identical characters on the screen at the same time along with changing backgrounds would be quite simple to accomplish. However you must look at the time this movie was made, utilizing these effects were not often seen in silent films and makes this movie impressive and significant.",
181,17 December 2015,m-carter-68742,8, Classic Keaton,"At the time this film was produced, it wasn't as popular as it should have been. Fist off, the story was very funny, but it also had its serious parts. Also, this was one of the first times the idea of a film within a film was even thought of, let alone executed. It was done well also, especially for being made in the 20's when editing was not not nearly as useful and effective as it is today. Keaton is a magician. He plays his part so well, his facial expressions almost speak for themselves, its like he is giving dialog without talking. Truly spectacular. Normally films shot during this time are rough, meaning the actual picture isn't as smooth as it could be. I did not find that to be an issue with this film. Music of course is important and fits in perfectly with what was happening on screen. This film should have been as popular back then like it is now, because it is truly amazing. Keaton did a great job, and having this film be labeled a classic is almost an understatement.",
182,10 April 2016,CriticalViewing,7," Silence, but words help bring it into the modern era!","This film by Buster Keaton does a very great job of communicating to the audience a okay-by- play of what is going on through it's use of captions. What is done, is whenever there is a line of dialogue or a course of action taken that may be a bit unclear, the screen stops the motion, cuts to a black screen, with those necessary words displayed in a white large print. This makes for an easy viewing, therefore making it much more enjoyable to viewers of today. I am sure it aided viewers back in the 1920s when it was released, but the viewers of today that are used to having both diegetic and non-diegetic sound in films can breathe a sigh of relief when attempting to appreciate this silent. It brings the best of the two worlds together. Expressive and emotive acting that is common with silent films and, the direct ""here's what's happening"" format that is common today by providing a pause in the film to read and comprehend the motives and expressions portrayed throughout. Very well done!",
183,11 September 2012,kendraocon,8, Great movie! Keeps viewers interested!,"I thought Buster Keaton did a wonderful job of directing and acting in this movie. This movie's humor kept you on your toes and the music tied in with the movie very well. There were a few technical things that were very advanced and new such as moving the camera, multiple scenes and a movie in another movie. The visual and technical aspects of this movie were a very big accomplishment during this time. Keaton thought creatively and thought outside the box when it came to coming up with the concept of the movie. He thought of other ways to keep the viewers attention with the lack of voices, the way the music was also helped the story line have more emotion to it.",
184,10 September 2012,dfiscaletti8,8, Review for Sherlock Jr,"Sherlock Jr. was my first silent film that I have watched beginning to end, and I have to admit it was not as bad as I expected it to be. Even without dialogue the characters kept it interesting by over expressing things and incorporating quite a deal of comedy. The music also worked well with the movie by helping describe each situation. With every silent film I believe there is expected to be some boring parts, but luckily only found myself drifting off once, but even that part tried to stay intriguing by incorporation a lot of stunt work. Buster Keaton is known for his stunt work, which he executes very well in the film;everything seemed to line up perfectly. I believe anyone who is interested in seeing a silent film should definitely view Sherlock Jr.because it keeps the audience entertained and creates and interesting story line that you will want to follow until the end.",
