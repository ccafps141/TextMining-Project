0,1 October 2006,bkoganbing,10, Economic Dislocation,John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.,/
1,13 February 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, John Ford's stark portrayal of a poor family in the depression remains one of the most moving films in history.,"The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who are run off of their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. I think that one of the most striking elements of this movie is the black and white cinematography. Obviously, there wasn't a lot of variation on this particular subject in 1940, but especially today, the lack of color enhances the feelings of poverty and desperation and emptiness due to the family's loss of their home. In this way, because it would not be nearly as noticeable in 1940 as it is today, this time-enhanced effect of the black and white film stock has allowed for the film's impact to actually grow with time.

2,10 February 2006,evanston_dad,9," Not the Book, But Beautiful in Its Own Right","It's difficult on a first viewing of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the ""gee whizz"" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.",e
3,16 April 2018,inkblot11,10, Everyone should see Grapes of Wrath and be thankful for what they have!,"In rural Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is walking and hitchhiking home from prison, after a stay of four years. After taking a knife at a dance, Tom hit the attacker with a pan, killing him. Nevermind that it was self-defense, Tom still gets sent to prison. He hasn't heard from his parents, Ma (Jane Darwell) or Pa because they aren't the ""writing types"". A fierce dust storm makes Tom's final few steps treacherous. Arriving back at their small cabin, where his family are sharecroppers, Tom and his passing friend, Casy (John Carradine) are startled to find no one at home. A shell-shocked neighbor informs the other two that the family has been kicked off their land in foreclosure. They are nearby at Uncle John's house, where his family is about to suffer the same fate. Its the Depression and the Dust Bowl has ruined the land, taking off the top soil; no one can grow crops. When Tom catches up with his Ma and company, they are overjoyed to see him, for their plans are to pack a truck and move to California, where handbills show pickers are needed. Grandpa doesn't want to leave the only home he has ever known, so they drug him with medicine and haul him along. Now on the Mother Road, route 66, the journey is difficult; the truck breaks down frequently, no one wants them to stay long anywhere they rest, and Grandpa dies of a stroke. Will California really be the Golden, Promised Land? NOT ON YOUR LIFE! This heartbreaking adaptation of Steinbeck's classic is a must-see for the whole wide world. This family of hard-working folks has one calamity after another, just trying to earn an honest and living wage. Those who lived in the Dust Bowl part of the country were hit especially hard, as the soil had been overworked and winds took the topsoil off, creating damaging storms to crops, humans, and animals. No better were the ""lies"" of the handbills, advertisements that migrants were needed in California, where over 300,000 poor helpless folks showed up for very few jobs. The cast, with Fonda at the helm, is wonderful as is the scenery, costumes, and careful direction to show the truth of a desperate situation. Wanna get down on your knees and thank the Lord for what you have, Americans? You will when you view this amazing film!",v
4,4 May 2007,jluis1984,10, A masterpiece...,"During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath"", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.",i

7,29 March 2016,Richie-67-485852,10, Down but not Out,"Anytime you are tempted to feel down and out, watch this movie. I personally have seen it many times and are currently reading the book which I highly recommend. I cannot emphasize this enough. This is as down as you can get and still survive. We are taught to be grateful when watching this and to also consider the other guy, whoever he is and at the least, do not add to his burden. Actors are on their game as is the Director. Of course, none of this exists if it wasn't for John Steinbeck and his book. I thought about this movie during the recent Real Estate downturn and what the banks did in real life was indeed captured in this movie way back when. Indifferent, callous, and greedy while practicing their rights leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth and we bailed them out if that isn't the gall of galls. Have something to eat while watching to appreciate that you have food and the people in the movie do not, a tasty drink and a snack which is unheard of back during the depression days will help you connect more to the movie theme. There is humility, gratitude and lessons to be learned while being entertained. Its called a TEN thank you",/

Okay: Go out and watch this movie immediately because to not do so is, well, it's un-American. John Ford, with this nifty little film, made the greatest argument for populist/socialist politics in cinematic history. This movie understands the Depression and the Dust Bowl and the poor and the hungry and the starving and all those people that the sign at Ellis Island (or is it at the Statue of Liberty?) says that we'll take on and help. It understands those people better than anyone or anything else I know. Steinbeck's novel helps this movie get to where it needs to be, but, let's be honest, the Grapes of Wrath is all John Ford. ",r

13,17 October 2012,ironhorse_iv,9, Tom Joad will be there and so will this movie for you,"I'm will be there—to review John Steinbeck and his great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath, about the westward migration of people during the dust bowl in the Depression of the 1930's. It was a huge hit in 1940, and soon it was turn into a movie directed by John Ford. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joads, the incredible Jane Darwell as his mother. The film stands today as one of the finest examples of sensitive American cinema. It is an incredible combination of gut-wrenching scenes threaded through feel-good scenes that make you laugh and then sob. The movie is about The Joads family. They were destitute by faceless, corporative banks that seized their lands just when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) got out of prison. Forced out of their farm, the Joads are heading from the dust towns of Oklahoma to California for hope of a job. As aggressively coaxing is needed to acquire Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin) from leaving his abode, while the family meek existence is depended on the nurturing of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who's strong upbringing sturdily holds them together. When the family arrives upon destination, they harbor terrible living conditions and given low wages in the migrant-worker camps. Hot tempered Tom Joad eventually collides with the wrong side of the law, as he is cornered to leave his family behind. A documented-style production in which seasoned pioneer John Ford received an Academy Award for his appraised directing. The Joads suffers much, and struggle in times of adversity. The visuals of the film, was outstanding. The desolation of the land and the desperation of the people were depicted very well. It does have an uplifting message despite its gloom. A black and white cinematography that would inspire Ansel Adams. Tom Joad's speech is very powerful, and makes you appreciate every meal you have. The idea of the interpretation of the film is that despite being in hard times, the Joads gave to others. Letting others stay with them, helping out others, giving away their food. The faults of the film are these it's really heavy, slow tempo, long, and the Okie accent and dialect is hard to understand. Some harsh language in the book that wouldn't have been allowed in mainstream movies of that time is left out from the movie. The production codes did not allow for the shocking scene of a woman breast feeding a starving man that ends the book. In the book more detail is given about Tom Joad's older brother Noah. In the movie he's hardly featured at all, and in fact completely disappears from the latter part of the film with no explanation given as to where he went. The big difference between the movie and the novel is that the movie goes uphill while the novel goes entirely downhill. This makes all the difference. The uphill fashion of the film version fails to provide closure. For example, it lacks the powerful ending of the book, which I will not spoil. Anyways, this film and book should be read and view in EVERY school to show how lucky we are today and don't appreciated it with our many luxuries our money buys today. It doesn't belong 2 a particular era or country. It's the story of the struggles of humanity.",6

The film follows a poor Midwestern family during the depression who are being forced off their land. After being released from jail, Tom returns home to find it abandoned.

The question posed by Steinbeck, amplified elegantly here by Ford, is what happens to the little people, the working class, indeed the underclass who get squeezed the most when the checks and balances in society break down. It's also about how fickle human nature becomes when the haves indeed have power over the have-nots and how cheaply some people can sell their humanity to maintain that superiority.",1
16,26 February 2016,willwoodmill,9, The definitive Great Depression film,"Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions, typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting, fake ""Hollywood"" dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clichés. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.",5
17,16 September 2000,rmax304823,10, People That Live,"The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good (or great) as you can get, especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes, one absent from the film, the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 (or even suggested), the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat, what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle, and ""we're the people that live."" That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years, but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.",/

19,7 October 2018,mmallon4,10," California, Super Cool To The Homeless","The Grapes of Wrath was impressively released less than a year following the release of the novel and yet within this short timeframe director John Ford crafted one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A number of John Ford's movies have that foreign film feel - a feeling of very raw, lifelike emotion. The Grapes of Warth itself is one of the most emotionally draining films of all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings of pity; everything is rough, dirty nor is there makeup on any of the actors. Just take the scene in which the depression-ridden Joad family on their way to California attempt to buy bread from a dinner (a scene which really puts the value of money in perspective) - The emotion is one part humility and the other part pathetic.",r

Now, I finally did and it even goes beyond my highest expectations... I was prepared to see some class-A drama but everything what this family goes through is even worse than I thought. This famous movie milestone goes about the Joad family. They have to leave everything they own in Oklahoma behind. Them and several other poor families are attracted by California because there is supposed to be work and a place to live. The long trip is filled with misery and when they finally get in California, it seems that they've been deceived once more. There's almost no food and 8 hungry mouths to fill. ",e

22,15 May 2007,planktonrules,8," While a tad too sentimental and not always accurate historically, it's a very impressive and heart-rending film","This is an extremely sentimental and worthwhile film that fans of Hollywood's Golden Age should see at least once. While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film (I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE), it is superb and well-crafted. Some of the acting (in particular Jane Darwell as ""Ma"") was terrific and very realistic, while occasionally it was a bit over the top (John Carradine as ""the Preacher""). And the story itself was excellent and well-constructed--making an emotional and heart-felt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point (making it a one-dimensional fight between good and evil), the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.",_

Released in 1940 and till now this movie is as fresh as it can be. John Ford directorial version of John Steinbeck's finest work really worth a watch.As from the release of the book ""Grapes of Wrath"" has been seiged with controversies as the book was banned in many states but the book is great proponent of hardship. This movie mesmerizes you from the start as the characters are indulged with true humanitarian instincts, you won't feel any thing irrelevant.Henry Fonda is very much compelling in the role of young Todd and Jane Darwell won best supporting actress in magnificent portrayal of Mama Todd. All the other cast was fine and convincing in their roles .John Ford won another best director award from this and its no doubt the best deserving from his other achievements .In the end it's a treat and you wont be able to forget its impact for a long time.",=
24,6 April 2006,Hitchcoc,9, It Could Make You a Socialist,"Steinbeck's classic comes to life. It's the dust bowl era and the depression. People are driven of their property by the banks. Of course, those banks got those people help getting that property and the depression was a complex collapse. Still, it's sad to see a portrayal of human misery. The Joads pack up everything and head west. Of course, there's the Woody Guthrie song ""If You Ain't Got the Dough Re Me."" There really isn't an easy answer. California represents the great unknown where the streets are paved with gold and there's work and land for everyone. Naturally, the whole country was wallowing in poverty, and California was pretty well overextended. There's a point where all of us would say, 'It's either me or them."" Henry Fonda who looks like Jane (or is it the other way around) is young Tom. He can't stand any more of the stuff his family must deal with. He is going to become enterprising. Unfortunately, he finds himself on the wrong side of the law. It's a group of socialists (some would call them dirty Commies) who come to the rescue with their collectivism setting things right. We see things through a filtered glass. John Ford had his own belief system. I felt good and clean when the Joads had some things look up for them, but I realize, also, that it's not so simple. Sometimes there are circumstances that don't qualify as evil--they just are. I hope that we can take a balanced view of the world and help those who need help.",t

29,4 May 2021,nickenchuggets,10, The definitive great depression film,"This movie won John Ford an oscar for best director, and rightfully so. The grief and agony that the characters in this film undergo is quite unlike anything you will ever see again, and the most difficult part to accept is that it's all true. Set in the time period when America was still mired in the depression, the government has been forcing people off of their land in the american heartland and bulldozing their houses with caterpillar tractors. The evicted family the film focuses on is then forced to move to california, which promises to provide them with happiness and prosperity as best it could. When they arrive though, they are met with something arguably even worse than what they just ran from, and the family is forced into a migrant camp, where they encounter other people that are starving, tired, and barely alive. Through superb acting and writing, the perils faced by Henry Fonda drive his actions as he tries to lead himself and his relatives out of this nightmare. By the time this movie came out, it was 1940, the depression was over, and the economy was booming again, but we must never forget those extremely difficult times when people were forced to live in uninviting locales like those depicted here, and work themselves to death just to buy food. In an era where the depression was still fresh in everybody's mind, and people were actively trying to forget about the pain it caused, The Grapes of Wrath revisits it in all its grim detail, not to agitate those who lived through it, but to pay homage to their efforts and how they survived.",v
30,21 August 2012,Artimidor,9," Just a taste of Steinbeck - flawed, but great enough","John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" undoubtedly ranks among the greatest works of American realist literature. It stands as a testament of the Great Depression era where tenant farmers of the dust bowls suffer under drought, then are brutally dispossessed and driven from their Oklahoma homes, forced to find their luck elsewhere. In the end all they have is themselves, as the trip to find the blessed land California demands a heavy toll, is accompanied by tragedies and setbacks and the outlook is bleak in the face of the greed that exploits honest workers to make a buck. John Ford tries the impossible - to go for an authentic rendition of the multilayered, detail packed, all around magnificently written Steinbeck material, and definitely succeeds in delivering an indispensable heart-wrenching film portraying the never ending struggle of the Joads. Any direct comparison between book and film however is moot, enjoy both for what they are. On board in this road movie of the existential kind are Henry Fonda as an ex-convict, John Carradine as a disillusioned preacher and the Oscar winning Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, all first-rate acting with strong support of an array of bit players who help the crude reality take shape. Highly recommendable! There are downsides, though. For one the two hours of screen time can barely correspond to the epic proportions of the novel. However, the entry is still much more complete than Kazan's adaption of Steinbeck's other epic drama ""East of Eden"", starring Jimmy Dean, which only shows a fraction of the story. The one real liability however is the diluted ending which was tucked on as a concession to the mass audience while Steinbeck's epic hits you with full force. Well, if you want the real thing, read the book. With the film you get a pretty good taste of it.",
31,28 April 2002,Agent10,9, One of Henry Fonda's Best,"Even though good books rarely ever turn into good movies, the Grapes of Wrath sheds such a belief with beauty and charm. Granted, the acting may have been hokie in some parts, but the message is clear: the world is full of haves and have-nots. This is easily one of the few `old' movies I could watch on a regular basis. Even after all of the suffering the Joad family goes through, the clinging hand of hope still firmly hangs on. Certainly one of the best films ever made.",

After being evicted from the land they'd farmed for generations, they join many other Okie families migrating to California seeking opportunities to work.

39,21 July 2004,cldavisj,10, My Family's History in film,"Ma Joad was my mother. That is to say her and thousands like her out of the Dust Bowl of the '30s and '40's . I never got to ask ma about those days, she died before I knew that this movie and her life were the same. But my oldest sisters were born in transient camps just like the movie..people were alternately mean and kind just like the movie. When I watch the camp scenes they are as my sister's described them.

And then there's the acting. Henry Fonda was, no doubt, one of the greatest actors of all times, and this might just be his best film (other great roles of his include The Lady Eve, made the following year, and Hitchcock's underrated The Wrong Man). John Carradine has his shining hour here - too often he was cast in B-movies. Even in Stagecoach, his role was kind of, well, cheesy (I'm not a big fan of that particular Ford film). That scene where Tom Joad meets him in the tent is excellent; Carradine is brilliant (and so is Greg Tolland; man, look at the lighting job!). I do, however, wish he had kept his mustache. It's hard to picture him without it! But even with those two masterful actors, a viewer's attention will always shift to Jane Darwell, who plays the Joad matriarch. She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, perhaps the most justly won Oscar in the Academy's history. There is a scene near the beginning of the film in which, as the Joad family is just about to flee their home, Mrs. Joad finds some old earrings. She puts them up to her earlobes and looks in the mirror. How long has it been since she was young or beautiful enough to wear earrings? The past is past, and it will never come back.",

Steinbeck's book (still, sadly, unread by me, though other works like the Pearl are amazing on their own) is called the definitive account of the poverty-stricken mid-American experience in the depression, and it probably is. It allows for a very literary sensibility to form about such an American family like the Joads, who are the kind of folk that you'd think, if there wasn't immediate cynicism to be had with the like, politicians would be addressing first and foremost in speeches as the 'working man' and 'American family'.

The assignment was a success because Ford approached the novel more from the viewpoint of its human drama than its ideology. There simply isn't a more beautiful black and white film in the American canon. Gregg Toland's cinematography is exquisite; it's no wonder he went on to shoot ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Except for the fact that it uses well-known stars instead of non-professional actors, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" has in embryonic form all the stylistic hallmarks of Italian neorealism. Henry Fonda gives the performance of his life as Tom Joad, and Jane Darwell won a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Ma Joad, the eternally stoic earth mother who keeps the family together in the face of insurmountable odds. My favorite character, though, is the renegade preacher, Jim Casy, played by John Carradine at the height of his acting career before his eventual slide into grade-Z horror and exploitation movies.

67,11 February 2017,Marwan-Bob,9, There comes a time when a man gets mad,"When John Steinbeck wrote THE GRAPES OF WRATH it became a highly controversial book, which eventually became a highly controversial movie. For my money it's a near perfect film. The direction by two time Oscar winner John Ford is spot on. He tells his story and it moves along at a very brisk pace. One thing I always find that bothers me most about older films is that the pace tends to lag, a result of the film not aging well or it never had a good pace. This film, upon release, was highly successful and earned several academy award nominations including nominations for best picture and best actor for Henry Fonda. Fonda plays Tom Joad, a man on parole who returns home and discovers that his family has been driven off their land and now must leave Oklahoma and head to the promise of work out in California. The film has a dark view of life in the depression, but to view it any other way in regards to this family's story would be doing Steinbeck's material a great disservice. The family has to struggle to stay together. Grandma and Grandpa are quite old when the journey begins; Rosasharn is pregnant and, to leave with them, Tom must violate his parole. The characters in this film are very relatable because of the idea of family. We can all relate to the various things the characters do to help the family and sometimes to get away from it. One of the films biggest assets is Jane Darwell's touching performance as Ma Joad, a wise woman who is the glue that holds together the family unit.

As nightmarish as any science fiction movie about a distopian future, and yet when it was made it was an historical movie of the recent past, set in the brutal reality of 1930s America during the Great Depression.
Henry Fonda returns from prison to find his family nolonger has a home and the share cropper world he knew has become the wasteland of the dustbowl, where fat cats in big cars pass the buck while the ordinairy folk scratch at the dry dirt in frustration and starve.
A flat, featurless landscape, scoured by dust storms, that leave a haze through which headlights and torches cast ominous shadows, exagerating the gaunt twisted faces and inbred misshapen ears of it's haunted inhabitants.
In images reminicent of the Terminator movies, bulldozers ridden by faceless figures in gas masks roam the land, demolishing everything in their path - but the faceless figure behind the wheel turns out to be another fellow farmer trying to feed his family.
Hank and co travel ""Beverly Hillbilly"" style across the country, along the way there are acts of kindness between individuals, but as a group they are resented as outsiders by locals, who fear suffering the same fate.
There are shanty towns and farms run like prison camps, angry mobs, police state border controls, man hunting, incidents of inhumanity and humanity are all woven together expertly by John Ford in this master piece.
Fonda is at his melancholy, lean, long legged best, John Carradine is also a standout as the preacher who has lost his faith and Jane Darwell won an oscar for her portrayal of ""Ma"".

Basically Tom Joad (Oscar nominated Henry Fonda) has returned home after serving four years in prison for killing a man, and he is joined on his journey by faithless former preacher Casy (John Carradine), and together they find the farm deserted. Tom finds his family who tell him that they were evicted, and the extended family of eight have to pack their things and set on the road to California, and there they hope to find work. The Grandpa (Charley Grapewin) dies from a stroke along the way on Route 66, and they have no choice but to bury his body on a roadside, and after being warned about the lack of jobs at their destination, Grandma (Zeffie Tilbury) dies also before they reach the border. They soon find a travelling camp populated by children, and a man and the sheriff do come offering the family members work, but with no indication of what the salary is, this man with the sheriff is trouble apparently. The sheriff killed the man, and Tom knocked out the sheriff before getting away, and the rest of the family keep travelling until the find a farm that needs workers, but it is suspicious for being surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. They earn very little money when they accept a job picking pears, and Tom walking around comes across Casy again who is planning a strike with fellow labourers, but then thugs kill Casy and gash Tom. The family move on again and find a US government camp which has much better living conditions, such as toilets and showers, but they are wary of thugs coming and need the sheriff to take control. Tom must go away because the sheriff is looking for him, and he leaves his mother, Ma Joad (Oscar winning Jane Darwell), thinking that she won't see him again, but she is hopeful about the future heading for work in the north. Also starring Dorris Bowdon as Rose-of-Sharon 'Rosasharn' Rivers, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, O.Z. Whitehead as Al and John Qualen as Muley. Fonda is alright as the one who almost leads the family, and Darwell is indeed intriguing as the mother of the family who is tries to keep spirits up. I will be honest, I didn't really pay enough attention to or understand the plot, and I didn't really understand the leading character's heroism, I'd probably only see it the once, but there are some good moments, costumes and landscapes to just about keep you watching, a reasonably worthwhile classic period drama.

By 1930, it was bankrupt; I kept wondering why we were moving from the big house to a succession of smaller houses on the same property, then entirely off of it. Mine was such a happy childhood, I can only surmise the loss of wealth did not register with me. I don't even remember being aware of it; by the time my family became being near penniless, I was the only child left at home - I was the youngest.

It's grim story about people struggling to survive. That these conditions existed in the United States is a disgrace. To be thrown off the land is bad enough, but then to be humiliated compounds the injustice. The story is told in the form of semi-documentary which gives it further authenticity. The movie is about land. People own it, farm it, exploit it, divide it, fight for it, defend it, plow it, drive over it, drive through it. The people are transiting; the land stays. Tom Joad enters and Tom Joad exits; he is a metaphor for the transitory nature of existence. The only thing stable is the land. Ma Joad is trying to keep the family together but it's a losing battle. Only the will to survive gets them through. This movie is an incredibly powerful story, strongly acted, and told with candor.",

101,4 January 2007,jeuneidiot,8, You Can't Keep an Okey Down,"This powerful film starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford chronicles the Joads, a family from Oklahoma, driven from their home by greedy bankers and corporations after their livelihood was ruined by the dust storms of the mid 30s. These storms displaced around 500,000 people, many of whom went to California looking for work. This caused a serious overage of pickers and workers in that state and many of the displaced ended up and starving and suffering in squalor in miserable camps. Steinbeck chronicled this misery (his own version of Les Miserables) in Grapes of Wrath, which was adapted the following year for the screen. Henry Fonda took the role of Tom Joad, which turned his career into gold. All of the adults in the cast performed marvelously, from the crazy grandpa dreaming of squishing around in grapes, to Casey the former preacher who just wasn't sure anymore to Ma, (who won an Oscar along with John Ford for the film). The overwhelming message pounds home the misery of these people, the poor treatment they receive at the hands of the government, police and big business and how unions and worker rights are the solution to these ills.

108,19 January 2019,lisamcdonnell0816,8, An Emotional Experience,"The Grapes of Wrath, starring Henry Fonda, is a raw depiction of the Joad family's displacement from their home and journey to find work and start a new life in California. It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that moved me the way The Grapes of Wrath did. The director, John Ford, along with cinematographer Gregg Toland used the timing of natural light to capture the raw images and create an almost documentary-like look. The actors wore no makeup to maintain the authenticity of their characters, and many scenes were shot on location in the areas the family travels through in the story. In this current era of big-budget films with stunning special effects and high-definition visuals and audio, it is refreshing to be riveted by exceptional screenplay and execution by the actors. From the beginning of the film, when Tom Joad is introduced as a man re-entering society after a stint in prison, you are transported to a time when the environment in America was rapidly changing. The great depression was in full swing, and class lines were being clearly defined, with rural Americans dropping to the bottom of the food chain. The Joad family, who for generations lived and prospered off of their land, were being forced to leave by big business and mechanized faming, leaving them with very few options for prosperity. Following a lead for employment in California, the entire family packs what they can fit into their truck and sets off on the long and dangerous journey. There is a particularly poignant scene when Mama Joad (Jane Darwell) is going through her belongings, deciding what was valuable enough to take, and what needed to be left behind, where you can feel the apprehension and sadness through the screen. That scene solidified how Jane Darwell won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role. The Joads were simple people, who worked hard and knew nothing about the world that they were being forced into. At many points along their journey, they are mistreated and judged for being rural Americans. In a scene where the family stopped at a gas station, when they pulled away, one of the attendants looked to the other attendant and said ""they ain't people."" That line encompassed the general attitude towards families like the Joads during that time period. Not only does The Grapes of Wrath provide viewers with an illustration of life during the depression, but the movie gives the timeless lesson that hope along with the bond of family will persevere in the end.",
109,12 May 2011,crivers123,7, The Grapes of Wrath (1940),"The Grapes of Wrath (1940) was a very well-made look at the experience of an Oklahoma farmer during the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. It is hard not to feel sympathy for the families who are losing their homes and farms. It was an intensely emotional scene when Muley and his family have to watch their homes be plowed to the ground. There were some scenes that it was easy to tell that there was a painted backdrop ( for example when Tom is arriving back home for the first time, he is walking through a field and there's an obvious backdrop.)The fact that the director was able to create a convincing look at the dustbowl so soon after it occurred definitely speaks for his talent.",

In a political discussion, I'd come across as the conservative, but I don't find issue here with the struggle of the Joad's to find a better life for themselves. History can't easily be defined in black and white terms, and the idea that government programs can be legitimately used to provide for citizens in dire need is to be commended. Those same programs, when used to create class warfare is where I take issue. Because director John Ford was such good friends with conservative stalwarts like John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, one would think that he was a Republican as well. In fact, he was an activist liberal Democrat, who admired FDR and JFK. So perhaps it's true he was stirring the pot with this picture, pitting the haves against the have-nots in a way that can be viewed as left leaning. The term 'Reds' was used a couple of times by Henry Fonda in the picture in a questioning way.",

I feel so happy when the Joad family finally pulls into the government camp and are treated to kindness and decency. After traveling all that way with them, seeing them suffer, humiliated, spat on, you feel so much compassion for them. And the scene where Tom and his mother are dancing, and Tom is singing to her, that is pure joy. I don't know what Ford's politics were, but I remember reading somewhere where he is very conservative, and many of his film's deal with the frontier, rugged individualism and all, it's interesting that this movie deals so much with local corruption, exploitation and sides with the federal government and its programs protecting worker's rights.

The movie reorganized the scenes so that instead of the Joads going from Hoovervilles to the government camp (Weed Patch) to the boxcars they went from Hoovervilles to the Ranch to the government camp (Wheat Patch). They changed the order in the movie and took the hard-hitting tragedy of the book and made it into the feel-good-movie-of-the-year. This censorship happened with many scenes in the movie. The Joads, in the book, ended by fleeing from flooding boxcars to the sanctuary of a damp barn while in the movie they leave a clean, nice government camp to go get 20 days worth of work while driving off into the sunset. The movie also completely leaves out the ending of the book where Rose of Sharon gives birth to a stillborn baby and then has to flee with some of the family to a barn to get out of the ""wet"". When they reach the barn she nurses an old man dying of malnutrition. This is a very powerful ending that was completely written out. ",

Forced off their land, and striking out west, the Joad family encounters just about every kind of hardship, yet the family lives on.  Mostly in part of Ma Joad, who keeps her family going through the worst of times.  Henry Fonda is wonderful as Tom. You can see his anger and frustration behind his eyes.  There's so much injustice going on around him, and he's powerless against it.  When he's about ready to do something foolish, it's his mother that pulls him back and makes him think about what his actions will do.  Unfortunately for Tom, fate has a way of dealing a bad hand and he must leave his family, not for his safety, but for theirs.  John Ford, a man usually associated with the western genre, brings Steinbeck's epic to the screen with skill and care. He invests so much time with the Joads that you feel like they're your own family.  And it pains you to see them go through such pain.  There is an uplifting end to it.

117,8 January 2000,jmcody,10, A classic of the human condition,"I think it is most ironic that independent filmmakers claim to despise ""the Hollywood"" film in favor of making ""personal cinema"" when one looks at the films of perhaps the most Hollywood sytem ingrained and yet stunningly personal films of John Ford.His films hold up because they display his personal love of character, land, place (there is a difference), time, honor, tradition and ritual. The Grapes of Wrath is one of his finest pictures. His obsessions and political leanings come to life in Steinbeck's haunting and searing narrative.I agree with many of the other IMDB reviewers, there is much in this film that is pure leftist propaganda and that Reifenstahl and Eisenstien's influence can be seen.  This is certainly true in the masked stormtrooper bulldozer montage. But propaganda, like the very medium of film itself, operates on pure emotion. This film is loaded with one emotional image after another. The photography of Gregg Toland matches the best of Life magazine in its immediacy and realism, while at the same time dramatically recapturing the best of German Expressionism. There are so many frames that could stand as works of photographic art. The look of the film stands proudly next to the work of Benton, Hopper, O'Keefe, Capa, and Bourke-White as examples of American visual art.The cast is uniformly honest, sincere and utterly real in thier inhabitation of character. John Carradine, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, John Qualen and the great Charley Grapewin all give performances that are on the level with anything ever produced from a Actor's Studio graduate.Enough can not be possibly said about Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad. Simply put it is one of the finest characterizations ever captured on film. He was not just an American pop culture icon, he was a fine dramatic artist.The script captures much of the best of Steinbeck's novel with fantastically illuminating and human quotes. It preaches to be sure, but never at the expense of the narrative. This is a lesson so many ""serious"" film makers have yet to learn.The film has not dated in terms of its impact on the heart. Grapes of Wrath is about a specific time and place in American History yes, but it is also about what it means to be a human being. In that sense, it transcends nationalism and is fine work of World Literature. It is on equal with Citizen Kane as one of the finest films ever made. A 10 out of 10.",

But, like most kids, I was far more into the movies of my time. I viewed most older movies, especially black & white ones, with a degree of contempt. However, that changed when I was fourteen. That summer I checked out two older movies on VHS from my local library. I had heard a lot about one of these movies being called ""the greatest movie of all time"" and the other I knew was based on a book that fourteen year-old me just wasn't about to voluntarily read (although I did read it years later). So I took them both home and watched them back to back, glued to the screen the whole time.

128,28 December 2005,vishal_wall,9, A good documentation of American depression,"I had heard that 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a good movie. I watched it and I found it indeed is. It's a very well cast, written and directed film by John Ford. The movie is about a family from Oklahoma migrated to California to find work during the great depression. I don't know why we call it 'Great' depression rather than calling it 'worst' depression or 'Devil' depression. I think humans are romantic about misery and so all the brutes or incident which brought misery are called 'Great' like Alexander the devil, Napoleon the devil and Devil Depression of America (1929). I'm sure by the next century Hitler will also be termed as 'Great' as by then probably western anti-communist agenda would have subsided and people will find greatness in Hitler's policies. Anyways. Henry Fonda- a Criminal by circumstances comes back from jail on parole to his home during American economic depression only to find his land is grabbed by capitalism and his family has moved to his uncle's farm. He meets them there and as his uncle's farm is also doomed they have no choice but to move towards the west to find work. In rest of the film the whole family keeps moving from one place to the other looking for work. The film has some very moving scenes especially the one where family stops at a restaurant to buy bread. The closeness of the family members, their relationship with each other is shown beautifully. At one point I was really compelled to think they are better off as at least they are together but from the next scene onwards the family starts breaking into pieces. Staying away from the family members is a curse of capitalism and this movie has depicted it in a very formal way. People are just lost on the way. Husband leaves his wife for a job. Uncle takes a dive into the water and asks others to move on as he wants to live close to a river. How things become direction less in a money oriented society is very well done here. Jane Darwell as Ma Joad steals the show. Henry Fonda has never said a word differently in any of his film so no point in discussing what he does here.",

They dominate the film.The black and white scenery is typical Ford. the situations are too - good or bad. The dialogue is straight forward and the sound quality shows its age.I dont think the condemning of the capitalist system is as strong as in the book. The book has more nuance. The govt camp run by the people and govt by extension is the better way togo. Most of the existing society outside of this camp is fascist, police controlled, American Legion Nazi, exploitive and very greedy. Its a decent movie made to showcase the Depression Era effects on "" white Anglo Saxon ""American"" land owners."" No people of black, or brown hue are in the movie. Evidently their problems did not exist. Its a classic , kind of dated ,yet relevant for today. California, the golden land, is a metaphor for the United States. Evidently the streets are not paved with gold and the reality falls short of the rhetoric in the US....People are exploited, greed rules, the game is rigged against average people. Socialism at that time, was a viable alternative. Capitalism had failed.",

138,10 November 2014,tabbyharwood,5, Family Land Taken,The Grapes of Wrath is a touching movie of poverty and how the Great Depression had an impact on families. Families had land taken away from them even though it was owned for over 50 years. Companies came in and took the land from families leaving them with no where to live. They struggled to feed their children. They had no choice but to leave their land and find a new home. Some traveled all the way across the country to find a new home. Lives were lost along the way due to illness or sickness. The darkness of the film gives you the realization of how depressing those times were. How some homes were occupied by 20 plus family members all trying to survive. The way that individuals had to suffer to get to a free land of living was gloomy situation. The part when the kids were all playing in the dumpster and then fighting to get soup was real touching and portrayed the struggle of families trying to feed their children. People lived in tents and they got used to the struggle of survival. People just wanted to work and provide for his family and they worked for pennies just to feed their children. This movie helped me to realize the little things that we take for granted today. How land could be lifted up from under people and they were left with nowhere to go. Families that stick together can get through anything.,
139,9 August 2009,johnmschofield,10, A moving story of the effects of Poverty and another warning from history,"This film although made almost seventy years ago is as relevant today as it was then. It depicts a family struggling to survive the effects of a depression and trying to do the right thing in spite of enormous suffering and degradation. You could make a similar film today and probably film it anywhere in the world. There were millions starving in the world both in 1940 and now almost 2010 and without sounding too pessimistic I cannot see an end to this situation. I am not interested in politics mainly because politicians worldwide generally are not interested in changing anything for the better. Thats not to say that I don't hope for a better future but I think it unlikely that my dream of no poverty will ever come true. The situation is the same as it always was and has been the same for centuries and millions have died as a result. That is not just my particular opinion that is a fact. If you are down you will rarely get any help and indeed you are more likely to be taken advantage of because there is always someone that has the power and the lack of empathy to do that. This film graphically sets out what can happen should you and your family find yourself in a similar position. I would recommend anyone watch this film as another timeless classic. To me 'The grapes of wrath' is another warning from history, it seems we collectively are not listening.",
140,6 October 2014,weezeralfalfa,10," classic narrative of the Depression dispossessed, including Exodus, with somewhat optimistic ending","Judging from the large number of reviews of this film, compared to most other well regarded films from this era, this must still be regarded as a classic portrayal of the plight of the rural poor during The Great Depression, dispossessed of their rented or sometimes owned land and home, forced to flee to distant overcrowded greener pastures or cities. Actually, this flight had begun around 1920, after the collapse of agriculture produce prices with the ending of WWI. Although only white Americans are depicted, African Americans were leaving southern states, especially, in large numbers during this period and subsequently. Although the Joads understandably didn't see it that way at that time, population dislocations, due to technological progress or resource exhaustion and resource discoveries is an unfortunate integral part of relatively recent history. This film dramatizes the generally greater adverse effect of such dislocations on the elderly, who have often invested near a lifetime in their dispossessed property and lifestyle, thus are more reluctant to abandon the familiar for a distant unknown, and are more likely to die trying to get there under rather primitive traveling conditions, as dramatized in this film. This particular point is more thoroughly emphasized in the subsequent film ""Wild River"", in which an elderly woman landowner refuses to leave her lifelong home and plantation, until forced to, even knowing it would soon be drowned by the rising waters behind a new TVA dam. In that case, the woman didn't die of traveling stress. Apparently, she simply willed herself to die, out of depression. She had no desire to start a new life in the TVA-financed alternative property awarded her, in spite of all the immediate and long-term benefits claimed by the TVA rep for the building of that dam.",

The performances stayed with me for years, and the power of the film too. I read the book and it showed how great a film they had made from a long, wordy, social tale. Recently re-watching the movie, it looked fresh and just as powerful as when I first saw it. Henry Fonda, John Carradine and especially Jane Darwell, give career heights performances and they add truthful weight to the characters. The story challenges the way we treat migrants and how we force them to be what we think they might be, in England we have a lot of this in recent times. All the character parts are effective, for example the caretaker of the government camp, who at last shows some understanding of the migrants problems and quietly helps them settle in. Unfortunately he is virtually the only kind soul the Joads meet on their journey. It is a solid drama, never adding any comedy or music to heighten the action, sticking truthfully to its source. I am sure Steinbeck was proud of this version.",

Based off the literary sensation written by John Steinbeck only a year before the film's release, it tells a story about depression and poverty. It is a very simple, but well-told story with memorable characters and performances. More than eighty years later, the film remains socially prevalent today as it was back in 1940. Ford does an incredible job making his audience care about the plight of these poor folks- something that many people had to endure during the Great Depression. For the duration of the two-hour running time, I was at the edge of my seat deep within my feelings. The film is not built on shocking dramatics, but rather a story that is still striking because of how deep it is based on reality. This reality is shocking enough. On top of the actual story, Gregg Toland's black-and-white cinematography is super effective. Of course, that is how film were seen back during this time-period, but the camerawork added a realistic touch to these character's predicaments.",
157,19 January 2021,marcslope,10," Like the New York Times capsule TV review used to say, ""the American cinema at its peak""","John Steinbeck's epic novel of the poverty, dislocation, and injustices wrought by the Dust Bowl of the 1930s was unfilmable as is; it's raunchier, more political, and more left-wing than what 20th Century Fox could put in a major release. All the same, what they achieved was a masterpiece. The fraught journey of the Joads was boiled down extremely effectively by screenwriter Nunally Johnson, and John Ford's direction and Gregg Toland's superb photography are, in a word, unflinching. They're not afraid to thrust the audience straight into the suffering of the Joads and so many like them, and those hungry kids clustered around Ma Joad's pot of fried dough don't look like Hollywood extras, they look like real, poor, hungry Depression kids. The violence and capitalistic greed visited upon the Okies aren't soft-peddled, they're real and frightening. And the ending, very different from the book, is the right ending for this journey, especially in Jane Darwell's unfussy, deservedly Oscar-winning delivery. So many of the actors give career-high performances: John Carradine's haunted Casy, John Qualen's blighted Muley, Grant Mitchell's fatherly camp supervisor (the one component that feels a little soft: ""See, the government CAN do good""). Small scenes, like the one with Mae in the diner, have large resonance, and the have- and have-not verities that are with us still have never been more realistically and heartbreakingly portrayed.

174,18 January 2020,labontearia,9, A Classic American Tale,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" is considered one of the top pieces of cinema to ever be created, and even when viewed for the first time 80 years later, it's not hard to tell why. In the movie based on the book by John Steinbeck, we see the reality of what many American people faced. Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, is a wayward man, on his way home from prison to reunite with his family. Once home, he discovers that his family has been pushed out of their home by the people who own the land. The family, reunited with Tom decide that they can persevere and will relocate to California, where jobs will be plentiful, and money and housing will not be an issue. They decide to take Jim Casy (played by John Carradine), the old ex-preacher, along for the journey with them.
The Joad Family along with Jim Casy quickly discover that the American dream they were hoping for was not as easily attainable as they previously hoped. It seems that they are struck with hardship after hardship, beginning with the death of multiple family members during their journey just travelling, followed by lack of jobs, lack of food, questionable living conditions, and unfair treatment by employers. In one particularly shocking scene, Connie, father-to-be of Tom's nephew, runs away from the family, unable to deal with the pressures of the working camps, leaving his pregnant wife behind.
It seems as if the Joad family's misfortunes will never end. At one of the camps, ex-preacher Jim Casy finds himself involved in what is most likely the beginning formations of a union. Workers are forming strikes to protest the unfair monopoly the food store has over the workers of the farm. Both Jim and Tom find themselves amidst the strikers on one fateful night at which point Jim is struck dead by an officer. Tom retaliates back by killing the officer and running away, but not before getting struck in the face himself, leaving him with an identifiable scar. As the police begin their search for Tom, the Joad family decides to try again, and they pack up in search of the next camp.
At the final camp, it seems that the Joad family's misfortune may be over. Government run, there is plenty of work, food, showers, and even dances. It seems that everything may just work out for the Joad's until the police eventually come by looking for Tom, who has violated his parole by killing the officer at the previous camp. Tom decides it will be best to leave his family permanently to avoid them getting in trouble for hiding them. In a touching scene, Tom says his final goodbyes to his mother and reflects on his time with Jim Casy, the ex-pastor, deciding that he would like to follow in his footsteps and seek out some form of social justice. The two bid goodbye and the next day, Ma (played by Jane Darwell) heads out to work with Pa and delivers perhaps one of the best executed speeches in the whole film, discussing how despite the trials and tribulations the family has faced, they keep surviving and will continue to survive no matter what.
Ultimately, it is the movie's telling of the story, produced by Nunnally Johnson, that makes the movie resonate as strongly as it does. Though perhaps the acting seems a little over the top years later and the accents were hard to follow and understand, the ultimate portrayal of resilience that makes Americans American is a message that still instills a sense of pride in anyone who views this movie. Overall, I would give this movie a solid 8 or 9 out of 10. It is certainly easy to understand how and why this is still an ultimate classic of American Cinema.",
175,5 January 2011,eabakkum,8, A drama about the expulsion of peasants from their tenant farm,"The Grapes of Wrath is an exceptional film, both in substance and as an artistic accomplishment. Since I did not read the book, my review is written without any prejudice. In the film we follow an extended family of small peasants, the Joads, who are expelled from their tenant farm. At first the story may seem a typical part of American history, which is of course true. For instance the illustrious folk singer Woody Guthrie had his roots in the Oklahoma dust bowl, and the eventual migration to California. I was truly fascinated by his biographic DVD ""This machine kills fascists"". But in fact the expulsion of small peasants is a universal theme. Already in the fifteenth century it started with the English enclosure movement. In the nineteenth century it was a recurring phenomenon in all parts of Europe. For instance, in 1903 the Flemish author Cyriel Buysse wrote a play about it (""Het gezin van Paemel""), and created one of the predecessors of Steinbeck's novel. Later a Flemish film version has been produced, which is highly recommendable. And then in the Bolshewist countries there was the forced transformation into collective farming. Although the Czechoslovak and Polish regimes shrunk from this move, which gives food for reflection. The making public of the American version through a book and subsequently a film was a courageous endeavor, since social critique is rarely welcomed (it could probably only be done because of the friendly New Deal atmosphere). Paricularly striking is the scene, where a farmer tries to prevent the demolition of his farm by threatening with a rifle. He asks the usher: ""Against who should I defend myself?"" The land owner? No, it is only an enterprise. The director of the enterprise? No, he just does what he is told to do. The bank? No, it simply reacts to the demand of the market. Of course the usher puts up a sham, because each and every one of these institutions is to blame (evidently in the first place the director, who has made a willful decision to break up the long-lasting business relation). The homeless farmers migrate en bloc to California (!), hoping to make a living as pickers. They live in tent camps, and are murdered by villagers, the thugs of land owners, and even the local police (especially the deputies are accomplices of the wealthy land owners). The main character is the peasants son Tom Joad (impressively portrayed by Henry Fonda). He has just served six years in prison for man slaughter, and is freed on parole. Here we see a glimpse of the family pride. When Tom returns home to Oklahoma, his family assumes: ""Did you escape?"" Especially grandfather is delighted: ""I told you so! They can't lock up a Joad!"" He and many others hold that they have a right to the Oklahoma land, because many of them died there: ""It is our dust"". All peasant communities share this same common isolation, caused by an apparent independence and self-provision (my grandparents were also farmers). This tends to make them inflexible. Grandpa and Grandma die during the ride to California. This does not come as a surprise, and therefore the Stalin-like director of the land owning company does not go free here. Characteristic of the small and collective peasant world is the mother of the family, who complains that she sees her family falling apart. Again Tom kills a man, this time not in self-defense. Frankly, I don't understand this aspect of the narrative. On the one side, Tom is no more a criminal than the policeman, who for no reason fires with his gun in a crowded camp of migrants and seriously wounds an innocent woman. On the other hand, it impedes the feelings of empathy and identification of the viewer/reader, and images the Joads as culpable wrong-doers. As a matter of fact, it can be argued that the Joad family (just like the Paemels) have neglected the change of time,and the agricultural revolution. This is a central point. Too often the changing policy of the society elite is far-reaching to such an extent, that the common people get no fair chance to adapt. And this can truly be called a crime. In conclusion: The Grapes of Wrath is recommended (which it doesn't need). If you like social films, see Het gezin van Paemel. Or consider reading my other reviews.",

I find it difficult to match actors with the characters in the book however, Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, the hot head. Fonda did a great job of portraying his character as the common man and his performance allowed me to understand the way many individuals were feeling during that period of history. While the movie did leave out many important scenes that were included in the book the scenes included showed the struggles of the Americans that experienced the Dust Bowl. The scene where the Joad family is kicked off their land was quite emotional and a good depiction of the past. The setting of the film was very accurate to the book and the way the scenes were The shot of the family traveling to California were very well done. Using what seems to be a process shot of the landscape giving the impression that the vehicle is in motion. The shots of the landscape itself were breathtaking.

179,26 December 2022,ohlabtechguy,7, Political social commentary of the early 20th Century,"I've heard about this movie and novel for a long time but didn't know the details. Just saw this movie on YT for free. I've seen a lot of old movies and this one certainly stands out as being unique. It's gritty and focuses on characters who belong to the lowest classes. As soon as I saw the scene with a farm run by the US Government, I knew there was a political message being made. The message was clearly that capitalistic farm owners only seek to exploit their workers, whereas the government is more like the workers' friend and ally. Was this the reality and big picture taking place in the 1930s? I don't have a clue. I suspect the real truth is far more complex. It would be interesting to see how proponents of the current Critical Race Theory would view this movie, since all the exploitation shown is due to socioeconomic class and not race. All the characters were white. It was all about white people being cruel and exploitative towards other white people. Performances were credible although at times the script and direction were too ""theatrical"", veering from stark realism to performance directed at an audience. Very bleak and somewhat depressing social commentary, but worth seeing once.",

182,15 October 2010,d-jacobs1,8, A masterfully engaging and moving a-bomb of hardship.,"An enormously powerful and moving narrative of the hardships and perseverance of one poor farming family during the great depression, this film beautifully blends expert cinematography and moving dialogue. The Joad's struggle is hauntingly foreshadowed at the beginning in the Joad's abandoned house, where a mood of tragedy is established. Throughout the film, use of deep contrast and shadow is appropriately used to emphasize moments of despair and sullenness, the preacher often comes in and out of shadow and plays a key role in Tom Joad's development. I found the mother to be exceptionally engaging, owning most of the emotional power and meaning in the dialogue. While the film is mainly a constant bludgeoning of sadness, and it feels as though the Joad's will never be at peace, there are moments of relief. The grandpa serves a dose of comic relief, and the government run housing camp is the only place happiness seems to exist. Over the course of the film you begin to feel connected to the Joads, and start thinking like them. As the Joad's enter the displaced farmers' camp, you feel a sense of apprehension along with Tom, and you find yourself waiting for the next injustice to present itself. You then grow attached to this haven, and feel accomplished when the police scheme against it is thwarted. The beautiful photography, top tier dialogue, and moving story all blend to produce an engaging style typical of great movies; a category in which this film rightly fits.",

186,20 January 2020,emmagersten,10, A window into the life of migrant workers in the 30s,"The Grapes of Wrath is a 1940 Hollywood movie and is based on the book written by John Steinbeck. It was adapted for the film by Nunnally Johnson and directed by John Ford.
The film's main focus is on the Joad family's survival during the great depression of the 1930s. The film is in black and white which lends itself ideally to reflect the gloomy times and life circumstances of the main characters; they are poor tenant farmers, suffering from terrible climate catastrophe that destroyed their land and livelihood. The process of brutal bank repossession of the farm and eviction of inhabitants was presented in its entire cruelty, showing no regard for the dignity and destiny of its long-term occupants and their survival.
The film opens with the two main characters: Tommy Joad (played by Henry Fonda), and Jim Casy, a preacher and Tommy's friend, driving by some fields and talking about share cropping. Tommy discloses that he has been just paroled from prison where he spent 4 years for killing a man at a bar. That later puts him in a legally sensitive position. Returning to the share cropping land in Oklahoma where Tommy Joad and his family had worked for generations, he was immediately told that they are no longer allowed to work on those lands. After much effort to resist, the Joads join the caravan of other from Oklahoma on the journey west to California that advertised jobs and opportunities. That made them feel hopeful for their future.
The film follows their journey to California, where not everything is great: some family members die and some lose their spirit in addition to their descent into poverty, some split from the group, people quarrel and fight, the living conditions are horrible, people sharing sad stories of helplessness, low pay and more hopelessness. Jim Casy is very honest about losing his faith while still reminiscing fondly on his past time as a preacher. Both Jim and Tom reflect passionately on the conditions, the fairness and social justice.
The tragedy of this film is watching their long trek not result in a better life. Still the film includes scenes where people manage to dance and sing and cling to hope and stay loyal to land and farming.
What I really liked about this movie is that it made me consider parallels of poor living conditions of people under capitalism versus the powerlessness of masses of people under communism. In spite of sad circumstances people in the movie were free to move and pursue happiness. Compared to the amalgamation of modern movies I've seen the characters were very authentic and much easier to connect with.
The movie was one of the best overall that I've seen. The absence of CGI was also surprisingly refreshing because it makes you just focus on the people, the acting and the story. I haven't seen any other films from this era which makes me not want to give it any kind of star rating.",

He was outstanding. Instead they waited until late in his life and gave it to him for On Golden Pond. What was the academy thinking? Grapes of Wrath was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It shows just how bad the depression years were. It makes you think about how lucky we are to have as much as we have when they were deprived of what little they had. They did the same thing with John Wayne and Paul Newman. Skipped over them all of their lives and finally gave them Oscars for True Grit and The Color of Money. Sympathy Oscars don't cut it. Great performances should be honored as such and not overlooked. I realize that everyone cannot receive an Oscar. I love the People's Choice Awards. That means something.

The Grapes of Wrath is a story of a joint family living in America (State of Oklahoma) at the times of the 'Great Depression'. Homeless and out of work, they had to move to the extreme west (State of California) to have a chance of earning livelihood and survival. They move from Okhlahoma to California in a vehicle that is old enough to be kept in the museum. Their journey to California itself is a highlight of the movie. They venture through different towns and states, get the sometimes good and sometimes bad reception of local people of every state, Hell,loose two members of their family in the journey (The Journey in Little Miss Sunshine is inspired from this movie). Living peacefully all these years in their Oklahoma Farm, suddenly they are faced with the materialistic facet of human nature. Some days they go without eating, somedays without sleep, Looking here and there for a job, they are ready to do absolutely anything. In all this trauma and pain, the only thing that remains constant is the human emotion of love and belonging. As a family, they are emotionally richer than the most richest man around.

198,8 November 2019,mcbr-67199,9, Good Movie,"The Grapes of Wrath is a must watch film due to its parallels to The Dust Bowl and The Great Depression of the 1930's. The movie also portrays thoughtful cinematography and excellent choice of music which brings the whole movie together. A major theme in the movie is the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a series of major winds and drought during the 1930's that spread throughout the southern US which led to the death of all crops and livestock. The main characters of the movie, the Joad family loses their farm to the Dust Bowl and travel from Oklahoma to California in an attempt to rebuild their lives. They encounter many struggles along the way and have little money due to their crops being demolished from the unforgiving winds. In 1929 the worst economic downturn in US history hit, the Great Depression. It began when the stock market crashed and immediately impacted the rest of the US. During this time unemployment rose to 25% and many people lost their houses, cars, jobs, etc. This major economic downfall is portrayed so vividly in the movie when you see the characters struggle to find a job to make enough money to provide for one another. The American dream portrayed during the roaring 20's is now gone and reality has set in for the characters knowing they may not make enough money to live. As well as it's significant connections to history The Grapes of Wrath also should be recognized for its flawless cinematography and music score. Director John Ford uses storytelling through the cinematography of this movie with subtle hints shown in every shot. During the scene where the caterpillar passes over Muley's house the cinematographer slightly pans to show the shadows of the farmers going through the tractor tracks. The use of the shadows portrays an underlying theme of defeat coming from the farmers, only putting the shadows in the shot left a feeling of emptiness in the viewer, exactly what the farmers were thinking in the scene. The music in this movie compliments the theme almost perfectly, with songs such as ""She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain"", and ""Going Down The Road Feeling Bad"" Alfred Newman does an incredible job of placing the music within the movie. The entire soundtrack of the movie fits perfectly with the theme of hopelessness and traveling West which enhances the entire experience of the movie. This films tie ins with major historical events and incredible cinematography and soundtrack make it a must see for anyone.",

The photography was very open and spacious and the lighting was very contrasty and low key. This was appropriate because the subject of the film was The Great Depression and its effects on rural farmers and its setting was the Dust Bowl of the southwest.

Yet it is much more than that - it is simply one of the finest movies ever made. Better acting you will never see - and while it's arguably (a very young) Henry Fonda's very best film, Jane Darwell puts in a performance you will never forget (and you won't soon forget her final line - one of the most historic, moving and memorable final lines in all of movie history). You can't get a better story than one written by John Steinbeck, of course, and the stark cinematography blazes new territory and remains fresh to this day. Even the ""lesser"" character actors shine brightly here. Who will forget John Qualen's performance as Muley or John Carradine's performance as Casey? ...And that's just scratching the surface. Who doesn't fall in love with and care about the main characters, as they desperately try to survive the rigors of the Depression (and whom among us could withstand the horrors they went through)? This is a real story - one that every American needs to know; there is no exaggeration here. The inhumanity heaped upon the most defenseless during the Depression - as brought out in this film - is something few movies have brought out. This is the quintessential Dust Bowl and Depression film. The realism is incredible. The music helps move you to tears, too. The heroism so many of the characters display is not just moving - it speaks of a time when more people were truly noble. What a cast! What a story! What a film!",

The Grapes of Wrath is more than just a good old fashioned movie; it's a lesson in American history. Many of us have probably heard a grandparent or older family member talk of ""The Dust Bowl"" days, ""The Depression Era"" and of banks foreclosing on farms during the 1930's. Director John Ford brilliantly captures all this in The Grapes of Wrath as it follows one Oklahoma family through all these hardships as they migrate from their foreclosed farm to California in hopes of finding work in a depressed economy. Superb acting by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine bring raw emotion to a well written script based on the novel by John Steinbeck. Both the novel and the movie were extremely controversial during their initial period of release. The novel was actually banned in several states because of its true depiction of the life of strife that many families encountered while living in migrant worker camps in California.

One technical aspect was how great the photography looked, by cinematographer Gregg Toland, one of the best in the industry at that time period. John Ford gave this movie excellent direction, he conveyed good character development and the movie had movement and progression, both in the storyline, the core meaning and the character relationships. It's a sad movie made in 1940, but taking place in the 30's during the dust bowl, families are forced to migrate west to California in hopes of finding work. With thousands of families migrating, few can be accommodated. For the family of Tom Joad luck was rare. The emotions, mood and feeling that come from the very roundness and progressiveness is what makes this movie so desirable. Also the shot composition and lighting really helped me feel the mood of the story. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a very realistic and sad story of man vs. law and man vs. society. It shows us how the best thing to do is to stick together with your loved ones and you'll get by. This was such and inspiring influential movie.",

222,19 January 2023,hayleecook-52748,6, An alright historic movie,"I think this was a good movie. Being not from the great depression era, the movie just looked like it was and made it seem really real. I think that it showed the actually worse parts of the great depression without 'milking' it or making it too unrealistic. The only thing that kind of got me out of it was that I was so out of touch with the characters, most of them I couldn't connect with and it just made me not be fully engaged in the movie. I think Tommy is a very interesting main character, his past is made for you to not trust him or think he's a good person. Especially in the way he talked to the truck driver in the beginning, but he grew as a person throughout the entire movie and with every bump in the road he hit with his family it definitely made him stronger and a more likable character. I think Tommy's ending monologue was very touching and it was one of those things that I thought about after the movie was over, something about him listing the places he'll be in to his mother was just very meaningful.

This movie is very close to being a primary source for the Great Depression, which adds to the realness of the movie. The scenes of these communities of other western farmers, especially the first one, was very heartbreaking. I appreciate the cinematography.

Another thing I noticed is how this was around the time period of the great depression. From a movie standpoint I felt this movie was somewhat boring and
lengthy. The movie was longer than I felt it should have been. I did however like the characters in this film, I felt some were really entertaining. The downside was how most of the characters lacked development. I would only recommend this film to an older audience.",

It focuses on the ""dust bowl"" where okies had to move to California in search of jobs and work. The movie shows how they were treated and they do this very well. They show how they get kicked out of their land and they move through the levels of severity of the camps. While they do show the history part very well the entertainment aspect is lacking. They do the bare minimum to keep the audience focused and into the movie. If you took all the camps and historical facts out of the movie it would be a confusing and uninteresting mess. This movie has potential but if killing off someone every time it gets boring is the producers idea of keeping the audience entertained it is doomed. There just needs to be for life to the movie, more story, more laughs and enjoyment. If you want to learn about what the life of an okie is like this is the perfect movie for you but otherwise I'd recommend spending your time on something better than this.",

It is fascinating to me how Americans made it through the Great Depression. I think if they were to shorten the length of the movie, it would have helped pace the movie and help with the long boring scene. For me personally, I wouldn't recommend this movie.

My one issue from the beginning of the movie is the family asking Tom ""Did you bust out?!"" can we get an explanation on why he would've busted out of prison? He got out on good behavior. Also, the way that Ma uses the grandma's corpse as a way to get through the checkpoint is kinda hilarious but also morbid at the same time, as a viewer I knew that the grandma was gonna die but she was sick and then it just cuts to Ma with the zombie-like grandma in her lap.

Director John Ford pulls no punches. Other than the direct effects of the depression, the depiction of the lengths people go to to abuse the hurting of other humans is crazy (and probably true). Yet, among all the self interest, there are acts of kindness and selflessness that leave you with hope for the world. Henry Fonda is great as Tom Joad, and deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Supporting cast did a pretty good job, with Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad), to the fore. Her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well deserved. A must-see, realistic human drama at its best.",

Some other things I saw during this movie is when they lit the candle in the house to see if anyone was there there was still a back light. where was that coming from? another thing was the sound. When the wind storm was rolling in it was extremely loud and if you looked around not everything was moving from these terrible winds. another thing was I liked the fact that they used a montage effect of all the signs when they were traveling from Oklahoma to California.

The plot takes place during the height of the great depression when families were struggling. Tom Joad is a recently released prisoner who was trying to find his way back home to his family. When he arrives at his home, it looks abandoned. This film was made in black and white, but the camera was amazing at showing more drama and emotion. He slowly walks up to the door wondering if its really empty or if they're just hiding. Upon entering his assumptions were correct, except for Muley. Joad finds out that everybody was traveling from Oklahoma to California to try to find some work and a better life. During the depression film had no other choice, but to reflect the realities of the world. People didn't want to see happiness on the screen when their lives were a constant battle. Joad and Muley take off on foot to hopefully meet up with their family. Eventually they do, and the world family seems to have meaning again. it doesn't matter what challenges they were facing, they knew the strength that they could get from each other. If someone was still hungry, but their was no food left to be eaten, someone would share what they had left. the Joad family continued across country on their journey finding random jobs and housing, but surviving. This was an epic story that wasn't based on any family in particular, but on the sad truths that our country once had to encounter.

It is definitely an overrated movie going back to the cinema's first steps.

Tom Joad returns home from jail (where he spent 4 years serving a murder charge) to find his family's farm destroyed and desolate, and his family facing eviction the next day. The family begin their trek to California only to arrive in a place with a starving job market. During their time in California Tom seems to do the family more harm than good with his justice-seeking attitude that send the family to multiple new locations before Tom's final departure from the family.

I think that Tom was a very selfish character as he still got into fights after getting out of jail even though he could have been caught and ruined the chances his family had to find a better way of living. I also hate how they brought up the mom as the glue of the family, but if i remember well she only really had like two moments when she acted like the ""glue"".

There is an overall dark and depressing aspect to the film; families lost their land, homes, food, and great amounts of their wealth. Media tried to cover the reality of the situation by reporting deaths due to heart failure or stroke, instead of starvation, which was the reality. It was a trying time for many people, and Grapes of Wrath, shows what it was like for one family to lose their home to the Depression. All they want to do is go to California, but when they get to the land of ""Milk and Honey"" there isn't as much hope there as they had thought. The camera work for this film was overall good. There were beautiful shots of the environment and land surrounding them. Although the film is a realistic interpretation of a very historical period in American history, it seems to be quite dull. John Ford (Director of the film) may have tried to make too much happen in the film.

I was sad when Grandpa Joad passed away during the trip down the highway. Other than that, it's still good. The acting by Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell happens to be really good as the story moves on. Also, the writing of this movie is so good that it makes me want to see it at least once more.

They almost always keep my interest and i can appreciate the classics. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" however, is my exception. If it wasn't for the acting being fantastic, I would have given this film a failing grade. Any movie that bores me to the extent when I want to turn it off, I can't give it a good grade. It's not just the movie, it's the play too. I really just can't enjoy the story when it's about a subject as dry as the dust bowl.",

In all the, plot/ story content was great. Seeing what the main characters went through was some what hard to watch for me. I felt bad and guilty for watching it with popcorn in my hands. Besides the plot, the camera work was incredible. ",
272,8 October 2014,leonrach95,8, Trying to live the dream,The Grapes of Wrath is an extremely intense movie. It kept an serious tone throughout the entire movie and it honestly never got uplifting. There was no good outcome from anything that they did. There is probably one of the most mature films I have seen come from movies of the 1940's. The story is during the time of the dust bowl where no jobs are available. The actors are truly inspiring at how they display emotions on their face. The actors take this into their own hands and make it extremely believable. The director make a powerful movie at displaying the depression and how it was to be poor. If you can handle a serious movie I highly recommend this to anyone.,
273,19 January 2023,maryjoanmartin,7, Accurate and boring,"I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because I didn't like the ending and found it boring as they went from camp to camp. I found it as a good depiction of its historic reference. Since the movie was depicted around the great depression and the dust bowl it was good to see just how devastating these events left American families. My favorite part of the movie was when Tom Joad got hit by the sheriffs and it left a scar. Tom Joad then had to flee the camp because he was wanted. The method that they used to get out of the camp was to hide him under blankets in the family car. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good idea of how the people in Oklahoma in the 1930s were treated. The ending wasn't a small cute perfect ending which is what most people want; however, it was realistic to the great depression. Tom ending up leaving to make sure his family wasn't put in danger and his family continued to move around to find work to get food on the table.",

I'm not saying it was horrible, some parts were enjoyable and some scenes were even funny. It was just a lot of typical 1940's movie humor. I think there was a good message, it was just portrayed in a strange way. Watching this does make me grateful that I've never had to experience hardships such as this, so one could also view this movie as an eye opener. I enjoyed Ma Joad's character the most and thought that she made the movie 10x better. I appreciate this movie for what it is, but wouldn't continue watching it for years to come.",

The beginning of the movie I am still confused about and I am not sure how the guy got back to his family but whatever. Anyways the movie is about Okies (fams from Oklahoma) moving to California and trying to find work and housing. The main character I guess killed someone and got out and was on parole but broke the parole to go with his family. The family went on the road trip and it took a long time. Someone dies but can't say. The grandpa didn't want to go so they got him drunk and put him in the back of the truck. Kinda rude but ok. The first camp they went to the cops came and tried to arrest a guy for ""a fight"" that probably didn't happen. The guy ran and the cop shot at him but somehow missed very badly and shot a random lady randomly standing in the road. Yeah also it is in black and white so it is kinda hard to see them at night but watch if you want.",

It wasn't really that interesting, I may have been struggling to stay awake during this movie but I didn't hate it. I think it might just be me because this isn't my type of movie but I have to be considerate because it did come out in 1940. I like the story a lot though because of the time period, it is very interesting seeing how the family was affected by the Depression. I think if the movie was recreated today the movie would be so much better, not just because it wouldn't be in black and white.",
277,17 October 2010,JamesDean1955,7, graphic look into the feel and realness of the average struggling American family during the Great Depression,"Upon review of this classic, I found myself immersed into the feel of this film. The lighting in this movie casts a certain element of darkness,doom,and gloom which indirectly reflects the time period this is being portrayed in the film. The plot was interesting, I followed the story and it was an interesting look into what our grandparents and great grandparents had to endure during those times of hardship. I found it also liberating to a certain extent, it made current situations and problems in my current life seem not so hard up after all, at least i haven't been forced out of the home and shipped off to a farm to work for a measly 2 cents... Not yet of course ( considering the shape of our current economy / government ) I enjoyed the casting of shadows, and that most of the film was shot at night, this really gave me the sense of darkness, loneliness, and uncertainness. Not quite sure if the director had that intention in mind while in production, but anyway you look at it, it holds a unique element of darkness to it. I would strongly recommend this movie, its fun, serious, and educating, and tells a story during an important time in Americas history.",
278,15 March 2013,uziesuzie,10, Just a little piece of a big soul,"This film really captures the trials and tribulations of the immigrants during The Great Depression. With the inclusion of the great devastation of the Dust Bowl period, which was happening at the same time. One forcing families off of their land and the other creating economic despair. A no win situation. The long take of the Joed family entering the Transient camp from the actually family's point of view was really intense. You feel as though your right there with them. The best line in the film is in the last ten minutes of the film when Tom Joed says to his mother "" A Fella ain't got a soul of his own, just a little piece of a big soul. The one big soul that belongs to everybody"" This was the most beautiful part of the film besides the memorizing landscapes.",
279,4 May 2013,v-colarusso,8, Dust Bowl,"The Grapes of Wrath was a remarkable story of a family's struggle during the Great Depression. The story was unbelievably sad and seemed very realistic. It's interesting that this event was reenacted into film so close to the era that it actually took place. Ma Joad was my favorite character because of her determination to keep the family together. In such trying times, it appeared to be very hard for the family to appreciate each other. An idea that I found to be odd, I always assumed that it was struggles such as this one that brought people closer. The black and white cinematography really helped portray the desperation and hopelessness emotion of the film.",
280,26 March 2014,launsbachc,7, Overall Good,"I have to note that the characterization in this film is very good. It is as if you can really hear and see the pain each character is experiencing. For example when Tom first meets Casy the viewer can easily identify that he has drawn drastically far from his former beliefs and life as a preacher. Henry Fonda (Tom) does a phenomenal job of portraying the sort of rough around the edges but good hearted type. Most of his significant plot developing actions consist of him perhaps doing the ""wrong thing"" but for the right reason for instance when he hits the sheriff. Because the film is centered around depression era Midwest farmers it may be difficult to connect with on a personal level. That said, one thing any whole hearted person can relate to in this film is the love and dedication we have for our families, how important it is, and how it truly reveals itself in times of hardship. To me that was the overwhelming social significance of the film. In the end when Tom is forced to skip town because of the sheriff he tells his mother he plans to fight for injustice. Although it is definitely sad I feel as if Tom gains fulfillment from using his edge and aggression to combat unfairness. Weather it was Casy's attacker or the Sheriff it was clear Tom did what he did for the right reasons and felt good about it despite the consequences. Symbolically as we see Tom off to seek his fulfillment it appears his family may be fortunate enough to seek theirs too as they hear of work north of the camp. ",

I know it's an old movie, but some old movies are kind of interesting. This is not one of them. I understand the theme and how it's centered around the Great Depression. I also liked how at some points it showed some comedic relief but other than that, it was quite a sad movie. The acting wasn't all that great, even for the time it was filmed in. The story was also sad too, but not enough to want me to know what was going on in deeper detail. All together this movie wasn't absolutely horrible, it just didn't really catch my interest.",

Don't get me wrong this movie is old and at times hard to follow but it's not because the story is bad. In 1940, they didn't have the capabilities to satisfy your 5 second attention span. If you can focus for a little bit, maybe you can notice the good things about this movie. The cinematography and camera work was very advanced for a movie of this time and Henry Fonda did great as Tom Jode. Jane Darwell won the award for best supporting role for this movie as Ma. The story of the Oakies having to leave their homes for work and opportunities and the losses they went through is tragic and very interesting. There was a ""propaganda!"" review that wasn't completely wrong for once! Anyway, maybe before you dawg on an old movie you can actually pay attention to it.",
283,23 January 2023,johnwashington-87142,7, good,I gave this movie a 7/10 because of how it shows how people lived in that time and how the depression was bad in the times of days and years spent in. In any case though how sad that most farmers had to leave their own lands just for other people to build things and after that. I feel like it is stupid because they can be spend years of their life farming and then their kids framing to just for it to end in a blink of an eye and becomes homeless and don't have money or resource to help me get back up from being broke and and the worst part is trying to feed everyone when knowing that everyone won't survive and if they get sick to a bad part as well but this movie shows you a lot that what happened in that year of depression and how bad it was for most people who couldn't find a job or got run out of a job.,

Like every other boy at that age I was a regular picturegoer and enjoyed the solid entertainment provided. My country was at war and we needed entertainment. But this film had a profound effect on me. It told me more about why we had to fight for democracy so that our society could be held to account for the way it treated its members than any of the propaganda films of the war. The humanity of the Joads, the way in which Ma fought to keep her family together, the way in which greed and corruption could ruin society and make us all losers was subtly and artistically portrayed. This is a film which should make Hollywood proud.",

They are off to California due to he dust storms and infertile farmland. On their journey they face many trials and tribulations in which the protagonist must help his family overcome in order to help them have a safe trip to California.throughout the film there is very epic scenes that are quite inspiring as well as very poetic and epic dialogue. There is a lot of substance to take from this film and it is very easy to feel for the characters in this which I think is awesome because it almost brings you back to that very same time period.,

The film gave a very realistic point of view on the issues that came along with the depression. Not many viewers, nor myself can relate to this issue or even feel what they might have felt. The movie created a portrait for us to see as it goes through the trails this family has to battle. The costumes in this movie not only helped gave us a visual on what the 30's were like; it allowed us to forget about the reality we currently are in. Again, this is the genius of film making. All of these things play an important role in the tone for the movie. I believe the props and the setting played the most important part in this film.",

It had elements of despair and used flashbacks as a way to get the story told. This film is an adaptation of a previously written novel, and that usually means that the film will not be a decent view. However, that is not the case. Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as Tom, and does a great job at making the viewer believe the plight that one would have when having to move off of their land due to the dust bowls.

It shows people living in deplorable conditions and the set pieces are great. The film does a good job at showing the environment, which was the Midwestern United States. The camera shots by John Ford are amazing and capture the scope and the feel of the scenes.

I had to look back into dates to realize that ""La Terra Trema"" and ""Rocco e i suoi fratelli"" both from Luchino Visconti or ""Les quatre cents coups"" from François Truffaut or even ""Los Olvidados"" from Luis Buñuel were made after John Ford's movie, I felt that in those days only European cinema had these deep drama human elements, but this movie was a good surprise for me. Human spirit struggling; people moving from one place to other leaving everything they have for a new better life, dealing with moral dilemmas, taking care of older parents, hunger, misery, all these elements are always present in one way or another in those days but what I loved about this movie is the ""hope"", the way this American movie believes in the human spirit and doesn't lead everything to a dramatic tragedy.

The acting performances in the film are just about flawless with Jane Darwell contributing one of the great performances in the history of cinema with a tour de force in her portrayal of Ma Joad. Ford's direction is absolutely outstanding in his achievements in setting the perfect tone and mood with great lighting, visuals, sounds and art direction. The only thing keeping me from giving the film a 10 out of 10 is the slightly inconsistent performance by Henry Fonda as Tom. Overall it was a wonderful performance but there were times when it seemed to me like he was hitting the wrong notes. If I were allowed to give the film a 9.8 I would but I just couldn't quite give it a 10.

The characters performances were powerful and inspiring. The Grapes of Wrath is an unquestionably beautiful and spiring - yet educational - film at the same time.

The exploitation of the poor and working classes, man's inhumanity to man. History repeats itself, this time not in California but in China. We buy the cheap goods but forget the slave labor conditions that the peasants of these third world countries work under. Sorry I digress.

312,6 April 2011,sushifish55,9, Great film that does justice to the novel,"When I say this I don't mean in the sense of how accurately the film follows Steinbeck's novel; the film starts to stray from the books story around halfway through the movie. What I mean is the film is great on it's own and ,unlike most film adaptations of books, this movie kept most of the others message intact. The key difference I found was that the book was much sadder. I know it's hard to believe seeing how depressing this movie was but their were many things the director chose not to show. The biggest difference was in the endings. The film leaves you with some since of optimism for these people, the novel does no such thing. The book leaves you with Rosasharn giving birth to a stillborn and offering her breast milk to a man dying of starvation. This obviously could have never been shown in theaters during the 1940's and I'm glad for it. I believe it would have been one powerful scene but the book was way to sad to begin with and the film was pretty depressing as well. Currently we could have handled a film like that just fine but back in the 1940's this was some amazingly heavy stuff.

However, it went above and beyond them. The movie really painted a clear picture of everything the book was trying to say. The adaptation from book to film was a work of art in itself. It has such a powerful social message that is really hit home through the way it is directed and the way the actors worked together. Also, I felt that the cinematographer of the film did a wonderful job at capturing the fields and open skies of Oklahoma.

It was very difficult to understand what they were saying at times but that can be blamed on the quality of the cameras at the time.

The cinematography is astonishing especially for a 1940 film and really helps set the mood of each scene. Tom Joad's journey is a captivating adventure, the struggles him and his family face throughout the film and the hardships overcome made me appreciative all the things I'm blessed with. When originally released I can imagine this film had a strong impact on American society because during the great depression many families had gone through similar situation and could relate. Strong acting done by Henry Fonda really helps to create a strong emotional bond to the characters. John Ford definitely did not disappoint in his adaptation of Steinbeck's most powerful story, truly a thought provoking perception on American life around the time of the great depression. A must see for anyone who enjoys classic masterpieces",
318,23 April 2014,Chris042711,8, Historically Reflective and a good work for the early 40's,The grapes of wrath is more than just an entertainment piece. The film reflects the real world struggles of the Great Depression and specifically the devastating effects of the dust bowl. The movie begins innocently enough with a man asking for a ride. We later find out this man has just been released from jail and is on probation. He comes home to an empty house and the news his family has lost his land and thus their source of income and survival and from here the family makes their journey across the county suffering many hardships along the way.,
319,20 March 2012,sloanliam,4, okay...,"If you don't know much about the great depression like i don't, the movie will be a little bit confusing. basically it's about a trucker who picks up an ex convict on the road and then they all hang out with a priest, and have adventures trying to live off the land. It's okay, but it gets pretty boring, up until the convict ends up killing a police officer, which at that point it all goes down hill. don't watch because it will bore you. I personally also think that there was too much tragedy in it. Also i would recommend that you study up on the dust bowl and the great depression. I had to write a review for this so i got it off Hull. as an 8th grader, i wouldn't recommend watching this if you younger than 18. thanks for reading my review.

I have viewed two other John Ford films with this being my least favorite with ""The Man who Shot Liberty Valence"" taking the cake. The acting by Tommy was outstanding and really was intriguing the entire film. To me the character that stood out the most was the mama. She portrayed the lady of the house very well with all the cooking and the cleaning and caring for the family. It was only right that she got rewarded at the end. This film was an alright film but I don't think I would watch it again for fun. In my opinion not one of Ford's best films.",

The story is centered around the family of protagonist Tom Jobe. Tom is reunited with his family after serving a four year prison sentence for killing a guy in a dance hall. Ford has such a fluid style of film making. The viewer becomes a part of the family as they pack into their old truck and head west to California. I find that Ford uses a lot of visual metaphors to convey his ideas. For instance, when a families house is demolished, ford pans down to the shadows of the family cast over the tracks of the tractor. Symbolizing the destruction of their whole life. With each day the situation seems to get worse as the sun goes down, but each day brings a new hope as the sun comes over the horizon.

324,19 January 2023,selenasanchez-01069,8, Great black and white movie,"I would rate this movie an eight out of ten. I really enjoyed it because of how much comedy there was even though it was a movie about the Great Depression. I loved how the car was falling apart every five seconds, how the grandfather was going insane, and how they reacted to different situations. It was hilarious when the grandmother died in the car and how the people only found out when they pointed a bright flashlight directly at her face. It was also funny in the beginning of the movie when they were hiding in the bushes, probably only fifteen feet from the police and the police couldn't find them. The police didn't even take their job seriously, they only threw a rock at the window and asked if there was anyone there and just left. I also really liked how the movie was set in the time period they were in, so we were able to see what the people looked like back then. They most likely did not have any errors in how it was like during that time, so I enjoyed seeing how raw it was. The actors and actresses most likely went through something like that as well, not their farms getting taken away, but the sadness of the Great Depression. This probably helped them act better in the movie because they understood the travesty of it. Most movies that are based off of a certain time period are usually bad because the people who made the movie have not gone through it. The information that they also put in the movie is mostly wrong and they have an inaccurate depiction of what happened. I also liked that they showed how horrible it was when the government forced all the farmers to move out of their farms to go to California. You could see how much grief they went through having known that what their family and ancestors had built up, would get torn apart so easily. Without getting any proper human treatment the government only gave them a day to get packed up and move out of their homes. If someone told me to move out of my home randomly one day and I only had so much time to do it I would be upset too. It is a home that you have spent years of your life or your whole life knowing. Then it gets thrown away practically because you get no profit from moving but a restless lifestyle. Especially if it is a home that has sentimental value and you don't want to get rid of it, plus some people even tried to stand up for themselves. This still didn't work out because everyone was out for themselves and their own benefit. The tractor people did not care if a house was being torn away, they only cared about their own families. I also liked how they showed the family was so untrustworthy when they finally got to the camp. I liked how their characters evolved from being gullible into believing what the government was saying, to processing information and learning from the past what this could mean. I think character growth is important in movies because without it you have nothing to look forward to or anything to be really surprised about. I deducted one point from this movie because it was black and white, which made it unpleasant to the eyes. I also deducted another point because at times I could not understand what they were saying. Sometimes they would say something so quickly I didn't understand a thing and sometimes they just had a strong accent from back in the day.",

I was very pleased with most of the aspects of this movie, except for one major thing; the movie is over two hours long.

Expressing emotion in a restrained fashion, without using overtly emotional words or body language is something I have now come to associate with the B/W Hollywood cinema. But even accounting for that, the emotive quotient of the movie could have been a tad higher. The Joad family cuts across the width of America from Oklahoma to California in a dumpster truck, lock stock and barrel. Poor grandpa doesn't want to leave the earth he grew up in and the earth grants him the wish, albeit in a tragic way as he dies en-route. Grandma follows suit, though much closer to California. Her burial scene is unceremoniously skipped and I found her body getting carried along with live people for so long a little macabre honestly. The kids seem to have no context of the whole situation which is again a bit weird given that the girl is pretty grown up. They are just happy-go-lucky all the time not missing a single thing and not regretting any piece of the journey. Uncle John also doesn't show any character, nor does the pregnant women. In fact, I believe the chief character of the movie is the mother, but she symbolizes the all-too-familiar middle class matriarch much more than a woman from the time and space she is required to represent in the movie. The situations themselves are assumed to be already known to the audience with the screenplay not bothering too much with explaining the details of what is going on. So my verdict - one time watch. Also I am going to read the novel now and I am sure after that I am going to understand the movie more and like it even less.",

The Grapes of Wrath is one of my favorite books and, now, my least favorite films. The sense of deepening dread that carries the Joads from bad to worse in the book is missing, there is no sense of urgency to find work, the casting choices were poor (other than Fonda as Tom Joad), and the music makes it feel like a family just in limbo rather than running for their lives. Key parts of the book that made it into the film are rearranged and this lose their potency. Important characters like Grampa, Granma, Casy, and Rosasharn all fade into the background. Lastly, the most striking images (the book's final two chapters) are left out entirely. Even though I reminded myself before I started the film that movies never live up to the book they are based on, I've never been more disappointed in a film in my whole life.",

Especially the scene where Tom asks Ma to dance with him was very touching in my opinion and I don't remember them having such in the book so that was a great addition.

This movie teaches you what every day life was like for migrant workers. The abuses that ordinary citizens faced everyday just trying to provide food and shelter for their families. Big businesses were profiting millions of dollars while paying workers measly wages and providing no benefits or safety. The film does carry a political tone against big business and anti-regulators.,
359,30 September 2014,shinc-030,7, Average family during the Great Depression endures many hardships,"So much for a story about fruit, The Grapes of Wrath is way much more than that! This film may start off quiet and dull, but it leads to a much more action-packed plot! Although different from the original book, the film still does include the major points and the overall themes of the story. The Grapes of Wrath is a story about a poverty stricken family, the Joads, who migrate from their home in Oklahoma to California in search of work and a better life. The main antagonist is poverty which is enhanced in the black and white color settings of the movie. Because it is in only black or white, it is clearly felt and shown the desperation and lack of hope the Joads have. On the entire journey towards California, the family endures every possible trial they could have faced. They lose family members to death and abandonment, suffer from ""persecution"", poverty and hunger, and have a constant breakdown from their run-down truck. However, their determination, along with Ma Joad's eventual leadership, demonstrates one of the major lessons that strength can be found in numbers and with each other. Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad, the protagonist-a man recently released from prison, portrays Tom the way that Tom is supposed to be received. He acts as a caring, yet strong-willed and sometimes reckless youth- which is then shown in Fonda's vibrant facial expressions and motions. All of the actors portray their roles with an enthusiasm that is then proved in the accurate representation of the characters. Although many times, there is a small form of hope throughout the book, viewers never expect that The Grapes of Wrath will have a happy ending. The film did not include the intercalary chapters from the book but enough foreshadowing is presented allowing us to know that it is a moral story with no satisfying end. Overall, this film is mind captivating forcing readers to think about life in many aspects, and reconsider decisions made. It teaches important values and how to have faith in times of hardships.",
