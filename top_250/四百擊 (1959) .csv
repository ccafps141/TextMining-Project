0,20 September 2004,FilmOtaku,8, One of the shining stars of the French New Wave,"Every day life, however 'real' and gritty it may be, is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950's. In Europe however, there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the 'here and now'. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950's  films that explored the filmmaker's surroundings, and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows' is one of the most well-known films of this movement, and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.",/
1,20 May 2006,EUyeshima,9, Deserved Truffaut Classic Benefits Significantly from Criterion's New DVD Package,"As the seminal work of the French New Wave, the 1959 directorial debut of 27-year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However, the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It's worth seeing twice - once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut's childhood friend Robert Lachenay (the true-life inspiration for Rene in the film). Speaking in French but subtitled in English, he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison, listen to the by-the-numbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill (recorded back in 1992), which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.",r
2,2 April 2001,zetes,10, Perfection,"I first saw this film around three or four years ago for the first time. I had watched it late at night, and I was very sleepy after it ended. I was rather ambivalent towards it. To tell you the truth, I don't know whether I had even heard of it before I rented it. And I don't even remember if it was my first film by Francois Truffaut, either. I have seen two others, The Green Room, which I didn't like all that much, and Shoot the Piano Player, which I loved. My guess would be that I saw The Green Room first, then looked up what else Francois Truffaut had made, and which ones were considered his better films.",e

7,5 August 2001,dbdumonteil,4, Living a wild life,"This film  aka  ""the four hundred blows"" is a mistranslation.Faire les 400 coups"" means""to live a wild life. As a French,I'm stunned when I see the popularity of this good ,but by no means outstanding film. 1.It's not the first film of the ""nouvelle vague"" move;check Agnes Varda's ""la pointe courte"",(1956)Alain Resnais's ""Hiroshima mon amour""(1958),Claude Chabrol's ""le beau serge""(1958) are anterior .Historically,""les 400 coups "" comes after. 2.The ""nouvelle vague"" was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors:Overnight,Julien Duvivier,Henri-George Clouzot,Claude Autant-Lara ,Yves allégret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion.THis selfishness and this contempt is typically ""nouvelle vague"".You 've never heard (or read) the great generation of the thirties (Renoir,Carné,Grémillon,Duvivier already,Feyder) laugh at ,say,Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder.So,thanks to Truffaut and co,some people will never discover some gems of the French fifties or forties(Duvuvier's ""sous le ciel de Paris"",Autant-Lara's ""douce"",Yves Allégret's ""une si jolie petite plage "" and ""manèges"").THe novelle vague clique went as far as saying that William Wyler,Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless! 3.""Les 400 coups "" is technically rather disappointing:it's very academic ,the story is as linear as it can be,the teachers are caricatures,and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as (you've got to be a French circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous  it is): Well ,your father 's got only his brevet (junior school diploma)and,as for me ,I've got only my high school diploma!You've got to know,that circa 1960,hardly 10%of the pupils had the HSD in France! Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!She wants him to have diplomas,who can blame her? 4.Compared to the innovations of ""Hiroshima mon amour"",which features a brand new form,and a new ""fragmented "" content,""les 400 coups "" pales into significance.Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior ""Jules and Jim"", helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau. 5.The interpretation is rather stiff;Jean-Pierre Léaud ,arguably listenable when dubbed in English ,is still decent,but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation. 6.The topic=stolen childhood  had better days,before (Julien Duvivier's ""Poil de carotte"" ,Luis Bunuel's ""los olvidados"") and will have after (Maurice Pialat's ""l'enfance nue"",Kenneth Loach's ""Kes"") I do not want to demean Truffaut,his movie is not bad,but,frankly,French movie buffs,prefer ""Jules and Jim"" ""l'enfant sauvage"" (a film honest ,true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)""l'argent de poche""(as academic as ""400 coups"" but much more funny)or his nice Hitchcock pastiche ""vivement dimanche"".",/

Inspired by the director's childhood, The 400 Blows (Truffaut's first film) is primarily about a young boy growing up with his mother and stepfather in Paris and apparently heading into a life of crime. Most adults see the boy as a troublemaker, but in the film, he is meant to be the protagonist.",2

As Joyce advised, ""Wipe your glosses with what you know."" There are only two cautions to be observed. One is that your first story, about yourself, doesn't turn you into a moral paragon. The second is that, having gotten that initial material out of your system, you have the industry and talent to go on to other things -- not necessarily less personal, but less heavily invested. Truffaut managed to rise well above his beginnings.",8

It is a magnet - wherever you go you move towards it - and a totem.  ",6
13,4 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, A masterpiece of French cinema,"Francois Truffaut makes his feature debut with this French masterpiece; the story is largely autobiographical but also shows a grim and authentic of troubled adolescence. The film is very well made considering how mere the budget was at the time, the cinematography and scenery are both striking and throughout you can see influences to Jean Vigo, Jean Renoir and Italian neoralism. The music just adds to the atmosphere, the direction is superb and the finale is very audacious. The writing is thoughtful and poignant, and this film boasts a superb lead performance. Jean-Pierre Leaud conveys both mischief and vulnerability in his role, and he does so effortlessly. All in all, c'est magnifique! 10/10 Bethany Cox",0
14,13 December 2003,claudio_carvalho,9, The Lost of the Childhood in a Landmark of the Nouvelle Vague,"Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is a fourteen years old boy rejected by his mother and his stepfather, who gave him his name. This lack of affection in his home makes him a rebel, bad student, liar, reckless and stealing objects and money at home. This movie was the first one directed by François Truffault and is a landmark of the Nouvelle Vague, a French style of making films initiated by Truffault and Godard. This movement has produced low budget, but high quality movies, using a small crew, hand camera and free screenplay, with lots of creation and improvisation. The character Antoine is the alter-ego of Truffault. His crimes, watched in the Twentieth-First Century, are minors, but in 1959 were much serious. It is a very good movie, recommended for those who indeed loves cinema. My vote is nine.",1
15,20 December 2019,christopher-underwood,6, one of the most extraordinary and wondrous scenes I have ever seen.,"There is within this film one of the most extraordinary and wondrous scenes I have ever seen. For no particular reason (like much of the film) there is suddenly the depiction of a puppet show of Little Red Riding Hood with a very large audience of children. We cut between the violent action and the children's faces as they watch. Spellbound, we see them giggling as children do, then looking frightened, then relieved but then perplexed and turning to their friends, then themselves spellbound by the magical scenes and scared and amused and relieved all over again. The force of the feeling that we are truly relating to the kids before us is for the brief duration of the minute or so of celluloid is amazing. One wishes, of course that the rest of the film was the same. There are other sequences of note but for the most part I was so uninterested in the various activities of stupid children and even more stupid adults that my exasperation was almost too painful to endure as the stupidity of the institutions is finally revealed. Never a fan of Truffault I was prompted to see this (for the first time!) after seeing the boy in the lead, Jean-Pierre Leaud who I had watched recently as an adult play film director in Olivier Assayas' Irma Vep (1996). Not sure I should have bothered.",6

Finally, at the end of the movie, Doinel escapes from a seaside cottage and runs out to the shore, and an ambiguous future.",/
18,8 May 2017,Vartiainen,5, To face the struggles of life without the needed experience to deal with them,"One of the defining films of its director François Truffaut as well as the French New Wave movement.

19,23 October 2004,paul2001sw-1,8, Waving in the new cinema,"In general, it's very rare to see a film made before 1970 or so that offers a convincing picture of everyday life. Which makes this film by Francois Truffaut, dating from as early as 1959, all the more impressive. 'The Four Hundred Blows' is simply remarkable, with its naturalistic dialogue (laced with black humour) supplemented by the very subtle musical score (also a rarity in films of this vintage), imaginative camera work and an incidental construction that have set the template for just about every notable piece of cinematic realism made since. The point is that ""naturalism"" does not come naturally; and Truffaut was light years ahead of his peers in imagining how a portrait of the real world (and the feelings of its inhabitants) might be created. Having re-watched one of my favourite films recently, Shane Meadows 1999 effort 'A Room for Romeo Brass', another story of troubled boys in dysfunctional families, I find myself amazed how much more in common 'The Hundred Blows' has with that film than with its contemporaries.",r

The tale is about an unhappy young boy with strict parents who finds himself getting into trouble at school and falls into a life of petty crime as a result. It's a film that utilises humour to off-set the darker moments of the screenplay, and it's very well acted throughout with naturalistic performances from the main players. The film as a whole is realistic and heartfelt, with real character depth rather than needless sentiment.",f

23,10 September 2009,Hitchcoc,10, Wonderfully Understaated,"Twenty-five years have passed since I last saw this film. I remember my fascination with this snotty boy who skipped school, showed disdain for authority, and made a general nuisance of himself. Those questions are still there but the answers are a little easier. Truffaut didn't go for the over-dramatic. He showed the day to day activities of a person who felt disconnected from a goal or place in life. He has disdain for his parents though they aren't all that horrible. His mother is sleeping around and he knows it. His father is an ineffectual boob who is terribly in love with the woman who really doesn't have any respect for him. They treat the boy OK. When they are angry with him they are probably justified. He is getting a good education and he is ""betraying"" them. ",=
24,22 February 2005,CUDIU,10, pure poetry,"No doubt, this is a masterpiece. There are at least two unforgettable sequences in this movie. The first is the puppet show, with those children's faces looking at the stage, quite out of anything that can be expressed by words... being so childish and perfectly baby-like, but at the same time so desperately resembling to the faces of us, adult spectators of movies and life. A second, extraordinary moment is the final encounter of the boy Doinel with the ocean, at the end of the movie. Out of the school-jail where they have sent him, he runs through the French countryside until he finds this long beach. When he finally reaches the water, he gives that sudden and unexpected look into the camera... that is when the movie ends, and we can't help being pervaded by a full, cosmic empathy with Antoine Doinel. Thank you Mr Truffaut.",t

26,30 April 2019,elicopperman,8, Childhood Opposition towards Authority,"In the late 1950s, France began to resurface in popularity with cinema thanks to the innovative French New Wave. With so many films coming out from creative minds who started off as critics, these films would be lauded for their unique editing tricks, stone cold tones, and long panning scenes that detail a character's actions for as long as needed. One of the most well known auteurs during this time was Francois Truffaut, who made his debut sixty years ago with The 400 Blows. In addition to being a revolutionary film about a rebel child going against his authority, this feature marks the first appearance of Truffaut's alter ego Antoine Doinel, a character he would use in a few other works later on in his career. As they always say, create what you're familiar with, especially if the protagonist is based off of you.",_
27,19 August 2019,Horst_In_Translation,4," Not a blow in the face, but could have been a better movie for sure","""Les quatre cents coups"" or ""The 400 Blows"" is a French black-and-white film almost exclusively in the French language toothat was originally released back in 1959, so it has its 60th anniversary this year. And even if it was written and directed by Francois Truffaut, one of France's most known, I am a bit surprised that it was seen and rated by so many people here on imdb as it is not too far away from the 100k amount. Anyway it probably also has to do with the high rating and maybe to a lesser extent that Truffaut's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar and lead actor Léaud at a really tender age scored a BAFTA breakthrough nomination losing out to the recently deceased Albert Finney. Anyway, it runs for 100 minutes approximately and takes us into the life of Antoine Doinel, a boy who is not getting the love he is seeking from his mother or stepdad and as a consequence ends up doing some stupid stuff. Nothing too serious honestly, so the film is not really about the main character messing up, but the circumstances around him being so messed up. He confirms that he does not love his mother and things are probably not too different with how she handed him to her own mother during his early years and near the end the meeting between the two at the corrective facility is really telling because clearly the closeness between them is missing completely and it is a really cold situation emotionally despite the woman not having seen her son for a while. She also does not mind pushing annother disappointment into his son's face right away when she tells him that his ""father"" could not come. Luck is also a major component here. When the boy decides to skip school without telling anybody and fake a doctor's note, he runs into hiw mother making out with another man, which certainly did not make things better between the two. But this situation alone shows how messed up their entire existence is and there is probably no lovely happy ending to be expected. So the ending is as happy as it could be I suppose with the boy running away from the facility and at least he gets to see the sea, something his mother stated actually earlier and it is clear that she is not entirely indifferent towards him. Also obvious during the scene when his stepdad is really mad at him because of the fire incident and still you could argue she stands a bit up for her son there because she is scared of him saying something about the affair, but I think it is not just that. There is affection from her for her son, but real love probably not.",u
28,25 April 2006,ppw3o6r,10, An intense emotional journey of one boy's early life,"This film is one of the greatest I have ever seen. It depicts some events in the life of Antoine Doinel, a young French boy who gets into a lot of trouble no matter what he does. This was the first film by Francois Truffaut, and I believe that it is filmed with such an innocence that you can really feel some of the emotions that Antoine feels. I love the simple style of this film, and I think it adds to its charm. The story is can even be painful to watch as one sees all of the things that happen to Antoine. I think that the reason for the strong emotions embedded in this film is that it is semi-autobiographical. I think the cinema is what rescued Truffaut from a life like his protagonist.In short, an inspiration to all filmmakers-they DEFINITELY don't make them like this anymore!",r
29,15 January 2006,planktonrules,8, very good but not great,"I have seen this movie twice. The first time, I thought it was an okay picture. However, because it is such an important French New Wave film and had a big impact on future projects and because so much positive stuff has been written about it, I thought I'd give it another try. Well, it did improve some with the second watching--particularly since I have also seen the rest of the ""Antoine Doinel"" films. But, was it ""great"",...not really, though it still was a very very good film. There is very little negative about it other than the occasionally poor sound track. As many New Wave films are supposed to have a ""home-made"" quality about them, much of the time this wasn't a problem. But, there were times when the amateurish quality of the music was distracting. Also, a smaller complaint was the abrupt ending, though this is only a small complaint since the director returned to his alter-ego in follow-up films. When all seen together, now THAT is a fascinating thing-and something I recommend you try to do if you see ""The 400 Blows"".",v
30,8 July 2001,caspian1978,8, Truffaut's story of youth,"The opening sequence is filmed the perspective of a child. The low angles looking up in the downtown city in France shows the audience that it is the views of the world scene through the eyes of a child. Powerful, strong, and correct, the opening sets the stage for the story. Like the start if the film, the end is just as powerful. The freeze frame of Antoine looking into the camera makes the audience uncomfortable. It is over, but is it the end. Is Antoine happy? Is he sad? He is tired from running, he has come a long way in both the run and from the start of the film, no emotion except for being tired, he could not fit in any of the societies offered to him. He is left alone on the edge of the world with a choice he has to answer for himself.",
31,16 November 2020,SumanShakya,7, Not a timeless classic as hyped but still good....,"Watching ""The Bicycle Thieves"" earlier this year, the same expectation was made through this French classic as both had child artists in its center and both explored Europe in the post War era. ""The 400 Blows"" is on disturbed childhood which resorts to petty crimes following the indifference from the parents. It delves into child psychology and remains engaging for most of the time. It is highly structured in its narration with a nice flow maintained aside a beautiful portrayal of Paris streets it captures.",
32,24 May 2002,DennisLittrell,9, Sympathetic and engaging,"An idiomatic translation of the French title of this movie, Les quatre cents coup, would be something like ""Raising Hell,"" understood ironically. Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel, played very winningly by Jean-Pierre Leaud, doesn't suffer ""400 blows,"" although he does get mistreated quite a bit, and he doesn't mean to raise hell or to be a problem to his parents or society. He's just a boy being a boy. Unfortunately his mother (Claire Mauier), who is more like a wicked step-mother than the boy's biological mother (although she is that) would like to be rid of him so that she can spend more time pursuing her hobby, which is adultery. His cuckolded step-father (Albert Remy) is no help, although he seems to care more for the boy than his mother. And the institutions of society, as represented by his school, the Parisian police, and the social services people, seem intent on turning poor Antoine into a criminal. Truffaut ends the movie at a spot where it is still far from clear where Antoine is really headed, but we can guess that his spirit will be undaunted.",
33,12 September 1999,MarioB,9, One of the best of all time,"French moviemakers have always really great with children. From the 1930's (Poil de carotte) to the 1960's (Guerre des boutons) or more recently (Le Petit Prince a dit, 1992), childs in French movies seems always realists, themselves. They don't act like little adults or stupid human beings. Les 400 Coups is sure the best picture ever made with a child. It's also the first movie of master Truffaut and probably his best work, along with Jules et Jim.  But Truffaut will have a very bad idea after that: make other films with the same kid growing up, become an adult.  The problem is that Leaud will grown up to be a pretty bad actor.  He's great in this movie, probably because he never think, at that time, that he will become an actor.  I love everything in the movie, but I have a little preference for the scene where the little kids look at a puppet show. Their faces are amazing!",

Truffaut transfers his unhappy childhood memories on to the big screen with almost an effortless appearance. But make no mistake, great care and preparation went into every shot and scene. We see an unhappy young boy who has trouble at home, trouble in school, and trouble adjusting to his miserable life. Who wouldn't have trouble under those circumstances? These are the 400 blows that must be overcome in life; and sometimes it is more than 400. Truffaut overcame them, and it is the knowledge of this reality that gives many hope for their futures, even though their current situations are unfortunate.",

This is the sixth Francois Truffaut film I've seen and i can't wait to see the rest of his films. I could just describe the plot here but if you don't already know about it, it would be better if you just watched it without knowing anything about it. This movie was dedicate to Andre Bazin, a film critic who died in 1959 and also helped Truffaut when he deserted the military. I would say this movie is better than Shoot the Piano player, Truffaut's follow up film to this one. I had read somewhere that this movie was autobiographical for the director.

46,29 October 2006,raaesquire,10, Truffaut's Bulls-eye,"The 400 Blows is a film that every teenager must see. When I was 14 (Antonie's age in the film I suppose), I hated everything. I hated school, I hated living with my parents, and I didn't want to be subordinate to society on the whole. To put it simply, I wanted to just get out there and live my life instead of being picked on by school teachers and essentially be an outcast amongst my peers, who were spoiled rich white males thinking with their you know whats instead of their brains. Antonie Doinel is a character who used his mind and what did he get? He was sent to reform school. He possesses the traits of every average adolescent male. He wants to expand his mind (he reads Balzac), doesn't do his work, riles up the teacher, doesn't really get along with his parents (although his father seems to have more vested interest in the boy), defaces classroom walls, and looks at and defaces pinups. Quite simply, his character is one of the most complex to ever be created.",

To put it more precisely it was the first film of a ""Nouvelle vague"" director. Seen nowadays the film is much less innovative than for example Jean Luc Godard's ""Breatless"" from the next year. More in general the ""Nouvelle vague"" directors are in my opinion more connected with each other being ex colleagues of the film periodical ""Cahiers du Cinema"" than being a stylistically homogeneous group. There are great differences between directors such as Jean Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Louis Malle and Francois Truffaut. By the way for Francois Truffaut the Cannes festival of 1959 was a complete victory. A year earlier he was banned as an unwelcome, too critical, film journalist and now as director he received the grand prize.",

Sometimes these works are just self-indulgent ways for their creators to exorcise their personal demonsand sometimes, like Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows,"" they go far beyond that. This movie allows those of us who were never young hellraisers like Truffaut or his protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) to understand him and discover the universality of his story. The way that Antoine's family alternates between loudly arguing and pretending that everything is happy is very recognizable. So is the way that Antoine is stuck somewhere between childhood and adolescence and expected to take responsibility for his actions, even though the adults' rules don't make sense.",

Truffaut was a troubled youth and (like many of us) used his love of cinema as an escape, and to provide hope for his future.

That's pretty much what I got out of this movie. There was excellent, whimsical acting by all the cast (mostly out of the kids in the classroom), great direction on little nuances that the lead boy, Antoine, felt like doing, and excellent cinematography showing the depth of where poor choices can lead you (and oppositely, the grandeur of the openness of hope in a stress-free society).

Don't believe so but you could convince me if you tried) because Truffaut has the confidence in what the moving image can do that he can show us how Antoine behaves. I think that's the key thing to this film and why that dedication to Andre Bazin is, for what it's worth, earned as far as what Bazin was all about as a critic as a proponent of the Neo-Realist movement in Italy and elsewhere, and his lessons the Cashiers critics took to heart.",
55,24 March 2009,jzappa,10," An Unadorned, Pure and Personal Debut Feature for Francois Truffaut","This unadorned, pure and personal debut feature is one of the most profoundly relatable tales ever made about a young adolescent, because we can all identify with it to some extent. It shows the defenselessness of being a kid. Nothing you do necessarily sobers an adult. Influenced by Truffaut's own early life, it shows an able boy growing up in Paris and seemingly diving foolhardy into a life of crime. Adults see him as an agent provocateur. We are afforded some of his personal time alone, as when he lights a candle before a small tribute mausoleum to Balzac in his bedroom. The film's famous final shot, a zoom in to a freeze frame, shows him looking straight into the camera. He has a comparable countenance at other times in the film, which is shot in black and white in Paris in a frigid season. He always has the collar of his jacket unfolded against the wind. Antoine and his delinquent friend have so much character in their young faces, and that is perhaps the most immediate force behind the final shot.",

This young boy is Antoine Doinel, (Jean-Pierre Leaud) who is a rather rebellious young man in school and causes all kinds of problems with his teachers. Antoine steals money from his parents, skips school and pals around with his friends who are not much better than he is. This young man proceeds to almost burn his apartment house down and is constantly hearing his father and mother fighting among each other. One day, Antoine cuts school and sees his mother kissing passionately another man on a Paris street. This story clearly shows what can happen to a child who is not really loved and has mental problems trying to fit into society and has no ambitions to better himself in life and is always looking for any easy way out of the routine of living. There is lots of laughs in this film and some very sad and heart breaking events that continue to drive Antoine to a complete dead end.",
57,1 August 2005,raymond-15,8, Little humorous touches shine with nostalgic brilliance.,It's those little extra touches that make Truffaut's work rather special and so appealing. The film depicts memories of school life in the early part of last century. A frustrated schoolmaster bellows at an unruly classroom as he seeks to maintain discipline and the schoolboys mimic him behind his back. Antoine (Jeanne-Pierre Leaud)seems to be the unfortunate one who always gets caught and is punished accordingly. I was surprised to find that the schoolmaster did not resort to physical violence.

(1959, French, R, 94 min Directed and co-written by François Truffaut with Jean-Pierre Léaud, Claire Maurier, Albert Rémy). `The Four Hundred Blows' is idiomatic French for raising hell.  Which I found to be a strange title after someone explained the meaning.  No one in this movie is really raising hell nor forcing hell on others.  Antoine Doinel (Léaud) is a 14 year-old Parisian boy and a superficial view of his life is not idyllic but hardly hellish. His mom (Maurier) isn't the most attentive person in the world.  She is busy with a lot of things besides being a mom.  She has a lover, a fact about his mom that isn't a point of pride with Antoine.  Antoine has a stepfather (Rémy).  Again, not the most attentive of parents.  Antoine isn't a good student.  All in all it's not the easiest of lives but nothing worth raising hell about.  And the hell he raises, isn't that big a deal.  He skips school.  He gets caught stealing a typewriter.  (Actually he gets caught returning the typewriter when he finds out he can't fence it.)  Antoine ends up in a reformatory and escapes, ending up on the shores of the North Sea. In what has become a relatively famous scene from French cinema, Antoine turns back from the sea and looks straight into the camera. ",

A documentary-like work otherwise, this movie does what I most admire about movies: immerse us with different lives, times, and places. So, first, this quality in the '400 blows' predominates and accentuates the rest of the movie to germane sensitivity; from there the plot takes over and we delve into the lives of a small middle-class family, and the main character among the three family members--the boy. Indeed, the astute social critique leaves the viewer with long lasting impressions. But the boy's plight will ever remain the single most potent symbol in my memory of the vindication, liberty, freedom, and inevitable alienation humans undergo in their lives.

The characters are easy to understand and relate to, the story as well. Nothing wrong there. However, it was mostly the way the film was shot that ruined it for me. It's full of long, metaphoric, unimportant shots that really just confused me rather than appealed to me. I often wondered just when is Truffaut going to end this overly-long shot, not out of suspense but out of frustrated boredom. Overall it's a simple, sad story that will leave you sad and confused. I respect it for it's craftsmenship, but it's not even remotely entertaining or thought-provoking. I'm sure people would accuse me for being shallow, but this is an honest opinion and I have studied and read about this film. I have thought much about it, and I'm still of the same opinion.",

Antoine Doinel is an example of a kid who, on the surface, has a stable home life – with a roof over his head, a decent school, and parents who look out for him, albeit with them sometimes taking turns as one or another is often out at night. However, as the movie progresses, we get glimpses of just how difficult the young man's life is – his mother's infidelity, overheard arguments, and their careless comments. The way Truffaut slowly reveals the details is masterful, which is all the more impressive given this was the director's first film. ",

A remarkable feature-length debut from the revered critic-turned-director, Truffaut's touching and funny portrait of juvenile angst proved one of the pioneering films in the French New Wave. Just a few days ago, I decided to attend my university's film society for a showing of the film, but, inconceivably and unforgivably, the screening was started a full thirty minutes into the picture, and, due to a wearisome technical fault, we missed a further ten minutes in the centre of the story, including the moment when young Antoine reveals himself to have never seen the ocean, a remark that proves extremely significant once we arrive at the conclusion.",

73,11 January 2005,ACitizenCalledKane,10, The beginning of a new age in world cinema!,"The beauty of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows is not found in terms of its technical merit (even though, in technical terms, it is still a brilliant piece), but in the heart and soul of the film, the shear love with which it was made. Truffaut said time and time again that the cinema saved his life, and you get the impression that the only way he felt he could repay his sanctuary was by committing himself to it. He did so in many ways! Not only did the auteur commit his time to movies, by being a lover of film and a critic, he soon became a director, producing this inspired masterpiece. Perhaps, that is what makes it a masterpiece. The film truly is inspired; inspired by Truffaut's life, his passion for cinema, and his theories about how films should be created. The result is amazing! Antoine Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, is a misunderstood young boy, trying to keep his head above water, despite being caught up in what seems to be a predestined downward spiral. His teacher and his parents do not trust him, and he knows this. Seeing no trust to betray, he does whatever he can to try to compensate for how miserable he is treated. His mother (Claire Maurier) is busy working and trying to be a housewife, despite an affair she is having with another man. His father (Albert Remy) seems nice enough, but loses his temper when he is disappointed in the young man. Because of an already-existent lack of trust the parents have for their son, everything he does is perceived as wrong. No one ever takes the time (not his parents, certainly not his despicable teacher) to actually look at the boy, to determine whether there is any malice in his actions, or if he is simply a misguided little boy, searching for something he cannot describe or define. This is Truffaut's gift - He allows us to look through the screen, to see this young man, to study him, maybe for only one hundred minutes, but we are given the time to see the truth in this child that few probably ever saw in the young, tormented Truffaut. To miss this film is to deprive yourself of a rare cinematic experience!",

This film is the one that made the 'French New Wave' movement famous all around the world. This movement revolved around the internalisation of a confluence of influences and then the execution of something unique, real and personal with the help of those influences as well as new revolutionary ideas. While watching 'The 400 Blows' one can see the dedication to realism in terms of shooting on location which can be found in Italian neo-realism, one can find a fluidity in the camera movement that is reminiscent of Hitchcock and Max Ophüls, one can find the precise use of lighting to make the shadows prominent in certain scenes similar to film-noir or German expressionism, one can also find a bit of poetic realism reminiscent of Renoir and Satyajit Ray. But François Truffaut elevates the film from being a merely experimental piece of work paying homage to his influences to a greatly touching piece of work through the tender treatment of characters, intimate exploration of themes and expressive editing techniques which make his film as personal as can be.",

78,16 January 2006,randeclip-1,9, Still relevant today,"Upon first seeing the Francois Truffaut film 400 Blows, I was struck with the thought that this film was either designed to scar children away from a life of crime or just a social commentary on juvenile delinquency in Paris in the early fifties. This film is neither. Truffaut's main goal in making this film was to show the uncontrollable downward spiral of one boy. We are shown this through the boy ""Antoine"" eyes. Whether reflected in multiple mirrors at his mom's vanity or from the bottom of a spinning carnival ride, it is his view and perspective of the world that we see. The adult world is conspicuously absent except for the occasional villain or incompetent who happens to pass through Antoine's life. This film is shocking today, with our modern views on decency and political correctness. It was not designed to shock its audiences at the time. The idea of a child being disposable is a lost concept in today's world. The end of the film is especially important in the fact that Antoine, alone on the beach, could be interpreted as having reached his end. He has, throughout the film, sunk lower and lower no matter how hard he tried to better himself. By the end, we are led to believe he has reached his end, both figuratively and literally. My feeling is that instead of despair, he is faced with hope. The beach represents not an end but beginning, and one of limitless possibilities and a chance to begin again. This film is a timeless story of hope and the possibilities of redemption. Truffaut's style is modern and creative for its time. He stays away from stylized techniques that would have only dated this film. If this film was in color, I feel that an audience of today would have a hard time differentiating 400 Blows from a modern movie.",
79,1 November 2012,jboothmillard,6, The 400 Blows,"This film was naturally one I knew nothing about from its recommendation in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I was hoping of course knowing that and seeing critics give it five out of five stars that it would live it to this good reputation, from director François Truffaut (Jules et Jim). Basically twelve year old Antoine Doinel (BAFTA nominated Jean-Pierre Léaud) is the boy growing up in Paris during the early 1950's, misunderstood by his parents at home and at school tormented by his insensitive French teacher (Guy Decomble), and to get away from both these problems he frequently runs away. He finally decides to quit school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarism, and to finance his plans to leave home and get away from everything he steals the typewriter from his father Julien (Albert Rémy), but when he finds out he has his son arrested. Antoine spends the night in the police cell locked up with prostitutes, thieves and hardened criminals, and being interviewed by a judge his mother Gilberte Doinel (Claire Maurier) confesses that Julien is not the boy's biological father. This causes the young man to be placed with other troubled children in an observation centre near the shore, this is his mother's wish, and his unhappiness is brought out during his probing by a psychiatrist, and we see these troubles told in fragmented monologues. Antoine is then one day playing football with the boys in the centre, and under the fence he manages to escape and reach the ocean, which he had always wanted to visit through his life, and the film freezes and zooms on the face of the boy as he looks directly into the camera. Also starring Patrick Auffay as René Bigey and Georges Flamant as Mr. Bigey. Young Léaud gives a very good performance as the boy who runs away from the things he hates and causes trouble for others, it is an interesting choice for the debut film for director Truffaut as it is very close to autobiographical, I admit that I couldn't fully agree with the five out of five star rating from the critics as at times it could be complicated and I couldn't follow it, but as a film I can see it is a most worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Good, in my opinion!",

It is charming enough, although seems for the most part to have all the emotional impact of a haddock. The central character, Doinel, is played well, and is likeable, but hardly a master criminal, and certainly doesn't descend into the life of violence the tag-lines would have you believe. Good acting, stylish direction and likeable characters aren't enough to classify this as a masterpiece though. As coming of age dramas go, this is hardly groundbreaking. I didn't dislike the film, it simply failed to grab me. I sympathised with Doinel, and found him to be an enjoyable character, although his story seemed to fumble along with very little meaning or direction. If you are looking for groundbreaking, Los Olvidados is more ""punchy"", and states its case far better. Not being from France in the late 50's it is difficult to say exactly how realistic this is, though I am guessing it is pretty accurate for the time. It's certainly worth checking out, but ultimately it is overhyped, and falls short of the expectation one is given.

The English translation of the title unfortunately doesn't reflect the ambiguity which is prevalent in French, where the idiom ""quatre cents coups (du diable)"" refers to ""impish pranks"" or ""pieces of mischief"" and beatings at the same time. The emphasis does not lie on the latter in the original intention, thus setting the picture in a better context. Be it as it may: Being the first feature of Truffaut after having started out as a film critic, he knows exactly what he wants to do with the material, and it shows as he embraces realism in Paris of the 50s and 60s - real life, everyday people, situations as they happen, right until the minuscule details.",

But now I have understood the cause of it. It is not only the greatness of Truffaut, excellent photography of Anri Decaee, charming musical score of Jean Constantine, performance of wonderful children Jean-Pierre Leaud and Patrick Auffray. All these were not enough. But, in addition to these qualities of the movie, I had a strong feeling of identification with Antoine, and that identification had come because many facts and events of my childhood were coinciding with what had happened with him. Even surroundings of my childhood was almost the same - not in Paris, but in one of the greatest capital cities.

95,19 January 2005,laelia123,3," Maybe good if you study film, otherwise very boring","This movie bewilders me. It may be that I'm just a stupid American, but I really just don't get 400 Blows. Everything I've read about this movie has been a total rave, but I just couldn't stay interested. I'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say, but when it boils right down to it, it's just really really boring. Maybe it's the language barrier, may I'm just not ""sensitive"" or ""artsy"" enough, but whatever the case is, I hated this movie. The story itself isn't bad; it's about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers, and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. That in itself ought to be interesting, and it was, at first. There was nothing wrong with the dialogue, but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason, so I didn't always know what was going on. But for the dialogue we could understand, it made enough sense. The actors were believable enough, but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. So you feel for the main character, but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think, well that sucks. The plot isn't even your typical plot. Each time he gets in trouble, he gets into more trouble than the last time, but the reasons never vary too much. And through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it. So it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. The ending, by the way, was completely over my head. It's way too artsy for me, and I just didn't get it. Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. The structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn out. For the amount of dialogue and significant moments, the movie could have been an hour shorter. It just didn't end. Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots, none of which were especially memorable; for example, the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. Now, I'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere, but for the average viewer, I'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running, like doing my laundry, or taking a nap. ",
96,21 February 2009,Merodoc,10, A mesmerizing début for Truffaut,"Voilàthe New Wave has reached the shore. At times dazzling and tragic, Francois Truffaut's bleak look at French society and juvenile delinquents is markedly different than other films of the era. While some directors were looking outward at America or making edgy films, Truffaut explores the interior life of Antoine Doinel. Antoine Doinelplayed by Jean-Pierre Léaud, who reprises this role in later Truffaut filmsis a misbehaving boy. At school, he is caught passing a lewd photo of a woman. He is without remorse, playing tricks behind the teacher's class (played by Guy Decomble from Melville's ""Bob le Flambeur""). He is the class clown in a rigid school where any malfeasance is not tolerated. The schoolteacher pauses his lesson and says, ""Poor France, what a future!"" When he skips school one day with co-conspirator and sidekick René, he sees his mother kissing a man. This man is not her husband. She sees him, he definitely sees her, and the two scurry away. A jazzy score quickens the melancholy pace of the film, matching the mood and pulse of Paris quite nicely. It's not a stretch to assign this film social critique status. At two points in the film, teachers lead children on forced exercise walks on the streets. In pairs of two, the children break apart from the group unbeknownst to the teacher until none remain. Truffauta rebel who created Doinel as a two parts himself one part his friendsis poking fun at the establishment. The nation's futureits childrenare rebelling against the rigidity and discipline of their elders, the teachers. It's not loud, it's not overt, but it is happening steadily. This tension between the older generation and the younger generation defined the New Wave directors and drives this film. Understandably, many critics think this film champions cause célèbre of sortsthe severity with which juvenile delinquents are treated. I tend to agree. Doinel is sent away without so much as a fair seat at the table. He is mixed in with petty thieves and worse. The plot of the film is irrelevant. Doinel cannot sit still because he yearns for adventure and cheap thrillsarcade, movies, 'Gravitron' rideand his truant behavior catches up with him. Eventually, he is shipped away to a reform school where he is to straighten up. Doinel is the soul of the film. He is not a bad boy. He is a real boy. Marcel Moussy and Truffaut wanted to paint a more realistic, complex portrait of a boy (with a mind, a heart, and often conflicting emotions), and they have succeeded brilliantly. He knows right from wrong. He just can't be bothered. He sets the table for dinner, then steals money. He gets a thrill out of breaking the rules. But he has a consciencehe can't get the professor's harsh voice out of his head. When Doinel plays hooky, he overhears another woman talking at the bakery about an unwanted child. Doinel pauses to listen, then winces. In some ways, Doinel is the product of his parents. His mother is strict, serious, unwavering. But his fatherwith whom we emphasizeis funny, loose, and proud of Doinel. He knows Doinel stole his Michelin guide, but he would rather hope for the best than outright accuse him. Truffaut has an eye for domesticities and quotidian life. The relationship between his mother and father is similarly strained. Their marriage is so familiar, they are both weary of it. When disputes arise, we see Doinel wrapped in his sleeping blanket on his mattress, listening. The plot quickens when Doinel admits to a shrink that his mother wanted an abortion, and it was his grandmother who convinced her otherwise. The catch: he made up that last bit, and ad-libbed the whole interview. This powerful scenein which Doinel is speaking actually to Truffaut because the actress wasn't availablehas outlived 400 Blows. He fidgets, he shrugs, he uhhsLéaud *is* Doinel. Chilling. Like other films of this era, all shots are taken at real locations. Henri Decea, the cinematographer who is as much of a staple of the New Wave as Truffaut and Godard, provides a revealing capture of a child without seeming condescending, too close, or too far. We are invited into Doinel's world like a silent co-conspirator, a witness to his every act, capture, and punishment. This film is at once marvelous and poignant. Even if you elect not to see the movie (a mistake), you must catch the last scene on YouTube. Doinel has escaped the confines of his reform school, and runs to the sea. The final shot of Doinel is ""as famous as the Odessa steps in Battleship Potempkin, or the snow globe from Citizen Kane"" according to critic Richard Neupart. A must-see for any film major, buff, or appreciator. If you liked this film, you should consider Truffaut's earlier work Les mistons.",

Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" is not only his best work, but the best film I've ever seen. It paints such an accurate view of life; the pain, the awkwardness, the loneliness, and the love. The first time I saw it was on Bravo a few years back. The film felt so contemporary to me, that it shocked me to see it was made in 1959. Jean Pierre Leaud gives a devastating performance. Its strength lies in the fact that he's not playing a cute, lovable boy, but a true teenager. This might be the first time a director did not condescend to its child actors. (Truffaut, along with Spain's Victor Erice, remains one of the best child directors in the history of cinema). The cinematography is incredibly sophisticated, and yet approachable by anybody's standards. I have read that Truffaut regrets using the Jean Constantin score, but IMHO, it works to this day. It gives the film an emotional punch, particularly through the final frames. I know I will never grow tired of praising or watching this film. It is simply the best.",

The film tells the story of Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood and neglected adolescent as he devolves into a life of petty crime. He has a depraved upbringing, living with his parents who only seem to notice him when he gets in trouble for things that are constantly blown out of proportion by his hateful teachers. The only place Antoine can find refuge is with his delinquent friends who, being much more fortunate than Antoine, don't suffer the consequences of their actions like Antoine does. The film is a meaningful look into the life of the adolescent and growing up under subtly harsh circumstances. His upbringing isn't outright brutal, but it is quietly cruel in a way that creeps up on you and you only realize the kind of terrible things going on in retrospect.

There is the physical education class run through the streets with the teacher losing students, the carnival wheel and finally the best ending scene to any movie ever put on film.

This was a truly well made movie that I think is Truffaut's best and most personal because this film was inspired by his early life of which I am pretty sure that as a teenager Truffaut might have done the same things that the Leaud character did but I don't know yet, and this movie I and critics alike think that this movie is one of the best movies of 1959, as well as one of the best movies ever made.",

Other titles play with the notion with an obvious and sometimes heavy-handed slant, however, whether for comedy, drama, or otherwise. The genius of 'The 400 blows' by comparison is that while it's rather light on its feet, the overall tone is more detached and plainspoken, letting the story speak for itself without becoming cheeky or maudlin.

118,15 September 2022,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, The mistranslation starts and stops with the title.,"If you wanted to be charitable, you could say the English title for 'The 400 Blows (1959)' refers to the large number of setbacks of young hero faces. If you wanted to be honest, you should say that it's simply a complete mistranslation of the original French title. The film follows a schoolboy who smokes, steals, shams and skives his way through life, surrounded by apathetic adults entirely uninterested in either raising him right or treating him like an actual individual with wants and needs. Youth is often ignored and this film is keenly aware of that. It isn't overly dour, but it is a rather bleak portrayal of one kid's rocky childhood. Thankfully, there are moments of levity sprinkled throughout and the story's underlying sadness never becomes overbearing. It's more of a melancholy that clouds the overall affair, one which crafts - or at least bolsters - quite a few poignant moments. The piece is very well realised in that it does feel like a fly-on-the-wall look into its focal character's life. Its realistic aesthetic boosts the effectiveness of its down-to-earth narrative, as do its no-frills yet convincing performances. It isn't overly concerned with plot, but it doesn't feel aimless. In fact, it's almost a movie of two halves due to the way in which it unfolds. Regardless, it's always entertaining, whether traditionally or otherwise. Its iconic final moment is genuinely quite haunting.",

120,23 April 2020,andrewroy-04316,9," A deep, melancholic exploration of an adolescent's yearning for freedom and spontaneity","The 400 Blows is a patient adolescent character study which is unassuming, but has lots of depth to consider. Every scene in the movie showcases Antoine's fundamental struggle: he has good intentions and is creative and intelligent, but is impulsive and bold and is painted as a troublemaker everywhere. More than anything, he wants to be free. The cinematography does a great job of highlighting the contrast between the constricting home life with the limitless open Paris streets. When he has freedom to choose what to do, he is happy, but his choices are constantly hampered by authority figures. He feels unloved and caged in by the expectations of his parents, and he is tired of disappointing them despite doing his best to be good, so he decides to live on the streets. His school teacher is a similar authority figure who only sees the bad in Antoine, and who Antoine ends up avoiding. Both his teacher and his dad complain of him not confiding in them, failing to understand that the things he loves are being away from the constriction of their authority. He cares a lot for his friend Rene, in large part because their friendship is out of choice rather than the obligation he feels to his parents. When Rene and his mom come to see him, he is overjoyed to see Rene, but devastated when he leaves and his mom enters. The final scene shows Antoine getting to see the ocean for the first time, and ends on a freeze frame of him with a contemplative look. What will he do? How can he live happily in the world? I interpreted the film as a critique on the way society limits people's potential and happiness. Antoine usually does what's expected of him (putting out the trash every night, for example) and when he doesn't he's either embarrassed (getting distracted from his homework and skipping school as a result) or atones for it (buying the flour for his mom). He is street smart and a quick thinker, and even when he steals a typewriter he puts himself at risk by choosing to return it. None of these attributes are noticed by anyone except the audience, and by the end Antoine's life seems destined to be one of mishaps and crime. The film's style is clearly one with a heavy emphasis on realism, as we see the trademarks of Italian neorealism popping up here - the long wide tracking shots as Antoine moves across streets, the footage shot in the city itself, and the patient slice of life tone of the film. I really loved this film because I found Antoine's plight so easy to understand and relate to - kids often have good intentions and just want to explore and see things, but needless limits and expectations are placed by authority figures (here, the education system and parents) which leave the child unsatisfied and wanting to be free that much more. This is a movie that makes me want to spend more time with it and dive deeper into it, because it has a lot to explore and consider.",
121,19 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,7, Good,"In 1959 a pair French films were released that became the twin pillars of the New Wave (Nouvelle Vague), and were instantly hailed as classics. One, Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (A Bout de Soufflé), was a bad film, and the other, François Truffaut's The 400 Blows (Les Quatre Cents Coups), was a good film. Neither, however, can really be called great cinema, despite their reputations. That said, Truffaut's film is far better than Godard's because it mostly avoids overt clichés, even as its screenplay- its weakest element, written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussey, often bogs down in anomy. Like Godard, Truffaut shot his film in black and white, and indulged the real world, as well as doing long takes, to try to feign naturalism, even though these were often outcomes of necessity not choice, borne out of lack of financing rather than artistic vision.",

127,2 September 2008,RainDogJr,10, un film merveilleux de François Truffaut,"This is the story of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) in his school, in his home, in the streets of Paris. This is the story of a boy entering in a new world, for him, leaving his family behind. Every time Antoine is at a different place we see more of his personality and every time he is at a different place he is doing something that of course will bring consequences. In the school he does a bad thing to later be at home thinking in the things he needs to do in order to repair the things in his school to later be near the school thinking in how he could forget to do those things. The film begins with the typical problematic kid at school and soon we find that Antoine has his own preferences at home. Is clear that he has a better relation with his father (Albert Rémy) but everything will change soon. The main problem is that everything is like a secret between family members. There is not that thing called trust, not from Antoine to his parents and neither from the parents to Antoine. On the other hand we have his best friend René (Patrick Auffay), together with him Antoine will began to have his life in the streets of Paris. For a day they leaved the school tools in order to have a fun day by going to the movies and some other places. During that ""fun day"" we will watch not the beginning of all the problems but sure the beginning of a new stage for the Doinel family. Sure Antoine was doing a bad thing so as his mother (Claire Maurier), both discovered the other, nobody said a word. Now everything changes and now at Antoine's home you even feel sorry for Antoine's father. That day the mother of Antoine died but just for Antoine. But also the mother is quite worried and now suddenly she is very kind with Antoine. Their case can be resume in once act: the mother needs to make an offer to Antoine, you know if he makes a good work at school she will give him money. Obviously that's a problem, a clear example of the problems of Antoine at school but also is a clear example of how the mother wants to resolve the things. Of course everything is a secret between Antoine and his mother so if the kid does a bad thing that will annoy his father the kid will have the protection of his mother since she knows everything is for the school. Eventually Antoine will make a work that is not what the teacher asked and also that will have some strong consequences so now the escape is the only thing in Antoine's mind and what's he eventually will do. In short, Antoine's mother became ""good"" with him so her secret can stay like that but the deep problems never changed. One of the many reasons I loved this film is that it is unpredictable. One day you see Antoine working for his school project and the other you see him living in a friend's house. By the end you know that maybe the entire story is somehow predictable since you see how was the relation between Antoine and his mother even before he was born so you see that this problem was somehow old and maybe some good things cover it a little but after all we always watched a broken family and in the end we just watch a kid running and running",

When his antics finally attract the attention of the police, they decide that maybe some time in juvenile detention might not do him any harm so off he goes - but he is not there for long! It's an episodic story that raises laughs and heckles in equal measure. You cannot help but like this tearaway. It's not so much that he wants attention (though he certainly does), it is that he is has initiative. He is bored; bored of his constantly rowing parents, of the teachers who don't really care about him. He is mischievous, he likes having fun - especially with his pal ""René"" (Patrick Auffay) with whom he has a few escapades and even lives for a short time. Theft is a serious matter but somehow when he pinches a typewriter from his dad's office - one that doesn't work, by the way, it has to make you smile. The ending features one of these scenes from a film that you will never forget. It is simple, and it's that simplicity coupled with this young boy's charming and enthusiastic performance that makes this film memorable, enjoyable and probably my favourite from François Truffaut.",

These two forces bring him to an unfortunate life of skipping school, and stealing. He is obviously lost in his life, not knowing how to make it work for himself.
I just find the story moving and relatable. Much of the camerawork is very pleasing and interesting. The camera can be used to create humor, as when the boys are running away from their exercise, and it can be used to show serious emotion and thoughts, like the famous ending frame.

""Les quatre cents coups"" is an autobiographical film,François Truffaut in his youth lived a wild life.So he gave us the portrait of Antoine Doinel, son of a dysfunctional family, who begins to skip the college and to live in streets, to steel little things such a typewriter, is arrested , sent to a reformatory and finally scaped running towards the sea.
From then the names of François Truffaut begins to be famous and of course of Jean-Pierre Léaud who will participate in others films of Truffaut ""Baisers volés, Domicile conjugal"" as Antoine Doinel adult.

Jean-Pierre Léaud plays Truffaut's on-screen alter ego Antoine Doinel, a mischievous youth in Paris, getting into one fix after another. Ignored by his parents (Albert Rémy & Claire Maurier), he toils away his time cutting school, going to the movies and getting into trouble. Léaud, who would reprise this role throughout the next twenty years, is remarkable. Not too bright, not to aggressive, but oddly likable. Truffaut explores themes that he'd go back to time & again with many subsequent films. The 27-year old directs with such a sure hand, it's hard to believe this was his debut. Henri Decaë's cinematography is stunning and Jean Constantin did the music. The film's final shot has become one of the defining images of the French New Wave.",

I am not sure why it is called this, so if anyone can help please comment. So this is considered to be a classic, and a centerpiece for discussion in film school. In this regard, I must be ignorant. This is a classic movie, this is a good movie, but I guess I just don't understand what makes this such a big deal for film students. It is a great story about little Antoine doniel who drinks, smokes, steals, skips school, lies, and runs away repeatedly. There is no moral question directed at the viewer it is just his life, and it has been hard but not terrible, like many people's own experience, and so we are not there to judge. The character is revisited throughout truaffot's career in several films, he even uses the same actor Jean-Pierre Laud. Pretty impressive considering the films span 20 years and he started at age 13. I recently reviewed ""you can count on me"" in many ways this film reminded me of it, in the sense that nothing is over played but we get to understand what goes into shaping someones life.

François Truffaut's The 400 Blows is as definitive an example as any. Consistently topping critics' lists and credited for effectively spearheading the movement known as the French New Wave (along with Godard's Breathless), the most important thing to remember about Truffaut's seminal work is that, far from being designed to be an awards-lapping masterpiece of art cinema, the film was spawned by autobiographical sentiments so anarchic and countercultural that they would sneer at the notion of any such pretension. And this is the true beauty of The 400 Blows – that it feels so wholeheartedly honest that there is no sense of trying to cater to any particular audiences at any point, naturally making it paradoxically all the more refreshing, delightful and compelling.

City of God, although far more violent and horrific, comes to mind, as it is also shot in a near-documentary style, with young children and few professional actors. These films seem unremittingly honest, showing life the way it is, or the way it can be for some unlucky people. Ordinary film plots, with beginnings, middles and either happy or sad endings, are not realistic. They are attempts to make sense of life, but life isn't like that.

An adolescent with a troubled background is bent on fun and mischief. Such loose and barely controlled upbringing unravels leading to crime. Shot in black and white, the film moves at a brisk pace barely letting up where action is the name without sacrificing the Euro atmosphere and look. Good directing and acting make the film standout highlighting Truffaut's eminence as one of the foremost directors in film. Despite these the film loses some steam towards the middle where one too many unnecessary scenes dull its edge. A compelling film on childhood, friendship and man's experiences and place in society, this is one flick that can leave quite a mark.

167,9 October 2006,naitre,9, A true gem,"A simple, lucid story which, with a lightness so natural that it almost seems unintentional, gradually unravels into a full-blown masterpiece. Tragic as the story is, it still keeps this charming, luminous allure, like a breath of fresh air in the shape of a movie. Jean-Pierre Léaud's performance is nothing short of fantastic. Yet it's exactly on his casting for the part that I would like to comment. On the one hand, the choice is perfect - he IS Antoine Doinel, he lives and breathes this part as if it were his own life. On the other hand, the lead was obviously supposed to be a charismatic actor with a charming personality, able to make the audience feel for him. And that he does incredibly well.. but in fact, Antoine-Jean-Pierre is even TOO good. He is supposed to portray a troubled boy falling deeper and deeper down the social scale, and that in reality is a way darker, uglier sight than the one we see. Léaud conveys a strange sense of well-being and invincibility even in the hardest moments of Antoine's life, which renders the movie even more ""watchable"", but at the expense of psychological accuracy. I also find it hard to believe as a spectator that someone as heartrendingly adorable as this child could suffer such amounts of neglect and abuse from the grown-ups who surround him. The scenes with his family who couldn't care less about him come across as slightly unconvincing at moments. It's hard to imagine a mother so cold or a father so ruthless in the face of the exceptionally charming little human being that is Léaud-Doinel. Yet it's probably this uncanny supernaturally natural charisma that gives us a sense of hope at the end of the movie and a feeling that in spite of everything that has happened at the end of the day he'll do well.",

There is no ""fat"" on it, it is very tight in its narrative and it is also quite well composed. A poetic but also very sad tale of a young boy and his troubled life. It is a classic movie! However, I don't think it is Truffaut's best film as I am aware of many do believe. Truffaut (1932-1984) was perhaps THE director in the entire history of motion pictures that was able of, truly and profoundly, conveying love as an idea or an emotion on the silver screen. I know that he was not the only one who achieved making great love stories, but perhaps only he knew how to do it the best way. And that brings me to my reason for not regarding this as his best film: I think it lacks that kind of true emotion and sentiment that shines so bright in his later films.

Basically, a young boy tries to live a wild and out-of-control life due to his poor conditions at home and school. One of my biggest dislikes of the new wave is the minimalist way they try to portray story, plot, and emotion. While this movie still doesn't have the highest-concept as far as plot goes, the slice-of-life they choose to take here is an interesting one. The boy in the movie turns to increasingly worse crimes. The whole time he does, the fantastic acting by the kid playing the character has me rooting for him. Even though some of the things he's doing are cruel or wrong, I find myself hoping he'll escape his horrible home life or school life, or find some way to rise above it. The camera work was pretty well done in some shots too, considering the budget. The long shot of the boy running down the road was nice - a really smooth, one-take scene. I also liked the unscripted interview dialogue between the psychologist and the boy.

The best part of the film is Truffaut's camera work which is nothing but superb. The black and white really makes the film, showing the depressing life of a boy unwanted at home by his mother, and it seems he does not know his father is not really his father. He turns to a life of petty crime and running away to escape his problems only to find he is too young for the streets of Paris. This film has always been hailed as a masterpiece, and in it's time it was.

The story is not uncommon now, 60 years later, but it is still easy enough to follow and complex enough to keep its viewers engaged. The camera work was also great, particularly in the final 10 minutes or so. The only problem that I feel the film has is that it feels older than it is. I don't think it stands the test of time that same way some other films from around then do.

177,22 June 2015,danielayechan310,9, A very colorful black and white film,"A ""French New Wave"" director Francois Truffaut's first feature film The 400 Blows (1959) is mainly based on the real story of Truffaut's childhood which establishes the new theories for the modern cinema. The 400 Blows against the classical Hollywood film clichés (in a good way), and it's episodic and somewhat documentary-like cinematic techniques help to create the authentic story of a 14-year-old boy. The protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) is viewed as a trouble-making teenager among the adults. Actually, Antoine lives an unhappy life dealing with his verbally abusive mother who is having an affair with a man from work, and his kind and friendly yet not deeply attachable stepfather whom he initially considered as his biological father. His departed grandfather is the only inspiration in his life. His luck is not good. At his school, Antoine has to deal with an uninspired teacher who always doubt his talent and pictures him as nothing but as a ""troublemaker"". To make a matter worst, he skips school, and lies to his parents and teacher. Receiving unprofessional reputation from his school teacher, and all the negligence from his parents force him to get the statuses of a liar, a dropout, and a theft which eventually lead him to the juvenile detention home. Delinquency is the key theme in this film. Antoine believes in freedom, and he is constantly planning to escape from being locked up. Using real locations in Paris, and having unprofessional actors with some improvised dialogues define the cinematic reality in this film. It is realistic, yet it has a moving story in which Truffaut skillfully plays around with the camera to add colors to this black and white film; extremely long shots in Antoine's' running scenes, a high aerial shot of the boy jogging scene, and a series of close-ups and deep focus shots will draw the audiences in the middle of actions as well as into the main characters' mind.",

Antoine is a rascal and creates his own problems, but he is a product of his environment: he is rejected by his mother and his stepfather. In their eves, he cannot do anything right.

As great 20th century minds, he rejected school and the whole system in general. The only ones he relied on was his father, who in spite of all the incomprehension, was actually faithful to him, and his closest friend, René. They skip classes together to go to the cinema and one day he actually runs away from home. He goes living in an abandoned factory and gets away with it by stealing. This leeps on until his parents (finally) understand they are incapable of educating him and Doinel his sent to an observation centre. This movie is then turned into a sequel by Truffaut himself, and emphasised the beginning of the nouvelle vague, which is believed to have truly began one year earlier, by Claude Chabrol.

Even if the French school and justice systems are not anymore what they were at the time of ""Les 400 coups"", questioning is aroused. Plus though sometimes a bit long, it's often funny.

189,20 August 2012,scottackerlund,10," ""Raising Hell"" - François Truffaut's French New Wave masterpiece","François Truffaut's, ""The 400 Blows,"" (1959) is an excellent character study of a youth living in poverty in Paris, France during the 1950's. Truffaut pulls many experiences from his own adolescent life to construct a very real telling of a troublesome young boy scorned by his teachers and parents because of his unquenchable thirst for exploration, excitement and what his superiors see as insubordination when it comes to society's rules. In under two hours Truffaut is able to tell the story of a troubled kid in Paris and subtly relate it to his own feelings about Cinema and its place in society at the time. Antoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in a small poor house in Paris under his mother and step-father's rules. After several examples of how Antoine is treated by his parents and his instructors, he decides he must run away in order to be happy. After being caught and sent back home a few times, he meets another boy with similar goals as him and the two go on a crime spree throughout Paris. Eventually, Antoine gets caught stealing a typewriter and is sent to the juvenile detention center to be rehabilitated. After only a few days he escapes the juvenile center and runs toward the sea in hopes of freedom. The film ends with a poignant freeze-frame of Antoine's face after he turns away from the sea and it is here that Truffaut freezes these characters and their story in cinematic history. These are characters forever locked into this particular story. Truffaut is drawing attention to the audience's knowledge that they just watched a film. The most important aspect of this film is not necessarily the story or characters themselves but rather the cinematic conventions that the film follows or breaks. You can compare Antoine Doinel to cinema itself in the way Truffaut see's the art form. He see's it as a young boy trying to be free and not follow society's rules. 400 Blows is a long desperate run away from conformity and to the freedom of the sea. Truffaut once said, ""I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not interested in anything in between."" He uses freeze-frames, fades, dissolves, and jump cuts to inform the audience that they are watching a film and in doing so he and his fellow colleague's practically created the French New Wave style. For all the things that 400 Blows says about society at the time, especially French society, the film's comparison to cinema itself, and the invention of a totally new cinematic movement, François Truffaut led the way for his contemporaries and himself to create new original films away from the traditional ideas of what a film had to be. The film went on to earn the 27 year old director the unique distinction of Best Director at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and has forever changed the way movies are conceptualized and produced. One of the original auteurs, François Truffaut's ""400 Blows"" raises hell in the cinematic world and has gone down as one of the greatest films every made.",
190,31 May 2011,K-nightt,8, Dehumanizing to be non-threatening,"Despite the year this film was made, I believe the issues it addresses remain exceedingly current. I think it is somewhat of a synecdoche of what society at large instills in people nowadays. It is very difficult to tread outside of the very well-delineated lines our superego has drawn for us. Antoine seems to be spiraled into this vertiginous voyage of soul destruction on almost a whim. I think it is symptomatic of our culture to ""lend"" our views of the world to the children, stating how they should feel and act, while not allowing their free expression of emotion. It is tragic, yet it reveals the parents' own unresolved issues and their need to project their own unwanted aspects into their kids, in whom they can exercise a more strict control. So, in the end, children not only have to carry the burden of their own emotionally chaotic and ever-changing inner world, but they need to shoulder the brunt of their parents' failings as well; perhaps this was best exemplified when Antoine's parents demand that he take the garbage out, they need to remind him that in the final analysis he is responsible for dealing with everybody's waste. What ensues in someone who has been so brow-beaten by life, without ever having their own emotions validated, is that they doubt the reality of their emotions, and encapsulate themselves into a protected world that is numb to any further assault by the world, what Sidney Klein would term an ""autistic cyst."" The destruction of all that is externally good is symbolized when he is being taken away in the police wagon, the tears he sheds represent the death of emotion in itself, in a cathartic manner. When the end rolls around, even fantasy cannot save him. He approaches the ocean and when he sets foot in the water, her starts to walk sideways and eventually turns away with an emotionless face the world has nothing left to offer him. His mother also plays out her own intrapsychic dynamic very well; she suffers between the pull of her id and her superego; her id is represented by Antoine, since he was conceived out of wedlock, and he is the personification of her rebellious side. Society (including her husband) puts demands on how her child should be reared, and since he represents such a powerful force in herself, a selfobject coruscating with a lust she perhaps wishes she could reclaim, there must be hell going on inside her head. She eventually succumbs to the oppressive punitive superego, and the only way she can eliminate her pulsating id is to eliminate her contact with its concrete representation, her son. She isolates her affect and summarily casts him into the destructive world that in essence destroyed her as well.",
191,4 July 2013,wburnett,10, Amazing to this day!!!,"This has to be one of the best coming of age stories ever made, and when I saw this film, I didn't expect to be as impressed or as emotionally drawn in as this 1959 classic did to me! Starting off with our protagonist Antoine Doinel misbehaving in class and then expanding the story out into a truly remarkable film about what is essentially child abuse ""although I imagine the culture in 1959 France, and 2013 Britain are two whole different things... but what makes this film truly remarkable is its young star. Once you set eyes upon his daring, yet cheeky behaviour, you begin to see why he has an apathy for life that no child in my personal opinion should have. What is going on here is the whole ""Nurse Ratchet"" scenario really brought to form by 1976 by ""one flew over the cuckoos nest"", the format is very similar, with everything the adults doing to help the child just pushing him further and further from social obedience. The shots of him seeing his hometown drive out of view at the end had me in complete hysterical sobbing mode, and with good reason... The cinematography is just as alive today as if it were made today in black and white, yet, the same thing can't be said for the setting... Its absolutely amazing to see what Paris looked like in 1959, its beautiful and (even in b&w, which people should stop complaining about... and subtitles) this serves up as one of the best international movies of its time. The acting is very rarely wooden and over the top, and never from our main character, I can quite safely say that this film needs to be broadcast more. I would pay a lot of money to see it on the big screen... I just cannot bring myself to criticise this fantastic gem of cinema!

Unfortunately that is not not the truth, so someone seems to have been overly aggressive on the marketing. Production elements aside (or rather lack of them), this false hype masks an even larger problem that is often overlooked: it is simply not a very good story. The story elements are simplistic, hackneyed, and overplayed. The first scene in the classroom sets the poor tone. Purported to be the director's response to films that he thought were too 'stagey,' this film itself feels inauthentic and stagey throughout, just without a big budget, color, or a good story. Combined with poorly filmed tracking shots, sloppy editing, and bad transitions, today this film looks like a mess. The only redeeming quality it has now, as a film standing alone from its over-hyped reputation, is the naturalistic performances by the actors. But that is not enough to make up for all the other elements that are very badly executed. In the end, it is simply a boring, uninteresting, and poorly made film that is not worth the time.",
194,12 December 2018,niccoloparrino,10," Gorgeous movie, ingenious for its time","""The 400 Blows"" is a not-so-good literal translation of the original French title, which is an expression for ""acting rebellious, unrestrained"". It is the behavior of a child, Antoine, who's the protagonist. All throughout the film, he's tormented by the incomprehensible distance with the adults' world. Like most children, he feels disconnected from his surroundings, from the true reality of facts. He cannot foresee consequences, and whenever he finds himself facing them, he gives them no important significance.
It may sound ridiculous to hear, but children are more directly connected to the truest nature of the world we live in. Antoine cares more about getting in touch with the world by struggling to get a living out of it, instead of sitting at a desk for years. Whenever he gets in trouble, even if it's something trivial, he sees no other option but leaving home.
This movie is about innocence, more strictly children's innocence, but it doesn't mean the grown-up audience is forbidden from relating to the movie. The movie feels so close to real life, it follows the characters in the most common of times and makes them extremely fascinating. It's possible that Truffaut gave the movie this realistic atmosphere just to express better the simplicity and pure thoughts of Antoine.
The revolutionary face of the French New Wave is concealed by the tenderness of the movie. The movie is more rebellious in its technique rather than the actions of the characters. Antoine doesn't fight for one ideology or another. He just constantly tries to find out what the world has to offer him personally. But I guess the ending explains all this much more appropriately than me.",

Just like Jules and Jim, Stolen Kisses and Day for Night the people and the things they do are so real, you feel like you could almost walk in and talk to them.

But he didn't have a role model to show him how to be good, at no point in the movie do we see his mother or father doing anything positive. So it wasn't like he was always doing wrong, it was more like he didn't know how to do right. For example when he stole the typewriter if was for survival, and when he realized he couldn't do anything with it he didn't just leave it in the street, he tried to do good and got severely punished for it.

It is the best french movie in my opinion and my second favorite movie. The director, Francois Truffaut reflects Antoine Doinel's life as a real experience. He actually shows his troubled childhood in the ""400 Blows"" and this makes the movie the first example of French new wave movies. I felt while watching that when Antoine walked, I walked. When he ran, I ran. I experienced his life as mine. This is one of the most important feature of French new wave movies (Nouvelle Vague) , so life can be seen more real in these type of films. That's because I feel real emotions and sorrows. That's because I adore this movie, and Truffaut himself. Antoine Doinel feels distress because of his family and society around him. He can't show himself up at school or in life. He lives with lies and a bad family. Everything around him is shattered and drags him to do forbidden things like committing a theft. These troubles make him escape from his wicked life. In the final scene, we can see that he runs without a backward glance. Some people cannot understand why Truffaut finishes this movie like this and why Antoine runs. Trying to get over his life is the explanation of it and Antoine's inevitability is the final moment. The sea represents he cannot get over from his life. The expression on his face is the symbol of desperation. ""400 Blows"" will remain in my favorites in short. Every human being should see this.",
218,13 June 2013,mariteregomez95,7," Critique: ""The 400 Blows""","Is ""The 400 Blows"" a movie of a young child's miss happens, or an acute critic against French education? The movie ""The 400 Blows"" by Francois Truffaut exposes the harsh situation that Antoine Doinel, a twelve-year-old boy, undergoes. It depicts the unique and inefficient ways of educating children in the 1960's. This movie connects with the viewer in a profound way. The story is told through the child's perspective, creating a sense of connection and compassion in the reader, for this young character. ",
