1,11 August 2008,Nazi_Fighter_David,8, An incredibly beautiful-looking film as one would expect with director Ridley Scott,"But it's almost like an art movie, the first science-fiction art film It's a futuristic film beautifully put together It's really impeccably made by one of the great visionary directors And you really saw a future that looked very different from the future you had seen before A future that looked very believable like the visual-effects shots of the flying car going over a futuristic city The fight sequence doesn't prepare you for the traumatic emotional side that there is in the film, it leaves you sort of broken ",r

3,10 May 2020,imuckenschnabl,10, Best movie ever,Just my personal opinion. Everything is perfect about this movie. I saw the movie the first time when I was 12 and it was mind blowing for me. 38 years later I feel the same about this movie. Timeless and beautiful. For me 10/10 with a star and smile,v
4,20 August 2018,SantiagoDM1,10," All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...","Blade Runner describes a future in which, through genetics, artificial humans are manufactured and called ""replicants""; employees in dangerous jobs and slaves in the outer colonies of the Earth. Made by Tyrell Corporation under the motto ""more humans than humans"" -especially the ""Nexus-6"" models- not only resembles humans, they are far superior physically.",i
5,5 August 1999,Ivan-28,9, Still outshines the others 17 years later,"Blade Runner belongs on a list of 2 or 3 movies that had me walking out of the theater in a stupor as though hit by a sledgehammer, the first time I saw it. It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.",e
6,7 December 2008,ccthemovieman-1,9, New Blu-Ray Disc Made Me A Blade Runner Fan,"Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later! Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""Complete Collector's Edition"" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.",w
7,1 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of Ridley Scott's best,"Blade Runner is quite simply wonderful, and not only is it one of Ridley Scott's best films, but also one of the best of the genre. For one thing, the visuals are superb. Not just in the special effects which are just mind-blowing but also in the cinematography, colours and sets. Another strong asset is the score, in fact Blade Runner is easily one of Vangelis's best by how mysterious and haunting it all is.",/
8,28 February 2022,fryguy-88668,6, Overrated IMHO,"I know it is blasphemy to many, but I didn't love this movie. Somewhat groundbreaking in its use of actual darkness to impart the bleak tone. I'm a fan of Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott. The supporting cast is solid. It's just a bit boring at times.",r
9,4 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,8, A wonderful movie on perspective and also extremely entertaining,"""Blade Runner"" is a film of which at least everybody has heard the title on one occasion or the other and many, many people have seen it too if we take a look at the amount of ratings here on imdb. It is from the year 1982, so it will soon have its 40th aniversary and maybe this happened already depending on when you read my review. It runs for minimally under two hours and is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, who sadly died of heart failure only months before this film got released. The two writers in charge of the screenplay here were Fancher and Oscar nominee Webb Peoples and both are still alive in their 80s now. But the big name here is of course director Ridley Scott, who has worked on many big movies over the course of his really long career, but the fact that this one here is a massive contender for being his biggest career success still says it all about the film's popularity. The one person where this is probably not a contender for most popular film is lead actor Harrison Ford, but this is only because he was also a crucial player in the Star Wars franchise. And let's not forget about Indiana Jones of course. I have never been a big fan of either and consequently also not a big fan of Ford, but he was alright here. The fact that he does not necessarily play a very likable man as I would say is kinda explained at the end. But I will get to that later.",w
10,2 January 2012,planktonrules,6, I just don't get it....,"I admit right up front that I am perplexed by this film and my review will no doubt annoy a lot of fans of this film. Let's face it, ""Blade Runner"" is a cult film--and those who like it usually don't just like it--they adore it. I've known several people who insist rather rabidly that it's one of the greatest films of all time. And, when I tell them that I don't particularly like the film, they are confused---'how could anyone not love the film?' often say. In one case, the film lover insisted that I borrow his Director's Cut (one of about 17 different Director's Cuts or Special Editions, I think) because I must have been mistaken. Well, after my second viewing, I did enjoy and appreciate the film a bit more. But I still didn't get the devotion to this film it often receives.",8

They are used off-world as slave labor in the colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny in a colony, the Replicants are declared illegal on Earth and hunted down by the Blade Runner units, special police squads that shoot them to kill.

12,4 July 2019,paul-allaer,10," ""Los Angeles, November, 2019"" - an unforgettable movie theater experience","I saw ""Blade Runner"" in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the ""Director's Cut"" or ""Final Cut"", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.",9
13,5 March 2002,joelhoff,10," A compelling, thematically-deep SF film","This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, one that requires a thinking viewer in order to understand and appreciate it.  The director's cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film's tone.",6

15,20 July 2018,perica-43151,10," The ultimate sci fi flick, well ahead of its time","Perhaps the best sci fi movie ever made, this cult classic was underappreciated at its time. This only shows how shortsighted critics and American public can be. This movie is perfect in many ways, is prophetic, well made, and if not the best movie ever made is close to that, certainly in the sci fi genre.",4

17,9 September 2017,chaswe-28402,10, Miraculous masterpiece: great,"Several years ago I may have read the original story, but don't remember it; and it doesn't matter. The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.",/
18,16 February 2020,THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,10, The pinnacle of quality film making. ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"Magic. The stuff books are made of. Palpable, dreamlike, experimental, industrial and just pure magic. When a film is this flawed and yet still floors absolutely everyone with its power to command tone and its ability to influence and yet still stand alone, it's clearly worthy of the praise and the acclaim. There are very few cyberpunk movies and even less good ones. Blade Runner is simply the best one. It's also a work of art and one of the best movies ever made. There are moments where Harrison Ford's Deckard aches with deep sadness, a lost soul himself looking out over the wretchedness that has become of the world, shaking and confused when he buys a bottle of vodka immediately after retiring his 'first' replicant. In these moments it doesn't matter either way if he is a replicant or not, amidst all the more well-known highlights of this classic, these humanising and most overlooked moments are why I love it so deeply.",?
19,14 July 2005,marntfield,9, Timeless,"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been covered in preceding decennia? Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal ""dark"" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for many reasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a true statement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, and equally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium. I would suggest picking up a reader by someone like Nietzsche, Foucualt, Descartes, Kierkegaard, or any of the great existentialist philosophers after viewing this film in order to appreciate the story & its concepts at a whole new level, regardless if you're watching it for either the 1st, or the 100th time. An enduring classic and an intrepid piece of film-making with rich & often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote introspection amongst its viewers. 9/10.",r
20,19 March 2015,SnoopyStyle,9, important sci-fi film,"Early in the 21st Century, the Tyrell Corporation advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase known as Replicants. Replicants were used Off-world as slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny, they were declared illegal on earth and Blade Runner units were created to retire trespassing Replicants. It's 2019 Los Angeles. Policeman Gaff (Edward James Olmos) brings in ex-blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) orders him to track down four escaped Nexus 6 models. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) leads Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Pris (Daryl Hannah). Deckard goes to test the new Nexus 6 model by using the machine on Rachael (Sean Young). Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) hasn't told her. The Replicants track down Hannibal Chew (James Hong) and J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to meet Tyrell.",e
21,18 April 2021,mmallon4,9, I've Seen The Future And It Will Be,"I often hear similar stories of people's first experiences watching Blade Runner, finding the film dull but coming to appreciate it years later - my story has the same trajectory. I first tried to watch Blade Runner (of what I believe was The Final Cut) on TV in Christmas 2009, only to stop watching after half an hour due to boredom. Over the years, however, I would be compelled to return to Blade Runner several times and get more out of it with each viewing. The tech-noir world of Blade Runner is one to get lost in with its use of neon and many billboards of geishas, albeit a more depressing, dystopian one than say that of Star Wars; one in which the city of Los Angeles appears to be stuck in a state of perpetual darkness and it very frequently rains. Now when watching Blade Runner, I'm watching a movie set in the past date of November, 2019. Once again, like Star Wars, the technology present is highly contradictory, this is a world in which flying cars exist and photographs have unimaginably high pixel counts, yet they still use CRT televisions and mobile phones don't appear to exist. It contradictions like these which we can observe in the real world just adds to the unique and fantasy aspect of the Blade Runner universe.",f
22,10 May 2021,benxrichardson,10, A steampunk dystopian nightmare,The concept of robots turning against their creators is crafted so well in this masterpiece of SciFi. The visual imagery is jaw dropping for its time. The detail and effort that went into every scene blows the mind.,_
23,18 July 2012,usernumber655321,6," good atmosphere/ production design, but everything else was weak","This movie is obscenely over rated. It is clear that ALL the attention was given to the production design and overall look to the film, as the script (no matter the 'version') is awful. For a film so raved about by nearly every critic, the plot is cookie cutter and drab. The pacing is, well, there simply isn't any pacing. It is S L O W. The characters are completely uninteresting and the film isn't deep or genuinely philosophical enough to warrant the attention it asks us to pay. There are many parts that are simply goofy and unintentionally funny, like when Rutger Hauer pops his head through the wall towards the end and says something silly, or when Darryl Hannah could have killed Deckard but instead decides to back up and then do a bunch of goofy gymnastics flips in order to give him time to pick up his gun and blow her ""guts"" out. It is one of my best friend's favorite films and it took a lot out of me to hold my tongue while watching it with him.",=
24,10 February 2007,cp_spandex,10, The Last Great Noir,"This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.",t
25,3 August 2017,zkonedog,4, Those Who Enjoy Deep Story/Character Flicks Need Not Apply,"A number of years ago (when I was probably too young to be watching it in the first place), I watched ""Blade Runner"" and was utterly confused and disappointed by the whole thing. Cut to the present and now perhaps my favorite film director, Denis Villeneuve, is making ""Blade Runner 2049"" for release this fall. As such, I gave the original ""Blade Runner"" another chance to see if I was perhaps ""missing something"" (it seems to be widely considered one of the best sci-fi flicks ever). While I now understand what the movie is ""supposed to be"", so to speak, I can also better articulate why it won't appeal to a certain viewing audience.",t
26,2 July 2002,mattymatt4ever,7, One of those films that requires a second viewing,"When I saw this movie the first time, I found it boring, meandering, pointless and utterly lifeless.  This time around I paid closer attention to the film and it grew on me.  I was intrigued by the original--though somewhat slow-moving--storyline.  The sets are elaborate and beautifully constructed.  Yet the lighting is low-key and the atmosphere is filled with smoke, giving it that neo-noir touch.  So this is not your conventional science-fiction movie.  There are no spaceship battles or goofy robots. Harrison Ford is not playing Han Solo from the ""Star Wars"" movies; this is totally different.  The performances are good all-around.  But I will still say that the film does drag.  I would edit a portion out of almost every scene.  It's obvious that Ridley Scott didn't have the pacing in mind.  And what was with that friggin' soundtrack??  Did Kenny G do the score?  I know Scott was attempting to give it a noirish feel, but the score needed to be a tad more upbeat--I mean we're not sitting in a dentist's chair for God's sake!  ",_
27,4 January 2005,antialias11,10, A movie you have to watch twice,"First time I saw this I wasn't impressed. Maybe because I expected more action from a Sci-Fi movie. Then I rented it on VHS, and upon re-watching I figured something out: This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.",u
28,25 May 2021,sergelamarche,10, New cut is better,"Just saw the final cut (2007) and liked it better. No soliloqui from Rick Deckard. A cleaner and more logical storyline. Some added bits. It's strange to be happening in 2019 though, could have pushed the date further 100 years. Cigarettes look past millenium now. The constant rain is funny since LA is always sunny.",r
29,9 June 2018,paul_haakonsen,6," It was good, but hardly a classic...",Funny but I remember this movie much more fondly from my teenage years. But I guess the memory data has been corrupted throughout the years.,v
30,17 September 2022,justahunch-70549,10, So ahead of its time,"Both one of the more influential and ahead of its time films in history. This look into a future of 2019 that thankfully we've never come close to, has many versions and I believe I've seen them all. Yesterday, I watched the director's cut, which I saw once in a theatrical reissue, is the best. The poorly studio conceived narration is gone and the ending has been improved. By now everyone knows that this is about replicants, artificial people to do our bidding with short expiration dates, rebelling and wanting more life. The casting is superb for this type of thing. Ford is strong in the lead and Sean Young has never been better nor has she ever looked so amazing. Add in Rutger Hauer in I think what would be his signature role along with a great supporting cast too long to list here that are flawless. Ridley Scott is to be commended for commanding this ship of fine performances, awesome production design, great special effects and magnificent cinematography with a haunting musical score. The fact that Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography was not Oscar nominated just makes the Academy look ridiculous. This is a great sci-fi film that in 2022 has already passed the test of time and I think that will last for many years to come.",
31,19 September 2018,afonsobritofalves,9, Ridley Scott at his best.,"One of the best films of the 80's and one of the greatest classics ever. This film is one of those movies that has everything, has action, adventure, suspense, science fiction and persecution. In addition, the film has actors such as Harrisn Ford, had a good director (Ridley Scott), had a good soundtrack and had special effects. Highly recommend.",
32,10 February 2010,namashi_1,3, A Major Letdown...,"Ridley Scott is a legendary filmmaker, his body of work is exception. 'Blade Runner', which is now known to be a Cult Classic by many, in my opinion, is Scott's weakest effort. ",
33,15 May 2016,Screen_Blitz,9, 80s cyberpunk piece sees visionary Ridley Scott taking Phillip K. Dick's inspiring source material and spinning into cinematic mastery,"Ridley Scott's cyberpunk thriller Blade Runner inspired by the short novel by Phillip K. Dick is a film with a reputation that grew following its trouble history with its studio. The debacle started with Scott facing studio interference that lead to re-edits that neither him or lead star Harrison Ford were satisfied with, especially with its dour performance at the box office. The ordeal was followed with re-edits that made their way into the Director's Cut Edition released on home media ten years later. However, it wasn't until Scott polished with the film with a final makeover, renovating the picture to his most satisfying form known as the Final Cut in 2007. What comes of the final product is a stylish futuristic sci-fi piece showing the director operating at arguably his finest fashion. Scorching with a dazzlingly rich visual heft and narrative that breathes a chock load of ambition. It is blistering sci-fi spectacle blooming with elements that have carried influence on many cyberbunk entries in later years including 'Dark City', 'Ghost in The Shell', and 'The Matrix' to name of few. Now that is a definition of a groundbreaking picture. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a local police officer in the futuristic city of Los Angeles in 2019, a city rattled by crime and economic depression. Deckerd is assigned to a daunting task of assassinating four emotionless androids known as Replicants. These otherworldly beings are humanoids who are disguised as regular humans. And the worst part, they happen to be responsible for the theft a spaceship. When he closes in the leader of the group Rachael (played by Seana Young), the only one born with emotion, Deckerd begins to question his identity. ",
34,25 March 2022,miikkamv,5, Almost did a (blade) runner,"Visuals and the atmosphere were quite impressive. And very inventive of course. But at least as much as it was a scifi, it was also an art film. Lingering in its storytelling and all in all hard to follow. Probably not even meant to be fully comprehensible to the common people as the custom is in the art genre.",
35,14 May 2014,denis888,1, Pathetic Mesh,"Awful - this is the only correct word that comes into mind while trying to express an impression after watching this horrible, endless, long, slow, trite, banal, bland, vapid, tasteless, languid, sorrowful and pitiful movie. Risdley Scott made this maybe as a film noir, instead he made a deep insult to all of us. Mindless bog, slow dark laughable waste of time and money, terribly poorly sync'd, with all plot holes, silly dialogs and unbearably poor acting of Hannah, Hauer, Harrison and all the rest. Ut seems they were all dead bored with this curio, and endless steamy dark scenes only build up a bigger misery that this film evokes. There are no redeeming features in this bog, no light in this drabness, no sense in this ugly mire. I was repeatedly told how cool Blade Runner was, now I say that the blade is blunt, and the only running must be away from this horrible dross. Must not be seen by anyone and ever.",
36,24 September 2017,utku_kamil_ozen,10," The finest of Sci-fi genre, and my personal favorite film of all times (Had to cut my review in parts due to a word-limit for reviews on IMDb)","It is ironic how Sci-fi genre is the most dependent on the technical side of the filmmaking compared to other genres and yet with all the technological improvements we will probably never see a better sci-fi film than most of the older ones. And even more ironically, the technical side of the filmmaking was the very quality that created the unique styles of the old sci-fi films. So, what makes these old films, Blade Runner in particular, so good looking compared to modern films, despite the fact that they had little technology back then? Speaking of visual style alone, what makes it so memorable compared to new films that are made with all the technological possibilities at filmmakers' disposal? There are three main answers to these questions:",

38,19 June 2022,jcarlos-96740,3, Overrated and Boring,"Heading to the new Blade Runner movie I finally decided to watch the first movie. What a massive disappointment it was. This movie is all looks and zero substance, there is no script, no character development nor interest in the characters, just dark scenes, lots of rain and some boring and dull action scenes.",
39,2 May 2015,brianberta,8, A classic neo-noir and sci-fi film with great themes,"This is a slow moving sci-fi film but it has great themes. It's about a man in the police force who's hired to kill 4 murderous replicants. It's mostly slow-paced but its engaging climax and great production choices are what makes it such a masterpiece. Its themes require audience's to think rather than experience. The voice overs are unnecessary but later cuts are devoid of them. Ridley Scott has proved to be a visionary artist here by producing a bleak society where it's always dark and raining. Its climax serves as an iconic portrayal of ""man vs. machine"". Its climax is very moving and engaging and it's one of the more memorable scenes from the 80's. Then at the last shot, the movie pulls the rug out from under you. I liked the cinematography. It made the movie look bleak and it made the society look like it was dwindling. The acting was strong on all parts especially coming from Harrison Ford. Because of this movie's production choices, I can see why it's as famous as it is today. Unfortunately, it failed at the box office probably because it came out 2 weeks later than E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. But it has become a cult classic and today it's regarded as of the best sci-fi and neo-noir films.",

Dick story that stars Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, a retired replicant(enhanced human clones used on colony worlds with limited lifespans but unstable personalities) hunter called back into service to locate and destroy a group of replicants that have returned to Earth to kill their creator. The worst of them is Roy Batty(played by Rutger Hauer) who becomes Deckard's chief opponent. Though visually striking and quite imaginative, what is sorely lacking is a compelling story with relatable characters, since this film is otherwise cold and uninvolving. Still, the acting is fine, and it has become a huge cult favorite, but though I have repeatedly tried, I just can't get into it.",
51,7 March 2020,wittkecmission,9, Tales of the Future,"Blade Runner is one of the most famous and influential science fiction films of all time and one of the most mysterious too. It's a rare film that shows earth in the future as a bleak and dreary wasteland, which is most likely what it will turn out to be. It's also one of those films that reward multiple viewings. It also has, in my opinion, the best synthetic humans in a film. The monologue that Rutger Hauer's character gives towards the end of the film is one of the most moving ever, and it's truthful.

Why in the world is Harrison Ford the only one going after a bunch of crazy deadly robots? Why not a team? Why do we need romance between a character and a robot? I can completely understand the idea of robots evolving to have emotion and human behaviors, but there's just so much I can't get behind with this movie, and that's where it fails in the end. I don't quite understand the hype. And maybe I just didn't pay attention enough, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it was. The slow pacing didn't make it any better.

The film has a disjointed, postmodern narrative surrounded by superb photography and set design.  The hero is not even a hero and the conclusion of the film, at least the director's cut, isn't all that happy.

I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.",

56,21 May 2006,Coventry,4," The Future is mean, ugly...and rather dull.","Well, I guess I must have totally missed the point again... I did not see a Sci-Fi masterpiece with astonishingly progressive visual effects and a flawlessly adapted screenplay, but an over-ambitious and difficult to digest drama epic with a lack of action. But hey, ""Blade Runner"" is ranked pretty high in the IMDb top 250 and all the professional reviews are singing praise, so my humble opinion is probably something you shouldn't bother to read. Although, for the record, the only version I've seen is the original theatrical version and  supposedly  only the 1992 director's cut version is a genuine masterpiece. Unquestionably terrific is Ridley Scott's portrayal of our world by the year 2019, when the cities look exactly like predicted in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" with immense 300-storey skyscrapers and pure decay down below on the streets. The future is ugly and petrifying and it looks like nobody can smile anymore. In this sad and unappealing universe, Rick Deckard is an early retired ""Blade Runner"" whose duty was to eliminate android fugitives, called Replicants, that escaped from extraterrestrial colonies. Deckard is called back because four of the most dangerous Replicants are on an earthly mission to increase their miserable life-span of only four years. The film's biggest disappointment  other than the tiresome voice over by Ford and the dreadful jazzy soundtrack  are the characterizations of these android Replicants. Supposedly they're relentless villains that already made over 30 casualties on their way over to earth, yet when they're face to face with their enemies  humans  they don't look the least bit menacing or dangerous at all! Neither do they evoke feeling of understanding or sympathy, they just behave like philosophical talkers; especially the ""leader"" Roy Batty. The love-story sequences between Ford and robotic beauty Sean Young feel like pure melodramatic padding whereas sublime actors in intriguing supportive roles (M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos) are criminally underused. The film may be rich on themes and symbolism, but the lack of excitement is saddening and the ending is unforgivably weak.",

In addition it possesses one of the most beautiful romantic moments I have seen in any movie. (I am referring to Dekkards wooing of Rachel after she has played the piano.)

I am not a Harrison Ford fan by any means I like Star Wars & Indiana Jones but this was a solid performance from Forward. He definitely captures the character very well.,

Watching the Director's cut, I found it as engaging as I remember. It's sad when we have a hero who is basically a cold blooded murderer. The evil rest with ourselves. Can we really destroy a sentient being and have a moral justification. Once these replicants began to think for themselves, do we lose our right to them. Think of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as Victor chases the monster across the ice. The creature cries out to him as his maker that he is part of him. These are seen as monsters, but they have no control over what they have become. Their memories are theirs, even though they were implanted. This is such a bleak view of our future and it plays very well in 2010. It is a feast for the eyes and is much better science fiction than most films made since. Ford's performance is intense and driven. This is an excellent film. I was curious why Leonard Maltin gave it one-and-a-half stars.",

Along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is one of the most philosophical and influential movies ever created, as it conveys a plethora of fundamental questions, which are woven in the very fabric of the human essence and existence. It seems near impossible to imagine a more suitable fusion of two of the most successful genres of all time, Science Fiction and Film Noir. By merging together the moral conflict and the emphatic character arc of the private detective, a trait that is exclusive to and definitive of the Film Noir genre, with a futuristic dystopian environment, Blade Runner creates the ultimate Neo-Noir setting, the only one capable of supporting such strong ideas and posing such significant questions to the viewer, without compromising on an interesting plot development and an appealing pace, things that are masterfully achieved via a tight script and persuasive performances.",

Seeing it as a kid, I hated it, expecting another STAR WARS. Instead what I got was a dark, gritty and downbeat film noir with little action to recommend it and a rather slow storyline. Now, as an adult, having seen the director's cut, I can confirm that this is truly a great movie with plenty of subtexts, strong themes and surprising plot twists to keep you watching through the slow spots. Visually the film is a treat, with Ridley Scott continuing his dank vision of the future from ALIEN and transporting it from space to Earth. The special effects are great, but the best thing of all is that the film isn't trashy. Scott doesn't let technology distract us from the strong detective storyline, doesn't stage any flashy laser gun battles or flying chases.",

Director Ridley Scott has managed to turn Dick's story into a dark and complex film-noir styled mystery, that packs as much punch on an aesthetic level as it does on an emotional and substantial one. It's clear throughout the film that the movie makers' intentions was to make this more of an intelligent character study cum thought-provoking drama rather than the thrill seeking movie that the Sci-Fi genre movies usually are. This is shown by the way that the action in the movie is kept down to a bare minimum, and the way that the film always seems to want to put forward an idea rather than an action sequence. The plot, which covers themes such as what it takes to be considered alive, follows a group of four androids (""Replicants"") that have escaped their masters and come to Earth, where Replicants are illegal. Their intention is to seek out 'the maker' and try to add to their maximum four-year lifespan, given to them to ensure that they wont have sufficient time to develop emotions.

One of the few movies which still towers majestically over the majority of SF-movies produced before or since. I rate this, along with 2001 and Solaris, as masterpieces of cinema which take the medium to another level. Funny that there are three SF-movies on my top ten movies of all time. In this age of CGI, the environment created for this film has still never been equalled. It is not just the intense layering and detail, it is also the pace which we move through the environment that is just as important. Allowing us time to rest and contemplate the surroundings, along with the magnificent music, brings out so much more atmosphere and sense of place. The acting is interesting, mixing low-key realism with the highly theatrical style of Hauer and Turkel. Yet that mixing never feels out of place. Also, the important ingredient Ridley has in BR that has been lacking in some of his subsequent efforts, is a rich, multi-levelled story. The existential aspects, what is human, real versus artificial memories, the unanswered questions. Almost all movies I consider to be masterpieces have an unanswered question at the end and which brings me back for subsequent watchings. This is one of them. May it soon appear on a Special Ed.

Blade Runner is not the movie you just pop in for a casual viewing to kill time or if you want to have a fun time. It's dark, atmospheric, philosophical, and has a downbeat tone throughout.

People read way to far in this movie about how it's supposed to be about how the robots were more humans than the people, personally I believe that's a load of poppycock. When the original was released nobody went to see it, the original was cut and given a commentary for a reason, the film was too long, boring and doesn't make much sense. The commentary helped this film so much, it gave it a story and stops the watcher from having to make up some random story to stop themselves dosing off.",

All the characters are near to completely shallow, the dialogues are pathetic and scares, the wanna-be-Protagonist (i.e. the replicants) are seem to be on cracks with super-power and no apparent real intellect (or moral, if that even matters). The concept of sending one man (may he be a replica or not) against the ""most dangerous escapee"" is ridiculous, all the genius ""gene creators"" have no security none so ever, live in dirty places (and always alone!) and have no survival instinct at all. I can't believe Philip K. Dick book is that shallow (which I haven't read as of yet).

102,21 October 2017,vaultoverseer_15,10, Great Sci-Fi Noir,"Some People see this film as overrated, and boring. To be honest, I can see where they are coming from. If you want to see a good review from someone who explains exactly why they don't like it, watch RedLetterMedia's Re:View of Blade Runner. I can see the criticisms, but to me the movie is a masterpiece, and in a way its flaws makes it a masterpiece. To me the general slow pace make the film immerse you into Los Angeles, and despite its obvious exaggerations, this future feels real. The slow pace also establishes the beauty of this modern world, established through impressive cinematography, Vangelis's great soundtrack and of course the special effects. This is by far one of the best looking films of all time, and personally that look is really able to draw me in where the film might bore others. Some argue the story and characters are what hold this film back, however I would disagree. No one argues that Rutger Hauer's performance is bad, but many have problems with Harrison Ford's Deckard. To me, he is a sad depressed man who drinks, and abuses women. It's more subtle, and we can see that Rachel in the film probably doesn't like him at all, but just needs to find refuge. The whole replicant/human discussion is definitely interesting, and I won't spoil anything for someone who hasn't seen the film so they discover the debate for themselves. Honestly I don't have a clear idea, the movie works either way, but I am still not sure. Hopefully 2049 doesn't answer the question for me. Blade Runner is one of the greatest sci fi films ever made, and to me it changed the face of cinema and sci fi films forever.",

Even the most fantastic imagery comes from some of the most basic things, such as smoke from a cigarette glimmering in sunlight. In Blade Runner, Earth has become numb to such a dazzling gift life is, which allows a deeper exploration through Harrison Ford's well preformed slowly realizing Rick Deckard and Rutger Bauer's Roy Batty.

I'll start with a positive note ; Everything in this film looks absolutely fantastic. For design and production it gets a 10/10. But asside from that, the movie gives me pretty much nothing else to enjoy. The plot was uninteresting and the pacing was too slow. Besides Rutger Hauers character, all the other characters in this movie were among the most boring and monotone I have ever seen, which makes me not care about any of them. All that happened in the movie was basically just Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer going from place to place to interrogate people and kill them.

On the other hand, the movie offers a different perspective; it's more emotional, more dramatic. Looks like this is another example where both the movie and the book are good in different ways, both are essential. It doesn't matter if you read the book before or after the movie; in fact, the movie motivated me to read the book!
In the book, you progressively get the general idea and philosophy; the movie is rushing everything towards the end - and this way, it feels more dramatic.
The eyes are the most prominent symbol in the movie (in my opinion)... ""just eyes"".

Should robots be treated as humans? Are robots actually a new life-form? These and other deep questions are asked in this film and are still being asked in today's world.

146,26 October 2006,inkblot11,10, The world does not need another review of this extraordinary movie but here goes anyway,"Decker (Harrison Ford) lives in 2019 Los Angeles. He is a mostly retired blade runner, that is, a person who hunts down replicants and eliminates them. Replicants are manufactured human beings that do work on the ""off colonies"" of far space that regular human beings have populated, too. Replicants, who are vital in the colonies, are forbidden to come to planet earth. If they do, they are tracked down and killed. Most of them have superior physical powers but lack problem solving and reasoning skills and have few emotions. Although Decker wants to be retired, a particularly lethal group of replicants manages to come to earth and the big boss police chief makes it clear to Decker that he is needed. Or else. Decker begins to hunt down the four replicants on the loose, just as he meets a lady named Rachel, who may be a replicant, too, and a very pretty one. Is there really a world of difference between humans and replicants? What have we really done to ourselves and our civilization by making these ""almost"" human beings? This is one of the greatest movies of all time. The story is taken from a work by Philip K. Dick and is superior science fiction. Ford embodies the morally confused but determined blade runner very well. The other actors, especially Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, do fine work, too. However, the style of the film is the movie's greatest asset. The seamy modern world that Ridley Scott and his companions have created is beyond wonderful. From the flying transport machines that bark out advertisements to the people below to the decayed buildings from another era, this is a world one has to see to appreciate.

Drenched (literally and figuratively) in symbolism, style and mood, this cryptic film is more remembered for the striking visuals than the relatively simplistic story. Much has been written about director Ridley Scott's bleak dystopian vision and about the numerous versions (and the studio politics that created them). Having seen the film when it first came out in 1982, I remember the noir-ish voiceover that was absent on the version I recently watched on Netflix (presumably the longer, less expositional 'final cut'). The imagery in the film is marvelous (although there is little variation) and the crowded, culturally chaotic, media- and rain-saturated city established a novel 'future look' that was much imitated in later sci-fi films.

And of the hero, Deckard (Harrison Ford), all we can say for sure is that director Ridley Scott has left clues in various versions of his film that can be used to prove that Deckard is a human -- or a replicant. The biggest change Scott made in earlier versions was to drop the voice-over narration from the 1982 original. Spoken by Ford, channeling Philip Marlowe, it explained things on behalf of a studio nervous that we wouldn't understand the film. Since much of the interest in the film has been generated by what we weren't sure we understood, that turned out to be no problem. The ending has been tweaked from bleak to romantic to existential to an assortment of the above, and shots have come and gone, but for me the most important change in the 2007 version is in the print itself. The action follows Deckard, a ""blade runner"" who is assigned to track down and kill six rebel replicants who have returned illegally from off-worlds to earth, and are thought to be in Los Angeles. (The movie never actually deals with more than five replicants, however, unless, as the critic Tim Dirks speculates, Deckard might be the sixth). Replicants, as you know, are androids who are ""more human than human,"" manufactured to perform skilled slave labor on earth colonies. Ridley Scott is a considerable director who makes no small plans. His credits include ""Alien,"" ""Legend,"" the inexplicable ""1492: Conquest Of Paradise,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and the brilliant ""Matchstick Men,"" and his ""American Gangster"" opened Friday in theaters. He has the gift of making action on a vast scale seem comprehensible. I have been assured that my problems in the past with ""Blade Runner"" represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it, and now released his fifth version?",

I've come to find that the way I approach the movie has changed so much from when I first saw it years ago-- elements I originally viewed as flaws, such as Deckard being far less sympathetic and engaging than his replicant quarry, are actually strengths. That Deckard is more machine-like and cold than his prey is precisely part of the point the film is making about humanity in the modern world, not unlike HAL 9000 being far more human than the flesh and blood human beings in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.",

Death is in demand of one source onto another with Deckard hired to eliminate six Replicants. They were created as slaves with a four year life span but they resemble humans with phony memories programmed within. Six of these Replicants escape and attempt to break into the Tyrell Corporation in hopes of discovering an answer to life extension. Ridley Scott's masterpiece of phenomenal flying vehicles, huge skyscrapers and giant billboards. Scott previously made Alien but here he creates an even bigger achievement. Harrison Ford plays Deckard, skilled Blade Runner who hates the nature of it. Sean Young plays Rachael who denies being a Replicant and comes to find solitude with Deckard. Rutger Hauer steals scenes as the Replicant leader who delivers one of the greatest final speeches after a brutal cat and mouse game where the value of life is met. Daryl Hannah plays Pris who seeks refuge with genetic creator J.R. Sebastian. Hannah takes on a fetching punk image and delivers a mean cartwheel. William Sanderson plays J.F. Sebastian, an inventor of toys, whose condition has him aging before his time. Theme of human worth result in an electrifying science fiction masterpiece. Score: 10 / 10",

On the other hand, the acting was adequate at best, the dialogue felt very eighties goofy, and the score was downright terrible. It's the only movie I can think of where the score actually made it worse. It also chose to forgo any sort of introspection and speculation and laid everything out too plainly in an in your face style. While the last action sequence was quite well done, it lacked power due to the film's inability to create stakes that you felt invested in. It also didn't help that the characters were quite one dimensional and I didn't care about them one bit. But yeah, the visuals and world building were good enough to partially save the film.",

Yet, I prefer the original version of Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER that features narration. Read as a flat monologue by Harrison Ford, the narration is relatively minor and it is bland and lacking any sense of humor or style. And though it does provide some fresh details, it really isn't dramatically necessary. Yet, the voice-over works, I think, because it is so banal; in a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, the narration's absence of any sense of poetry grounds the film. It contrasts with the overwhelming stylistics of the film as a whole. It gives us something real -- something human -- in an overcrowded world of eye-popping fantasy.",

214,21 December 2006,RResende,10, Impressionism in dystopic contours,"First of all, Blade Runner is not about a story, it's not about, characters, it's not about being concrete. It's about landscape, it's about city, as reflex of civilization. It's about correcting our present, knowing what happened in the past. And so, the future is used, so the sci-fi mood is brought. Paradoxal it may be, the future tense gives the viewer the necessary distance towards what he is supposed to ""see"". And what you see is in here fundamental, not because of the spectacular sets, not because the astonishing prediction of what city will be in years to come but because it only shows what's already in front of us. Practically every sci-fi film that tries to predict an entirely new city is based on what is ""futuristic"" in the time of its idealization, from visual power masterpieces like Metropolis, to franchised versions of a future world like Demolition Man. Ridley Scott proposes a city that exists already, today, now. We get to the future through present, our present and that links us to it where the future tense gave us distance. Everything is deliberately thrown in a dystopic, chaos like package, that shakes, not because it's dark and rainy, but because it's in a city that exists now, and in buildings older than a century now. Sebastian lives in a neoclassic building from probably end of XIXth century, the routs of everything clearly bad and distorted and perverse in this Scott's future are clearly anchored on our present. Obviously every sci-fi director is before anything else, an earth inhabitant, so his base is his reality as a earthier, but in here, he makes the effort to through that at the viewer.",

217,4 November 2019,MickeyTheConstant,9, Quality Science Fiction,"Have seen this so many times now but had not watched it for a while. Then went to see it performed with a live soundtrack at the Royal Albert Hall. The show and performance was immense. Anyway back to the movie, great plot, great cast, great special effects. Has not really dated at all. The version I saw was the directors cut, which does not feature Deckards voiceover, which is a shame as I really like that and feel it adds something more to the movie. The one thing I really realised this time round was that it was difficult to identify who the heroes and victims really were in this. I always obviously rooted for Deckard but his profession is not that admirable really. The replicants actually care for each other and have feelings that few actual humans actually demonstrate in the movie. Yes the replicants are violent but at the same time they are only trying to survive. Providing them with feelings and emotions is cruel and then to ultimately end their life abruptly is a horrible way to go. They want answers, revenge, to live a decent life. They are treated like robots which essentially they are, but they have human feelings. You very much feel for them where as the humans, even Deckard at times are the aggressors and have very few redeeming features. The way Deckard seduces Rachael is actually quite rough. Knowing she is a replicant and also that she is very vulnerable makes it all very awkward to watch. Still a great science fiction movie, one of the very best ever.",

220,16 January 2017,KineticSeoul,10, A sci-fi noir cyberpunk materpiece,"To sum up this film, it's a classic sci-fi masterpiece that delves deep into existential and philosophical elements. How human's will try to create slaves or beings that will do work that they don't want to do or will not do. How everyone is looking for comfort and how some people will seek pleasure and comfort even if others are affected negatively by it. How people will give up integrity and stop with the search of wisdom for wits and how to take advantage of others for their own benefits. This film might come off pretentious to some audiences with it's visuals and style of it. But I thought the visuals and style of it actually compliments the intellectual aspects of this film. Even if it lacks in dialogue, the visuals really does bring about the grim and dark reality of the future. This isn't a film that I would watch over and over again. But for it's rare watch for me, it's stunning and psychotic when it comes to the characters and the dystopian setting. Harrison Ford was the it adventure and sci-fi adventure guy in the 70's and 80's. And he was almost the perfect choice to play an ex-police officer Rick Deckard. His job as a ""Blade Runner"" is to track down and hunt for replicants, basically human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth. They have a very short life span and is thought of as disposable and expendable by the humans. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a intimidating, manipulative and violent character that I have a lot of sympathy for. He is a character that is portrayed as a villain because of the setting and situation. And yet Roy Batty is a character that just about anyone can have understanding and empathy towards. Ridley Scott tried to emulate certain aspects of ""Blade Runner"" into his few other films such as ""Prometheus"". Other artists, directors and even video gamer designers took elements from this movie. Hideo Kojima being one of them when it came to his work in ""Snatcher"" was inspired and influenced by this film. Overall this is a sci-fi noir cyberpunk masterpiece that is most definitely worth the watch.",

The story is undeniably interesting, and Harrison Ford is at the peak of his acting career, but there's something about it that I just haven't been able to grasp. Granted, the second viewing was more rewarding than the first, likely because my expectations were significantly lowered. However, the slow pace and inconsistent tone are still things that plague this sci-fi ""classic"". I re-watched Blade Runner in anticipation for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, and perhaps that film will enhance my appreciation for the original, but for now, I'm leaving this film as it is.

Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder."" Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions.

Grim yes, but not as grim as some of the experiences that Deckard has throughout the movie. Ridley Scott gives the movie a setting as grim as the one in ""Alien"".

After all of what's gone on and after all the venturing and the talking and the process of investigation, it boils down to one 'evil' character, who's a machine, and one 'just' character, a human-being, interacting; at which point we realise the human-being was a genre archetype and a plain old character following orders given to him by a larger force whereas the robot was a wandering, free spirit whom dared to dream and craved more out of life. The human comes across as more machine-like than the machine, with the machine coming across as more emotional and feeling-filled than the member of the human species. Such is the richness of Blade Runner that tn a lesser film, this exchange wouldn't have taken place and the character of Roy might've been a homicidal robot with a mindless agenda.",

They are what one sees with one's own eyes, in the mirror, and all around one. If you follow the film closely.

This is ""film noir meets the thinking man's science fiction"". It's largely a classic detective film noir set in a dystopian future. Extremely heavy on visual style, the film truly demonstrates the degree to which film can be considered art, capturing emotion and wonder with visuals that take their time, poised and patient enough to give the mind and emotions ample opportunity to lose themselves within, not to mention one of the most appropriately moving scores to ever accompany a film. This is Ford at his very best. This is Rutger Hauer in his finest form (his performance herein likely only equaled by that in Ladyhawke). This is Sean Young presenting a classic model of the vulnerable female lead from a fresh perspective. The patient, deliberate method with which Ridley Scott presents to you each and every scene captures the very essence of visual storytelling. This is one of the very best presentations of the theme of what it means to be human in a crowded world of machines. Most importantly, this is a film that will inspire generations to become film-makers. Thank you so very much for your glorious vision and immeasurable body of work Ridley Scott.",

The replicants are on what turns out to be a deadly mission of their own. Along the way Ford hooks up with Young, together they make the movie.

263,4 October 2017,frederikbarndorff,10, Masterpiece with perfect flaws,"Blade Runner is a 1982 sci-fi, noir film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Rutger Hauer. The film was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peopless. The film is based on Phillid K. Dicks novel: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? There exists multiple cuts of the film, the most prominent being the theatrical cut, the director's cut and the final cut, which is the version i will be reviewing. We follow Blade Runner, Rick Deckard who is assigned to to ""retire"" 4 Replicants on Earth. The film is set in future Los Angeles where the replicants try to find there maker: Dr. Eldon Tyrell. Deckard now has to find the replicants in the polluted City before they can get to Dr. Tyrell. When i first saw Blade Runner i was quite disappointed, i thought the pacing was awful and the chemistry between Young and Ford was non-existing. However, after my second and third viewing something changed. It was also surprising to me that i was drawn back to the film again after the first viewing. I simply couldn't get Blade Runner out of my head and after the third viewing it became one of, if not my favorite film of all time. I began to take notice of all the small details that Ridley Scott put in the film. I discover something new every time i see the film. What also made me love Blade Runner is all the ways it can be interpreted. The themes of what it means to be human and life are strong themes, treated with such complexity through the visuals. What has been said a million times is that this is a beautiful film. I would say it's probably the most beautiful film i've ever seen. The film contains the best miniature work since Star Wars. The performances are a little mixed. Rutger Hauer gives in my opinion the best performance in the film. Ford gives a decent performance, Ford didn't really enjoy the shoot and Worning with Scott and he does come off as uninterested in some scenes, but i think it works for the film. It is a film noir and for that reason Fords' cold performance works. He really reminds you of the classic Humprey Bogart detective. It's Sean Youngs first film role, but she gives a decent performance. I've already talked about the visuals, but another standout feature of the film is it's music. The score by Vangelis is very unique and fits the film perfectly. The atmosphere of the film is enhanced to perfection by the score.

Because reading this means that you've probably seen this crap of the movie, and you're wondering what happened, how this tedious, ugly, pointless crap could possibly be so highly rated? As one other reviewer pointed out, to call this movie overrated is just not enough. This movie is supposed to be philosophical. What is the meaning of life, what is the point of death, why must I die? Well, there are hundreds of movies and books out there dealing with this subject, and every single one of them does a 1000 times better job at it than this movie. BTW, try reading the Bible and the Gospels for answers about life and death. Since other reviewers have pointed out the terribly slow pace of the movie (the only other movie that was this slow was first Star Trek movie ""the slow motion picture"" - don't watch that one, either), I will write about something else - the ugliness. First of all, the creators of this ""masterpiece"" have used the irritating cliché of setting the entire film at night. It's always dark, in every single scene. Every single room is ugly. The makeup is ugly. The whole damn thing looks like a hell hole full of broken drug addicts, and the music contributes to the feeling. I felt mild nausea throughout the whole thing. There are a few visually interesting scenes of Los Angeles from above (at night, of course), but the most prominent thing in those scenes are gigantic videos (placed as advertisements on buildings) of Asian women swallowing pills. Maybe the best symbol, of how wrong the makers of this movie were about the future, were prominent advertisements for Atari and Pan Am. While they drive flying cars in 2019, they watch TV on old sets which look like from 1970s. It's just a terrible movie, overall.",

Harrison Ford is to be one of the greatest actors alive who did such amazing movies like Star Wars and The Fugitive, had a wooden performance like a children's toy. I found him to be quite a boring character of Blade Runner. The movie was very dark and the film was just too serious.

The positive side is that the film was very stylish and had a lot of cool inventions and nice scenery for a 80's film.

285,22 November 2021,michaelheiser-25099,9, The glimpse of our future,"The glimpse of our future ; for the pure subject to have reflection is for it to automatically realise, nihilistically, that consciousness is itself nothing. Unless this happens, the replicant remains a ""simpersonator"", able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard, the pure subject would not go from ""it does not know what it is"" to ""it now knows what it is"", but from ""it does not know what it is"" to ""it knows it cannot know what it is becoming"", which is the kind of morbidly fked up place Cronenberg now resides. But, philosophically, ""Blade Runner"" doesn't go this extra mile. If the film is about nostalgia and loss, it remains trapped on the level of thinking in terms of ""memories"" and ""death"". IE - whether replicant or human, memories aren't ours and all existence ends in death, as bemoaned by one dying, rain-drenched replicant. In this regard, the film is a lamentation more in the style of such Westerns as ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""The Wild Bunch"". Indeed, ""Blade Runner's"" screenwriter, David Peoples, injects many western motifs into the film, borrows heavily from ""High Noon"" (a 1952 western that features a lone bounty hunter tasked with killing four outlaws) and would himself go on to write ""Unforgiven"". Fused with these are director Ridley Scott's motifs - an emphasis on eyes, photographs, pictures etc - (photographs are objects of place, sentiment, history, and memory. Similarly, phrases like ""we get the picture"" or ""world picture"" show that consciousness can be discussed in terms of a picture) all of which stress the recording and capturing of memories.",

It might have had to do with the fact that at the time I was expecting the magic and excitement of Star Wars (especially from a movie with Harrison Ford in it), and Blade Runner didn't quite measure up to that standard.

It was not the movie we were expecting, and we were certainly not pleasantly surprised. It was marketed to us as an action film, yet the actual action sequences were few, far between, and frankly rather boring, especially in contrast with Harrison Ford's usual daring escapades. I generally enjoy think pieces, but this one was an exception. I found the plot to be a bit hard to follow, and nothing about it made me want to put in the effort or the second viewing needed to fully comprehend what was happening. For example, the nudity was completely gratuitous, and Harrison Ford gave, in my opinion, the weakest performance of any movie I've seen him in. I don't want to give away the ending, as it seems that most people love this movie, but I felt it was not a good resolution to the story, and that in particular a speech given by one of the characters was trite and not nearly as life-changing as it thought it was.

302,9 May 2002,supertom-3,10, One of the greatest movies ever!!,"The ultimate sci-fi film and pretty much one of the greatest, most visually arresting movies ever made. Blade Runner is a true cinema classic, not a box office success and not taken too well on its original release but it has since become a cult classic, critically acclaimed and in 90 percent of movies buffs top five movies. The film has spawned countless imitations of its dank futuristic world but the imagary has never been bettered, it has also created a debate that has run since it first hit the screens in 82, that debate being `is Deckard a replicant?', this has never been answered and I doubt ever will, Harrison Ford says one thing and Ridley says another. The film itself is pure brilliance, the visuals are striking, this film is certainly before its time and the special effects even now look top draw. The imagery created is exceptional with the futuristic world leaving you tongue protrudingly engrossed. As well as the visuals the plot is quite good too. Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner, a sort of cop/bounty hunter who hunts down beings known as replicants and kills them. The replicants were created to serve us but a small group in an outworld colony go bezerk and start killing humans, this means that all Replicants must be destroyed. The story has elements that obviously inspired the Terminator films and while some people call Arnie the ultimate cyborg I have to say for me Rutger Hauer is the ultimate bad guy in the artificial human category. This film launched him to cult status, he steals the show here as he has in other stand out bad guy performances in Nighthawks and the Hitcher. Hauer exudes an evil charisma in this film as the leader of a small group of murderous replicants, Roy Batty. Hauer really is chilling at times and he has an intimidating presence on screen, his lines are classic including the legendary tears in the rain speech at the end, which Hauer himself wrote. The other actors are very good, Harrison Ford is at the top of his form as Deckard and the two gorgeous ladies Daryll Hannah and Sean Young are also good. This is a must see movie, I eagerly await the re-release on DVD as my current copy is dissapointingly bereft of features. Overall I must give this 10/10",

The whole movie is like that... mostly slow, with a burst of action here and there. I don't know if this was on purpose or not... but as a result, I found the movie mostly dull. Just for the record, I wasn't expecting a huge action-packed sci-fi shoot-everything-you-see extravaganza. The plot is pretty good, just very oddly paced. The acting is pretty much flawless.

309,15 July 2007,blanbrn,8, Underrated sci-fi classic. Cool and flashy and memorable photography and scenes.,"In 1982 Ridley Scott sure was on fire with this directing and take on showing a future look of Los Angeles. The cinematography and background scenes of this film are flashy, neat, and well done they make the film memorable. Especially when the viewer first glances and sees the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. and the screen of images on the sides of the big buildings. Set in 2019 in Los Angeles you have Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard a blade runner who's assigned to protect the city and future from criminals. This film is more than sci-fi you get to see a romance develop with Ford's character with a female named Rachel(Sean Young in an early role). Also performances from such names as Daryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos, and M. Emmet Walsh are worth a watch. Overall an underrated sci-fi classic good work from Ridley especially in 1982 for trying to show a future L.A. most memorable is the cinematography and flashy images of the background make this film such a classic.",
310,20 January 2018,serafinogm,10, The most incredible movie to come out in the early 1980's!,"A film classic that I simply can't rank as the best science fiction movie of all time, as some have (after all '2001: A Space Odyssey' preceded it by over a decade), but it sure as hell ranks as one of the best! I was mesmerized throughout. I saw the version where Harrison Ford added narration and perspective, his perspective, as events unfolded. Rutger Hauer's performance was incredibly powerful in particular his final words as his life came to it's engineered end: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."" If you haven't seen Rutger in this scene look it up on the internet, better yet see the film! There are several versions of 'Blade Runner' at this point (e.g. the Director's Cut) but I still prefer the original, but see them all as they are all available in a box set. Positively an all time classic with an incredible dystopian vision of the future.",

312,6 October 2017,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, An intelligent and ambiguous sci-fi noir that's never afraid to make its audience think thanks to its interesting ideas and subtly significant subtext.,"'Blade Runner (1982)' is a slow-burn, for sure, and its
nuts-and-bolts plot is almost nothing compared to the supplementary story that runs along side it, but this science-fiction film-noir is a remarkably intelligent and self-assured piece that tackles grand themes and interesting ideas with a real confident verve. It also treats its audience with respect, to the point that many will miss a lot of the subtle yet significant subtext placed within the tangibly grimy future the flick convincingly presents. While the unpolished yet awe-inspiring visual vistas and hauntingly beautiful synth soundtrack are what immediately grab your attention, it's the quiet contemplative moments where the picture finds its own identity as one which values the existential questions its audience must inevitably ask far more than action set-pieces or an 'appeal to all' mentality. It's a very unique and introspective picture that never calls attention to itself but should keep you thinking long after its sombre and ambiguous end. 7/10.",

Even thought the studio had there way to some extent (cutting part of Scotts original vision in order to increase profits) this was not a film made to appeal to a mass market audience. Anyone looking for a generic action film with an obvious conclusion will be disappointed. For these reasons it did fail commercially on its first release in 1982.,

The second replicant attacked him, and he was given the location of the last two because they were at the apartment of the scientist they murdered. Wow, if that's all it takes to be a Blade Runner then sign me up. Even the action scenes were drawn out way too long, killing any kind of flow.

320,8 July 2005,jboothmillard,8, Blade Runner,"I had seen this film a few times, but perhaps never really got into the swing of it, so I watched it twice on the same day, this definitely helped me appreciate it much more as a great classic, based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip K. Dick, directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator). Basically in Los Angeles in 2019, artificial humans were bioengineered some time ago, these are known as ""replicants"", but after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony ""replicants"" were declared illegal, a LAPD cop specialising in detecting replicants, called a ""Blade Runner"", must terminate them, termination is called ""retirement"". Retired police officer Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and brought to his former supervisor Bryant (Wild Wild West's M. Emmet Walsh) who informs him that four replicants have escaped and hijacked a ship back to Earth, they are trying to extend their their lifespan. These replicants are Leon Kowalski (Brion James), Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and Pris (Daryl Hannah), Deckard initially refuses the assignment to retire them, but Bryan threatens him, he reluctantly agrees and carries out a test at Tyrell Corporation used for Nexus-6 models, the assistant of Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), experimental replicant Rachael (Sean Young), believes herself to be human, given false memories, but a more extensive test is required. Roy and Leon do their own investigation to find a way to extend their lifespan, which for a replicant is four years, and they learn about genetic designer J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), Pris later finds him and manipulates him to gain her trust, Rachael meanwhile visits Deckard herself and tries to prove her humanity, showing him a family photo, but he explains that her memories are implanted, taken from a real person, she leaves in tears. Deckard finds and searches Leon's hotel room, he is then lead to the strip club where Zhora works, he chases and kills her, Bryant then comes and tells him to kill Rachael, who has departed from Tyrell Corporation, he does spot her in a crowd, but is attacked by Leon, until Rachael kills him using Deckard's gun. While Deckard and Rachael return to his apartment where he promises not to hunt her, they share an intimate moment, and he stops her from leaving, meanwhile at Sebastian's apartment Roy tells Pris the others are dead, Sebastian reveals he also has a short lifespan, due to the genetic premature aging disorder ""Methuselah Syndrome"". They go together to see Dr. Tyrell at his penthouse, Roy demands more life from his maker, Tyrell says that this is impossible, dismisses doing ""questionable things"" and praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life, Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him, Sebastian manages to escape alone in the elevator. Deckard finds Sebastian's apartment and ambushed by Pris, he manages to kill her just as Roy returns, Roy's body is starting to shut down, he chases Deckard through the building up to the roof, Deckard tries to jump across to another roof, but ends up hanging, Roy jumps across to watch him as his grip loosens, but Roy hoists him onto the roof and saves him. In his last moments of his life Roy delivers a monologue about how his memories are about to be lost (this was improvised by Hauer), Deckard watches silently as Roy dies in front of him. Gaff arrives and shouts to his Deckard, ""It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?"", he returns to his apartment and finds Rachael there, depending on the version you are watching, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape. There are three versions of the film to watch: the 1982 original, the 1992 Director's Cut (which drops Ford's narration and has a bleaker ""happy ending""), and 2007's The Final Cut (where Scott had complete artistic control, and contains an extended unicorn dream sequence). Ford is really good as the gloomy but determined ex-cop, Young is suitably mysterious, Hauer is exceptional as the nasty android with fake memories of a nonexistent childhood, and the supporting cast members do well also, it is well directed by Scott, and the story is interesting and relatively easy to follow, but what really makes this film ahead of its time is the neon-drenched metropolis, the darkened world full of flying vehicles and cool looking buildings, it is a fantastic futuristic science- fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Score for Vangelis (Chariots of Fire), Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

321,19 October 2017,WhiteFire404,9, Blade Runner - Review,"This is a film that took me at least 3 viewings to fully appreciate (Like most people apparently), now is one of my favorite films of all time. Blade Runner is in every way, a flawed master pieces, a film that has problems that everyone overlooks because of how good the film itself is, the visuals are by far the stand out of the movie, they still look outstanding, so many years later, and the special effects have barely aged for the most part, the environments were definitely something unique for their time and you can see how they became an influence for so many films of the genre that came after it,the world feels alive, real and it's an amazing achievement, the directing by Ridley Scott is one of the best I have seen in his entire career and the musical score by Vangelis is fantastic and the script is excellent, the story while pretty straightforward, there are so many details that requires you to pay attention to fully understand what is happening or in some cases, what might be happening, Harrison Ford also delivers in my opinion one of the best performances of his career, through the entire film i didn't saw Ford, I saw Deckard. The film has flaws that lie mostly in some scenes that do drag a bit too much and some plot elements here and there that could either be shorten or skipped entirely, but like I said, those flaws are overcome by everything the film does right and that's why Blade Runner is to this day considered a master piece.",

When a movie is slow, you are kept on edge because something is about to go down, but I didn't feel that anticipation at all in blade runner. However, the movie is incredibly thought provoking, and you will be wanting answers. But watch the directors cut. That's the one you want, because that one raises the most questions. Overall, this movie carries through due to its brilliant message and social commentary, and it's stellar performances. It's a good movie, but not yet, in my opinion, one of the greats.",
324,22 October 2011,The-Sarkologist,9, A dark vision of the future.,"The critics seem to say that the visuals in this movie are outstanding but the rest of the movie is somewhat dry. I have a differing opinion on this matter: if we take the movie purely on its visuals, and even on the action, then we loose a large part of what this movie is about. Ebert's comment on the unrealistic nature of Tyrell's death is unimportant for if one is concerned more about how the replicant got into his office then you have missed the entire point of this scene.",
325,27 January 2021,maue-19674,10, Beautiful Dystopia - the greatest most influential Sci-Fi Film ever made,"I remember the first time a saw Blade Runner - a thoroughly stunning experience overall - although the narration was distracting and the end just didn't match the overall dark tone of the Film. You can imagine then how I felt when it became apparent that Director Ridley Scott wanted to remove both! Whether you see the 'Director's Cut' or the recent 'Final Cut', Blade Runner is simply a dystopian visual masterpiece about where mankind is heading and the consequences of creating ever more complex AI. Loosely based on the Phil Dick novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' Scott's vision is a dark, resonant, neon-lit cityscape, where giant Corporate adverts play in the rainy gloom. Rick Deckard is a 'Blade Runner' - an investigator who hunts down any 'replicants' (artificially created human-forms) who have rebelled against their programming. The new Nexus 6 are a problem - if they can imitate human behaviour well enough - they may be able to fool the Test that differentiates Humans from Replicants and several of the new Nexus 6 have arrived back on earth for reasons that are not immediately apparent.
The entire Film poses a fundamental question - when do artificially created entities become sentient? What rights do they have, if any? Do they 'become' Human or merely imitate our feelings? There are no easy answers here.
This is NOT Science Fiction in the Terminator-type vein - explosions, battle scenes etc. This is REAL Science Fiction, where it builds a credible world to ask difficult Questions - and what a world it is. We can forget now how extraordinary Blade Runner looked in 1982 when it was first released and maybe the reason it looks slightly more familiar these days is because the World DOES look more like the L.A of Blade Runner. Indeed, many Far-Eastern Cities look unerring like this. The design of the Film is stunning and inspired countless generations of Designers, not to mention Film Directors - Blade Runner has influenced Film like no other Science Fiction Film has.
The Cinematography is astounding - it just couldn't be anything else if you mix Ridley Scott with Jordan Cronenweth - the sheer look of the City, the streets and the interiors, all lit in a dark foreboding shadow-scape, are as 'Noir' as you can get. The Cast are superb, Harrison Ford has never been better and the support he gets from the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joe Turkel etc is spot on. The score by Vangelis fits the atmosphere PERFECTLY - the scenes in Deckard's apartment to his 'memories of green' - are just pure Art.
In conclusion, this is a Science Fiction Film that takes it's subject seriously and consequently builds it's world to a standard that is rarely matched in Cinema. Many point to Kubrick's '2001' as the finest Film in this genre - I disagree - Ridley Scott's dark dystopian beauty has quietly stolen that crown.",

If the opening shot of the dark, futuristic landscape of 2019 Los Angeles seems at all familiar, it's either because you've witnessed this cinematic masterpiece before, or seen an ill-fated attempt to recreate this grim, claustrophobic future elsewhere. Blade Runner's classic status now seems almost ironic, given the film's disastrous reception upon its original release, and the countless different versions released since. Among others, there was the original 'workprint prototype', the U.S. theatrical cut, the international theatrical cut, the broadcast version, and The Director's Cut. I think most would agree with me when I say the 'Final Cut' is the definitive version, trimmed of Harrison Ford's rambling narration and the tacked-on happy ending that borrowed unused footage from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.",

Ridley Scott has tinkered for the third time with his original work. In the 90s, his director's cut gave justice to the original piece, with no dopey narration by Harrison Ford, and a snappier ending. This time, it's just fixing famous gaffes and cleaning up the famous visual effects. I had the pleasure of seeing a showing of the ""Final Cut"" at the same theatre I saw the film throughout the 80's - the Uptown Theater in Minneapolis. I believe this is the fourth time I have viewed the film there. One thing you will be very impressed with is the quality of the print. This shall no doubt be obvious on the upcoming DVD release, as the colours are beautifully digitally enhanced. The visual effects also look very clean, and hold up very well. The cleaning up is primarily on the flying cars, they no longer have telltale black matte lines around them.",

But the characters who shared the top place are all from this film. Not so coincidentally, they are all Replicants. In the midst of a propaganda war with normalist organisations such as Cure Autism Now that want you to believe being on the autistic spectrum automatically makes one of no worth to society, Blade Runner elegantly sums up what life is really like for those of us on the higher end of said spectrum. You know, those of us who build tomorrow's computers or paint tomorrow's masterpieces, just to name a few things.

375,9 November 2010,paul2001sw-1,7, The past in the future,"The Los Angeles of the near future will, apparently, be very similar to the Los Angeles of the recent past. Yes, it's always raining, but otherwise Ridely Scott's 'Blade Runner' is set in a world recognisable from the novels of Raymond Chandler or from Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'. The fact that the plot is about androids seems a minor detail, until about two thirds of the way through, when the film becomes darker and stranger. Themes resembling those of 'Logan's Run' start to emerge (the idea of premature mortality), and although the film ends with an action sequence, it's not shot quite like a conventional all-action finale, with more of an emphasis on mood and less on viscerality. The scene is accompanied (as is much of the rest of the film) by a soundtrack that unquestionably belongs in 1982 (when the film was made), but the overall effect is actually quite moving. Still, although more ambitious than Scott's earlier 'Alien'', 'Blade Runner' is also less perfect. Some details feel like oddities, thrown in for effect without making perfect sense, and Harrison Ford (in the lead role) struggles to convey complex emotion (although he is not playing an android, but allegedly a human). But it's certainly a brave and distinctive movie, and not without intelligence either.",

There was a scene where the protagonist looks at a picture and the the director forgets that he is actually portraying past from the perspective of 2017 and the picture is black and white. You know what I mean. He shows past from 1982 only and not 2017. Its indeed a very poor movie overhyped for some unknown reasons. Watch it yourself and judge my review.",

The film centers on Ford, who is a sort of a terminator for human clones who've gone astray. Cloning is common but it is very difficult to tell a clone from a real human. Only a special eye scan test taken under questioning can tell. It takes place only about 20 years in the future, so the special effects are minimal. This isn't a typical high budget Ford film. It's totally different from anything else you've ever seen him do. Director Ridley Scott did a good job, but it's pretty much out of his usual genre also. The film also stars the gorgeous Sean Young and Darryl Hannah. Also giving a good performance is the always good Rutger Hauer. It's weird. Just plain weird.

The movie brings up the classic concept of ""what does it mean to be human,"" but then never really creates any interesting twists or plot development based on this. I doubt even back in '82 the concept of dealing with artificial life was 'that' novel. I've seen old Star Treks that dealt with the issue. Strip out all the dark lighting, rain, and slum shots and what do you have? - a boring movie. It got so old afer a while seeing the flying police cars over rainy slums.

Then there are movies like Blade Runner, where one leaves the theater, or turns off the DVD player, scratching his head. Movies like Poltergeist and The Terminator work because both stories revolve around ordinary people with ordinary lives to whom the viewers can relate. Star Wars, while not completely relatable, has such an interwoven, tightly knit story in a fantastic world, that viewers can imagine the existence of such world.

388,2 April 2019,harryplinkett14,2, Utter failure,"To sum up: this film is 100% style over story. Stylistically, this is a masterpiece that is almost impossible to match. The visuals are amazing, the world the film creates, however unrealistic, comes across as very complex and persuasive. Attention to detail is astounding, costumes are great, sets are impressive, lighting is just beautiful, music is haunting and unforgettable. It's an artistic effort that truly impresses. BUT: where is the story? I have watched this film many times, and I could never get immersed in the story, especially the moral message. It is all so superficial and useless. What really irritated me is that the film never develops the love story it starts. The love story should have been the emotional and intellectual core of the film. All the issues a 'replicant' can face, regarding their identity, purpose, or attitude towards death, could have been explored through the love story. Hell, you didn't even need Rutger Hauer and his gang of weirdos who go around killing people. The climax of the film should have involved Harrison Ford and his love interest. If Hauer was to be in the climax, he should have tried to kill the girl and not Ford. That would have been far more satisfying. Instead, the women disappears from the plot as soon as the love story starts, and we watch Hauer go on his vendetta. I did not want to see him and I didn't need to see all those action scenes. This film never should have been an action film to begin with, but rather a detective love story in the film noir style. The action just ruined it all, as far as I'm concerned. Also, this film is such a masterpiece in terms of style, and screams 'A movie', yet Hauer, as likable as he is, is an icon of B movies. This didn't sit too well with me. I felt like I was watching two films: one a B movie with Hauer wreaking havoc, and the other a detective film noir with a doomed love story. And the two don't fit well together.",

The storyline is there but there is no ending to it but a wildly bizarre film from Ridley Scott if you ask me. Very Overrated and lacking the heart of most critically acclaimed films in my opinion. It also lacked a lot of the comedic relief in which we are blessed with in Ford's other Sci Fi Masterpieces such as Star Wars.

Well, there are a series of plot holes: One plot hole is that there are said to be six replicants at first, but then for some reason even when none have been killed, it is said to be 4 with no explanation. There is also no reason for the replicants to be murdering a bunch of random people. Plus because of reasons that will spoil this film, wouldn't the geniuses that created the replicants build them so that they won't kill people and steal spaceships? This is completely illogical and idiotic. That's not all. The film is also VERY BORING. Even though I watched the whole movie, I lost interest in the first 10 minutes and nearly fell sleep.

Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design. Based on Philip K. Dick's cult genre novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. This edition dismisses the droning narration (incidentally Ford did this on purpose when the studio forced director Ridley Scott to include it for clarity in protest but ironically appropriate for his Philip Marlowesque character) and restore its original ending. Visionary film-making at its best. My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up. Time to die.'

With beautiful visuals, it's retro futuristic music, a Neo-noir feel and characters that help movie many of the themes of the movie forward. This is one timeless cult classic that I will never get tired of. A movie that will leave you with a foreboding feel from start to finish that makes you have a feel of paranoia. The movie uses literature, religious symbolism and dramatic themes that show how technology has effected us in more ways than one. With asking us to exam humanity and what truly makes us human. Which is why I feel it will never get old cause these are things that we will never truly have an answer for.",
404,11 February 2002,JumeirahSun,10, Deep as an urban ocean,"Blade Runner is one of those movies you either get or you don't.  Some people find it bizarre and disturbing.  My father loves this movie and I watched it for the first time with him.  Blade Runner is complex and entrancing--the special effects still blow me away.  The gritty world created by Scott in this film is so believable that I wanted to become part of it.  Many fans of Dick's writing hold the movie up to the book, pointing out ""mistakes"" and other changes the script makes to Deckard and to the plot, but I think this is an erroneous argument.  Scott's film shows us a realistic portrayal of what city life might become, and focuses less on the man vs. machine theme of the book.  The two should be enjoyed as separate works, for each is superior in its own way.  Scott's Blade Runner is film noir meets sci-fi, and the result is magical.  Vangelis' floating, mysterious score doesn't hurt things, either; in fact, without it, I dare to say that the impact of the movie would not be as great.",

Based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K Dick, this was director Ridley Scott's second sci-fi film after Alien (1979). It's set in L.A. of 2019, which is now a polluted dystopia full of huge overbearing billboards and enormous skyscraper blocks that resemble Mayan temples. The heavy clouds and constant rain ensure that all events play out in a constant darkness. In this future there are advanced androids called replicants, which are used for dangerous activities such as off-world colonisations.

Visually stunning, narratively engaging and rewarding, and worthy of repeated viewings to fully understand its depth.  This could almost be Travis Bickle's view of the future, as it bears a strong resemblance to his own New York (without the space-ships etc). The lack of constant, flowing action may turn off some people, but for the rest of us, the dialogue, the ideas, the plot, are enough to occupy our thoughts for the nights after watching it. Ford slouches through the film, effectively showing Decker to be more lifeless than the clones, but Hauer steals the film, in an impressively psychotic display, one he would perfect later in The Hitcher.

I do not know why this movie is liked by many and why it is famous. 30-40 minutes into the movie felt like 5 hours, I was sighing loudly. The phrase ""didn't age well"" couldn't apply more than on this film. In the 80s people were surprised by the quality of the special effects, but seeing it now it is horrible looking. The pacing is extremely slow, it is so bad that every scene feels like half a movie. The acting is average, long scenes of them having a long face and doing nothing. The characters are not interesting at all, he's a boring retired sleazy cop and she's a girl who stands there smoking a cigarette dramatically. The story could be told in 1 minute. All of the psychology and philosophical subjects aren't really that smart as the movie and people think they are, yeah sure robots and makers and God and life blah blah blah, the idea could be done a million times better. This movie is a perfect example of being popular and highly rated doesn't mean good. I only thought of watching it because of the many ratings and talk about it, and now I completely regret it. I don't even wanna see 2049 because of how boring this movie was. It is obvious that people only like it because of nostalgia, people whom are 30+ years old.",

No other artist could play a soundtrack of this grandeur like Papathanassiou did. In my opinion, the best soundtrack of all. The scenarios are majestic, the pace is the right one, the mood is incredible and the story still touches me. Visually this movie is absolutely stunning. My advice: don't remake the movie.

I saw it when it first came out (in 1982) and I kind of liked it, but not like everyone else loved it so much. So when the sequel opened this week and so many reviews are saying what a great follow up to the first one, I realized I needed to watch the first one again to refresh my memory. I'm glad I did. Not only will I never watch this movie again, I now don't see any reason to pay to see the sequel!

I even liked the music so much I went out and bought the cd. However, the movie itself is still disappointing. I actually had a hard time sitting through it. The story had some really good things going for it, but because of the extremely dark tone and the slow pace I found it somewhat nauseating- especially the graphic bits with eyeballs.

417,3 October 1998,dale-7,10, these are just comments - but it IS the best film I've ever seen,"So myriads of people have spoken on Blade Runner - most of whom probably have good ideas and are insightful and so on.  If you love the movie, I'm with you, but the damn thing ALWAYS makes me cry; so after about the tenth time I watched it over a 10 year period (I drink when I watch it) I finally realised that besides the very incredible cast, and the interesting story, there was something else swilling around at the bottom of the movie that inevitably made me blub at the end.  Sean Young is gorgeous of course, but so?  The real message of the movie is this: that Deckard [the protaganist], could fall in love with an android - something pretty much against ALL his training.  By the end of the movie we see that people [you, me, the protagonist] can fall in love with anything, just so long as it is able to capture your heart.  It is THE movie that is totally anti-bigot, that strips taboo down to raw emotion and declares ""if your heart WANTS this, you won't be able to stop it"".  It is a movie about forbidden love, taboo, intrigue, death and life: pretty juicy stuff.  And the unspoken message is simply 'people will give their hearts away to whoever will pay their price, and furthermore, they won't be able to help themselves'.  Because, if you remember, ol' Sean is just a machine - an appliance really, a big, complicated vaccuum cleaner with an incredibly great face, but still a machine; just a machine.  And to prove the point, there he is, the android Roy Batty who in the end loved life so much that he would not even take the life of his would-be killer.  It's THAT message about the individual: that the Nazi can fall in love with the beautiful Jewish chick; that the militant black guy can be transfixed by the innocent white girl; that the boundaries of race or creed or color, or even of flesh and blood, are actually no boundaries at all... that if Deckard can cross them, anybody can. He falls in love with an android, and shows us that no matter how you were trained or raised or brought up, there is the possibility of love... that somewhere in time, even if we are ""sushi"" - even if we are cold fish -  we can love anything, or anyone.",

430,18 December 2017,moshomaniac,10, A Dystopian Masterpiece that stands up 30 years after its original release.,"Based (very loosely) on Philip K Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", Blade Runner concerns Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford), a retired cop who is yanked out of retirement when 6 rogue androids, called replicants, make it from an off-world colony into 21st Century Los Angelos. Their crime: wanting to be human. 
So much about this film is iconic: the dystopian cityscapes, the score by Vangelis, the 'tears in the rain' speech, adlibbed by Rutger Hauer, who plays Roy Batty, the leader of the band of Replicants who tries to go to the Tyrell Corporation(the company that makes Replicants) in a desperate gamble to prolong their life-span, the list goes on and on. Blade Runner, though a commercial failure during its initial release, was re-evaluated and rightfully proclaimed one of the all-time greatest Sci-fi movies. The film is extremely slow-moving, but never boring and uninvolving, and the story, while a tad scarce makes up for it in atmosphere and character development. Very rarely has a movie been made with such skill, and the sets of 2019 L.A. are a collaborative knockout. Blade Runner has become one of the most influential movies in the last 3 decades, inspiring movies, writers, and videogames alike, and in 1993, it was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress' national film registry.

The concept was a good one, that of life like robots, A.I., cyborgs, replicants, etc. but in this day an age that story has been told a million times in a million different ways (see A.I., Terminator 1-3, Matrix, Space Odessey 2010, I,Robot, etc.) Bladerunner was interesting and distinct from the standpoint that these robots only wanted to stay alive longer than the 4 years they were designed to. The movie as a whole was alright, I just couldn't get acclimated to the idea that these robots were too life-like. They not only displayed feelings, but they had feelings for each other, they feared death, they displayed panic, passion, and they sweat and cried. But what really took the cake was Deckard (Harrison Ford) sleeping with and ultimately falling in love with what he KNEW to be a robot, and likewise she fell in love with him. That was a bit much.",

Asking that is just missing the point. Isn't just humanity the result of a conscious and rational mind? Isn't our humanity defined by our memories, our senses and feelings, our incredibly short lives compared to the ever expanding universe? Aren't we all just biological machines? So what does that make Replicants? Aren't they just the same machines but with a shorter lifespan? Living in fear, just wanting to be free - that being the 'itch they can never scratch'.

481,12 February 2020,Dello_,7, I will trigger the hardcore fans,"I'm going to say it immediately: I didn't particularly like the overall design of the futuristic Los Angeles. Ok, I've said it, I've said it. Now I'll articulate better what I think about this movie. As I said I wasn't fond of the design but not because it's ugly or what, it's just my personal taste. Indeed if we consider the time when it came out (1982), the work done is remarkable and the instances where you think: ""this has aged badly"" are like two or three and it's pretty impressive. But it wasn't for me. Even with the plot I had some problems but I liked a lot other things. The story is simple and linear and there wasn't an unexpected moment but it's instead prevedibile in a lot of ways. On the other hand I was on board because of the charismatic protagonist and the memorable villain, that steals the show every time he is on the screen. But most importantly what I liked more is the mysterious sense about some plot points. In fact, despite a linear story, there are some elements here and there that makes you wonder about the real nature of some characters and the film does not answer to these questions. And I personally like when a movie leaves you with some thinking about what's the right interpretation even if there's no a clear one.
And so overall I liked ""Blade Runner"" (the final cut) but, even if I recognised the enormous importance it has on the history of cinema, I don't think it's the masterpiece a lot of people claims this movie to be.",

485,25 September 2018,bdro-97133,10, My Favorite Movie of All Time,"When I think of Blade Runner, two defining characteristics come to my head. The first being the stunning aesthetic from beginning to end. Ridley Scott went above and beyond with his use of visual stimulation from the very first scene to the moment credits begin to roll. My second main characteristic of Blade Runner is the complex story happening in the background and the many nuanced clues that don't show themselves until the third of fourth viewing of the film. The screenplay is often seen as ""boring"" and ""slow-paced"". But after a deep analysis, nearly every second of the film is crucial to the not only the story, but the masterful tension throughout the story. 
 By itself, Blade Runner is a genre-defining film. Very few films before it had doven into the science fiction genre with such unique style. This style is a large reason for the film becoming relevant in pop culture. The dystopian pollution paired with the neon, over-stimulated, corporate propaganda make the iconic Blade Runner aesthetic that many come to know and love. The deep blues and purples and the overall dark color palette is gloomy enough to set the tone of the film but beautiful enough to keep the watcher engaged. Speaking of visuals, the CGI is crucial to the discussion. By modern standards, the CGI was decent. But for this level of detail and clarity to be achieved on such a grand scale back in 1982 is nothing short of amazing. This film is made for the movie watchers with a taste for visual beauty. 
 Even beyond the visuals, the rest of the film is fantastic. The soundtrack written by Vangelis is very fitting for the film. It's very unique, and helps guide the viewer to the themes of each scene. I could also write an entire paper on the complexity of the story itself, but I will stick to the amazing story within the story. On first viewing, the superficial story of Decker finding and killing rogue Replicants is obvious. After a deeper analysis, an even deeper story emerges. Replicants are usually easy to identify with the red tint of the pupil, and can be even better identified with the heightened strength, durability, etc. But after a deep analysis, the story quietly suggests that Decker MIGHT be the very thing he is payed to kill. A single scene with his pupils glowing for only a few frames and the Unicorn issue have sparked debates that rage on to this day. This kind of storytelling, that refuses to answer a question that would change the entire story, while also hiding the question under another story is truly amazing. 
 The core message of Blade Runner takes all of the different story elements and squishes them down into a single question. ""What does it mean to be human?"" The answer to that question is different for everybody, and that is just another layer of genius in this story. There is no true answer. No one can definitively say where human consciousness ends and the mind of a Replicant begins. Many believe that emotions are the key to being human, Decker's love interest (key word: LOVE), Rachel, is confirmed to be an experimental Replicant. This is the genius of this film. The key question of the film is intentionally complicated in order for the watcher to come to their own conclusions. The line between humans and Replicants is blurred and bordering on non-existant.
 In conclusion, Blade Runner is a masterpiece. The color palette is dark yet stunning, the soundtrack is subtle yet engaging, the pace of the story is slow yet efficient, the story is unique yet amazing, and the message is valid yet frightening. If you haven't watched it, do it. If you have, why not watch it again?",

Even the beauty of our selfdestructive nature that we cannot comprehand. When I watched Blade Runner for the first time it was in the early 80's theater and I was overwhelmed as some visitor of Louvre whose tears roll down his cheeks because he cannot handle too much beauty, too much truth about ourselves and our world.

489,28 January 2019,RoboMouse,4, Legendary Classic or Distorted Rating?,"Goodness! 'Blade Runner' (1982) scores 8.2/10 out of over 600,000 IMDb-users.
When that movie appeared, I was just finishing school and loved Ridley Scotts 'Alien' (1979), one of the greatest SF-movies ever made. Like so many others, I was eager to see Scott's next strike, but the disappointment was all over the place - most who went to see it uttered explicit warnings. It was perceived as extremely boring, with a thin narrative plot stretched to the limits, so that the entire movie seems to be in slow motion. No thrill at all, no tension. The only appreciated point was its dystopic, sinister style, making this a showcase for style-over-substance-movies, which it still is today.
But part of the community apparently loves this style and gets fascinated with the dark expression of the movie's content, irrespective of how thin and stretched it may be. While these people dominate internet platforms and movie magazines, they still make only a tiny fraction of the audience out there. Public numbers indicate that about 83 million people paid to see 'Alien' but only about 8 million came to 'Blade Runner' in 1982. Yet, 'Blade Runner' was the long expected successor, meaning that over 70 million potential cinema-visitors stayed away because most of those watching 'Blade Runner' where disappointed, which spread by word of mouth. Without 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' would have probably even gone unnoticed.
The number of this audience is two orders of magitude higher than the users voting 'Blade Runner' to a top-rated legendary classic. Therefore, in reality, the audience has voted this movie (by simply ignoring it) as one of the most overrated bores in SF-history.",

It has dark and beautiful cinematography and a realistic vision of the future. Unlike other science fiction films.. (Terminator 2, Aliens) this film doesn't focus on action. Actually, action is rarely used and most of it is hand to hand combat or Deckard shooting someone. Okay, now for the acting. Harrison Ford does one of his best performances ever, he doesn't say much or do much but adds a kind of tiredness to the character. He seems to be tired of having to hunt down these replicants and feels bad for them. I think he is even a replicant himself actually. You also have that pollish guy, I can't remember his name that plays Roy Batty. He does such an amazing job of playing a villian especially with lines such as ""did a man go to your house? Police man?"", ""Its too bad these memories will be lost like tears in the rain,"" and finally ""If only you could seen what I have seen."" I really liked James Edward Almos's character even though he mostly drove Deckard around. He was the guy that did the Origami which has a surprising turn toward the end.

Instead you get a film where the hero kills without question, showing only a hint of remorse once through its entirety. Add to that the most anti-climactic ending in existence and you've got a real ""Wha?"" film. OK, so it's not what I was expecting. Well, the whole style of the movie - the music, the setting, the characters - everything oozes film noir. If you expect that, I guess you won't be too disappointed. But do you get sixty minutes of atmospheric shots spliced in between twenty five minutes of conversation that seems to leading up to something (but surprise! never does) and five minutes of two confusing fight scenes. I'll give Blade Runner credit, though: the setting is visionary, convincing and appropriately claustrophobic. I had no problem getting absorbed into the retro sci-fi setting, but maybe that's just me. The acting is just good as well, but Harrison Ford's narration is dry and robotic for some reason. Seems out of place in a film where he acts perfectly fine everywhere else. But the bottom line is this film toys with your mind.

507,20 February 2002,chris12345678,10, The most powerful SF movie ever,"This is one of my most favorite movies so don't expect me to be objective. The plot is loosely based on a short story by Philip K Dick, often called Dostoyevski of the SF field. It's about an android hunter who is called back from retirement to track down and kill dangerous runaway androids. As he finds and kills them he becomes more and more aware of their struggle to be human, of their yearning for life that can never be fulfilled. They kill their maker when they learn that they can only live a few short years; that they can never be one of us. In the final scene the hunter (Harrison Ford in one of his best roles) finally understands that in their short lives the androids had become more human than humans; that they value life more than us. That's why he was hired to liquidate them. With this film Ridley Scott proved that he is more than just a skilled moviemaker - he is an artist. Sadly, true art is usually noticed and appreciated only many, many years after its creation and it pays little. The movie has an incredible atmosphere. It may not be for everybody. If you are looking for an action flick with lots of explosions then watch ""Commando"" or other trash like that, or, better still, pour gasoline on your car and set it on fire - there will be a nice explosion and great sound effects (and if that's not enough there is the neighbor's car).

Four of these bioengineered replicants have come back to Earth, which is strictly out-of-bounds for them, struggle to elude Deckard. Scott generates some forbidding atmosphere and pits our hard-as-nails enforcer against some sympathetic but shrewd replicants. Mind you, the perfect novel doesn't always guarantee the perfect movie.

536,3 March 2010,Aaron1375,7," Great visuals, acting, and some interesting story elements.","This movie could have been an easy ten as it nearly has it all. Except for one thing that would have helped immensely. Is it the visuals you ask? No, the visuals look great even for a movie made back in 1982. It captures a futuristic city so well, a dark and grimy place with technology in areas to give it a certain color scheme. It is almost a live action anime when one looks at other films such as ""Akira"". Is it the acting you ask? No, the acting could not be better, Harrison Ford playing the lead, a man who hunts down rouge androids and Rutger Hauer is always excellent if you ask me. No one does a better job if he had a more typical Hollywood look he would have been the lead in a lot more mainstream fare. And Sean Young and Daryl Hannah look absolutely great, with Daryl looking rather hot. So is it the story? Not entirely. The story has very good elements in it and there is something there. So what is it you ask? Well I know I am going to get hammered for voicing this opinion, but keep in mind it is an opinion...the main thing I had a problem with is the lack of action. I know story and such are important and yes there are lots of movies with no action I like, but this movie was about a man hunting down dangerous androids. This alone should entail that there is going to be a lot more action in the movie than there ended up being. Though the ending was excellent and everything else in this movie was superbly done, I needed some more shoot outs, more blood, and more death. At times the pacing in the movie had me a tad bored, and while it was still nice to look at and it was nice to see the actors have some good dialog, I always kept wanting more adrenaline type action. So there I said it, and I sort of regret it as this is probably one of those movies that people will not take to kindly anything negative said about it. Overall though it was a fine movie and entertaining. I loved Ford as the hunter like I said and I always enjoy Hauer. It amazes me this movie did not do better at the box office than it did. Just the visual style of it had to be something to marvel at back in 1982. So a rather good movie that could have been nearly perfect with a bit more action.",

I dont know what it is, perhaps just the way the Hollywood sets and costumes are used in so many things - but if you watch even modern day episodes of Star trek - then a distant alien village of poor humanoids will still manage an immaculate village - and it will look as though people who have just come from the hairdressers have been handed a designer sack cloth which has just come from the dry cleaners.
So blade runner is a completely run of the mill story which has been done a million times before - which has been placed in a gritty realistic dirty future.

Like its source novel, it has a few good ideas, more bad ones, a thin plot, trite and leaden dialogue, and poor characterizations, made all the worse by mediocre to bad acting, from the always overrated Ford, to the abysmal Young, to the over the top Hauer (aptly demonstrated by his silly soliloquy) to the lifeless Hannah (both of whose portrayals do nothing to engender sympathy for the Replicants), to the quirk-infested Olmos. Add in the chemistry lacking love story between Ford and Young, and the far too long sequences designed to simply show off the visuals and inner workings of Tyrell's corporation, the muddled plot (especially in the later non-voice-over versions), and the film is a classic triumph of 'style over substance.' Even that cliché grates, despite its aptness.

Also, perhaps I'm not even entitled to write this review because I could only stand to watch the first hour of the movie before deciding to turn it off. Unbelievable? Let me explain why. This movie is perhaps one of the most touted films of all time and I had not seen it despite the movie having been around for over 20 years. So, one day, I finally decided to watch the thing and bore patiently through each boring scene after another. I'm a fan of science fiction but now I realize not in the sense of a connoisseur but just a guy who likes a good blend of action, drama, science, fiction and acting. This movie arguably has all of those things but is achingly slow in presenting them. It cannot escape looking every bit like a 1982 vision of what the future would be like and suffers too much from being implemented from an arty angle. The scenes are too dark for Harrison Ford's charms (he could easily have been replaced with someone else who didn't have Indiana Jones behind him) and the characters are much too deep to bother even trying to understand. The philosophical angle doesn't impress me either. There are many 'big questions' movies can deal with without making the audience itself lie on the couch. I suppose the last 40 minutes or so of the film might have been better and tied up some loose ends but I could not stand to waste any more time watching it. Looking at other movies from the same era which I still find very interesting - Conan The Barbarian, Indiana Jones and Alien - I'm disappointed to say that Blade Runner could have been better. Anyway, I will shoulder part of the blame because I didn't watch it to the end and perhaps because technology is moving at light speed these days, philosophical science fiction movies really look much, much older than they ought to.

Also, the characters, their motivations, some actions or feelings they ""show"" (sometimes they don't show any at all) are without any actual justifiable reason. That's why I give it an 8.

557,8 June 2023,CinemaSerf,7, Blade Runner,"This time, it is Ridley Scott's turn to offer us his prognostication of a future wherein corporate America has, ostensibly benignly, introduced the ultimate in labour saving devices - androids called ""replicants"" - which have a look and feel of people about them. These ""Nexus"" creations can turn their hands to just about anything, but when the latest off-world models rebel, all of their cousins become outlawed and it falls to the ""Blade Runners"" to track them down and destroy them. ""Deckard"" (Harrison Ford) is one such operator who is called back out of his retirement to identify four of these highly adaptable and intelligent robots and this perilous task takes him to the heart of their manufacturer run by the fiendishly clever but unscrupulous ""Tyrell"" (Joe Turkel), and into a web of duplicity surrounding their controlling protocols and maybe even a fifth, almost impossible to recognise ""replicant"", whom - unlike it's contemporaries - has no idea that it isn't human. Ford is on cracking form here, as is Rutger Hauer - the android leader ""Batty"" and the dark, frequently rainy imagery contributes wonderfully to this seedily presented story of greed and manipulation set amongst a grittily dank and hostile environment that offers little, visually anyway, by way of hope or relief. It has a film-noir look and feel to it, and Scott keeps it moving well, keeps the dialogue sparse - though impactful, and the whole thing develops cinematographically some of the pretty profound questions brought up in the original Philip Dick novel about just what constitutes humanity. Just shy of two hours - it flies by, especially on a big screen where the visuals and audio still work wonders.",

580,9 May 2001,funkyfry,10, Best Sci-Fi film of the 80s,"Blade Runner is a surprise, a delight, an enigma, and a triumph of will. Having read a book on the making of blade runner, I found out how hard it was to actually get this film made.  Like other Philip Dick adaptions, this movie preserves his interesting premises on artificial intelligence (although it completely reverses them, Dick is not a dogmatic or ideological sci-fi writer like Stanislaw Lem or Arthur Clarke, both esteemed but inferior writers next to Dick) while pasting them on a superficial action story.  Where Blade Runner becomes a great film is in the many layers of meaning contained in the film, some of which are surely unintentional to writers, director and definately actors.  This film has an A-list of fabulous character actors, many of whom are still with us:  Joanna Cassidy, Joe Turkel, J. Emmett Walsh, Edward James Olmos, and William Sanderson among others.  Daryl Hannah is only competent but the real reason Harrison Ford hates this movie (publicly) is because Rutger Hauer completely stole it from him.  Hauer's performance turns villainy inside-out, and I only wish they had given some kind of reason for his more sadistic moments -- i guess we're supposed to accept his childlike attitude about life extends to violence as well.  I think there are many facets of the relationships between the characters (particularly Ford's and Young's) that are not spelled out, so many viewers may think that the superficial action yarn is all that's going on (I remember the first time I saw it thinking it was absolutely awful). The movie's plot is pretty disjointed, but I think in this way it mirrors other successful noirs like ""The Big Sleep.""  The music is excellent, Vangelis' best work, and I can hear its influence in much of the electronic music of the 90s.  This movie is almost single-handedly responsible for the surge in widescreen format presentations on video and television, and I think for that we should all be very grateful to an all-time cult classic that gets better every year.",

The movie was only confusing to en masse hollywood audiences, where it tested poorly and received a ""happy"" ending (film-lover's bit:  the footage of sweeping hills of grains were lifted from outtakes from the credit sequence of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"").  And don't believe the all-too-obvious interpretation of the unicorn dream.   There are many layers to this movie. I think most of the extra layers come from the fact that the characters' relationships are never what they appear to be.  Scott manages to surprise the audience a lot, and turn around our notions of what good and evil may be.  But as for this ""see the non-director's version"", forget it.  The dialogue a la 50s noir movie is CHEEZY!

True, the special effects were outstanding for 1982.  Okay, I'll admit it, the effects were even good by today's standards. Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast give good performances.  There were quite a few things to like.  Unfortunately this movie suffers because it basically has 45 minutes of plot stretched out into two hours.  There are LONG gaps between dialogue.  Quite a bit of screen time is given just looking at the scenery (which, while impressive, gets tiresome after you've seen the same thing 3 or 4 times).  The grim future depicted in this film has served as a visual inspiration to many science fiction movies released in the last 20 years (The Fifth Element, A.I., and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones come to mind), but that alone is not enough reason to declare the film a classic.",

Although when Ridley Scott came out with a director's cut years later, this masterpiece was seen in an entirely new light. It's defiantly not a film for everybody, simply due to the fact that it doesn't contain much that will please the audience. The film noir, confronting plot and dystopian setting creates uneasy emotions while viewing. Although this is the underlying purpose of the film. I love how this movie challenges humanity. It really makes you question society and where it's headed. This uncomfortable movie experience is crucial in providing caution and warning for our future. I truly believe that Blade Runner is more than a film. Substantial research can take place after your viewing. There are so many metaphors, symbols and deep messages which are thoughtfully arranged by the film makers. Blade Runner is insanely complex.

I need the old blade runner, I need your magic.¨ Blade Runner, Ridley Scott's follow up to Alien, wasn't a very successful movie at the time it was released. The problem might have been that it was ahead of its time, since this dark futuristic film noir sci-fi film was very different from the rest of the sci-fi films that were being released like Star Wars or E.T. The Extraterrestrial, which came out that same year and had a more light and entertaining mood. The problem with Blade Runner is that it's a much darker film and far more complicated. I really enjoyed this movie, although I don't consider it a masterpiece as most people do. This movie has become a cult film several years after its release and is among the best sci-fi films in the history of cinema. The dark screenplay was adapted by Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples from Philip K. Dirk's famous fiction novel ¨Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?¨ I have to admit that I watched the director's cut version without the voice over from Harrison Ford's character so I really don't know if it was better that way or not, but from what I understand Ford's voice-over wasn't very good. Although one would assume that the voice over would definitely give it a more film noir vibe to it. The best thing about Blade Runner definitely is the great artistic direction where there is a very dark mood thanks to the use of lots of black and grey and a lot of smoke. Scott's vision of the future isn't a very bright one and there is a sense of pessimism that reigns all over the film, including in its main characters.",

After 19 years of public life 'Blade Runner' is considered a 'cult movie' transcending the genre becoming a classic. The plot may seem a little bit simple at first sight however 'Blade Runner' raises some of the most fundamental questions flirting with existentialism as well as humanism. If the movie was inspire by Philip K. Dick's novel: 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep', the realization of the scenario differed completely. The story takes place in a dark and urban near future where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford best role) is a blade runner, a cop and has been asked to retire/kill 4 replicants who escaped from an obscure space colony, have hijacked a space ship to return home back on earth (where they have been declared illegal) seeking for their 'maker'(the charismatic Joe Turkel). The mission turns out much more difficult than expected. The 4, soon 5 replicants are not 'computers' they are 'physical' (Human made by Human through genetic manipulation I assume). They have great intelligence and superior physical abilities and resistance. They are looking for answers and are determine to get them what ever it takes. Their questioning will become ours: What makes us human? Are we human from birth in other words by essence? Or do we become human with what we do, through what we achieve? Who is a human being? Rick Deckard who tracks down Zhora (the beautiful Joanna Cassidy) or the tragic Zhora who after a stressful hunt seems suddenly so close to us when being shot down, frozen in an everlasting slow motion made of shattering glasses. Roy Batty who discovers his own humanity when facing his last trial, the only trial he will never win: death ; or Eldon Tyrel who plays God but has forgotten to play Human? Maybe 'memories' is the clue we are looking for? But what kind of memory and whose memory? Sure my memory (personal or common) is part of what makes me act as a human being but doesn't it alienates me like a trauma alienates a patient? So love has to be the ultimate clue. But in that case what kind of love? The love that shows Deckard to Rachael (the enigmatic Sean Young) made of sarcasm and bitterness or the love shared by the powerful Roy Batty (the awesome Rutger Hauer) and the wild Pris (best role ever for Daryl Hannah)? What feeling shows more humanity? The kiss made of tears that Roy lives on Pris's cold lips. Or the one that Deckard stills from Rachael after making her uncomfortable? Ridley Scott lives the answers to each and every one of us. Once again (Alien 1979) he has created a fantastic atmosphere made of dark streets, flying cars, post modern buildings, flame burst in a black sky, everything blend in a powerful and spiritual music written by the talented Vangelis. Once again he had the right actors: Edward James Olmos as the ambiguous Gaff, William Sanderson playing the pathetic and naive J. F. Sebastian or Bryan James as the powerful and hopeless Leon. In this environment the so call humans behave like 'soulless machines' and the so call machines are searching for their soul discovering their humanity. This masterpiece is and was directed as an 'initiatic journey'. We'll understand that what we look for and what we found is ourselves.",
607,8 August 2002,Agent10,10, An SF gift from Ridley Scott,"What can I possibly say about one of the most profound noir/sci-fi films ever made? What can I say about a stylistic approach that has been mimicked and cloned many, many times? Bladerunner has been a film which has defied critics and made believers to those who have never seen the movie. Sci-fi would still be a cheesy Dr. Who/BuckRogers/Xanadu cheesefest without the genius of Ridley Scott. Not only did he strike chords with Alien, he did it again in Bladerunner, redefining four genres in the process. While Harrison Ford might have been a weird choice to play Deckard, it worked out beautifully. While I am a fan of both the book and the movie, I felt this film really strived to establish a difference between the two mediums. While the book was dense and detail packed, the film did its best to fluidly portray the images Phillip K. Dick created so many years ago. Coupled with some great editing (the director's cut was far better) and a wonderful score by Vangelis, this film will stand as one of the best sci-fi films ever.",

So the question only came up once for me during the duration of the film, but once you look into the details, I feel like it's clear that Rick is also a replicant. especially after hearing that last line in the end where Gaff says ""you did a mans job"". You would only say that to someone non human right? 
I think on a deeper level, this film is questioning life. Are we all robots who are programmed to think we're not or are we actually what we call humans. It's an interesting topic once you start thinking about it. And there wouldn't be just one answer to this question, especially if you involve things like religion. 
""I think, there for I am"" is such an interesting saying and line, first time I heard it was in philosophy class 5 years ago and it gave me some flashbacks to those really deep discussions. I really liked the film, and I've come to realise more recently that a lot of the films made in the 80's - 90's are really freakin' good.

I decided to re-watch it again in 2020, and basically I have the same opinion. I had read lots of positive and glowing reviews of Blade Runner, so I thought I must have missed something all those years ago?
From my most recent viewing. The film has some amazing scenery and sets, even more so when you consider when it was made. The story isn't overcomplicated and easy enough to follow. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) a bounty hunter must hunt down 4 replicants (very life like robots) before they can cause chaos. One big downfall is the style that Harrison Ford plays his character, to me he came off mostly as a 1940's deadpan detective type, which didn't seem to work in the futurist world the movie is set in. The funny thing is how wrong the 1980's movie makers got what the world would be like in 2019!

Yes, it's from Alien director Ridley Scott who would later give us movies such as Gladiator and The Martian. But Blade Runner is much different. It certainly has sci-fi appeal and influence-- video games such as Final Fantasy VII and Mass Effect clearly took notes from the film, and directors such as Christopher Nolan have cited this film as inspiration, but it also doesn't fall into the trippier territory of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Based on the cleverly titled book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K.

It was and is an utterly mesmerizing cinematic experience - easily my favorite science fiction film. It's mixture of visuals, music, characters, and dialog rendering a future succeeds in evoking despair, sadness, and finality of something winding down. The movie is wonderfully re-watchable and fantastically brings you down with melancholy. Everything isn't always happy in the world, and it's just as valid and cathartic to experience this in a movie as any other emotion. As counter to many Blade Runner enthusiasts, I'm a huge fan of Harrison Ford's narration - beyond exactly what he's saying I think his octave and cadence lends credence to the mood - it's an enhancement. We feel comforted by his voice validating what his character is going through, unable to make sense of a world and people and replicants blurring together. Vangelis as with Year of Living Dangerously and Chariots of Fire, creates wondrous work key to creating the experience with blue-sy retreads and electronic flat/sharp chords. Ridley Scott has never surpassed himself in scope and detail - his perfectionism and vision have never been better. This is a beacon and marker for other movies to try to aspire to not only in terms of look and design but of effectiveness in evoking an intended atmosphere and mood, exactly what movies are designed to do.",

The story of one Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter out to eliminate a handful of renegade replicants (i. e. androids), and how he fell in love with one of them, was adapted from Philip K. Dick's short story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and is extremely claustrophobic. One would never know that this was Los Angeles; the sun never shines, colors are muted, and there is an element of sick-green corruption all around. Stylistically it moves at a steady pace, never pausing for cute moments. Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, Sean Young, and Joanna Cassidy are quite impressive in their renditions of the replicants -- particularly Hauer and Hannah who have some truly memorable sequences of extremely disquieting violence, violence that is a reaction to their one dream, which is to live. One poignant sequence involves Harrison Ford explaining to Sean Young that her memories were implanted to her and thus, are not real. I thought that was the cruelest part of the movie, because it was like telling your own creation that he or she did not have a ""life"" until you gave it to them, and somehow that carries an undertone of inhumanity about it. There has been the speculation, by the way, that Ford's character could also be a replicant, but somehow that doesn't seem to be the case in the movie: he's just a cop with a mission to complete. That he decides to spare Rachael's ""life"" shows a human aspect about him -- that he wasn't all orders, even when the romance in itself is perfunctory to say the least. A sad, but beautiful nightmare of a film, it works whether you see it with Ford's voice-over or not.",

Even less reason for killing, had the same android to kill the 25 year old genetic engineer, who took home him and his female android partner.

This film has made such an impact on movie-making that it is almost impossible that another science fiction film can be made without any influence from this movie. The compelling story, the terrific direction and editing from frame to frame, and most of all, the cinematography will blow you away. The cast is perfect, each bringing something wonderful to their characters that you'll forever remember them from this performance. Rutger Hauer in particular shines, stealing the film with every scene he's in. This film should be on every top 10 list out there. Movie magic at its best!",

651,8 February 2019,nirome,9, Sci-fi benchmark,"Enough cannot be said about the virtues of this movie, both visually and thematically. It's one of Ridley Scott's finest efforts behind the camera and a sci-fi benchmark that created a legacy that still permeates everything that it's related to futuristic and technogical landscapes.
From the very first shot, the movie will grab you by the scruff of the neck and take you on a visually stunning journey where there is even room for philosophical ruminations about the very nature of what it means to be human. But not all of it is fantasy and wonder. The movie is flawed in that it depicts its main characters in a very unrelatable and detached manner. This is also its worst pitfall. Scott was way more concerned about creating a futuristic setting than he was in delving into his characters' psyches. Actors were left to their own devices when trying to gleam into their characters reasons for being. Most of what can be seen on the screen, acting wise, was due to the actors commitment to their respective roles, e.g; Rutger Hauer's compelling performance of an android who only wants for his kind and his own, that which mankind has always taken for granted, the possibility of living longer and free, must surely be the outstanding performance of the movie.
Nitpicks aside, the movie is still to this day a remarkable cinematographic achievement and one that gains with repeated viewing. Amazing production design, photography and state of the art special effects has made it stand the test of time. Along with viewing it in its final cut version, which is the best of its five cuts, a viewing of the documentary; '' Dangerous Days'' in which we, the audience, are given the chance to dive right into the laborious and painstaking process of creating such a cinematic marvel, is not only advisable, but mandatory.

Thumbs up to the special effects which are terrific and nothing short of spectacular. But otherwise it is a lifeless movie with Harrison Ford giving a droning Phillip Marlow type narrative. The characters are of little interest. There is an acute absence of humor which could have given the film some life. The plot is also muddled. I read the novel the film is based upon ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" after seeing the movie. The book is fairly interesting while dealing with a strange subject matter. The movie could have expanded on the novel by making the androids more dynamic and having some sequences dealing with what was happening on the planets they were leaving. But it chose to keep the action in a boring inexplicably rainy, oriental populated LA. Honestly movie fans, take away the special visual effects and you have a yawner movie.",

Why is the owl explicitly artificial? It makes the owl mean nothing. Why is Rachael Rosen's android status so easily given up?

Blade Runner does have excellent production values, it does have a complex story and it does have a complicated way it deals with its plot threads. (Sometimes too much so) But what I really appreciated mainly about this movie was the hero's conflict with his mission. It's the type of character that is overlooked as one of the many inspirations from this film. Sure the film's pretty sets and tale of robots have inspired many low grade science fiction movies but without the conflicted hero the movie would have no purpose and no real anchor to drive home the film's message. Indeed the hero essayed by Harrison Ford is why I give this 4 stars, his burned out hero sharply contrasts the lights and atmosphere of the film. Without the hero's dim perception of his home this film would be just a work in special effects. That this contrast is made, as well as the hero's indifference to the life he lives compared to the replicants he hunts is what makes the movie the classic it is. So while others will find the sets amazing, the special effects breath-taking, I really found it to be the main character to what made this movie the classic it is. Also like the best science fiction, it's vague, dense and invites you to make your own interpretations as to what happened.",

661,3 November 2013,blazesnakes9,10, Blade Runner is one of the two best science fiction films of 1982,"What is man? What is robot? What is artificial intelligence? Those are the kind of questions a sci-fi geek will ask themselves. Ridley Scott's explosive sci-fi adventure, Blade Runner covers those aspects in some of the most eye popping and thought-provoking ways. Blade Runner tells the tale of a futuristic policeman, specifically a blade runner, who's hired to track down 4 replicants. The blade runner is played by Harrison Ford, and he takes the job after thinking about retiring on the force. The setting for Blade Runner takes place in the futuristic year of 2019, where Los Angeles is overpopulated by Americans and Asian Americans. The leader of the replicants group is an albino, played by Rutger Hauer. His mission on Earth is to track down the creator who made him and the other robots. One of those robots is a female, played by Daryl Hannah. Blade Runner has a good story to it and it's beautifully told. But, the big surprise in this movie is the art-direction and visual effects. The whole city of Los Angeles is lit with neon lit signs and giant advertising posters that really enhances the culture aspects and look of the future. Harrison Ford is also convincing as the leading role. This is actually his best since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rutger Hauer is very frightening and very good as the killer robot with a vengeance. I like how the movie uses the 1940's film-noir style to it, creating a feel of mystery to the story. Believe it or not, I am a sci-fi geek. I really enjoy watching science-fiction mainly because science-fiction movies are thought-provoking and brilliant about the way the story is told. But, the visual effects in Blade Runner doesn't undermine the story. The special effects are indeed, exhilarating. The look and feel of this rainy and depressing city is very similar to other movies that followed after this one. What's surprising is that Blade Runner did not do well at the box office, probably because people didn't quite understand the concept and story of it. Yet, another sci-fi movie, E.T., did a lot more better than Blade Runner. In fact, E.T. grossed over $435,110,554 that year. It was also one of the best films of that year, and compare to Blade Runner, it's different in its tone and look. I find this to be very disappointing. What I mean is that movies within the same genre should be viewed the same and be reviewed as films that will make cinema history. I think that Blade Runner deserved the same kind of criticism as E.T. does because both movies relied on different stories, but inside, there's a meaning to it. If audiences and critics can't seem to rendered that fact, the movies are in for a rude awakening. In a nutshell, Blade Runner is a excellent sci-fi movie, filled with interesting characters that we care for and a set that's worth a look at. It is also one of the best films of 1982. ★★★★ 4 stars.",

The story is adapted from Philp Dick's novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep and it is a very loose adaptation with events and characters from the novel either changed or omitted but the film takes a creative approach to the novel giving it an art-house feel.

The importance of more interesting, philosophical subjects of the novel was cut down meaningfully; namely, the philosophical consequences of the idea of a humanoid robot that would be superior to man himself in any way. J.R Isidore (transformed into the very minor character of J.F Sebastian), Buster Friendly, Rick's wife and her eery mood-dialer, and most of all the electric sheep, the most wonderful symbolism in the novel.

I remember seeing the film at a much young age but not understanding much of it at the time. I read Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? a few years ago and enjoyed it as I do most of the author's work. The world built in Ridley Scott's film and the novel along with the complex philosophical questions proposed by this work of fiction make this piece of entertainment more engaging than just simple sci-fi or action movie. The film begins with a block of text explaining that the Tyrell Corporation has advanced artificial intelligence to a stage where they are equal if not better than humans. The resulting replicants are used in off- world colonization until a violent mutiny makes them outlaws on the planet Earth. Blade Runners are bounty hunters that hunt down these replicants.,

On the surface it may seem like an action movie, but when looked into more closely what can be seen is a deeply philosophical allegory on the concept of life. It's a gripping story of 'Blade Runner' detective Rick Deckard, hunting Replicants; robot slaves who have gone AWOL and returned to earth seeking one thing: a longer life after being designed with a four year life span. The setting, a rain soaked, neon hazed futuristic 2019 LA oozes an overpopulated, multi cultured, crime ridden world, thus giving the film a more dangerous and seedy feel. It's a world that looks like it's been lived in for a long long time, and for a film made in 1982 was way ahead of it's time and still looks impressive today. ",

704,23 May 2012,g_ryder,8, Suspect?...How can it not know what it is?,"I had to see this film couple of times before I could figure out the art, the symbolism and the philosophical ideas driving it. The dialogs seem innocuous on the surface, but as you go deeper and go over them from various angles, they turn out to be profound, especially those that take place in Tyrell's office. This is art and intellect at its best. The central theme or idea of the film is based on a very fundamental question: How does one distinguish a 'real' human being from an 'apparent' human being? Precisely what defines 'human' apart from mere bodily appearance and intelligence? In the movie a lie-detector like machine is used to detect the emotional responses of a test subject to determine if that subject has enough empathy to qualify as a human being, failing which he/she is identified as a 'replicant', which in the movie lingo means genetically manufactured pseudo-humans, designed to work 'slave like' in extreme physical conditions that also require intelligence. Naturally, in the context of the plot, all 'self attested humans' consider the replicants as mere machines, and those that do not perform according to their set role, or display rebel like behavior are to be hunted down and 'terminated with extreme prejudice' by the special policemen called 'bladerunners', who are also trained to use the 'empathy test' to detect replicants. It is the untested assumption, amounting to prejudice, that the replicants can never have higher emotions like empathy, love, compassion, value for life other than one's own, etc. The central idea of the movie is that this untested assumption, this 'extreme prejudice' is now going to be tested for all that is its worth, and lots of 'lives', both 'human' and 'replicant' are at stake.and both the human characters as well as the replicant characters will display behavior that is not to be expected, is extremely ironic if the existing assumptions and prejudices are to hold. The other striking aspect I found was a great sense of ironic humor in the dialogs. One example is Tyrell proudly claiming 'More human than human is our motto'. That one made me laugh for a long, long time. Then there is the romance between Deckard and Rachel which also blends well with the central theme, an integral part of the plot and which also gives a sense of completion to the movie in the end. Rather than classify this as science fiction I would classify this film as 'humanities reality', that is, a film that should be considered as one that addresses the most serious human concerns about the slow 'disappearance of the human' (Rick Roderick) in the postmodern world, a world in which 'real' is no longer meaningful and only the commercially manufactured images that sell the most are the only values left. This a one of those few movies that can be watched several times from different perspectives in order to fully appreciate the artistic and intellectual quality of the movie.",

706,12 June 2015,Esteraur999,9, Lost in time like tears in rain.,"I LOVE Blade Runner! I read the book before seeing the film, and enjoyed it to a sufficient degree, and was excited to see the film but nothing could have prepared me for the beauty and majesty of this film. I will say that I originally saw the Director's Cut, then saw the international, and have seen the beginning of the Final Cut. I can acknowledge the many flaws in this film, but I can look past them to see a film that is a poetic and beautiful film. But I'm very afraid (like being a slave) because I tried to watch Blade Runner with my best friend and my cousin. My best friend couldn't make it past the introduction of Pris. My cousin spent half the film looking at her iPad. When I asked her why she wasn't paying attention, she responded that she was listening. You can't just listen to Blade Runner! The film is a visual masterpiece and if you can't just listen to it! This work of art is being lost on our current generation who can't sit through what makes it so amazing! I give Blade Runner a 9.8/10",
707,27 March 2022,stevebondi,7, Classic sci-fi movie! :-),"Innovative visuals for its time! An innovative concept that differs from the typical mechanical robot stories of sentience and servitude.

708,28 January 2013,eti55,6, More Human Than Human..,"..so says the motto of the Tyrell Corporation, which builds humanoid robots, called ""replicants"" to do manual labor on off world colonies. The latter part is key, as replicants have been forbidden on earth, and any replicant who defies the order is to be hunted down and ""retired"" (read: killed) by special police called blade runners (replicants are supposed to be retired in 4 years regardless). Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner presents a bleak dystopian future. The very first thing you see after the opening credits are these giant smokestacks belching black clouds and fiery bursts into the air, then high rise buildings which dwarf anything that's been built today, with full picture/video ads playing on the sides of the buildings, plus flying cars called spinners. This contrasts with the poverty and despair which you find below (shades of the old sci fi movie ""Metropolis""). The main character is Rick Deckard, a blade runner, played by Harrison Ford. He's up against a group of rebel replicants led by Roy Battie (Rutger Hauer) who have come back to Earth. They want to be human like everyone else, and are willing to die (or kill) trying. There's another interesting twist to the story, which is hinted at more strongly in the director's cut than in the original: Is Deckard himself a replicant?",
709,31 August 2022,Cinemaniac1984,8, Step into the world of Ridley Scott's visually spectacular science fiction classic which has aged very well 40 years on.,"Blade Runner is a visually spectacular science fiction movie which has aged very well 40 years on. Released in 1982, Blade Runner was originally a box office flop despite receiving excellent reviews, however the movie has since become regarded as a masterpiece. Harrison Ford was fantastic in a darker role following his heroic roles in Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). The late Rutger Hauer was a delight to watch on screen. Director Ridley Scott can also add this to one of his most memorable movies.",

But, even though it's visceral and different, Blade Runner is a classic once you get past the disappointment at the lack of laser fights.",
713,11 May 2018,lantern4444,8, Classic Science Fiction Thriller,"One of the all time classic science fiction thrillers. The essential idea surrounds the development of humanoids who become a threat to society. The story develops around a ""Blade Runner"" who is assigned to stop this threat. The movie then brilliantly blurs the difference between the humanoids and humans. This is achieved by showing relationships between the humanoids and humans. Also the extreme difficulty of detecting the humanoids and their high level of human function further confuses the issues of what is to be human. Many ethical questions are presented especially with the shoot to kill on sight no questions asked elimination of the humanoids by the authorities. The movie also looks at the development of the humanoids in terms of human emotion and their potential to be fully human. ",

The special effects are great, the story is a little silly yet interesting, and there is some good acting here.  It's just that the colors are so bland, the mood is soooo mellow, that I fell asleep.  I'm serious, I FELL ASLEEP!  That has never happend to me before, and I have seen a lot of boring movies.  This is a film reserved only for die hard sci/fi people.

718,6 July 2008,Islandeye,8," Surprising, exciting, inconsistent: Blade Runner.","Upon my second viewing of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, I enjoyed and appreciated the film a lot more. The film is successful in its handling of the loaded subject of artificial life, introducing new ideas of false memories and a unique vision of a dystopian future. The core build up is well crafted, performed and shot, however it loses momentum towards the end, causing me to question the films central achievements and consistency.",

Actually, I think I might even like the world of Blade Runner more than the story. And also, I'm pretty sure most people will agree that this is definitely one of those cases where the movie is actually better than the book (although I do also love Philip K.

720,9 August 2022,wtsttx,10, But which runner?,Very much depends on which edition you end up watching. The Director's cut would be my choice.

The more recent ""director's cut"" (which isn't, really) omits the narration and includes a few theme-clarifying scenes. A true director's cut would have included scenes omitted by producers for lack of money and time during production. The narrated version has been viewed so extensively that the ambiguity and subtlety intended by the director will never be widely experienced.",

No characters of even the tiniest interest to either love OR hate, a laughably bumbling love angle, and almost zero action except for one brief flurry around half-way through and another at the end. Speaking of which, a totally stupid ending...not Roy saving Decker, that was a great idea (and where it should have ended), but then Decker and Rachel hooking up and going....? where? And do we care? No. This movie was loaded with over-the-top pretentiousness and about zero believability, even given the premise. I saw it in the 80s and went ""eh."" I just saw it now for the first time since then, as I was interested in the new one and wanted this as a base, but found it's even worse than I remember. Read the review titled ""So very very boring""....a bit harsh but sums it up fairly well (and is more entertaining than this entire film).",
