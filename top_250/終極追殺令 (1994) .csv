Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.",/
1,16 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Besson's masterpiece - action cinema with real heart,"Despite having a mainly American cast and being set on the rough streets of New York, this is very much a French film, evident from the crew list at the end of the film. I'm always one to give foreign film-makers a try, as they usually offer up something a little bit more stylish and different than the usual formula. Take Lucio Fulci with his trademark 'hard' and nightmarish horror films, Dario Argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films, or John Woo's violent, ballet-like action films.",r

She purports to be 18 but she's a child, had to grow up quick with a family that's quite wild, now they have wounds, that won't be healed, after messing with Stansfield, that's left her quite annoyed and somewhat, slightly riled. It's a story of revenge and adolescence, of walking a fine line that may cause offence, but there's chemistry and connection, performances played to perfection, quite original, without too much pretence.",v

His godfather and mentor is the mobster Tony (Danny Aiello), who loves León as if he were his own son, and his cold blood makes him a perfect killer. When Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang executes the family of his twelve years old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), León lodges the girl in his place, beginning a weird friendship between a killer and a confused girl wishing revenge. When Mathilda finds who Stansfield is, she presses León to kill him. ",i
5,21 December 1999,Insincere Dave,10, A shameful praise of a fantastic film.,"Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hitman. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.",e
6,16 May 1999,Methos-7,10, Gripping story with well-crafted characters,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.",w
7,19 January 2004,Twinsen61,9, Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made.

8,25 April 2003,Gjay2,7, a symphony in film,"luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.",r
9,18 September 2022,saikatsamanta,10," A Tale of Revenge, Love & Life...","One of the most iconic Action films of all time, this story is about a ruthless hitman Jean Reno and his next door neighbour, 12 year old Natalie Portman who lives in an abusive household and how a tragedy makes this two tormented souls find each other, love and life again. Luc Besson directs this one with plenty of bloody and uber stylish action scenes and some really touching moments. The music is pretty damn fantastic and the editing is crisp. Jean Reno owns his role with stonecold attitude but also possess this awkward innocence. Portman gives probably the greatest performance from a Child Actor, playing a kid hungry for love but has grown up too quickly amidst crime. Gary Oldman goes off the hinges, playing a Crooked DEA cop, belting out one iconic line after another. You can watch this film again and again, a Masterpiece !!!",w
10,14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10, A Brilliant Conflict,"This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, ""The Fifth Element.""",8
11,27 August 2000,cdsmith-2,10, Very well executed,"This film was absolutely amazing.  I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.  It's not the violence or action sequences that make this movie so great (although they are well done...), but rather moments like where Mathilda knocks on Leon's door.  It would be so easy to just film the door opening, but instead we see light illuminating Natalie Portman's face, symbolizing something angelic.  And the moment has so much more meaning.",9

14,20 March 2005,Quinoa1984,9," A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date","I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.",5
15,4 January 2005,rustysettler,10," Excellent, smart action film.","Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.",9

23,14 December 2014,Horst_In_Translation,8, Great film with one of the most memorable duos in film history,"""Lèon"" is a 1994 movie written and directed by Luc Besson and named after its central character played by Jean Reno. The film went almost completely under the radar in terms of awards recognition outside of France, but its reputation steadily rose over the years and it is now pretty much considered a classic. Besson was in his mid-30s when he made this movie, but already had a respectable résumé including a French and English version of ""Nikita"". For Reno and Oldman this is probably still the most famous work (not counting Oldman's efforts in the Batman movies) and for Portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Black Swan"", which gave her the Oscar. I am still a bit disappointed Reno was not present at the ceremony. For Portman, Mathilda was the first role in a movie. Also in the film is Danny Aiello as a friend to Léon. His role wasn't clear early on to me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with the money, but as the film went on it showed that he was pretty close to Léon.",=

I mean, really, did he and his goons have to take out Mathilda's whole family over a drug deal gone bad? And when Stansfield (Oldman) is questioned about the massacre, he storms out yelling that he doesn't have time for this spit?

They're the standard ""badass"" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral).

33,22 April 2008,OldAle1,3," stupid, glossy trash is a low point in the careers of all involved","Well well. Luc Besson takes on John Cassavetes for the first time in this pastiche (for the first half, anyway) of Gloria. Jean Reno is an illiterate Italian (? it's not totally clear, but this is how he's referred to) hit-man in his 40s in New York, a simpleton with no friends other than his plant, an assassin of inordinate skill (though we see no real evidence of this until the very end of the film) who takes in an orphaned Natalie Portman, a pre-teen when this was filmed but dressing like a hooker through most of the film, eventually agreeing to teach her the assassin's art so she can revenge herself upon the killer of her horrible family, Gary Oldman as an insane, dirty-cop drug-addict DEA officer. Got it? Yeah, I got it, it wasn't hard to figure out....though none of it made any sense, ever. There are a few reviews of this film that have suggested that it be looked at as existing in sort of a fantasy world, and that would seem to be a better way of looking at it. Not much makes sense if looked at in real-world terms, even less sense than in usual in a violent action movie; but the film doesn't seem to have any internal logic. Reno is the hit-man to end all hit men despite being an illiterate simpleton? Oldman is some fairly high-level cop despite being so obviously, categorically insane? There never seem to be any extras around in most of the indoor scenes; there's a whole 5-minute scene in a washroom between Oldman and Portman and nobody intrudes. None of this works in a film that ostensibly takes place in a real New York City Let's talk about the acting. Though I didn't think Reno's character made any sense, I rather liked him, I got taken in by his charm; Oldman on the other hand played a complete cartoon character. Did he play him well? Perhaps. I don't know. Was he supposed to be a cartoon? Did Besson think this was a cool idea? I guess so. It didn't work for me, at all. It was awful. And Portman; I'm not going to necessarily argue that her performance was bad, I'll give a 12-year-old the benefit of the doubt when playing a character that has to alternate between cutesy, slutty, and determined; but again, I didn't buy the person she was supposed to be. And although at the end the film never....quite....indulges in the pedophilic fantasies that it seems to be heading towards, it still comes to close for comfort. Portman wears skimpy outfits throughout, and the camera pays more attention to her ass than is probably necessary. Were this my first Luc Besson film, I might have given him a bit of a pass, but given his usual predilection for waifish, very young model types...ewww.",
34,24 February 2010,paul2001sw-1,6," Has merits, but made me feel uneasy","With it's soundtrack of Bjork and Sting, Luc Besson's film 'Leon' certainly reminds one of the early 1990s. The film also showcases Besson's ability to create a visually coherent and interesting world, in this case a slightly earlier, grottier New York brought to life on camera. But the plot and characters are frankly silly and quite dull, unless one happens to find firearms inherently interesting. What keeps the film watchable is the winning performance from a young Nathalie Portman, who makes her own entry in the canon of precocious movie children. In fact, it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure to enjoy her, because there's no doubt that the director is playing up her incipient sexuality; and while we may be supposed to laugh at the twelve-year old acting sixteen, I felt, in watching this movie, that the director was encouraging his audience to sexualise the character (or at least exploiting their expected reaction); there's definitely something not quite childish about it. I haven't seen her act better in anything she's made since.",
35,29 July 2015,planktonrules,7, Good but #27?! I just don't get it.,"I wish I'd never seen that ""Leon: The Professional"" was rated #27 on IMDb. With an outrageously high score like this, I get my expectations too high--way too high. Now I am not saying it's a bad film but it's certainly not THAT good. In fact, it's not among writer/director Luc Besson's best (""The Fifth Element"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" are definitely better). Why is it rated so highly? ",

Known as The Professional to others, Luc Besson's debut English language film captures the essence of evil on screen just as it does the potential hope other individuals may carry amidst all the gloom and depression in one of cinema's favourite down and out cities: New York. Why Léon is such an unrecognised film is quite bewildering  IMDb has it grossing a modest $19 Million dollars but it won two awards and garnered a few other nominations. Everyone likes a hero and most people like a story where two people (usually of opposite genders) connect in certain times of hardship amidst a locale of no hope  at its core, Léon could be seen as exactly this.",

The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this) ",

However, this portrait of a hitman, also known as The Professional, is far more sympathetic than most other portrayals of this profession. Jean Reno gives his unforgettable performance as a very hard man to kill along with a very young Natalie Portman, a young girl that the killer takes under his wing. One could easily assume there are sexual subplots going on here, but they would be mistaken. Leon is acting upon his instincts as a father might have in the same given situation. Gary Oldman is wonderful as the over the top cop out to get Leon from beginning to end. Portman does a great job as the young orphan, and shows why she would become a magnificent actress later in her career. Catch this film for the performances, if for no other reason.",

51,13 May 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8, Léon is someone you really don't want to mess with.,"Safe to say this film has spawned many iterations of omnipotent invincible hitmen, it isn't hard to see why. Opening to a lukewarm reception, Léon has rapidly garnered cult status and is a firm favourite amongst film aficionados. A young girl's family is brutally gunned down by a crooked detective, she teams up with a hitman named Léon in order to avenge their deaths. Suffice to say this is an action drama that needs to be viewed by everyone...and I mean ""EVERYONEEEE!"". It would be easy to class this as an exaggerative over-the-top action thrill ride, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to Besson's Parisian directing style, he focussed his attention to the quirky original relationship between Léon and Mathilda. A girl who has experienced the dark side of life, growing up with a father who deals drugs and regularly hooking up with women. To then be embraced by a determined yet warming hitman, her idyllic fantasy of a caring father figure becomes reality. The bond that rapidly forms between these two characters is fascinating to watch. Her idolisation for him and his protectiveness for her. It's a union that shouldn't work, but does. They both teach each other aspects of life they aren't necessarily familiar with, which furthers the intricate character development. Acting was terrific from everyone. Reno's commanding titular performance encapsulated the screen. Portman's debut is quite possibly the best child performance I've seen. And then there's Oldman as the crazed antagonist, who steals every scene. Whilst this is absolutely entertaining, there are obvious issues. The plot is too thin to carry the full runtime, it takes far too much time developing the character relationship where the actual plot feels neglected, leaving the antagonist on the sideline until the third act. Also the music choice occasionally didn't fit the bustling urban environment and took me out of the film. Aside from those points, it's considerably better than most crime dramas and has aged impeccably well. Everyone needs a Léon in their life.",

54,21 December 2013,runamokprods,8," That rarest of film creatures, something unique.","Determinedly, odd, over the top and a lot of fun., This strangely sentimental, wonderfully photographed, very violent black comedy is like some demented marriage of a sincere Disney film about a 12 year old girl looking for a father (or, in an intentionally disquieting French twist, a lover), with the over the top darkness of David Lynch, or Kubrick in his ""Dr. Strangelove"" mode, and some John Woo action thrown in for good measure. ",
55,16 June 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10, One of my favourite films of all time,"Leon The Professional is purely and simply one of the best films ever made. From Natalie Portman's stunning debut performance, to Gary Oldman's absolutely nightmarish baddie, to Jean Reno's lovable and eccentric protagonist, it's a classic, a piece of achingly beautiful cinema that I could watch on the daily and never get tired of. The three actors are the bricks which make the film so special, and Luc Besson's fluid, sensitive direction is the mortar which holds them together. Portman is simply miraculous in her first film role as Matilda, a young girl whose entire family is murdered by psychotic DEA agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Highly introverted assassin Leon (Reno), takes pity and allows the orphaned girl into his home and his life. Matilda is a strange girl whose specific idiosyncrasies both clash and amusinly interact with Leon's. He is an exile of sorts as well, with a tragic past and not a whole lot going on in his life besides the contracts he carries out for kindly, paternal mobster Tony (a phenomenal Danny Aiello). Leon and Matilda makes an interesting team; she is brash, unfiltered and lively, he is reserved, awkward and deafeningly quiet, resulting in unique character building and bonding that Besson handles wonderfully. Now, there's two versions of this film, because apparently American people can't handle slightly taboo undertones, even when they're handled in a caring and tasteful manner. You definitely want to see the longer, European cut which has some interesting scenes that crackle with sexual tension on Portman's part. Yes, she's twelve years old, at a very confusing crossroads of her life, the stark black and white mindset of a child dissolving into the very ambiguous and complex psyche of a woman. She believes she loves Leon, and he handles her advances in a way that requires maturity and intuition that he never had to begin with, but rises to the occasion. Call these scenes what you will, but there's no denying their esential place in the film's complete story, and to censor them for the sake of prudeness is a straight up crime. Matilda wants revenge against Stansfield and his team, which means going up against his wrath, and also means Portman sharing some incredible scenes with a voracious Oldman. Oh, Gary. This is his final form, the most terrifying villain in his stable, a flamboyant, deranged lunatic that one can scarce believe ever was allowed to be a cop. There's a fairy tale esque feel to the film, where the bad guys do what they want in the urban forest, never in uniform and free to roam, kill and terrorize with the full might of the NYPD at their dastardly disposal. Oldman is the Joker on mescaline, and in fact Stansfield pops mysterious pills from a little casket, when he's not murdering people while listening to Beethoven. He's loud, scary, stylish and animalistic, so intense one feels like his very presence will melt the TV screen. Portman is so superb it's hard to believe this was so early on in her career. In my mind she did her best work right out of the gate, in this film. Matilda is wise for her years, which she uses to mask the gulf of vulnerability residing in her, a hallmark trait found in children from abusive households. The family and friendship she finds with Leon strengthens her as as human being, and we start to see the emerging person she will continue to grow up to be. Natalie displays all of this uncannily well, and is the bruised, beating heart at the centre oft the film. Reno sells the eccentricities (Leon loves golden age Hollywood musicals) and sorrowful resolve of Leon so well, taking a character that is all action and very little talk, and speaking volumes with both body language and silence which, take it from me, is tough stuff. Besson, whether directing a quiet, introspective scene or a balletic action sequence, gives everything a stylized, earthy quality that makes the film stand out amongst other action ventures. You could spend a billion dollars on production design, but it all comes down to the human element behind the wheel, and if you don't have a director, cast and team that has the current running through them to create something special, all those dollars go out the window. This one has all of that, and is a solid gold classic.",
56,4 September 2021,gbill-74877,6," Portman shines, but that's about it","Natalie Portman is absolutely wonderful in this film, and her acting ability is truly impressive for a 13 year old. She's definitely the reason to watch it. The rest of the action film was slick and somewhat entertaining, but it felt like standard Hollywood fare, and didn't interest me nearly as much. Not a lot of it felt authentic and the dialogue was poorly written.

73,16 January 2017,KineticSeoul,10, My favorite hit-man in one of my all time favorite films,"I remember watching this film as a kid and being blown away by how awesome it is. From the action, the characters and the chemistry between Leon and Mathilda it was just all so darn memorable and cool. Sure, the relationship between an adult hit-man and a 12 year old girl may sound like it's messed up. But Luc Besson makes the whole thing work by making the hit-man Leon to be so darn likable, professional and yet naive. This is the role that Jean Reno will be known for throughout his acting career. He plays this secluded, introverted and yet sensitive hit-man who is very likable for a hit-man. Maybe because of his naive personality and how he doesn't live a rich and fulfilled lifestyle because of what he does. Maybe it's because Leon is a character that has certain codes and rules that he abides by. And for a hit-man he has some integrity and compassion. Some of it comes from Jean Reno's personal idea to make his character a bit mentally slow when it comes to things that didn't involve killing. This movie was a big hit in Asian countries, especially in japan. And a some Japanese movies, anime and manga tried to emulate some elements from this film. The ideas about the character Leon and his relationship with Mathilda came about because of Luc Besson's personal relationship with a teenage girl who is much younger than he is. Even Gary Oldman puts on a very memorable performance as a corrupt cop. His performance might be a bit over the top, but it stuck with me and it works when it comes to the context of this film. This is Oldman's performance I mostly remember him for despite him being a great actor. It's close the the performance level of Denzel Washington from ""Training Day"". This is even the performance that made Natalie Portman who played Mathilda into a star. Again it's the performance I remember this actress the most for. She brings about a lot of raw emotions for a very young actress. The first door scene where she is trying to get inside Leon's apartment by saying ""please"" made me feel for her character. In another words, overall this is the film that I remember all three actors for the most. Mix that in with one of the best script that Luc Besson has written so far and you got one of the best movies from the 90's. What made this film very lasting, impactful and memorable for me wasn't just because of the cool style of it all. And because of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. But because it has one of the best ending I have ever seen in film. It's explosive figurative and literally when it comes to Leon's final mission. Overall, this is a brilliant film with marvelous acting, characters and direction. This is part action movie, part revenge movie and part controversial romance movie that doesn't take it too far. While having a bit of artistic ambiance to it without it being pretentious. I personally think of this film as a masterpiece.",

It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery.

The slightly precocious Matilda is equally enigmatic, from a troubled background she is continually forced to rise above.

87,16 July 2017,Screen_Blitz,9, Luc Besson's The Professional is powerfully crafted with sophistication and stunning fortitude that strikes hard,"From French director Luc Besson, Leon: The Professional is an action film with a little more to bargain than a just a plethora of explosive action set pieces. It is a part-drama that strives for a sheer exploration in its characters and how their lives are changed when everything goes downhill. The alarming question implemented in this story is what would you be willing to do to protect someone who has seemingly lost everything. The answers lie within Besson's chillingly crafted action vehicle which bears a story of a relationship between a man with demons burning inside him and a preteen girl lost in a world of inconspicuous innocence, and their relationship is the emotional crux that activates the film's momentum. Making up the duo is French-born actor Jean Reno and young actress Natalie Portman, a youngster making her feature film debut. The performances along with Besson's uncompromising direction makes not a comfortable ride, but one that is nearly unforgettable. This film follows Leon (played by Jean Reno), an Italian-born immigrant and professional hit-man working under mobster Tony (played by Danny Aiello), who meets Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a lonely 12-year old girl living under the harsh conditions of her abusive father (played by Michael Badalucco), her snappy mother, her equally older sister, and her younger brother who seems to be only pleasant seed in the family. Mathilda spends her days smoking on the balcony and looking for work to do. When Leon witness the brutal murder of her family at the hands of gun-wielding goons lead by mob boss Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman), Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her the basics of becoming a professional assassin. Along the way, an unexpected platonic relationship forms between the two.",
88,14 May 2008,DaveDiggler,4," A Shallow, Bloated, Predictable Messianic Film","""Leon: The Professional"" is about a love story intertwined with some ridiculous shootouts. The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. ""The Professional"" is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is old like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all. ",

102,16 June 2017,justinraphaelm,6, Good movie that is a little overrated...,"'Leon: the Professional' is a movie that follows a young girl (Nat Portman) who's family (father and brother) is killed in the wake of a drug deal gone wrong, and subsequently, taken in by a neighbouring assassin who teaches her his trade. While the movie is not bad, it still suffers from a predictable plot line - and actions sequences- that, although are entertaining, never rise past the clutches of mid 90's action movie mediocrity. Yes, at times the movie is entertaining, but never more than movies like 'True Lies"", which was filmed around the same time. While there is a saving grace which prevents this movie from being another typical Hollywood mainstream action movie - which is the 3-4 minutes we get to see of Jean Reno connecting with Natalie Portman's character as a 12 year old child - there is not much else except what is to be expected. Nothing blew my mind for instance in the way that 'Reservoir Dogs' did as a violent low budget, yet interesting, character developed movie, or, say 'Pulp fiction' for it's dialogue. Nor did it have the sentimental connection that earned movies like the 'Shawshank redemption' or 'Schindler' list, great professional and public praise. The movie is well done, the actions sequences are also well done for the time, and the overall movie experience is not bad. I may be a little late in reviewing this movie, it having been almost 23 years since the movie graced cinemas,but honestly, considering the reviews that the movie has given, 8.6/10 (IMDB), I find it pretty disappointing (again, not that it was a bad movie, but because it was made to seem better than it is). I wish they had spent little more time connecting the characters of Natalie Portman and Jean Reno a little more, I think it could have been much more sentimental, emotive, and connecting as an overall experience. 6/10",
103,4 December 2008,kurciasbezdalas,10, What makes it different from others?,"I saw this film many years ago and as I remember I liked it, though it did seemed to me like anything special. It appeared to me like another action film about hit-man. I many times heard other people talking how great this film is and I couldn't understand how this movie is different from others. Now after few years I've watched it again, and now I realised it. Back then I was into action movies, so I've watched movies only to see some action, I didn't care much about a plot. This movie has some impressive action sequences, which were so beautifully filmed, that every minute of it was very enjoyable. But action isn't the most important thing about this film. What's important is an original story about unusual relationships between contract killer and a teenage girl. What else is good about this film is the colorfulness of it. Jean Reno was typical Jean Reno and that's good, he made a pretty original hit-man. Even more I liked Gary Oldman's performance, he always plays bad guys in movies so well, I think the movie would be much worse, if Stansfield was played by other guy.",

106,9 August 2010,Baldyy,9, A Beautiful Anomaly,"""The Professional"" is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. There are about a million things that Besson does to make this movie so one-of-a-kind that you may not notice until the second or third time around. The plot is fantastic in that it continually takes turns towards less desirable paths, which makes the movie all the more intriguing. Rarely does a film successfully walk the tightrope of mildly disturbing without falling into the pit of immorality and pervertedness, but Besson manages to make both Mathilda and Leon likable and peculiar without crossing the line of dementia.",
107,18 September 2009,atanas_n1-1,10, i love this one,"an other great favorite of mine, this one features what in my opinion are the best roles of Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, and maybe even of Gary Oldman a dark movie about a lonely and emotionally underdeveloped hit-man and a way too early grown up 12-years old girl, thrown together by violent circumstances and clued together by the love slowly growing between them it shows us unusual characters in a hard and merciless world, hit hard by life and still managing to protect a part of their humanity.",
108,18 November 2010,JessyCritical,9, Amazing,"Luc Besson, director of La Femme Nikita, introduces us to the kind- hearted assassin Leon, in this tense thriller. After her family is killed by the corrupt Government Official Stansfield (Gary Oldman) the young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is befriended by Leon. Determined to be taught how to 'clean' and desperate to avenge her young brother's death, Mathilda takes on a deadly new life. Leon, played by Jean Reno, is one of those character's you can't help but love. His goofy appearance and quirky behaviour contrast perfectly with his lethal career choice. Despite being unable to read, Leon loves a good film. The scene where he is watching 'Singin' in the Rain' shows us that he just a child inside. Also, during Mathilda's game he is only able to recognise Gene Kelly. Natalie Portman, also, gives a wonderful performance as the 12 year-old Mathilda and it's clear to see why she began to star in other films quite soon after this: Heat, Mars Attacks! etc. Portman has to portray a lot of emotion in this film and she does it with such ease. You instantly feel for her and the situation she's been put in. However, it does become clear that the tough-girl attitude she acquires is just a front, all she wants is to be loved. Perhaps seeking it from a professional assassin, who is a fair bit older than you, is not the best idea; but it is believable and understandable in this film. Gary Oldman as the villain, Stansfield, is brilliant. With lines like, ""I haven't got time for this mickey mouse bullsh*t,"" he was born for roles like this one. His performance is completely believable and you'll love to hate him. He, also, is an odd character: the weird way he takes his pills is nothing short of disturbing. The music used in Leon is another thing that needs applauding. Suspense is easily created and there are many times where you'll want to hold your breath until the scene is over. The soft music adds even more emotion and charm, making the film quite beautiful. So, overall, I really enjoyed this film and could easily watch it again and again. It's another of those films that will stay with you long after you've seen it. Even though it was made 16 years ago, nothing in this genre comes close to being as good.",
109,19 January 2010,thefilmguy7,5, The Professional is a mess,"I just watched Leon The Professional and I'm a little perplexed as to why this film has such high ratings. While Jean Reno delivered a solid performance, the film felt like a mess for the most part. There were HUGE gaps in logic and reason with some of the plot points. What was up with Gary Oldman? Was he like the emperor of the DEA? The crap that he got away with is totally impossible. I don't even see how the guy could work in the DEA considering that he is a total psychotic. The whole finale was ridiculous too. Did Luc Besson bother to take any time at all in researching DEA procedures or protocols? The DEA acted more like the mob than anything.",
110,23 August 2018,SimonJack,5," Light dialog, far out plot, and wild mayhem don't make a good movie","""Leon: The Professional"" is a French-made film with a story that takes place in New York City. The simple plot for this film is a good one. It's a variation on any number of stories in which a woman or man take in a child who has lost her or his parents.

I happened to catch this one the other night on a pay channel, and it was right after Matilda's family gets killed. I was immediately glued to it, even though I have seen it a few times before. It is a riveting and suspenseful film, and it scores in all departments. The style and pacing are second to none. Natalie Portman gave us a preview of her brilliance in this film, and she gives an excellent performance that I think would have been Oscar-worthy if the film had received more attention when it was first released. Jean Reno redefines the ruggedly handsome action hero, and he is perfect in the role of Leon. Gary Oldman is over the top, but so is his character, and he nails it all the way. Danny Aiello is solid as usual, and all of the supporting performances are spot on. Director Luc Besson set the standard with this film that others have sadly been unable to achieve. They need to, because it's films like this one that make movie watching the truly rewarding experience that it should be. This is for Matilda!!!",

How else could a virile man happen to start crying watching an action movie? How else could a sophisticated man fall in love with a child? Or a tantalized pacifist's soul feel itself falling into murderous frenzy? With the means of his cinematic language Luc Besson sneaks under our skin, ignoring any mental or emotional barriers. During the movie our eyes our not the window to peek at our soul but the gateway to enter it.

Begins as a rich character study studded with small bursts of violent action, with very little theatrics or inane hyperbole. Unfortunately, in the third act, Besson allows the violence to take over, leading to an over-baked finale with an eye on the commercial market.

We don't delve into what the whole of the Italian mafia is doing in the film, or about how wide Stansfeld's drug empire goes, his motivations... all the movie focuses on is Leon and Mathilda. Also, it shows so much emotion on everything and the characters they did were amazing, Jean Reno showing how sweet an assassin can be and Natalie Portman how little girl can be so intelligent. The advantages of this movie is the actors play. You can't find two actors who work together so well with such a gap between their ages. Another plus is the music choice of this movie, which makes the mood of the movie more understandable. After listening Sting's Shape Of My Heart in this movie, this song remains in our hearts.

But it seems the positive reviews come from people who don't have a critical eye for cinema, don't care if a movie is realistic or not, don't care if it is overdramatized or makes any sense, or anything like that. The problem is that this is not a sci fi movie. These are things that are necessary for a crime movie, especially of this nature. This is not the matrix or some sort of martial arts film. It is a organized crime/hitman movie. And in these movies you expect things to be realistic and believable, not overdramatized and downright silly. And thats what this movie is. It is ridiculously unrealistic and just ludicrous. Nothing in it is believable or makes sense. And I am not talking about in an artistic cinematic way either. I'm talking about the way in which you'd expect a movie to look if it was made by a teenager. This movie seems like it was made my someone who doesn't know anything about organized crime, or the real world, or film making.

143,15 February 2011,Aaron1375,8, Cops are the bad guys here.,"This film was a rather good film that features a professional hit-man. You see this man do his job with deadly precision at the start of the flick then you learn a bit about his life. He is a simple man, who needs little. Well in the apartment complex he lives in is a family and the father of said family has run afoul of a dirty cop, played by Gary Oldman. Well this family is pretty much wiped out from the father to the wife and the young son, only the daughter survives and this is only because Leon, the hit-man, lets her into his home. This professional hit-man is played by the always interesting Jean Reno who I believed played the character in the foreign and original version of this movie (I think it was a French film). You have some humorous scenes of Leon teaching the orphaned girl how to clean (his term for knocking someone off). He tells her how one goes from long range to short range that you are truly great when you become adept at the close range. Though with all this you know that sooner or later the men who killed the girl's family are going to get back into play and you end up with a very explosive finale.

Mathilda vows revenge and pressures Leon to teach her his deadly trade. Reno is great as the efficient but almost child-like killer, who drinks milk, cherishes his houseplant, learns to read, and ultimately ends up showing his young charge how to kill people, and Portman, who was only 12 when the film was made, is outstanding as a pubescent 'avenging angel wannabe'. On the other end of the gun barrel is Oldman's 'doped-up-psycho-cop' character, but the film has a bit of a fantasy feel to it so his sometimes screechingly over-the-top delivery works (IMO). Léon and Mathilda's off-beat, asymmetrically innocent relationship is developed beautifully and the story plays out to a great, if somewhat predictable, end. Apparently Besson's original screenplay was sort of a 'Lolita with guns', but Reno and Portman (or maybe her parents) nixed the idea of Léon becoming romantically entangled with 12 year old Mathilda and Reno was careful to play the part to minimise the chance that the audience would misinterpret the relationship.

163,13 February 2023,owenpont-70803,10, Magnificent................,This was such a good film. Luc Besson is a pretty good director already. Films like Fifth Element and in my opinion Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets prove that for sure. And even films like Anna and Lucy have there moments. But Leon The Professional is his best film. There is just so much to like about this film. All the acting (especially from Gary Oldman) are fantastic. Gary Oldman gives an insane over the top performance that captures the viewer throughout. Jean Reno did a great job as well. Throughout the film he has great action scenes and great dialog. Natalie Portman gave arguably one of her best performances she has ever given. Overall this was a great action/drama/thriller.,
164,23 April 2015,videorama-759-859391,8," One cool action piece, ala Besson, that shows true professionalism","The Professional is a super charged action piece, an exhilarating violent ride, riveting and terrifying, especially in it's first twenty minutes, with an explosive almost, hard to top ending, that truly blew me back against the wall of the cinema. It's a cinematic movie treat. If you can remember, a year and a half before, came The Assassin, too, a good movie, but this one has more intensity, but still qualifies for an 8. This is also Natalie Portman's first acting gig, and it's a role I'll never forget. When you watch her, you'll see why this was a star in the making, who blossomed with every role. Just check out, her next role in Heat. When Matilda/Portman's family is slaughtered by a force of corrupt cops, lead by DEA agent, Stansfield (Oldman in a perfected piece of villainy) she takes refuge, with a hit-man Leon (Reno) who lives down the hall. One truly intense moment has her pleading for him to open the door, the corrupt force in the close behind, realizing their missing one member of the slaughtered family, you are silently pleading too. The two form a friendship and an alliance, with Reno taking Matilda under his wing, teaching her, the avid protégé, the art of taking bad guys out, by use of sniper tactics, and other skills required to make the grade of a real hit-man. Leon is the closest thing, Matilda has come to a family for a long time, as if not counting the little brother, his murder sight wisely spared, the rest of her adopted family, weren't saints. The father was a boozing scumbag, the main objective at the hands of this dirty force. The mother (Ellen Page, of all people) is a cheap tart, and Matilda's older podgy sister, who works out, was a bitch. Oldman, too is unforgettable here, who just shows you how versatile he can be, one of the most underrated and unappreciated actors, like Nick Nolte, I've ever seen in my life. What I truly loved about The Professional was just the friendship that developed between Matilda and Leon, and how it played out. One scene having Matilda play dress up, and Reno trying to guess the acted out star and vice versa, I really loved. The build up of friendship and trust between impulsive kid and wise adult is mostly what Act 2 rides on. It's thin, but we can forgive this, because the friendship really involves us, and there really are some funny moments, created ny the two. We see a much more human side of a hit-man too, as Leon is not your ordinary hit-man. He's an ordinary average Joe, you'd pass on the street. He doesn't even act like a hit-man, the sort of guy who doesn't eat out, or live it up. But at first glance, as by example of his work, in it's opening, we really fear him, as a guy you do not mess with. He's a guy who'll find you, no matter where you hide. Danny Aiello who play's Reno's close friend, is only in a couple of scenes, one a weird dream sequence involving him and Oldman, where of course, you first think the scene is real. His short but memorable screen time is appreciated. The climax to The Professional reminded a lot of the one in The Specialist, but here it was beautiful. The Professional uses less scenes than it could of had, and that's a plus, as it's pulled off beautifully in ones 95's cool action pieces, with one tragic, thunderstruck ending.",

As the orphan, Portman is wonderful in her film debut. As Leon, Reno does OK but his character is unbelievable and underdeveloped. It is hard to believe that Leon, an uneducated, dim-witted, child-like fellow who loves plants and drinks milk is also a cold-blooded killer. He tells Portman she shouldn't use foul language but teaches her how to kill people. What a guy! Oldman, who would play Beethoven in his next film, is horribly over-the-top as a Beethoven-loving psycho DEA agent. On the plus side, the score is nice and the celebrity impersonations by Portman and Reno are amusing.",

It successfully blends action, drama, thriller (...you name it) together. It’s masterfully directed by Luc Besson which proves that you don’t need a big budget to make a really good movie. The shooting is awesome- Camera angles, close to face camera focus, scenes such as Mathilda’s face illuminating as the door opens and the white flash at the end is simply awesome! The Musical score and soundtrack such as Sting and Björk is again... Very well chosen and fits the movie completely! The movie contains some unforgettable dialogues & scenes too. The scene where there is a burst of laughter in the Restaurant or the toilet scene with Gary Oldman is just a treat to watch that guy act!

The story is too over the top too, and the things that happen and the things that the characters do seem too unbelievable. The action is not all that believable either, although it is very well done.

I highly recommend it based on Portman's performance alone. Also, the interaction between her character Mathilda--a twelve-year-old--and Jean Reno's Leon is at once touching and horrifying, given the nature of the material. Is Leon criticizing Mathilda for talking to the boy in the street and her liberal use of profanity as a father-figure, or because he's training her to be the ""professional cleaner"" she wants to become. Portman really does steal the show, though. Her ease with delivering her lines, many quite profane and vulgar, is amazing. Entertaining without being vacuous, this is a fine movie.",

I am very proud of Gary because he did such a wonderful job portraying the drug addicted chief of police who loved to kill those who valued life. What a wicked character, and how extraordinary his acting skills are. Natalie was great in this film, and she was a mere child. Some people may think that a hit man would never come to the rescue of a child especially if she is not a relative, but that's the great lesson of this story. Jean's character, Leon, has the ability to shoot anyone for money, anyone that is except for women and children, and that, I find was a good twist. It was best said in the classic story ""BEOWULF.""

Many of the action scenes are hokey, and some of acting was cheesy. Portman was amazing, though. Even at 12 years old, you could see the immense talent, beauty, and passion that were waiting to be unleashed upon the world. However, it was a bit disturbing how Besson tried to sex her up in some of the scenes... Ultimately, this film is about redemption, and how true family can sometimes be forged through fire, instead of genes. While it was awesome for its time period, the bar has been raised for movies a great deal in the last 18 years.

After a while, I was able to completely connect with Leon and Mathilda who were two unique and fun characters. The maniacal things like for example the milk and the overprotectiveness for the plant did it for me. These factors made Leon so pure and sincere. Mathilda's development during the movie was also interesting to see, Nathalie Portman certainly launched her career from this fantastic acting experience. A must see for people who love quirky movies.",
216,10 August 2017,bachispicaqtmz,10, I was so moved,"I do love this movie. This has speedy plot development, so I never got tired of watching. Any details of Leon are not described in the film. But it is gradually revealed that he is alone and a professional killer. I was surprised to watch him sleeping while sitting. It must be tough. At first, Leon tries to kill a fat man. In that scene, you hear the heartbeats of the close man and this makes you nervous. Leon gets close to him and put the knife on the men's neck. His heartbeats stops and there are no sound at that time. I gasped at this scene. Matilda, the heroine of this film, is also a lonely although she has a family. Leon refuses her offer to practicing killing at first, but he cherishes her little by little. They spend the time not only practicing killing but also playing and studying and eating. The scenes of Matilda disguises herself as various famous persons is one of my favorite scenes. Of course she is cute, but Leon, wondering who Matilda is imitating is also so cute. They are not on good terms at first. But Leon buys pretty clothes to Matilda. Matilda teaches reading and writing to Leon. They squirt water at each other...they look like real father and daughter day by day. Gary Oldman is one of main characters in this film. He is a merciless man and I was very disgusted at the way he speaks and acts! I hope Leon or Matilda kill him as soon as possible throughout. The climax scene when Oldman mobilizes all the troops is so exciting. The camera-works of this scene is marvelous. I re-winded a film and watched this scene many times. It is very thrilling. When Leon lets Matilda go, I feel very sad. Leon's survival relieves me but at last he dies. Their dream that to live together peacefully could not come true, but the last scene, Matilda plants Leon's precious plant in a field shows a certain positive perspective, doesn't it?",

You could put this film alongside any modern thriller and it's stands the test of time and although 24 years old it's not dated at all.,

The casting is perfect, the relationship between Leon and Mathilda is both sweet and heartbreaking. After seeing, actually during, this film I knew little Natalie was on her way. Such a natural presence and delivery is a rare thing. It's as if she had been living this part for her whole 11 yrs. And Reno gave us his best role ever. The King of Badguys has played many great characters, but Oldman is on fire here. The guy could be the best villain to ever hit the screen. I think back to some of his bad guys he's played, and those movies wouldn't be the same if he wasn't a part of them. The soundtrack is also tremendous, and the closing song by Sting really defined the whole film. I have nothing bad to say about this film, and would have done nothing different. Luc needs to get part II started fast! The story lines are endless. Just noticed that Natalie Portman has two 8.6 IMDb scores with Leon and Black Swan. Not too shabby in this day and age",
221,20 May 2015,dhaufrect-1,10," ""Leon: The Professional"" is a great film.","""Leon: The Professional"" is a great movie from 1994. The director and the writer is Luc Besson. It is currently on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal. The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be. Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants. The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie. I gave it 10 stars. Dale Haufrect",

The movie begins with Leon, portrayed by Jean Reno, a hit-man who takes in a 12-year-old girl named Mathilda, portrayed by a young Natalie Portman in her feature film debut, whose family has been murdered by a corrupt DEA agent, portrayed by Gary Oldman. With the help of a friendly mobster, by Danny Aiello, and this weird 12-year-old girl, Leon will try his best to protect from this corruptive agent. ""Leon: The Professional"" is a mixture of action and heartwarming drama. This movie takes us on explosive action scenes, while warming our hearts with the friendly chemistry between Leon and Mathilda. Jean Reno delivers the best performance of his career as the milk-obsessed hit-man. Natalie Portman makes a pretty-well portrayal for her big-screen debut. Gary Oldman steals the show as the murderous and mischievous agent of corruption. Danny Aiello makes a sweet and tough impression in his character, as well. The dialogue is sharp, the direction is well-managed, the acting is well-crafted, and the action scenes are thrilling. This movie also has a big heart, when talking about this unlikely friendship between this hit-man and a little girl. It's a cinema favorite for all you movie buffs. It has a well-crafted premise, and this is a movie that really works. This movie is definitely a must-watch.

Leon (The Professional) is quite possibly the finest work by director Luc Besson.There's conviction in this movie, and intelligence. Besson's incomparable film is almost impossible to beat and there's yet to be a director who could match his magnum opus.

The South Korean film Parasite is a good example of ""bad, so I will make it extra bad."" Leon, the movie we are discussing now, also falls into that category. I am not being unjust folks. It's a crappily written film with a very very ridiculous premise. I'm occasionally ok with a ridiculous premise, but at other times I am annoyed by them. Leon is an annoying premise. How can I explain to you how annoying? I really am not sure how. All I can say is that the ending is worst then everything that goes before it. Oh and by the way, I have seen Oldham in about half a dozen films and he becomes more and more unimpressive. His over the top, super animated antics in this film, don't convince me of greatness.

251,15 February 2006,fertilecelluloid,9," Erotic, funny, violent action fantasy","Leon (Jean Reno), a child-like assassin, becomes the protector of Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a precocious child whose parents are brutally murdered. Expanding on themes first explored in his ""La Femme Nikita"", Luc Besson's ""Leon"" (aka ""The Professional"") is one the most potent, audacious action fantasies ever branded to celluloid. Primarily, it is a love story that walks a delicate generational line and supports its basic narrative with provocative imagery, beautifully staged action, and simmering erotic tension. Portman is quite incredible as the strong-willed Mathilda and is a joy to watch as she naively seduces Reno into agreeing to father her. Reno, as the simple, boyish Leon, is thoroughly convincing and engaging in a difficult, ambiguous role. Though set (but not totally shot) in New York, the film has a strong European flavor and mixes Hong Kong-style action with intimate, cool drama that is often very funny. Eric Serra's moody score is a major contributor to the film's unique tone while Bjork's sensational ""Venus As A Boy"" is a stunning counterpoint to the darkness swirling around the characters. The events of the film are not realistic and there is a strained logic one must ignore in order to buy into the stylized reality. The extended cut focuses more heavily on Leon teaching Mathilda the tricks of his trade and amps up the erotic tension with a drunken dinner scene. Superb.",

U.,"Are any of us happy we responded so enthusiastically to La Femme Nikita that we now have to sit through shiny garbage like The Fifth Element and the Professional?  Wow, this movie's stupid.  The movie begins attempting no nonsense-realism by choosing gritty, not picturesque parts of the city, as well as chucking in the pretty gratuitous murder of a child to make it that much more ""edgy"", and then the movie just becomes an orgy of gun-worship and impersonal murder, strung together by a silly, yet sickening plot, where this mass murderer's (Leon) really kind of cute and avuncular when babysitting this heavily made up 12 year old.  Hey, he drinks milk!  How bad could he be?  And he refuses to shoot women and children!  What a guy!  I, being an adult male, he would happily kill given the business opportunity, but serves me right for not being a woman or child.  In the course of the plot he teaches this alarmingly sophisticated neighbor girl how to be like him, how to kill strangers.   Ahhh.  The ""lessons"" he offers her, the tricks of his trade are chestnuts you'd  never ever think of like, ""relax.  keep your eye on him.""  I would have thought panic and look away, so shows what I know!  And not like I'm mister puritanical, but something quite pronouncedly creepy is at least SUPPOSED to be going on in this film, I have never seen a child quite so ""advertised"" which is an extremely sleazy thing to be half-heartedly suggesting in your half-baked movie about the lovable hitman and orphan annie who likes to sing ""Like A Virgin"" and dress up as Marilyn Monroe.  Which reminds me--the abysmal humor that appears throughout the film, is that like a trademark with this guy?  ""The Fifth Element"" had an equally annoying cute streak.  Lastly, if you really watch Jean Reno, forgetting he's French and interesting looking, his performance is pretty rank amateur.  He really looks even more lost than the lovable murdering dope he's supposed to be playing.  They also refer to him in the film as Italian, which he's clearly French.  Does the French director not know what French accents sound like?  Gary Oldman is laughabale, at best, and that really is almost a compliment, or as close to one as this thing deserves.",

Alongside film icons Gary Oldman, who plays a crooked detective, and Jean Reno, the Italian assassin who rescues Mathilda after her parent's death, Portman and crew deliver a powerful performance that calls to question the ambiguity of morality.
Léon: The Professional is more than a coming of age film. Although it spends most of its time detailing the effects urban crime can have on a young teenager, it takes several stops to unpack the kindness known even among stereotypical villains. Everything seems backward in Léon: The Professional. The cops are the bad guys, the hitman is a savior, and the child acts more like an adult than anyone else.
There is a lot to like about Léon: The Professional. The score is modern for its era, even featuring Sting's song ""Shape of My Heart"" which has a guitar melody many modern viewers will recognize from Juice Wrld's song ""Lucid Dreams."" The camera work is also sound, featuring ingenious POV shots that stick the viewer into the character's headspace. If the technical beauty of the film alone doesn't grab you, the cast's exceptional performance will. Detective Stansfield is perhaps Gary Oldman's most recognizable role. Natalie Portman appears seasoned in her execution, driving a noticeable wedge in between her and other similar aged actors' abilities.
Léon: The Professional is not a film to miss. It deals in heavy material like corruption, drug use, murder, and love across age barriers without beating the audience over the head. Without a doubt, It should reside on every film lover's top 250 list.",
270,17 February 2015,jb0579,9," Masterpiece you say? No, but Close.","I won't bore you with a long plot synopsis, just to say that Reno plays Leon, a contract killer who informally adopts Matilda (Portman), a young girl with no place to go and fortuitously becomes aguainted with Leon the ""cleaner. Matilda becomes bent on avenging her family's murder, particularly that of her innocent little brother (the rest of the family is either abusive or uninteresting to her). Oldman's character as a corrupt cop becomes the object of her ire, and with help from a reluctant Leon the two set out to settle the score. What I will say is that I was BLOWN AWAY with the fact that, for all intents and purposes, this was the first big screen job for Portman, who was fragile, tough as nails, timid, bold, nervous, and even provocative - all at the same time. Oldman is just plain Gary Oldman. Effortless, believable, awesome as always, and charming even though his villainous role demands he not be, and you can't HELP but to fall in love with Jean Reno, who steals EVERYTHING he does. The beginning of the movie? Riveting. The middle? Absolutely keeps your attention: a perfect....PERFECT mix of tension and comic relief (which by the way is why I pan a lot of movies. In EVERY real life situation there's at least SOMETHING funny). The movie is at times intense and at times tender enough to evoke tears, if you are prone to that sort of thing. In my reviews I always add "" Scenes to Watch For""..... in this movie: when Portman (Matilda) is desperately knocking on Reno's (Leon's) door for reasons that will become obvious to you, watch her performance there, and the use of light on her face when the door opens but the viewer can't see it....genius direction and use of light. Another scene: the comic relief every time you see them march up the street carrying a plant for, again, reasons that will become obvious to you. And in general, Reno is perhaps the best actor alive at acting with just his facial expressions. Again....genius. the ""Godfather""? No. But wow, a powerful, powerful movie.

I believe that this is thanks to the good writing, character development, and single-mindedness of a general film viewer/critic, although a wider audience gave much more love to the film than the critics. There is nothing lolitaesque in 'Leon'. We all know that most young girls have some sort of crush into older men. But thanks to the brilliant performance of Jean Reno (and of course young Natalie Portman as Mathilda), and subtle writing, the relationship between the two main heroes is purely mentor-apprentice. Besides the 'love story', it is also a classic revenge tale and coming of age story. There is nice subtle morale there how sometimes it is best to leave the immediate retaliation onto the hold. Sometimes it is better to wait for justice to take longer. It might hit harder.",

276,12 November 2020,verna-a,4, The worship of violence,"Ok, so it's a suspenseful and watchable movie. But I did watch it with a growing disbelief that we are expected to swallow the messages implicit in the story : that because bad stuff happens to people they are entitled to turn into serial murderers, and while they are doing this, somewhere inside they are deeply loveable and can be redeemed by their devotion to one other person. This is peddled by depicting the vast majority of people as mean, evil or stupid so that their deaths mean nothing. And in this bloody universe, the thing to worship is guns. Firearms of all sorts are lovingly depicted as is the mayhem they create. This is the blackness at the heart of America, the sick and probably doomed society. I know Besson is a Frenchman, but he appears to fully embrace the American noir. If the violence wasn't sickening enough, there is extra sleaze in depicting the adolescent Portman as a titillating nymphet. I have a feeling I should have constantly made signs to ward off the devil while watching the film. This sort of film has deadened me to violence to a considerable extent, or I couldn't have watched it through to the end, but hopefully I have retained enough objectivity to know that humanity is reaching a pretty low ebb to serve this sort of thing up as entertainment.",

How could the story of a disturbingly attractive 12-year-old girl ""adopted"" by a single middle-aged man under bizarre circumstances - he literally holds the power of life and death over her - not be lascivious? All I can say is that the director and actors somehow found a way to avoid it. The other point, which is related to the first, is that Natalie Portman's performance is mesmerizing.

Stifling her terror, she walks past to the door of another apartment and knocks on it as though it is her own home, praying that the strange neighbour will open the door and let her in Luc Besson explores with great skill the unlikely relationship between Mathilde the 12-year old orphan and Leon: professional killer, immature loner and psychopath.

Leon is a very human character, he's got a lot of depth to him. The entire cast is brilliant, the story is brilliant. It's honestly one of the best films I've ever seen in my life.

Reno is great, Portman is impressive, the two have great chemistry, and the action scenes are exhilarating. When it doesn't work, though, it really doesn't work. Oldman is basically playing the same role he was stuck with throughout the 90s (though he gives it his all), the direction is bland and damn near amateurish, the whole film looks cheap, and the core relationship, while developed well, leaves a bad taste in one's month. A little too much awkward sexual tension. I think the problem is that Portman's role was written for someone older, and, as such, she just seems too young. It's rather overrated, and it's also dated by some terrible, terrible music choices.",

I couldn't believe how this epic movie ""grabbed my heart"" and I was wordless after the end of it. I am still so impressed every time I watched it again and again. This was the first movie with Jan Reno starring I watched. He became one of my favorite actors with his ""simplicity"" of acting and being the good bad guy. Gary Oldman was brilliant with his mad behavior and strong powerful playing. The little Natalie was the ""icing on the cake"" and she was as good as it was Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone.

He watches her family getting murdered from the peep hole in his apartment door. I can't give this one a higher rating because it started slowing down as I was ready to leave.

The only film that tops it for me is The Shawshank Redemption (click my name above to see my review on that) so therefore for me it beats the likes of my other favourites like The Godfather and Schindlers list. One of the main reason this film is so great is because of Natalie Portmans amazing acting in it, she managed to capture angry, suicidal, vengeful side of Mathilda but also the loving more caring side of her, not many grown up actors/actresses can do that let alone a kid.

Young Natalie Portman really shows exactly how good an actress she could be at the age of 13. Since I haven't seen Black Swan, this, to me is her finest performance. Jean Reno as Leon was absolutely wonderful as the two shared some great scenes but the star of the movie, to me, without any doubt is Gary Oldman. There is no need to go on about him as an actor in general but in this movie, he is something absolutely unbelievable.

345,15 January 2007,jboothmillard,8, Léon,"From director Luc Besson (The Fifth Element), I remember seeing this film, also titled The Professional, once before, but I couldn't remember much about it, so I had to have a second viewing. Basically Leone 'Léon' Montana (Jean Reno) is the professional hit-man, or ""cleaner"", who only drinks milk, cares for a houseplant and loves Gene Kelly musicals, and he lives next to Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman) is the twelve year old New York girl living with her little Brother (Carl J. Matusovich) and her dysfunctional family. Mathilda's Father (Michael Badalucco) is being paid by corrupt DEA cops to store cocaine in his house, and when they find out he has been stealing some of it for himself, sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman 'Stan' Stansfield (Gary Oldman) leads his team of agents to kill him and his family. Mathilda managed to escape death going shopping, and Léon lets him into his apartment knowing she is all alone, and she eventually finds out his deadly profession, but she doesn't see this as a threat, but an opportunity. She is willing to pay him a fee he has mentioned to kill the people responsible for killing her family, well, specifically her brother, or teach her to use the weapons of his trade, so he does this. So Léon teaches her how to use many firearms, particularly a scoped rifle, and in return she does chores in the apartment and teaches him some skills he lacks, such as literacy, and in doing so she claims she is falling in love with him. One day, after learning what she thinks is enough to do the job herself, Mathilda takes a number of weapons in a bag to go and hunt Stansfield down, posing as an innocent delivery girl, but he ambushes her, until Léon arrives to take her away. After gaining the information of Léon's whereabouts from friend Tony (Danny Aiello), Stansfield gets a team of SWAT-like masked men to take Mathilda hostage and infiltrate the apartment, but Léon's skills get the better of them and he gets her back safely. She manages to escape going down an air shaft, and Léon looks like he is going to make his way out posing as one of the masked men with bad injuries, but Stansfield recognises him. The end sees Léon nearly getting away, but being shot by Stansfield, and blowing himself and the villain up with active grenades, and after being refused a hit-man existence, Mathilda tries to return to school, and she plants Léon's beloved plant in a field. Also starring Peter Appel as Malky, Ellen Greene as Mathilda's Mother and Elizabeth Regen as Mathilda's Sister. Reno gives a wonderful performance as the loner with all the skills, Oldman is great as a dark drug taking villain on the wrong side of the law, and young Portman almost steals the show as the girl wanting revenge, and obviously Reno and Portman together create sparks. It is an action filled film, with some funny moments, some dark, atmospheric and suspenseful moments, as well as touching moments with the title character and his female friend bonding, a must see thriller. Gary Oldman was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 36 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",

Both their lives change dramatically, as they have to be with a person whom they know little about, but they like each other. The plot is captivating, and very well-written. The acting is all top-notch, especially from the three main characters, played by Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman. Each of them portray their respective character to perfection. The pacing is good, there is rarely a moment in the film where you are bored. The action scenes are very well done, action-filled yet relatively realistic. Every time there is an action sequence involving Leon, the hitman, you only see him briefly, every time he kills someone. It's like being a silent spectator, seeing a professional hitman in action. Very cool. I think most people who enjoys dramas, especially dramas about love and change, will like this, though some action fans might wanna give it a shot too(no pun intended). I also recommend this to any fan of the aforementioned actors, as all of them perform very well in this movie. 10/10",

The hopeful look in his face and the blank, yearning expression betrayed his feelings, but deprived him of his killer instinct -- a pistol followed him, and he did not even know it. Finally, the shot rang out, and the killer died at the end of the dark corridor, one step from the shining door.

377,5 April 2018,PipAndSqueak,9, Nothing to lose,"Casting for this film is spot on, starting with Jean Reno as the ruthless contract killer, through incredibly young Portman as the orphaned girl, to Oldman as the psychopathic and evil cop. The hitman cares only for his killing skill, a potted plant (a prayer plant, I think) and the dreamy and imaginative routines in film musicals. The girl is lost, or a lost cause, both in her own eyes and those of her abusive family. Only her little brother 'loves her' and he is taken from her in the most brutal of fashions. The hitman can't help observing the whole nasty episode but is too knowing to involve himself, except, the girl has already tugged his heart-strings.

I don't know if such a character is possible in real life, and I'm not sure about the message of the film, if there's any, but the fact is that I find good acting, good music and a film with which you don't get bored. My rating is 7 out of 10.",
380,11 September 2002,cathcacr,8," Really nice concept, but grueling in execution","First off, lovers of this film need to get some film-viewing maturity. Take just about any film in the Top 250, and I daresay that very, very few will have this massive a gap of opinion between that of the ""top 1000 voters"" (7.6 average) and the viewership at large (8.3 average).  And there's a very good reason for this; an experienced viewer can separate the virtues from the vices of this film, and this one is too long on the vices.  The set-up is great: merciless hitman is humanized, serves as protector and guide to young girl.  This *could* have been a great movie had it not fallen so flat in how it's executed.  Maybe it's something about kid actors, but the scenes where Mathilda (Portman, who shows promising signs of her deficiences as older actress) has anything to say draaaaaag on and on.  For any number of reasons you can imagine, the dialogue is cause for nervous fidgeting.  The attempts at humor make you wince.  The attempts at profundity will make you laugh.  The intriguing plot degenerates into artificial, sometimes preposterous, scenarios.  The highlight of the film?  Gary Oldman as the villain.  That should tell you something right there.  His flailing and jerking around in the police restroom was the most enjoyable moment of the movie.  Maybe Oldman himself realized that this movie wasn't to be taken all too seriously.  I wouldn't recommend the DVD version to anyone, as it makes the experience a grueling one.  A ridiculous restaurant sequence, among other things, is removed for the American release.  (Would have made for an interesting ""outtakes"" section on the DVD, at best.)  I gave this one a 5/10.  In the hands of a really skilled director and top-notch actors, this could have been great.",

382,16 May 2014,Incendid,7, Milk.,"I have been dying to buy Leon for years now and when i saw it on the top shelf at my local music store (why it was there i don't know) i bought it straight away, went home and watched it and it was awesome. The directing was as smooth as a circle, the writing inventive, the action was limited but awesome when it was there, the acting holds up mostly and then there is the greatest villain of them all, Gary Oldman. Starting with the acting, Jean Reno aced his performance and really did portray the 'cleaner' profession, i really do wish all films based around hit-men could be like this, i really do. The writing, it sustained a brisk pace throughout the movie and plotted twists and turns in different places creating this fantastic film. But there is one character who i find unusually disturbing and this was Matilda played by Natalie Portman, Matilda was weird, disturbing and a little bit looney, but on the other hand she is still a innocent kid who loves to copycat and play games, yet she acts like an adult to lure Leon into her trap where who knows what would have happened. Matilda disturbed me yet showed me the innocence of childhood and that is exactly what a charterer like her should do, divide your opinion and question their every move. Then there is Gary Oldman, and he honestly was more disturbing, you could see the insanity in his eyes, yet he could be disturbingly calm or the complete opposite and we never actually get to know his character which i love to see, every film needs a character like this, i think it just keeps the audience on the edge of their seat just connecting the dots. To conclude i feel as if Leon has made it into my top 10 favourite films of all time so i award it with a 9/10.",

It tells a story of two desperate souls and their search for meaning in their separate hopeless existences. It's also one hell of an intense action movie. Its star, a hit-man known as Leon (Jean Reno), lives in a world that is entirely of his own making, a world that is devoid of life, of meaning, and most importantly, love. Strange that by film's end, these are the very things he discovers in his fleeting final moments with the person who gave him these emotions, a 12 year-old girl named Mathilda (Natalie Portman), whose parents were murdered by a corrupt DEA agent named Stansfield (Gary Oldman). The acting here is brilliant, especially from Portman, who's a little too convincing, and Oldman is a little more unhinged here than usual. ""The Professional"" is skillfully directed by Luc Besson, who's also making his American debut here. This is a true action lover's action movie, so sit back, relax, and enjoy.",

This film is about the unusual apprenticeship of a hit man and a 12 year old girl who seeks revenge on a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman, who delivers a over the top, creepy performance here as main villain and scumbag). Jean Reno is a different kind of anti hero. Leon is a super efficient killer, but comes across as a little slow and socially awkward. Nonetheless, he is a professional hitman with ethics and gets his orders from mob boss Tony(Danny Alleio). Natalie Portman gives a good performance for someone so young and is convincing as an abused child from a completely dysfunctional family. This sort of story is atypical for an action flick, but was done really well with strong performances, tension and strong visuals and score. As a film this is very violent, but the world in which the characters inhabit is the same. The shootouts/ action sequences are top tier and Leon is a classic that holds up well. Leon The Professional is a original take on the hitman/professional killer genre and is one of the best movies of it's kind.",

That girl is Natalie Portman, wow was she young. She also does well, although she contains the only fault in the movie, and it's not really her, it's the character. I know that Portman's character is supposed to be persistent, but it gets kind of annoying with her, but the acting done by Portman redeems the character anyway. The storyline by Besson is great considering other action movies, and the directing was so well done. BOTTOM LINE: A CLOSE TO PERFECT ACTION MOVIE THANKS TO THE ACTING, FANTASTIC DIRECTION, AND A SCRIPT THAT IS GREAT...IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER ACTION SCRIPTS....the ""You don't like Beethoven do you?"" is the best line of the movie said by Oldman, boy was he creepy.",

I didn't really know what to expect and I still don't really know how I feel about the whole thing. In a way I have to give it to the film makers because they took an age old dramatic twist and added complete obscurity to it. It's the Punky Brewster, A Simple Twist of Fate (Steve Martin), Raising Helen (Kate Hudson) I could go on and on and on. A little person (usually a precocious little girl) inadvertently enters a single man's life and changes him and that is precisely what The Professional is only add in brutal gritty violence, sexualize the little girl to an almost disturbing nature, and just make it this really loud and violent story about two very different people who find each other. None of this makes the film inherently bad, just very adult, and gives it a very ominous and disturbing nature. I think this is exactly what has made The Professional the cult classic that it is because it takes a very big stretch in a genre and makes it somehow almost comical and yet dark and gritty and really twisted.

Her neighbor happens to be a professional hitman. It started off excellent, but it went downhill. The girl had a crush on the hitman and professed her love. The man was uncomfortable at first (as he should be). What I don't like is that he didn't tell her off. When he ""told her off,"" he was only talking about his ex, not the age thing. I get that the girl was exposed to serious stuff that she wasn't supposed to see so she matured faster. And that she started this weird love thing. However, she was a CHILD!

He is the exact opposite of Leon; whereas Leon's a innocent in an evil profession, Stansfield has blood all over his hands in a legitimate one.

His character's ruthless ability to kill, colored by his childish innocence despite his career as a hired killer make him lovable and sympathetic. And the heartbreaking performance from the wonderful Natalie Portman as the confused and older than her years Mathilda, who is orphaned by the murderous Stansfield and is driven by a thirst for revenge; makes your heart stop, and the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.

It is often wondered why Lyon brought the pot of greens wherever he went, and why at the last crisis, he still asked Mattier to take care of a plant. What a curious plant. Lulu is the best evidence that Lyon is not a good killer. Luolu represents the weak, those who need protection and care, and the love that Lyon once could not protect. In fact, Lyon wanted to love someone, protect her, take care of her, and care for her. If that person doesn't show up, then he has to fill this emptiness with a pot of green dill.

Unruly smoking a cigarette, pretending to have a mature conversation. In the beginning, it is often inadvertent.

The door opened, Lyon greeted Matil, giving her a haven, and at the same time giving her lonely heart a chance to redeem.

Of course, she's not as destructive and might be viewed as a watered-down version of Wan-Chu, but she definitely wasn't boring and was badass enough for my taste.

What really bothers me about 'Leon' is another form of child abuse: the 'grooming' of a minor as a would-be professional assassin. Hollywood revenge flicks are a dime-a-dozen of course, and they usually end up endorsing vigilante violence in one way or another. But what makes this film so awful is the application of this trope to the realm of childhood, and, further, its blank refusal to consider the moral implications of this stance. Sure, the little girl's family has been wiped out, and she wants payback, but is the most humane response to the situation really to help satisfy her desires, and get her even more entangled in the world of brutal criminality? The criminals are simply regulation scum who deserve what they get, and a little girl is deemed as suitable an agent of vengeance as an experienced hit-man. Leon is just as much a criminal and a murderer as the bad guys, but he is strong, taciturn and endowed with a sentimental streak, so he's 'noble'. No deeper reflection is required. Dress it all up in the odious trappings of fey Gallic whimsy (ye Gods, it's worse than 'Amelie'!), and the movie's nasty little heart beats on unnoticed.

426,28 June 2006,deepmc,10, Simplicit,"Most people misinterpret this movie, Leon was not a pedophile. He was a hit-man who obviously has no family and love for no one and he finally finds someone he can care for. It is not really sure how he loves her, but he wouldn't have sex with Matilda. He loves her like a Father would love his Daughter. This is one of the few well made emotional aspect movies that I can actually enjoy. It had everything a movie should have, slight humor, emotion, drama and action and most importantly, love. If you can't respect a well made film like this, then perhaps you shouldn't be on IMDb, trying to offer your two-cents on a movie you know nothing of.",

It is in full swing every way you look at it, it’s flawless. I call it perfection. The pinnacle of Luc Besson film-making career. Direction was superb as well as the soundtracks and scores (by Eric Serra). The scores was one of the pivotal element of the movie which add to the depth and dense atmosphere to the movie. Besides the movie is highly stylish and original. All these finishes off with one of the greatest, breath taking ending to a movie I’ve ever seen and that without using excessive special effects.",

I can only wish for the younger generation to have been able to enjoy like we did until FB came coupled with the selfie sticks. The movie watching generation of now are quite limited in what they see, surprisingly not because there were not too many films but on the contrary you have zillions of things to watch out of boredom and everyone can be a superstar in YouTube. Lamentably, they are not accustomed to films like this. The duo of a battered child and a hired gun is action filled, yet we laugh with them and cry with them. Natalie Portman as the young , slightly irritating Mathilda is gifted with talent. Jean Reno as the distant yet fatherly figure of a pro killer is captivating in his role. They and the plant will entertain you ( like it did for us ) .",

Superb actors, electric performances from Reno,Portman and Oldman who all should have got at least an Oscar nomination IMO. Luc beeson gives us an exciting movie here that should excite,shock and keep you locked into the movie 100% all the way through as there are no boring parts. The movie has humor and a great soundtrack. This movies has no cgi which in my view is a good thing. The Hit-man who rescues a young girl at great risk which he understands better than anyone due to his profession, He goes against what he is and what he is all about because he cares deep down under the ruthless hit-man exterior is a caring human being and as the movies goes on we see more and more of this from him. Oldman is as phyco as it gets! Something he does very well and you know its only a matter of time before Reno and Oldman deal with each other.

Jean Reno stars as Leon, in his best performance, the hit-man, 100%successful, professional, silent, but lonely. Gary Oldman is the crooked cop, stealing almost every scene he is in.

She's spunky and in control while her hit man hero is slowly coming to terms with his professions' life's expectancy, his predicament and his emotions at the hands of a 12 year old drop out. Director Luc Besson still manages to drive the suspension of disbelief out the window along with Gary Oldman's over weirdness that is supposed to pass as tension producing terror. The popularity of the film got my attention, as does the opening 20 minutes. But it's the blossoming love story that keeps your interest. Besson will never be able to deliver a movie to be taken seriously due to his confusingly playful approach to film-making. Dialog too dramatic to be taken seriously, that never quite matches the film genre, other than comic book. Revenge, Love, Fate, Kapow!",

It has a great story line, Fantastic characters like Leon and Gary Oldman's Agent Stansfield and awesome action scenes like the last 20 minutes of the film. This movie is easily the best movie ever, in my opinion, and more people should of rated it higher and who ever out there who rated it only one star is a d@ck head and i hope they get eaten by a giant squid.

The always interesting Gary Oldman plays a clever, dangerous and very bent cop who murders the family of a lowlife drug runner, unaware that a young daughter (Portman) has survived and sought the protection of a hit-man (Reno). The plot follows her pursuit of revenge against the cop, but the film centers on the unusual relationship that develops between the now- orphaned girl and the loner hit-man.

I saw the original theatrical release and absolutely loved it. I owned this version on DVD and then watched the extended cut in dismay. I can't be the only one out there who thinks this has changed the entire feel of the film for the worse. The original release played more on Mathilda's (unreciprocated) romantic feelings for Leon whilst the extended release becomes something altogether more uncomfortable to watch. I won't be watching this again in a hurry. Do yourself a favour and watch the original version.,

I don't understand why this film is rated so highly by IMDB users. It's a standard violent action movie with a bit of Lolita thrown in...nothing wrong with the concept, but really, what's so great about it?

But for all the guns and bangs, it's the human scenes that sets Leon apart.

Also, is there a soundtrack available? only song I've heard is Sting's 'Shape of my Heart'. I loved the haunting violin sounds throughout the film.

I was wrong, she was a 12-year-old playing the part of a 12-year-old, which made her character even more realistic. Reno (Leon) and Portman (Mathilda) have a powerful dynamic relationship throughout the movie as a hit-man and orphan who are thrown together in an unlikely circumstance. Their characters are so believable and fascinating, by the end of the film it felt as if Leon and Mathilda were members of my own family because Reno's and Portman's performances was so gripping, realistic and heart felt. Portman is a complete natural talent, she doesn't act, she plays it for real! The soundtrack in the film also hits the right notes.

Danny Aleio is convincing in his caring for Leon. The action sequences are very realistic and not gratuitous.

I get it she had a traumatizing life so she doesn't exactly understand the adult child relationship, but this movie kept pushing the envelope way too close for my comfort.

Since ""The Professional"", other hit-man movies have been released, such as ""Assassins"", ""The Specialist"", ""Last Kiss Goodnight"", ""Bourne Identity"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", and ""Collateral"". In these movies, and other similar movies, the hit-man (or hit-woman) was nicely dressed, clean cut, well spoken, and had seemingly unlimited resources. In contrast, Leon lived in an old apartment, he dressed shabbily, and had a heavy accent that he could not hide.

480,10 February 2021,judemcrobbie,10, Foreign Indie-ness crossed with American blockbuster,"Leon is a masterclass in how to write a terrifying protagonist. The first scene exemplifies this:
How we don't see him until the end creates a sense of dread felt unlike any other movie. This is executed in the fear from dialogue and acting from the whole cast.
The use of lighting, or lack of, and compartmentalisation of information scared us as well as the antagonist.
This scene revolutionised fearmongering for a protagonist, from Batman to John Wick.
The way Besson creates the likeable nature is so simple. Merely by using the youthful connotations of milk and writing a completely unlikeable antagonist for the scene.
The opening and final acts are sublime but the second act let's it down just a bit. Not even that the second act is bad, but the opening and final act are so good comparatively not up to scratch.
Jean Reno is so good. He creates the caring parent idea with almost being friends with Mathilda.
Gary Oldman is so good. The nutter archetype is common but Standfield is layered and Oldman shows this perfectly.

While biting down on the capsules he pops into his mouth prior to executing his victims, Oldman shivers, shakes, crosses his eyes, and shrieks in ways similar to a vampire preparing to sink his fangs into a jugular vein.  It's an entertaining comic book performance that is perfectly in synch with a story that, no matter how grim and violent, is essentially a fantasy, one as syrupy and sentimental as an old Shirley Temple movie.",

His accent is so french, I could smell the Brie through my television. Gary Oldman tries to create his typical megalomaniacal character, but this one is more comical than anything. The plausibility of this 12 year-old girl becoming enamored with this lifestyle is ridiculous. The films flirting with pedophilia is disgraceful. The ending is stupid. The whole idea of JR's illiteracy is asinine. The sum of $5000 a hit is unbelievable. Sorry guys, you missed the mark on this one.",
504,18 April 2016,sol-,9, Professionalism,"Also known as 'The Professional', this Luc Besson thriller follows the bond that grows between a loner hit-man and a preteen girl who he gives shelter to after her family is massacred. The film features several well crafted action sequences, a memorable escape from a seemingly inescapable situation and an excellent pulsating music score. The best asset here though is the unusual bond between the pair, which Besson carefully works through; as an impressionable near-teenager, the girl goes from viewing Léon as a saviour, to a father figure, to a mentor, to a potential lover, to simply a caring friend, and a young Natalie Portman hits every note perfectly in her portrayal (consider the respect she shoes Léon when he asks her not to smoke compared to her real father). Jean Reno is also fine as the hit-man, resisting temptation to lead her on when in her 'lover' phase. Not everything about Reno/Léon quite rings true. His constant drinking of milk (in lieu of liquor) and his affection for potted plants are obvious devices to soften the character, however, his life philosophy feels real at every turn, having to make some very hard choices; he even considers putting a bullet through Portman's head in her sleep to end her misery. The film's best performance though arguably comes from Gary Oldman, more maniacal than ever, talking gibberish about classical music and setting everyone around him on edge. The surrogate father/daughter angle is, however, what really propels the film. It highlights the ability of two lonely souls to connect in the crazy, violent world out there. Thoughtful stuff.",

Great cast/acting aside, the story comes off as just another mid-90's, ultra-violent Pulp Fiction clone. I've seen other films from that era recently, such as True Romance and Natural Born Killers. They all seem to mistake shock value for realism. Pulp Fiction pulls off the ultra-violence routine because it is about something other than the violence itself. Most other films of that genre, The Professional included, are almost comical in their melodrama. My guess is that this type of film will look passé for the next 50 years and then make a comeback, like film noir has. Until then, 5/10.",

It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year- old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.",

516,4 April 2004,snakej32,6, An Unintentionally Hilarious Comedy,"Hilarious, I have more laughs watching this movie with my friends than anything, think about it: The overly done stupid Milk thing, the whole first scene with things like: Leon randomly being in a vent to kill some guy when he was just on the stairs less than a minute before, when the balcony window closes hes somehow shooting towards it when he clearly isnt on the balcony which means he must be floating in the air in front of the building, him magically appearing and disappearing in a dark hallway in the beginning as well as his arm stretching when he backs up from the fat guy, the guys they try to pass off as D.E.A. (like the white Jamacan guy with a machine gun who empties his whole clip wildly in a small apartment or a guy who can sniff peoples lies and is high on drugs all the time) the whole pig in the kitchen thing (HES A HITMAN CMON), him taking in and training a little 12 year old girl who aspires to be a cleaner and having a strange relationship with her (if you see the uncut version the restaraunt scene is....strange) AND THEN HE GOES ON HITS WITH HER TOO, AND SHE USES A SILENCED PAINTBALL GUN! And has anyone looked closely at his choice of style? If you look you can see that his pants come up to his ankles and he wears knee socks haha, i'm sure thats what real hitmen dress like. Also, him using double pistols upsidown to kill a whole swat team, him surviving a grenade in a tiny apartment that hit right next to him (just by doing his hilarious ""AHHHHHHHHHHHH"" and diving a few feet to his side)and then him being able to recover from the blast with almost no injuries and then changing into an entire swat uniform in under 30 seconds. Also, Leon not noticing (in a totally empty hallway) that someone is following him with a gun (in a huge empty hallway you could surely hear someone else's footsteps, especially when they are right behind you.)If you want to see a good movie about a hitman watch Ghost Dog or even Road to Perdition. And Reno is damn good in La Femme Nikita as Victor, that's how a real ""cleaner"" would be, not a compassionate pedaphilic aging man who loves milk and plays with a pig ovenmit like Leon. I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I liked it, but that was before I realized all of it's inconsistencies, if you watch it more than once it becomes more of a comedy, go ahead watch it again and really analyze it, I'm sure there's even more stuff I left out",

Besson must have been watching the opening of the old Letterman show. The man eating the food is a mob boss, played by Danny Aiello, who wants to put a contract on a guy. The man who has come whizzing through the streets is Leon (Jean Reno), a skillful but uneducated ""cleaner,"" or professional hit-man But always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action.",

Luc Besson's mix of offbeat characters, humour and high octane action tends to be a little hit and miss, but in Leon he found the perfect balance between sensitive character study, emotion and tense action sequences. Pot plant loving, milk drinking loner Reno is the antithesis of the usual testosterone-soaked, gung-ho action hero and with no glib one liners or macho posturing, he takes no pleasure in the mayhem he induces; he's just very, very good at it. His relationship with a young Natalie Portman is sincere, funny and touching, and although emotionally ambiguous (at least from her adolescent point of view), it never crosses the line into sexual creepiness. Complimented by an excellent supporting cast, especially pill popping psychopath Gary Oldman who is the perfect foil for Reno's solitary hit-man, and wonderfully scored Leon is easily Besson's best work and one of the best action thrillers around.",

From its super-stylish beginninga directorial trademarkwe know we are in for a full-on cinematic experience. From the word go we have stunning action set pieces combined with some genuinely touching and funny scenes as well as sharp dialogue but what makes this film so special is the on-screen chemistry of its two leads. Jean Reno as the soft-spokenand somewhat naïvebut deadly French hit-man and Natalie Portman as the ballsy pre-teen determined to seek revenge on the psychotic cop who killed her family. There are plenty of humorous moments in this incredible film and some memorable one-liners including: ""Somebody's coming up somebody serious"". The underlying Lolita-style storyline is sometimes uncomfortable but strangely compelling and never gratuitous. Matilda sees Leon as a father-figure and he feels duty bound to protect her, however as the relationship becomes stronger Matilda confuses her feelings for something more sexualleaving Leon gob smacked and ultimately getting them evicted from their hotel.",

This is a good film and before I saw it I understood it to be an action-type shoot-em-up film that I probably would have passed on but when I viewed it on television I found it to Be quite well done and an offbeat and interesting and compelling story about the emotionless professional hit-man and his 12 year old neighbor girl who is street savvy and although she has a father and step family she is more like an orphan and a society dropout before becoming a teenager. The hit-man himself is like a big kid at times and delivers his role more through expression and body language than with dialog. The third central character is the dirty cop. French film heavy Jean Reno is Léon, Natalie Portman in her film debut is Mathilda and Gary Oldman is Stansfield star along with Danny Aiello and Peter Appel. Nikta director and writer Luc Besson has a mostly French crew of filmmakers with him here including cinematographer Thierry Arbogast who photographed the Besson films Nakita, The Messenger, Angela, The Fifth element and the soon to be released Arthur and the Minimoys. The great sound to this film is done by a sound team led by veteran Francois Groult. The production designer Dan Weil, worked with the prolific writer/director/producer Besson on several films.

This was also the movie I first saw Natalie Portman still in her youngster years, Jean Leno was fittingly appropriate for the role, and Gary Oldman was a perfect choice for an unlikely antagonist.

555,1 June 2023,bgar-80932,7, Good but I didn't find it great,This movie is good but it doesn't really ever strike me as great. It's a story of a hit man who through a set of circumstances that leads her an orphan starts taking care of a little girl. The girl wants revenge of those that killed her family but mostly just her four year old brother. Over time Leon (the hit man) starts teaching her his trade. She makes a big mistake tailing the killer who happens to be a DEA agent and he has to do whatever he can to bail her out. The end was even surprisingly satisfying for me to not give it an 8 or something but the dialogue never blew me away. Natalie Portman shined as the 12 year old girl though and you could tell she was going to be a good actress. Glad I watched it but I won't likely watch it again.,

Jean Reno seems rather goofy at times even though his character is supposed to be a ""professional killer"". However, the last 45 minutes of the film are very well done. I really began to feel for jean and natalie, even though their relationship was rather odd(a 40 year old man with a 12 year old girl). The ending is probably the best part of the movie, but I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Overall I give the film a 7/10.",

572,9 May 2002,supertom-3,10, One of the greatest action films ever and so much more!,"Luc Bessons greatest Hollywood film and perhaps the best action film ever. This is an action film with a heart. It has an engaging plot, interesting characters and relationships that develop and also where a lot of action films fall short, it has brilliant acting. The film is so thrilling. It is desperately tragic and also funny, its exciting and chilling. How a film can be so diverse and work well is beyond me. At times you'll be nearing tears in moments of tragedy and they will be seemlessly followed by moments of heart warming humour. The cast are all very good. Jean Reno is brilliant as the rather simple minded foreigner who at the start of the film cannot read but can kill as effectively as an A-bomb. Natalie Portman puts in one of the greatest child performances ever, the greatest in my opinion would be Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense the film which should have earned him an oscar, and only his age perhaps denied him of that. Portman has rightfully been launched as a top actress since this film, including parts in the Star Wars saga which is the dream job of many an actor/actress and wannabe film star. Also in a scene stealing show is the versatile actor Gary Oldman, he is scary as the corrupt police officer with a drug problem, Oldman is so beleivable I'd almost be too scared to meet him if the chance were to arrise. This film is a definite classic. The action scenes are very good and the music is also great. You'll laugh, cry and be on the edge of your seat in this movie. The developent of the relationship between Leon and Matilda is engrossing, it never drifts into the realms of Lolita, it seems more like they see each other as family despite the fact Matilda is enfatuated with Leon.

578,16 July 2015,Xkinhe,10, Amazing Movie...,"Besson seems fascinated by the ""Pygmalion"" story, by the notion of a feral street person who is transformed by education. He crosses that with what seems to be an obsession with women who kill as a profession. These are interesting themes, and if ""The Professional"" doesn't work with anything like the power of ""La Femme Nikita,"" it is because his heroine is 12 years old, and we cannot persuade ourselves to ignore that fact. It colors every scene, making some unlikely and others troubling. The film opens with one of those virtuoso shots which zips down the streets of New York and in through a door, coming to a sudden halt at a plate of Italian food and then looking up at its owner. Besson must have been watching the opening of the old Letterman show. The man eating the food is a mob boss, played by Danny Aiello, who wants to put a contract on a guy. The man who has come whizzing through the streets is Leon (Jean Reno), a skillful but uneducated ""cleaner,"" or professional hit-man. We see him at work, in opening scenes of startling violence and grim efficiency. In the course of the movie, Leon will, in effect, adopt his neighbor Matilda (Natalie Portman), a tough, streetwise, 12-year old girl. She escapes to Leon's nearby apartment after her family has been wiped out by a crooked top DEA enforcer named Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who wants to kill her too. Matilda wants to hire Leon to avenge the death of her little brother; in payment, she offers to do his laundry. Leon wants nothing to do with the girl, but she insists, and attaches herself like a leech. Eventually she develops an ambition to become a cleaner herself. And their fate plays out like those of many another couple on the lam, although with that 30-year age difference. Matilda is played with great resourcefulness by Portman, who is required by the role to be, in a way, stronger than Leon. She has seen so many sad and violent things in her short life, and in her dysfunctional family, that little in his life can surprise her. She's something like the Jodie Foster character in ""Taxi Driver,"" old for her years. Yet her references are mostly to movies: ""Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone,"" she tells him. ""Thelma and Louise didn't work alone. And they were the best."" (To find a 12-year old in 1994 who knows ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is so extraordinary that it almost makes everything else she does plausible.) So Leon finds himself saddled with a little sidekick, just when the manic Stansfield is waging a personal vendetta against him. Although ""The Professional"" bathes in grit and was shot in the scuzziest locations New York has to offer, it's a romantic fantasy, not a realistic crime picture. Besson's visual approach gives it a European look; he finds Paris in Manhattan. That air of slight displacement helps it get away with various improbabilities, as when Matilda teaches Leon to read (in a few days, apparently), or when Leon is able to foresee the movements of his enemies with almost psychic accuracy. This gift is useful during several action sequences in ""The Professional,"" when Leon, alone and surrounded by dozens if not hundreds of law officers, is able to conceal himself in just such a way that when the cops enter an apartment in just such a manner, he can swing down from the ceiling, say, and blast them. Or he can set a trap for them. Or he can apparently teleport himself from one part of an apartment to another; they think they have him cornered, but he's behind them. So many of the movie's shoot-outs unfold so conveniently for him that they seem choreographed. The Oldman character sometimes seems to set himself up to be outsmarted, while trying to sneak up on Leon in any way not actually involving chewing through the scenery. The premise ""La Femme Nikita"" was that its heroine began as a thoroughly uncivilized character without a decent bone in her body, and then, after society exploited her savagery, she was slowly civilized through the love of a good, simple man. ""The Professional"" uses similar elements, rearranged. It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style. And it is well acted. But always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action. In a more serious movie, or even in a human comedy like Cassavetes' ""Gloria,"" the child might not have been out of place. But in what is essentially an exercise - a slick urban thriller - it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.",

There isn't a young actress out there that could've played that role as effectively as Portman. The emotion she's able to summon from when she's looking for Leon to open the door after her family's been shot, to the entertaining charades game, to the intense scene with Stansfield in the bathroom, truly amazing. You can't help but feel empathy for her character. Vintage Gary Oldman playing the bad guy as the corrupt DEA officer, one of his best performances as an actor.

I was very interested of it, so I was pretty much expecting a great movie experience. The movie tells about an Italian professional hit-man Léon who lives in peace and quiet with his plant. He doesn't have any friends besides Tony who hires him for hit-man jobs and that's pretty much what his life is; Nothing special, boring to be exact, besides the jobs he does. His neighbour is a drug dealer who's working with crooked DEA officers. This neighbour has a wife and three kids, and one of those kids is a 12 year old girl named Mathilda who Léon occasionally speaks to in the hall way. Mathilda's life is pretty much miserable, his father being a drug dealer who sometimes hits her and the rest of his family being just mean and ignorant besides his four year old little brother who is the only friend of her's. One day Mathilda leaves to the grocery store and in the meantime her whole family is killed by the DEA officers. When she comes back and walks along the hall way she sees her family's dead bodies and keeps on walking towards Léon's door.

After watching movies over the years, realized Leon is just another flick made by Hollywood with all the formulas and recipes they use repeatedly to make the mass dumber and dumber. The dialogues were so awful. Both the main actors were unbearable this time around. The so-called anti hero is given a set of activities to make him look villainous...

593,7 February 2011,fgfbach,9, one of the most powerful film in terms of very strong characteristics in each one,"A tiny quick memento about the director before i start my comment ; This film has a special meaning to me (which i realized after i watched it), as a newcomer, after Angel-A, i decided to watch Leon, and after the film i started to check what other films were there from Luc Besson, and i was very much surprised when i saw SUBWAY which was the first film i saw in cinema when i was around 10 years old, thanks to my uncle my cinema-career had already started with such a powerful director. Regarding the film, The first impression for me about the film is that the characters are so powerful that each one grabs you till the scene changes, even those who appear not more than some minutes or even seconds.. there is a surprising low-tempo in the middle of the film which - i think- prepares us to the final shot, the music and effects are used in almost every scene, it may absurd to say but this film is like a mixture of a clockwork orange and taxi driver, the characters are very crazy and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) reminded me of Iris (Jodie Foster), The first 30 minutes is a complete master piece, tension is so high that you feel you are in the film witnessing the slaughter in the apartment walking in the corridor, i hardly remember any other film which takes me to the deepest level so powerful and effective (old boy, sympathy for lady vengeance), but i must say that i disliked the music plays before the final shot when Mathilda and Leon seen together for the last time, i don't like too much repetition in Music, and that scene disturbed me because of this, anyway, from the start to the end its one of the craziest yet one of the most sentimental one, get a glass of milk, water your plants and start to watch.",

Moments that left you enough of an impression to force you review and analyze them thoroughly. This film gives me what I am looking for. Leon and Mathilda are excellent characters and you really embrace their personalities, their spirit, their hardships, you watch their actions with agony and feel their will for carrying on in a cruel,unforgiving world. Stansfield is also excellent as the villain and shows the other side of the coin, that is how easy it is to fall into immorality and how much power that can give you in the system we live today.

598,25 May 2014,yanggg,9, Just for copy,"From Amazon.co.uk Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) made his American directorial debut with this stylised thriller about a French hit man (Jean Reno) who takes in an American girl (Natalie Portman) being pursued by a corrupt killer cop (Gary Oldman). Oldman is a little more unhinged than he should be, but there is something genuinely irresistible about the story line and the relationship between Reno and Portman. Rather than cave in to the cookie-cutter look and feel of American action pictures, Besson brings a bit of his glossy style from French hits La Femme Nikita and Subway to the production of The Professional, and the results are refreshing even if the bullets and explosions are awfully familiar.--Tom Keogh Product Description Léon: The Professional (French: Léon; Original U.S.: The Professional) is a 1994 English- language French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hit-man; Gary Oldman as corrupt DEA agent Stansfield; a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is taken in by the hit-man after her family is murdered; and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hit-man his assignments.",
599,24 June 2000,Sonatine97,8, The Director's Cut is even better than the classy original!,"The original Leon was truly excellent - typical of most Besson films, full of style, drama, dry wit & European subtlties.",
600,11 February 2007,dcldan,10, Just wonderful,"Leon is a merciless hit-man, he kills for money and has anyone in the world. His neighbor, Mathilda, is a 12-year-old girl that lives with her family, which is absolutely unstructured: the father sells drugs, the mother takes them and her sister only thinks about her body. One day, another hit-man kills Mathild'as family, but she is saved from death by Leon, who, at the last moment, decides to take care of someone and saves her. She is much more adult that it seems and hire Leon to revenge the death of her family. Their relationship will change their lives forever. Probable Luc Besson's best work, he directs a perfect script, without any hole. Actors play perfect parts and all the action scenes are perfect: hard, but not too much, long but not too much, intense, but needed. The story is also touching, moving, totally believable, with a very catching end. Recommended to anyone, it is just wonderful.",
601,17 May 2010,Will3451,9, Million times better than the Bollywood copy Bichhoo (2000),I saw the Bollywood copy years before I saw the original because I am from Pakistan and in my region Bollywood movies are more famous and popular but I always admired movies from Hollywood and other movie industries more than Bollywood movies because I always admire good movies. I am watching movies from Hollywood and other movie industries since my childhood but much less than Bollywood movies but in last 2 3 years my love towards movies from Hollywood and other movie industries just skyrocketed and I now watch lots of movies from Hollywood and other movie industries and very few Bollywood movies.,
602,10 September 2004,Ashlevine,10, Wonderful,I watched this film three or four times. Every time I enjoyed the film more and more. The dynamics of the relationships is so great. I have rarely seen such chemistry between actors. The sexual intensity is brilliant. It gave the simplicity of the film an utter brilliance. I once heard a producer say: Keep it simple stupid. Well this could not be any simpler but fully clothed with power and brilliance. The actors managed to embody their characters so completely. The direction is seamless and the production values were just right. I highly recommend this film to everyone who is interested in learning great film-making. My hat off to all.,
603,5 April 2020,krational66,8, I protect you in my own way.,"I love you, so I don't kiss you. I love you so I speak coldly to you. I love you so I want you to leave me and live your own life. I love you so I choose to protect you silently. Protection is my way of loving you. This is Lyon'a love for Mathil. The love of fish for birds cannot be shelved. Only choose this way to love. Love is forgiving, love is hurt.
A killer should not be too kind, and should not care about a person. Lyon is not a good killer.
It is often wondering why Lyon had to carry that pot of green dill is no matter where he went, and why in the last crisis moment he still instructed Mathil to take care of Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!! Pot of plants. What's so strange about a pot of plants. Lulu is the best evidence that Lyon is not a good killer. Lulu represents the weak, the people who need protection and care, and the love that Lyon could not protect. In fact Lyon really wants to love someone, protect her, take care of her, pamper her. If the person does not show up, then he has to fill this void with a pot of green dill. Mathil was like a pot of vigorous green dill filling his broken heart. The revolving staircase, brown and black, reveals a simple and dignified atmosphere. Step by step up the stairs, spinning, spinning, lost with the rotation of the stairs, at the end of the rotation, a fairy-like girl is waiting quietly. Smoking cigarettes unruly and pretending to be mature. At first it was often inadvertent. Knowing that in your own identity, it's best not to provoke the evil police who are not as good as crazy dogs. However, in the fact of Mathil's pleading, his cold heart began to melt. The door opened and Lyon greeted Mathilda, giving her a safe haven and also giving her lonely heart a chance to redeem.
As a result, this elf-life mature and childish girl stubbornly stuck in Lyon's life and would never leave again. She stubbornly asked him to help his brother revenge, stubbornly asked him to teach her to "" clean up"" stubbornly asked him to love her, care about her, stubbornly transformed his life. Reason told Lyon that the killer must not have feelings. He must kill her.
However his heart had been shaken. His life is no longer just about killing people and that pot of green dill. He really loves her, he can break into the police station for her alone, and deal with Agent Hundred for her alone. He didn't forget to avenge Mathilda until he died, burying himself in a royal.
His love is so deep. A teenage elf-like girl, an indifferent man in his 30s or 40s; an angle who can hear the call of the Lord at any time, a bloody demon with hands in his hands... No matter what, it is an insurmountable gap. He can only hide this love that cannot be put aside in his heart. The surface kept refusing her. It was not until the last moment that she dared to say to her; "" Mathilda , I love you"" Only at this time, this sentence may become a ticket to send little Mathilda to return to the world, instead of biting her life. Fuse. In this world, is there such a person who can open a door or you a safe haven. Is there a person who can love you so deploy and forbesringly, protect you silently, endure your stubbornness, love you but refuse you.",

It has its own freshness and flavor to enjoy. The action in the movie, the villain, and relationship between the hit-man and the girl is more than cute. It shows many facets of Leon's character and all put put together well. It is a simple story but has been unwound by somebody who has a great taste.

The acting in this movie is flawless, in fact Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman deliver what I believe are the best performances of their careers.

620,3 May 2022,aksuenesefe,10, Masterpiece,Léon is a professional hitman and Mathilda is a little girl. We can see their relationship's grow up and fascinating dialogs between them. And also i think the final scene was very very emotional and epic.,
621,11 May 2008,mazer-rackham,1, Terrible,"Highly overrated. I didn't believe it for a second. In the opening scene, Leon peeks through a bullet hole in a door into a dark room with light behind him, and in doing so shows the gunman on the other side exactly where he is. Another time, when a hit goes bad in an apartment building, Leon only steps over from the door a foot or two as the man inside seeks to spray the entire wall with machine gun fire. Leon's character is completely unbelievable, he is never shown to have any degree of intelligence, not by the storyline or the acting, yet the other characters strongly push this notion. When I think of a character who is intelligent and good at killing, I think of Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. Leon is abysmal in comparison. Not only does the linear plot have no shred of plausibility, it is also made up of predictable scenes and dialog, which only infuriate the viewer as they drone on. Every scene feels forced, so unrealistic you can almost feel the presence of the film crew in the room, complete with the director frantically trying to think what should happen next. The unwarranted dramatic music is clearly a futile attempt to cover the bad acting. Nobody reacts to anything properly. The villains are cartoon-like at best. The only thing shocking is the amount of cursing in a story which was so clearly written for a children's TV show. The first few pages of comments almost had me convinced I was crazy, until I found the realistic ones buried at the bottom.",

But i went to the cinema the premiere's day without expectations, just because this day were no many options and because of Gary Oldman, and leave the teather shocked. Was it just me who was fascinated. Time gave its truth. Almost 30 years passed and still one of the 50 best films ever.",
623,24 October 2003,chvylvr80,10, A true Professional,"Leon must be the greatest movie about a hitman. Luc Besson perfectly tells the story of Leon, a lonely man that only has his work to keep him busy. This film is a lot more than just a gritty story about killing though.",

Sure the story is okay, but it doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. The part that I hated the most was at the beginning where they made leon some sort of teleportation machine and he appears everywhere. Totally unrealistic. And lastly, The cover of the tape is so BORING! Don't see it. It's a waist of time. You'll never get that 2 hours back. Yep, It's just that bad!",

Let me tell you that I have never seen a film that blended all the elements of cinema so well. The act, score, storyline, and drama are all wonderfully crafted in this film. Luc Besson gave a gift to the world of cinema with this film. It is his best film in my opinion and I do enjoy his other films. I would like to state that I would rank this film with The Empire Strikes Back, King Kong, Desperado, Frankenstien, all of those I would give a perfect 10 too. I love this film so much, I own three different editions of this film on DVD. The Professional (US version) Leon, The Professional extended version and most recently the Deluxe Edition, which by far is the best. Not only does it have the best quality film and sound there is, it's also has special features including interview with Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. My only complaint is that Luc Besson himself is not interview or shown on the DVD. Another thing that bugs me is the fact that Natlie Portman said she would do a sequel, what is Luc not listening? Please I beg you make a the sequel! It's not just a great hit-man movie, it is so much more. I truly love this movie, but some will not like it's subject matter.

This is by far Luc Besson's best film, I don't know what the hell he is thinking now, he just seem to write stupid action crap.  Anyway, Gary Oldman is in top form (when is he not) as the corrupt cop, and Jean Reno is very likeable for a hitman.  The story is wonderful and the characters are well developed.  Don't be fooled while this movie does have some awesome action scenes, IT IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE!! This is more of a drama with action thrown in because of who the characters are.  10/10",

The international version of this movie has all sorts of scenes in it which made me a little uncomfortable and I found myself, at times, wanting to turn my head or cover my ears.  This is coming from someone who can watch one horror movie after another and not be the least bit disturbed.  In addition to the awkwardness I felt, I also found myself checking my watch.  It's almost like sitting down and eating your favorite meal and over eating.  You walk away feeling less satisfied than you would have with a smaller portion.

I could understand y some would b uncomfortable bc of some of the ""sexual tension"" between Leon and Mathilda (her character did say they were lovers but she was messing with the hotel desk attendant) but I never saw it that way. So in my mind it's slightly head scratching that Portman later said she felt sexualized... Anyways this is a great action packed watch.

Natalie Portman, like Rachel McAdams in The Notebook, was perfectly cast as Mathilda. I believe any other young actress could not have conveyed the extraordinary performance which was required of such a young leading role. I hate to say, but most films can't even come close to Stanislavsky truth like Jean Reno and Portman beautifully delivered in Leon The Professional. The Music is also wonderfully placed as well as it is playful. Gary Oldman portrays the perfect antagonist-pretty much you hate him and want him for dead making his acting right on target, so no complaints there. So all in all I absolutely love Leon The Professional. It is definitely not for those who despise films that have some valid emotional complexities in it. For those with drone-like minds go watch Battlefield Earth or Cyborg or something-",

However it is immensely satisfying and has three outstanding performances. Portman's career in my opinion has yet to produce a role so intriguing, Oldman comes across as chillingly both insane and rational, and Jean Reno plays his role spectacularly, capturing both the human and inhuman sides to the character. Although at times I needed to pause and digest it, it was undoubtedly a superb movie. Gritty and unafraid to make bold artistic choices.",

What you get is the added relationship scenes that are obviously cut out in the Professional.  You can see the interaction between the two main characters and it adds a greater warmth to the film. The edited version of the Stateside release shows us our squeamish we are when it comes to such male/man female/child relationships.

However, I don't think it lived up to the hype. While it's not a bad movie, it's not as great as people make it out to be. The movie features Jean Reno playing the role of a highly skilled and efficient assassin. But the plot takes a strange turn when he forms a bond with a young girl and becomes her foster father. It's hard to believe that a ruthless killer would suddenly take on a nurturing role, and even more difficult to believe that he would train her to become a killer as well.",

It has its ups and downs and I am not sure if it deserves all the praise that has been going around, but it is still a consistent good movie. It poses an interesting story and a different take at an action movie, in a decade when bad, over the top action movies were the thing. The performances are overall good, especially Jean Reno, as the ruthless assassin fatherly loving figure, and Natalie Portman, the character that we sometimes forget is a child. Gary Oldman gives all his heart, but his performance can only be as good as the one-dimensional villain he is portraying.
The story is, on one hand, well designed and different, specially the constant efforts of Léon to adapt to his new role of caretaker. Mathilda's constant uncomfortable approaches make it even better and are the clear result of a way too brief and dysfunctional childhood. On the other hand, it still falls sometimes into the predictability of the typical 'redemption arc' formula.
Overall a refreshing approach to the genre, with smart use of action and an engaging plot.",

Well, there was a lot more to it than that. First of all, Natalie Portman was incredible in it, as she played Mathilda, a twelve-year old girl forced into a life of crime from a young age. She was a character you could laugh, cry and sympathise with. Jean Reno played Léon, the caring father/hit-man who takes in Mathilda after her family is brutally murdered, and you can feel the bond of the two dysfunctional characters as Mathilda learns the trade of ""cleaner"" and Léon learns to love again.

Its one of the best hitman movies ever made and definitely up there with the top action thrillers of the 90's. I won't spend too much time getting into the smaller details of what makes this a classic. Where would I start anyway? Natalie Portman is excellent in this as a kid and that isn't something that typically happens. Jean Reno is at the top of his game and this will arguably be the best movie he has ever done. Gary Oldman portrays arguably the best villain of his career. He is great as a villain, but this one sticks out more than the rest. The script is excellent and it allows you to get invested in the characters and empathize with their situations. This movie will definitely challenge you on a moral level as well. I can't really tell you too much that the synopsis doesn't already tell you about the plot, but I will say this has one of the best action sequences I have ever seen at the end of the movie.

Irregular, distorted and distorted urban composition can be seen everywhere, with the overall tone biased towards dark colors. Cities, tall buildings, these are the result of human development, but with them, in addition to advanced science and technology, but also breeding, spreading crime. The irony is that the police department, traditionally a symbol of justice and order, has become a source of evil and violence. The police station is also one of the tall buildings, the authority of the whole society, but has become one of the main positions of the evil world.

We don't see the door open, but we see the relief on Mathilda's face as it is bathed in the light from the opened door. So Mathilda's life was spared once because of her own act of kindness, and then again, because of Leon's act of kindness.

This unorthodox relationship creates an abundance of emotionally intense scenes throughout the film, notably the excellent finale. Reno is expertly cast as hollow, emotionally stricken hitman Leon, whilst Portman succeeds as vengeful youth Mathilda. However, Oldman delivers the most enthralling performance as sadistic, relentless DEA agent Stansfield. Leon is also propelled by wonderful cinematography and music decisions.",

741,19 October 1998,Die Hard-3,7, A witty film,"A great and witty film about how a hitman really might be.  A hitman really would kill without emotion, just doing his job.  Great plot combined with great acting, with some brutal, but not too bad, violence.  The ending is not disappointing, and I thought that the film was very good.  Jean Reno's acting performance is fine, as is the girl who played Mathilda, and Gary Oldman is OK.  The beginning of the film is great, where he turns up at a house, and moves without sound, and kills without remorse.  A good film experience that I recommend.",
742,1 November 2007,fable104,8, Good film but not great...,"The Professional was a good movie and deserves to be on the IMDb 250, though it should be much lower in the ranking. Jean Reno makes most modern day action heroes look like wusses as he takes bullets out of his arm in the shower and sows his wounds up. And there is something endearing about the simple life he leads with his plant and milk. Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello played great character roles with Oldman as a pill-popping corrupt cop with random bursts of violence. But Natalie Portman annoyed the hell out of me in this film. I don't think someone was doing their job well if I ended up wanting her to get killed more than Gary Oldman. I know she was supposed to be annoying but I found the scene with her laughing at Leon as she gobbled down the wine he had bought for her as ugly. Also found the villains besides Gary Oldman as a bit too dimensional. They all look and act alike, no real personalities.",
743,17 January 2022,kamsitheprince,10, This movie is so amazing and beautiful,"I love this movie, it's so gripping with absolutely no filler, it's campy and the writing was good, the casting of Natalie is untouched, same with Leon and Gary Oldman, the score was so beautiful and this movie in general. The chemistry between Natalie and Jean was some of the best chemistry I've seen in a movie, all their scenes together were so heartwarming, slick and fun to watch. This movie is criminally underrated and I can't wait to watch this masterpiece again in the future.",

Instead it's a creepy weird boring film about a hitman and a twelve year old Girl who's constantly sexualized throughout the film it's not even hidden it's straight up in your face what they're implying in some scenes not to mention the film overrall is just boring even these action scenes people praise are some of the most mind numbing boring piece of fiction imaginable. Absolutely nothing interesting or new or enjoyable about this film whoever Genuinely Enjoys this film needs to be put on a list.,

How did the story of Leon saying ""no women no children"" get back to the D.E.A., after Leon killed everyone their? And then Leon just marches into the D.E.A. offices in New York kills 2 guys and leaves, no problem? Then, how did the D.E.A. guy even find Leon and the Girl in the final scene? Also how did the D.E.A. guy even recognize Leon? I could go on with annoyances. Who can watch this movie and miss how poor the story ties together.",

751,25 August 2001,Alectreveiyan006,7, A fluke,"Very good, acting a movie for romance and action lovers combined. Not the greatest plot line but an outstanding performance by gary oldmen. This film is apparantly correlated to the 1990 film ""miller's crossing"" a drama/gangster/romance film that adds a little noir to finish the movie. I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you enjoy this genre. If not this movie is a simple civil crowd pleasure for some people. If you want romance combined with action/gangster I would advise you to see the above movie (Miller's crossing) or some arbitrary movie involving Gun's and Romance. To my knowledge that can not be done with exceptions of notable movie's you've probobly seen or heard of.

I was emotionally touched by the actors performances. Gary Oldman, Jean Reno, even Natalie Portman. All of them made me cry. Jean Reno as Leon is the perfect role for him.

765,2 June 2003,aeriz,10," The best, but with some apprehensions...","A masterpiece in filmmaking.  combination of action and drama with obvious intelligence placed into the narrative.  Jean Reno's acting displayed his key to success by being dramatic yet maintaining a sense of masculinity expected by society for a narratives masculine characters.  Gary Oldman is psychotic, a great antagonist who shows that he thinks before he acts. Natalie Portman is wonderful, showing off the talent, potential, and intelligence that she embodies.  Leon's greatest element is the reversal used in the narrative making the hitman an hero and the cops the enemies. the only real problem I have doesn't come from the film, but from what happens to the actors afterward.  Jeno Reno ending up in parts like Rollerball and Natalie Portman acting in star wars.  Not that I have a problem with star wars, yet her acting abilities are seriously restrained for that part.  Leon does have major potential for a sequel which I hear may be in the works but at the same time I can see where it could ruin the narrative if not handled correctly.  Personally, the roots metaphor should be carried over and Mathilda should kill with a knife at the end due to that was proclaimed as the last lesson she would learn to be a real professional. See this film and watch the international version also if you get a chance. Both create a different feel toward the ending.",
766,25 August 2000,sunhee_yongdae_lee,10, The Best Action/Drama,"Even though this movie came out in 1994 and was a smash hit in Korea and in Japan, I didn't have any idea about this movie until I saw it on video in 1999.  After the first time I saw it, I saw it over and over, maybe 10 times, until I had to return it to the video store. Now it has become my all time favourite movie. This movie has everything that a great movie should have; a good script, a good directing, a good cinematography, good actors, good soundtrack and good edit.  Actors were so mature that every character existed.  Especially I couldn't believe that it was Natalie Portman's debut film. The cinematography was somewhat similar to the European art movies, which I love, and Eric Serra's melancholic music made this movie even more emotional.  The best thing, however, about this movie is the story.  The innocent love between Leon and Mathilda was very fairy tale like but still very beliavable and moving. Luc Besson had created the most expert killer in film history, after this movie came out killers in other movies are always compared with Leon, with humanity, which is very original. Luc Besson is not the greatest movie director alive.  ""The Last Battle"", ""The Big Blue"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" were good but ""Subway"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Taxi"" and ""Joan of Arc"" were disappointing.  But still, Luc Besson is a wonderful writer/ director because of Leon.  Leon the director's cut has come out recently.  However I strongly recommend movie lovers to see the regular one first",

It 's like a flower filled with flowers On the way, suddenly walked by a person and let a loud fart, although not stinking, it is also awful. If the director can give a design that only hears its sound, not the scene. Rather than this kind of sensationalism, the act of adding extravagance. This will make the movie more perfect.",
