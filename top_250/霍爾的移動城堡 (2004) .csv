0,20 March 2005,surenm,10, A wild and surreal trip into the mind of a master.,"I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.",/
1,6 June 2005,soanim8ed,10, This is art,Howl's Moving Castle is as marvelous and magical as Miyazaki's other great work. Something in Disney's advertising or the description I read gave the false impression that it was going to be sub-standard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything DreamWorks Animation was doing (Madagascar was sooo pedestrian).,r
2,5 February 2006,kengoogloo,10, Try to decode the story ...,"Probably many people find the story confusing. I felt the same way when I saw it in the theater for the first time! The story seemed arbitrary and I couldn't connect the pieces together (much like I saw ""Ashes of Time"" for the first time). But when I watch it again on the DVD, I realize the movie is probably about one thing: personal freedom.",e

4,11 June 2007,planktonrules,8, Great provided you are not a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan or watch the film with one!,"I went to see this film with my anime and Diana Wynne Jones-loving teenage daughter. And while I enjoyed the film immensely due to its excellent animation, story and overall sense of fun, it was also interesting to see how much my daughter hated it! It was as if we saw two entirely different films. Why? Well, she is a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan and has read and re-read just about everything she ever wrote. And, according to her, the story was so different and so inferior to the book that she disliked the film and said some very nasty things about director Miyazaki. However, my advice is DON'T read the book and just go and see the movie. Then, after enjoying it, read the book ONLY if you are 100% sure you can do this without freaking out because they are so different!! I didn't know the difference and had a great time seeing the film!",i
5,10 July 2005,cornishogre-1,10, For those who love the book  or wondered about it,"When I read some four years ago that Diana Wynne Jones had sold the rights for Howl's Moving Castle to a Japanese animator, I wondered. The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.",e
6,23 February 2005,WritelySo,10, My favourite Miyazaki!,"What an amazing achievement! This is by far the best example I have ever seen of animated characterization. The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki's work, but in Howl's Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.",w
7,31 October 2016,SnoopyStyle,7, interesting world,"Sophie is a young shy hat maker working for her mother in an alternate-world turn-of-the-century European town. A wizard named Howl rescues her from a couple of lascivious soldiers only to be chased by a horde of waste demons. They escape to her sister Lettie's place. She is later visited by the Witch of the Waste and turned into an old woman. She runs away and encounters scarecrow Turnip-Head. After helping it, it leads her to Howl's Moving Castle. There she encounters the fire demon Calcifer who Howl uses to power the castle. Calcifer offers to break her curse if she could end his servitude. Sophie pretends to be new cleaning lady Grandma Sophie. The Mayor arrives at the Great Wizard Jenkins with a request from the King to fight in the war. Howl's apprentice Markl is able to switch between various exits and with various disguises. Then the other king invites Great Wizard Pendragon to join in the war. Howl is known as both wizards and unwilling to help either side. Madame Suliman threatens to take away his powers before he is lost after losing his heart.",/
8,25 June 2020,jessup-86446,6, ...huh?,"Maybe the only way to enjoy this movie is to think of it more as a visual symphony than a cohesive narrative? Like fantasia or something?
I had soooo many questions I needed answers for, and while I got some of them from the ending, for the most part I'm just left scratching my head and wondering what the heck I just watched.
Seriously, not even plot holes, just missing pieces of plot; so much information is never given and its absence is felt.
Is the war somehow Howl's fault? Where the heck did Sophie's mom come from?
Who was the witch? Who was the other witch? Is Sophie a witch? Why did the first witch curse Sophie? Why was the second witch so mad? Was she mad or am I projecting? On and on it goes.
Sigh.
6/10 Stars. All in all I think that it's a very pretty movie, with decent animation, but there are better Ghibli films for both animation and story.",r
9,23 September 2018,kbowes-23399,8, Beautiful,"A very cinematically beautiful film with characters you just fall in love with. I won't lie, the plot is very hard to follow. If you've read the book, you can tell that miyazaki focused less on following the plot, more on making the film beautiful to watch, and as a result we are left with a story that has huge chunks missing and frankly doesn't make a lot of sense in places. But I'm not mad, because it is very, very beautiful to watch.",w
10,3 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9, Howl's Moving Castle is an imaginative and delightful Miyazaki film,"I love anime, and when I noticed that Howl's Moving Castle was showing today, I knew I had to see it. And you know what, I wasn't disappointed. I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal. But overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enchanting and delightful work from Miyazaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox",3
11,4 September 2021,robertrutledge,6, Confusing as Hell,"I tried liking this movie. I don't get what all the hype is about. It is very hard to follow. Basically, this old witch turns this little girl who works at a hat shop into an old woman. The girl doesn't mind too much, because she's always been sort of an ""old soul"" anyways. She runs away from home because she doesn't want anyone seeing her as an old woman. She then runs into this random-ass scarecrow. Finally, she comes across the titular moving castle, although at this point in the story she has already had a run-in with the owner, Howl.",2

13,25 February 2021,auuwws,9, hauru no ugoku shiro,"The most beautiful anime film I have ever seen, Studio Ghibli proved to me that it is the undisputed best anime studio, the story of the film was very beautiful and the projections of the film were excellent, the characters of the film were beautifully written, especially the character of Hauru, it started narcissistic and ended completely differently, I liked the romantic relationship between Sophie and Hauru were awesome, and the film ending was so beautiful, I highly recommend watching it",2
14,17 June 2005,JohnDeSando,10, Original and Thoughtful,"Now I know why everyone was excited about Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar winning animation, because his new Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from a British novel by Diana Wynne Jones, is more original and thoughtful than any American entry in that genre. The visuals of flat, classic animation with slow-moving characters and painterly backgrounds are alone worth the experience, the castle itself an imaginative hodgepodge of chicken-legged monsters from Russian folklore and cumbersome war machines from Star Wars. As the director has said, ""I've told the people on my CGI staff not to be accurate, not to be true. We're making a mystery here, so make it mysterious.""",1

16,2 July 2005,jotix100,10, Hayao Miyazaki casts his spell on us,"The genius of Anime films, Hayao Miyazaki, shows why he is one of an absolute masters of the genre. Taking Diana Wynne Jones' story ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and creating the magnificent film for our delight, is something that no other man could have accomplished with as much flair and panache as Mr. Miyazaki has done.",9
17,3 May 2007,thinker1691,8," Fire, Magic and a boy's heart","From the Island of Japan comes this incredible story of an enchanted and magical castle. A young girl, named Sophi is bewitched and accidentally encapsulated into a traveling fortress. Unaware her brief meeting with a handsome and powerful wizard prince, will enrage the Witch of the Waste, Sophie is thus drawn into the struggle to find a lasting peace to a ongoing war. The story is interesting to be sure, but the animation and picturesque scenery add more than enough action and drama to offset traditional venues. Within the film are the talented voices of Jean Simmons and Emily Mortimer as the voice of Sophie, Christian Bale as Howl, the Bird Prince, Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman, the Sourceress. Josh Hutcherson as Markl and of course Billy Crystal is terrific as Calcifer, the Fire Demon. This fine cast adds resilience to the inspirational tale as does the colorful and touching film. To anyone who enjoys children's stories which endure the test of time and mesmerize modern audiences, this is one for the complete library. A classic in the making. ****",/
18,30 December 2006,Quinoa1984,9, loaded with enough imagination and sweet vibes for three movies!,"I can't say for certain, especially after only seeing the English-language dub of the film in the theater (and seeing bits of it again on TV)- that Howl's Moving Castle is one of the very best of the great Hayao Miyazaki's feature films. But I didn't leave it feeling un-happy in the slightest, and if anything I remember most the feeling of uplift, which is what the best fairy tales try to accomplish. It follows the strand left by Spirited Away (though also trailing off from other Miyazaki films to be sure) where a female character is the protagonist thrust into strange circumstances, really around a curse.",?

22,9 May 2013,ironhorse_iv,8, Howl if you like Howl's Moving Castle!! WOOOOO!!!,"I like the movie, but the film is way too different than the book to the point that it was a bit annoying. They change too many things. The story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. It's like taking 1939's Wizard of Oz and turning it into turning it into Sci-Fi's Tin Man (2007). It's a re-imagining of Dianne Wynne Jones's classic novel. Don't get me wrong, I love Hayao Miyazaki's vision of the book, Howl's Moving castle; I just wish it would had stay more true to Diana Wynne Jones's novel. This movie marks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work since Kiki's Delivery Service (1989). It is a really fascinating work with lively characters and incredible imagination through out the film. Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Chieko Baisho), a 19-year-old hat maker who is taking away by the charm of a Wizard name Howl (Takuya Kimura/ Christian Bale) when she was rescue by him when she was trying to visit her sister. For punishment for trying to steal her favorite's wizard's heart, The Witch of the Waste (Akihiro Miwa/ Lauren Bacall) transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her old, Sophie (Jean Simmons) must searches for a way to break the Witch's spell. On the way, she makes some new friends: Markl (Ryunosuke Kamiki/Josh Hutcherson), Howl's young apprentice, a scarecrow nickname Turliphead, and last Calcifer (Tatsuya Gashun/ Billy Crystal). The visuals in the movie are amazing. It's a steam punk fan's favorite, the way, Miyazaki use CG to creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment, but held together by the burning heart of magic is interesting. The film is overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and interesting details of everything around. There is also the major themes that Miyazaki's works been known for such as such as environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, and the absence of villains. Miyazaki's Howl has a very strong female protagonist that go against gender roles common in Japanese animation and fiction. Both old and young Sophie were very interesting. I love Jean Simmon's voice as old Sophie. She gives some charm and funny moments. I love the stairs scene. I was laughing my head off. The dubbing by English actors match pretty damn good. Good job, Pixar. I love the English dub more than the Japanese since it's based on a English novel. The Japanese just looks a bit odd with the European themes in this film. The plot in the film is secondary, as it's nearly makes no sense and full of plot-holes. Things are mention at the last moment or not fully disclosure toward the end. There is nothing about Wales, no reference, no mention, no allusion to the place where the novel came from. The fate of a lost prince sub-plot comes nowhere in left field toward the end. Miyazaki turned the the story into a protest against the war in Iraq. I have nothing against anti-war propaganda, believe me, but let's call it what it is, and not try to trick people into pulling out cash from their pockets for what they assume is a film version of one of their favorite books. The story is utterly unrecognizable from the original. Several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. Sophie doesn't have her sorceress powers that allow her to turn things into living objects. While the Witch of the Waste is the villain in the book; the movie instead made her, into a weak, harmless woman. Then it made the male Suliman (Haruko Kato/ Blythe Danner) a alley in the novel into a female enemy in the film. Still, there are some changes I do like. I like Howl portrayed as a deep troubled hero rather than the arrogant self-centered wizard he is in the book. Still there is a bit of that self-centered narcissism attitude in him in the film. Reminds me a lot of the story Beauty and the Beast. I like how Calcifer is a cute cheeky little orange flame instead of an evil menacing fire demon. Overall: You have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him. If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear.",_
23,26 September 2022,christiam-51976,6, Great animation and color but lacked good story.,I really loved the colors and the animation. I could tell that they've spent so much time and effort to show all of these effects on the spells and on the world building. The characters also were pretty unique and were pretty well made. Although i really did not like the plot because hardly anything was explained thoroughly and we got left with filling in the pieces. I feel like the story was all over the place and some things did not really much sense. There were some pretty funny moments and some great music but it was boring and slow towards the second part of the movie. I believe if they made the movie a bit shorter and we learned more about each character it wouldve been at least a 7 or 8.,=

29,27 June 2005,JTurner82,10, A somewhat lesser yet imaginative fairy tale from Hayao Miyazaki.,"With HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, Hayao Miyazaki takes a popular British children's book by Dianne Wyanna Jones and transforms it into yet another breathtakingly gorgeous and sumptuously animated work of art. Indeed, from the opening shot where we see the title structure--a bizarre amalgam of iron, steam, and unexpected surprises--loom ominously out of the mist, audiences will find themselves on a roller coaster of visual delight and imagination.",v
30,12 April 2020,aamy-83183,4, Just a pretty face,"This movie falls short in what should be the main reason to make a movie: it has no coherent story whatsoever. There's zero character development and they start to care for each other for no reason.
They adapted the original story to be a critique on war, but they failed even on that. Howl fights against a few warships and then what? That's a superficial strategy to fight war, just as superficial as the whole movie. In the end, the war is over as if it where a mere whim of the king's magician!
The only parts of the movie that actually get to your heart are the ones that they got from the book. Such a waste of plots.
The aesthetic is beautiful, but they should put more effort on the character's facial expressions and the script, because a pretty movie with no plot is just a waste of time and money.",

33,23 July 2005,mary-262,10, Wow,Note: Possible Spoilers ,
34,28 September 2005,pwteatros,2, Form more important than function? Spoiler,"In this movie, form is more important that function. We go from one pointless subplot to the other just so that we can see these wonderful and enchanting images of worlds we have never seen. The movie never comes together because the creators (director, etc) are too busy making sure they create beautiful images and scenarios. I don't see it as a poetic anti war movie. The book may do that, but this movie is not about anything. In the UK version it is not clear why Howl gives his heart to calcifer. It is not clear why Howl, knowing all his problems would be solved by putting his heart back in, doesn't do it --hey, the heart was always there! It is not clear why the witch of the waste wanted Howl's heart. And it is not clear why the Sophie's mother all of the sudden appears in the movie in the place where she used to live. What happened to the hat shop that it was empty for them to move back in. Pointless. I hate it when artists think form is more important than communicating with audiences.",
35,18 January 2005,WizardX,7, Somewhat disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Miyazaki's work, and having seen everything else he's done, I had to see Howl as soon as I could locate a subtitled version. Unfortunately, I must rank it among his weaker efforts. It's certainly not a BAD film - I don't think the man is capable of that - but after the brilliance of Mononoke, and Spirited Away, I was disappointed.",

Even though the enbglish voice cast did a decent job, I did prefer the japanese verion of the film. I felt that the acting was far better thatn the english.

Howl's is a long wait for me since the Spirit Away. After I seen this movie, it is still very enjoyable to me but there is something in my mind still questioning. Miyazaki want to tell us a love story, that we are sure but may be there is some more. After i read a local film review, the question is entirely clear now I seen this movie into another perspective.",
40,26 July 2019,AhmedSpielberg99,7, Look for what's underneath!,"This is the only Miyazaki film I've seen so far that's what's on its surface is way, way less impressive than what's underneath it. Neither its fantastical story, its visual splendor, nor its understated yet funny humour hold a candle to its subtext. Howl's Moving Castle's weight lies on What's beyond its story. It's actually a meditation on age and love. Miyazaki allows you here to see the world through the eyes of an adult who longs to be young again while conveying a plethora of lessons by his visual storytelling, which is here at its finest regarding practicality, but this is not the case regarding creativity.",
41,27 May 2022,and_mikkelsen,9, The master has done it again!,"The highlight of this movie is deffinetely the visuals! This is pretty close to be the BEST looking Ghibli movie!

I will admit to being biased, since this *is* my favorite movie of any (animated or not), but honestly, whether you're 7 or 70, this movie is a guaranteed delight. Every time I see this movie, I'm immediately overwhelmed by feelings of wonder, delight, creativity, and hope, and I must say I've definitely seen this movie over 60 times. It doesn't get old, and it's one of those movies where every time you see it, you see something new in the background you'd never noticed before.",
44,24 December 2011,jennyhor2004,3, Cynical and manipulative cut-and-paste job of other Miyazaki films with conservative message for girls,"Up to and including ""Spirited Away"", the animated films by Studio Ghibli are of a high standard both technically and in spirit. With ""Howl's Moving Castle"", the soulful quality of the earlier films that peaked with ""Princess Mononoke"" disappears and what we get is an empty shell of a story that exploits typical Studio Ghibli motifs and themes and the studio's technical virtuosity. All the familiar devices of earlier films – a young female protagonist on the verge of adulthood, elderly women, a flawed hero with shamanic characteristics, heroes and villains manipulated by more powerful characters of uncertain quality, sophisticated flying technology in an alternative 19th-century steampunk world – are worked over in a fantasy aimed (cynically it seems to me) at a mainstream Western audience and the result looks very cheesy and manipulative with an ulterior message that superficially celebrates female bravery but channels it into socially restrictive roles.",
45,14 November 2005,bsinc,9, Beautifully rich with imagination,"I was never a big fan of anime cartoons, to me they seemed very two-sided. On one side you have incredibly fluent and perfectly drawn mind-boggling details, which are mainly used in action scenes, and on the other side you have those crude repetitive monotonous moments of people walking, opening their mouths or just chunks of hair dangling in the wind's breeze where it almost feels as if the animation department is rushing and simplifying their job. ""Hauru No Ugoku Shiro"" starts exactly like the latter and I jumped to a conclusion way too soon. Because what I was about to see was nothing less than magic. I forgot the last time a movie captivated me so strongly, the last time I truly felt that kid I once used to be-this movie delivered big -time. Such creativity and pure fantasy extravaganza is almost unheard of today, yet Hayao Miyazaki lets us indulge in it with such ease and simplistic honesty it feels as if he's the only person in the world with imagination worth mentioning. And his definitely is! A colorful palette of characters and a beautiful story are the key element why this movie is worth seeing. ",
46,14 September 2004,chiarasf,9, A poetic anti-war cartoon.,"In a time of war and falsity here it is a dancing poetry from Japan against all the cruelty and pain. The moving castle leads us to a magic place where life has a strong value and elderly people have an important role to play. Also in an apparent hostility or in a scarecrow, Hayao Miyazaki gives us the chance of finding a friend and not letting the dream go down. The perfect technique and the emotional stream are in complete harmony. If the jury of the Venice Film Festival had been more far-seeing, it would have given a more prestigious prize to this masterpiece.",
47,15 July 2007,Thunderbuck,9," A marvelous, charming world","Miyazaki builds these wonderful little universes. Poetic, charming places that are at once familiar and exotic. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely bit of film that provides a great little escape.",

49,2 December 2004,dballred,8, Enjoyable but Unimaginative,"First of all, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this film and intend to see it several more times. On a technical level, Miyazaki has elevated the traditional 2-D animated film above the cheesier but more realistic 3-D Computer-generated works that seem to prevail everywhere else. Whether he used computers to simulate the 2-D look is beyond my current knowledge, but I applaud his attempt to abandon the technique that even crept into his previous work, _Spirited Away_.",
50,8 March 2006,kevin86,10, A profound and exhilarating Miyazaki creation!,"Howl's Moving Castle is phenomenal. Presenting itself initially in an odd way, our protagonist Sophie seems somewhat dry and dull. But this lasts only a few moments until a series of fantastical characters pour into her world. Each of these characters, whether it be Calcifer, Markl, Turniphead, the Witch of the Waste (during the last half) or the quiet dog are immediately likable from the get go. You genuinely care about them and their constant references to one another as a family only make the group seem all the more close. It's not very often I'm immediately pulled in by a group of characters but the colorful cast of Howl's Moving Castle are quick to bore a place in memory.",

Yes, it is very visual at times. At other times not so impressive. For example the fire in the castle could have been drawn by a talented fourth grader. But the real elephant in room everyone seems to be overlooking is this film has a very confused, hard to follow plot. In fact the director, Hayao Miyazaki, has as much said he agrees. So why do people sit through a film they really can't make heads or tails of and sing it's praise? Well, probably because you're supposed to. Slapp on the artsy title of animie and Miyazaki's name and you have critics falling over themselves to sing it's praise. I suspect the average movie goer will not be happy with Howl's Moving Castle. When you pay almost $10.00 per ticket you don't really care about credentials, you want to be entertained. And watching visuals just goes so far before you know you've been snookered. Instead, rent ""The Triplets of Belleville"" if you want to see creative animation at it's best.",

56,30 August 2011,jboothmillard,4, Howl's Moving Castle,"From Studio Ghibli and director Hayao Miyazaki (Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away), I had seen the DVD cover for this Japanese cartoon film a number of times, and being a fan of the previous films the studio made I had to see it. Basically young Sophie (Emily Mortimer) is the innocent girl who works in her late father's hat shop, and after a chance encounter with the magician Howl (Christian Bale), famous for his moving castle, she is cursed by the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall). The witch turn Sophie into an elderly woman, to become Grandma Sophie (Jean Simmons), and trapped in this body she tries to find a way to reverse it, but more than that to seek her fortune inside the Moving Castle. There she meets and befriends Calcifer (Billy Crystal) the fire demon, he powers the castle and recognises that she is cursed and helps however he can to help her get by. But he also makes a deal with her, if she breaks the contract she is under with Howl, whatever that is, then he has the power to lift her curse and she will go back to her eighteen year old self. I will be honest, this is pretty much the only story I can understand, the rest of it is really complicated, and just see the characters muddling about, helping each other in whatever is going on, and Sophie goes backwards and forwards sometimes with her age state. Also starring Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman, Josh Hutcherson as Markl, Jena Malone as Lettie, Crispin Freeman as Prince Turnip, Mark Silverman as King, Mari Devon as Honey and Liliana Mumy as Madge. I can certainly agree with the critics that the makers seem to have concentrated more on the spectacle than creating a story that you can follow and not get confused with, which is exactly what I found it does, but of course the animation is fantastically imaginative, overall it is not a terrible animated fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Okay!",
57,29 March 2006,james_corck3,10, Requiem for a child's dream,"If we go back to Spirited away, and more backwards to Mononoke Hime, we discover that Miyazaki has done with Howl's moving castle like a testament of his artwork. It has all the elements that made him what he is right now. The young hero (Sophie in this case) fighting against events that are over it's understatement, the cursed prince, the war feeling, the evil witches, the bizarre monsters, the charming characters... Is like a crossover of all his movies, like a gallery of paintings where you walk and you see each frame of his devious imagination. With the aid of Joe Hisaishi mesmerizing score, Miyazaki takes us to another ocean of original ideas, without being completely original (well, not every animation movie has a moving castle, and such a twisted plot of spells, curses, war and conspiracy). In a year full of Tripods, remakes, polemic movies and some flaws in the box office, Howl's moving castle is a relief. As they said in a Spanish comic book: I think like go to heaven is like enter in a Miyazaki movie. With Howl's moving castle that's a reality.",

As usual the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive - but what really holds the film together, for me, are the amiable anthropomorphic characters (Turnip the Scarecrow, Calcifer the Fire Demon and Heen the Dog) rather than the 'human' leads, the villains, or even the elements of fantasy so prevalent in this particular film-maker's admittedly unique brand of art.",

I recommend Spirited Away if you personally enjoyed this one because you're sure to enjoy Spirited Away as well.

Hoping to reverse the curse, Sophie searches out Lord Howl (Christian Bale*), a youthful but powerful sorcerer who lives in the titular castle with his assistant (Josh Hutcherson*) and Calcifer, a captured fire-demon (Billy Crystal*) who maintains the strangely anthropomorphic ambulatory fortress. The imagery, a blend of high-fantasy and steam-punk, is striking and imaginative and, the characters are nicely done (with A-list voice talent), and like most Studio Ghibli films, the backgrounds are detailed and the palatte lush. While the film is clearly a paean to pacifism (as director Hayao Miyazaki intended), the message does not overwhelm the film, which is amusing and entertaining. As others have noted, Howl, ostensibly the hero of the story, is somewhat morally ambiguous but Sophie (both young and old) is resourceful, resilient (she is very philosophical about having her youth and beauty stolen) and compassionate (as she cares for the witch, who has had her power stripped away).

However I've noticed studio Ghibli movies excel is creativity and extraordinary imagination but struggle with plot writing in some cases, when they actually try to add moving parts and complications it seems to fall apart a bit and plot holes start to emerge. Except in Spirited away, they did a flawless job at intertwining their astonishing imagination and animation with great plot, character development and writing. Issues I noticed: Sophia fell in love with Howl so quickly and it didn't really feel very plausible, obviously she loved the magic he brought into her world but because of him she turned into an old lady and never really makes any effort at fixing the curse. It was very vague what would fix Sophie's curse and its never really explained why she would appear younger every now and then. Why was she so forgiving to the witch of waste, she literally almost ruined her life and Sophie's response is to add her to the family and say she loves her? ok. Kissing the scarecrow to free him was pretty cliché not to mention how would the prince returning home suddenly stop the war?

A young girl becomes attached to the character after a spell from a witch makes her old and she goes into the castle. These and other characters are very likable and include a mute scarecrow, a talking fire that moves the castle and more. The animation is wonderful even though sometimes the story is hard to follow. It's also a romantic movie about the young character and Howl, although this doesn't really kick in til' near the end.

The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie.

114,9 October 2010,toqtaqiya2,8," Once again there is still room for meaning in the world of charming, animated fantasy.","Director Hayao Miyazaki took Diana Wynne Jones's novel as a basis for his follow-up to Oscar-winner Spirited Away (2001), but adds in his own overriding themes - man's relationship to nature, the futility of war, and the joy of flight. The natural world is beautifully represented as in his previous films, with some absolutely breathtaking mountain and lakeside landscapes. The finest creation of the film, though, is the Castle itself, a cross between Baba Yaga's hut, a Heath Robinson contraption, and one of Terry Gilliam's strange hybrid hens from Monty Python's Flying Circus. The film won a clutch of awards in Japan and overseas, including an Oscar nomination. Howl's Moving Castle is essentially a love story. Talk of magic being used to shield palaces while innocent villages are bombed clues viewers into the deliberate parallels being drawn with the Gulf War of 2003, a conflict that enraged the pacifist Miyazaki during the film's production. If there's one criticism, it's that the overly neat happy ending feels like a cheat after the previous seriousness of the war strand of the story. Yet it remains a complex, rewarding film graced with the acutely observed, colourful and imaginative artwork that is the hallmark of Japan's greatest living national treasure of animation.",

If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought this was done by Hayao's son - who's take on the Tales of Earthsea was also absolutely horrendous (see my review for that movie), in fact Howl's is just as bad.

The characters have no real motivation for their actions, other than that its what the script told them. The continuity is *terrible* (I don't mean Sophie morphing randomly between old and young, I understand that, I mean, how come howl can fly at the start and at the end he can only fly when some weird bird thing). It loses the whole part of howl being cursed by the witch, you never know WHY calcifer makes his deal with howl, WHY the scarecrow is following Sophie, and what IS it with all the huge war vehicles with massive guns? This isn't dominion tank police - but you'd be forgiven for thinking it was.

First, I would like to say that sound track of this movie was fantastic (His movie always has great sound-track). Second, I would like to say that I had a problem with voice. Sophie's voice was by C.Baisho. I think she's alright, when Sophie was old lady but when she was young girl her voice didn't meet the character (C.Baisho is I think in her late 50's or something like that). Over all, I enjoyed it very much. And I will watch few more times to understand his message. I didn't enjoy ""Sento-Chihiro no Kamikakushi"", but I think I liked this movie better in someways.

Before Howl his films were ALWAYS unique and new, when compared with the ones he had made before.

To break the curse, she seeks out Howl -a powerful wizard- and his mobile magical castle. Also dwelling there are the fire demon Calcifer (which also holds Howl's heart), and a young boy learning magic. As the story goes, Sophie and Howl fall in love with each other while trying to thwart the witch's curse on Sophie and somehow restore Howl's heart without destroying both him and Calcifer. This is a really touching love story and well worth watching how the supporting characters, magic, and vivid environment bring Howl and Sophie together.",

Easy to love characters, great storyline, extremely creative ideas, brilliant artwork and design...you name it, this movie has it. This movie will be inspiring anyone who watches it. Christian Bale and Billy Crystal fit the parts perfectly and it's great to watch a movie that doesn't have overly popular voice actors like ""John Goodman"" or ""Robin Williams"". This movie appeals to kids as well as adults. I took my 3 year old daughter to see it and she was completely drawn into it. This movie has an intelligent sense of humor that makes you honestly want to laugh, and not some shallow ""slapstick"" humor. There is plenty of action and drama to be found as well. You will have your emotions going all over the place while watching this. At first I was skeptical about the idea of a ""moving castle"" as the title implies, but once you watch it, things will make sense and you wouldn't want the plot to be any other way. The directing/writing of this movie makes Tim Burton look like an amateur. Go see it! And if you can't find a theater nearby...then sorry about your luck!

I prefer the movie which I think does a wonderful job in taking some of the original ideas of the book and creating a new and wonderful story even if it doesn't follow the book.

This is THE most amazing movie I have -ever- seen, I repeat, -EVER-, and not just in a range of Miyazaki and anime movies, though Howl's Moving Castle has given me whiplash when bypassing Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke by a mile long-shot. This is the story of a young hatter named Sophie (Zofi) who is the oldest of two (three in the book) daughters and believes the fairytale rule of the-first-is-always-the-worst. On her way to visiting her sister Lettie she bumps into two drunken soldiers who flirt shamelessly. She is saved by a handsome young man, who takes her on a ""stroll through the sky"" while escaping from ""ravenous globs of black goo"". When she returns home she meets an obese, ugly lady-later known to be the Witch of the Waste-who curses her into turning into a 90-year-old-woman. The next morning Sophie leaves her home, attempting to get as far from the town as possible. And she ends up in the house belonging to said handsome young man: Howl (Hauru). If I say any more, you would be spoiled. I have seen this movie 5 times in theatres and plan to buy the DVD, rumored to be coming out in November. If you don't see this movie and are yet an anime/manga/Miyazaki fan, it would be a loss that might cause the end of the world. At least in -my- opinion.",

It's themes are often light enough for children to enjoy but it does delve into some darker themes that will appeal to older viewers, and the entertainment factor is for all ages, it's a truly magical story with a great message, albeit with a rather overly mushy and sappy ending. Characters have always been a strong suit for the auteur, and while there are some similarities with these characters from other Miyazaki films, they still have their own personality and are never a clear copy of past characters, each bringing their own insight and humor to the story, they just follow a similar formula that strays away from being too familiar adding new set pieces (this one is action packed), twists and elements to make this a wholly original watch.",

163,16 March 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6, Endearingly strange.,"'Howl's Moving Castle (2004)' is certainly a strange film. It's an endearingly strange film, though. It's filled to the brim with interesting ideas, inventive visuals and inspired animation, which makes up for its somewhat scattershot central story and slightly strange pacing. The characters are all very well realised - and beautifully dubbed, I'll add - but the titular Howl is ever so slightly inconsistent (or, at least, presented inconsistently). Of course, his enigmatic nature is a part of his appeal, but he seems to lack a solid motivation - as do several of the other side-players - and the more we learn, the less it makes sense, in a way. Even our protagonist loses her drive part-way through, putting aside her quest simply to spend time as a housemaid. In her case, however, her character always shines through as she's constantly a wise, kindhearted person who's willing to forgive even those who have done her the most wrong. The narrative she finds herself caught up in isn't quite as strong-willed, but it's suitably tumultuous and charmingly off-beat. It keeps you engaged through its duration and is certainly unique, allowing Miyazaki and his team to play around with their intriguing designs and animation techniques. I especially enjoy the tar-like henchmen that pursue our heroes; their bulging bodies squeeze through small gaps, twist together as they struggle to stay upright and merge with one another to form huge, undulating masses. Overall, though it has some issues and doesn't hit home as hard as it perhaps should (in its more emotional moments), this is an entertaining affair throughout. It's a visual treat, too. 6/10",
164,2 March 2006,danielarreba,9, An amazing animated film,"Hauru no ugoku shiro is one of the most amazing animated films that I've seen in a long time. Alredy tired of Disney/Pixar paraphernalia, Hayao Miyazaki's film is fresh air in our mouth. And a sparkling scratch in our eyes. Definitely Miyazaki is a creator who has chosen animated films as the best way to express his ideas. Sophie is a young lady living a bored life in some place in Europe (not defined), at the beginning of XX century (not defined either). War times, and this is an important issue in the meaning of the film. Miyazaki is a pacifist and this movie can prove it. Howl, the young-beautiful man blessed (or punished, it all depends how you look at him)with magic powers, is a struggler who fights at nights breaking down anachronic war ships . Even more, he refused kingdom call which pretends he fights in the front. Sophie will be victim of the trick made by an evil witch (later we will find out that the same witch has been cheated)becoming in an 90 years old woman. Without hope, she'll rove until to find a fantastic roding castle with strange people living in it. The movie takes an oniric twist, in which logic is suspended, plot back and forth following undetermined parameters, as the castle does it.Hauru no ugoku shiro is a powerful visually film, which is not afraid to play with fantasy. It's a political film too.",

Yet I don't like how the movie keeps changing Sophie's age back and forth without any clear explanation.

The characters are awesome the mysterious nature of Howl works throughout the movie and Calcifer is super entertaining. The plot is complex but not at all difficult to follow. The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie.

It is like this movie have many layers and if you view this movie from different characters point of view, the story seems to offer something a bit different. (Sophie's point of view is the exactly the same as Howl, and if you watch the movie sympathizing to Sophie you will have a different perspective of the tale....it is not too easy to explain....but basically his characters have a life of its own and you can feel their emotions and reasons why they say or do things!) I think that is a magic of Miyazaki''s movie. He puts so much effort of developing the story line and it is not only one dimension, but all characters have their own.

Films, as many other artistic expressions, work in many levels and cannot (should not) be criticized because a certain criteria is not being followed. Of course, everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but: putting down a film because it doesn't spoon-feed you, the way 90% of US films do nowadays, and dropping it's rate so people might think it isn't a good film (and therefore not watching it) is just plain wrong. Howl's Moving castle is an excellent film. Period. Yes, it is a Japanese film(therefore a ""foreign"" film. LOL). Yes, certain aspects of it (very few really) speak only to the natives. Yes, some matters presented in the film require you to think about them once it is over. But only because the film industry is almost monopolized by US films doesn't mean that we should accept its manufacture as a standard. Let me tell you, I enjoy a good pop-corn movie every once in a while, I really do, but there is so much more going around than that. Please don't scrutinize an art form with such a narrow view.

Miyazaki has his name associated with some truly remarkable films (Laputa, Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, etc...) however he has also been involved in making some films which are little more than impenetrable clap-trap. Sadly Howl's Moving Castle falls into the second category (along with Nausicaa IMO). The plot is almost non-existent, and what little story remains is confusing and fragmented. The film suffers from the same problems as Nausicaa, in that an intriguing premise is established, but which never reaches a satisfying conclusion.",

201,27 June 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6, Fire in the Howl,"""Hauru no ugoku shiro"" or ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a Japanese animated movie from 2004, so this one will soon have its 20th anniversary or maybe it has happened already depending on when you come to read this review of mine. Of course, this is a Studio Ghibli production and the writer and director here is Hayao Miyazaki, the man who is probably the one everybody thinks of first when hearing about (slightly older) anime. However, he is not the only writer credited here. This film is based on a novel by Diana Wynne Jones, who is no longer with us anymore, but still lived when this film got made. Miyazaki is still alive, in his early 80s now and almost a decade younger than DWJ, which means that he was also already in his 60s when he directed this movie. It is anime from Japan, but Disney was also a bit of a factor as you can see if you take a closer look. By the new millennium, Disney had already come to terms with Ghibli's brilliance you could say and wanted in on it and if a big company like Disney wants in on something, there is pretty much no holding them back with all the money at their disposal. This is as true today as it was back then. The cast sounds interesting. I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, but I cannot really elaborate on the actors there because I am not familiar with the names, but I think they did a good job overall. I must mention the American cast though. I mean Christian Bale as Howl. Enough said. Add to that the likes of Lauren Bacall, Jean Simmons and also the very young Josh Hutcherson spanning through several eras of Hollywood film. Guess I can also mention Emily Mortimer, but I am a bit hesitant because she is not a good actress in almost everything she has been in over the years.",

No manners,"I haven't read the novel by Dianne Wynne Jones that this is loosely based on(but I understand that while this is not that direct of an adaptation, she is very happy with how it turned out). The young Sofie, a girl who doesn't feel attractive, becomes the victim of a spell that ages her. She then becomes the cleaning lady at the titular legged, moving castle of a powerful, selfish yet insecure young sorcerer Hauru, who she is infatuated with. We go with her on the ride to this amazing world of magic(in the universe this takes place in, it's almost commonplace) and quirky, strange and imaginative creatures, including a helpful living scarecrow, a charming, small and very old dog and the fire demon Calcifer(that eats egg shells and such to sustain himself). The focus is not on a ton of different creatures, settings or curses; the ones there are, are hypnotic, unforgettable and effective. This builds atmosphere and really gets to you, taking the time to draw you in, instead of the often scared-to-stand-still American norm(just because animation *can* move fast doesn't mean it always should). There is real personality to the locations, the beings and of course the characters. The sheer level of creativity and detail here is spellbinding. This has a great plot, if it is perhaps a tad vague at times and leaves you with unnecessary questions. I watched this with the original Japanese voices and subtitles, and I would definitely say that is the best way to go. The acting is spot-on. This has a marvelous score. While some of the humor is pretty silly, this is also genuinely funny at times. It can also be rather cute and sweet. This is 110 minutes sans credits. The art and designs are breathtaking, with little CGI. There is disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a 19 and a half minute featurette about how they animated the walking structure, a 7 and a half minute interview with the author of the book and a couple of TV spots and trailers. I recommend this to any fan of Animé. 10/10",

It has elements from virtually every movie Ghibli has done thus far, and fans will enjoy noting where they've seen certain themes and characters before. But it has certain qualities all its own.

Howl, Sophie, Markl, Calcifer, are people who don't want to take responsibility for where they are in their life, and don't want to move on. The great thing about this film is that all they layers to the film are neatly wrapped up in strong character-based storytelling which remains the core of the film. Sophie has a lovely outlook on life at the beginning of the film. She doesn't want to live her life in the back room making hats, but 'it's still better in here than out there'. So when Sophie gets her 'curse' it's actually great for her. She's really quick to embrace it because it means that she can skip this adulting thing entirely and go straight into old age. The point that the film makes is that while all adults are horrible in their own special way, all these coping mechanisms to avoid becoming and adult do not work. This resolution comes when the characters can learn to define for themselves what adulthood is.",

The director has almost totally forsaken plot in favor of visually transporting flights of the imagination. The big visual set pieces are presented quite matter-of-factly (Sofi's first encounter with the moving castle, for example) and the build to the climax is strangely casual. Still, the film, like all of Miyazaki's work, is extraordinarily inventive and revisits familiar themes and motifs. The character mix has close parallels with ""Spirited Away"", just as the dark, oily forces of evil resemble army's of the former film's 'No Face' character. The Joe Hisaishi music is strong but not amazing, and both the Japanese and American voice actors acquit themselves well. The film is not engaging on a visceral level, but it is filled with enormous warmth and rich humanity.

This time around, we have a disparate group of people suffering under various curses who find their way together and form a ragtag family to fight the forces of evil -- in this case, a seemingly never-ending war between two nations. Having said this, I will say HOWL is suitable for even the youngest viewer, because Miyasaki knows how to make such subject matter palatable for even the youngest among us. While not his best work, it is absolutely gorgeous and almost hallucinatory as it tells the story of a walking castle and its owner, a shy young warlock. In some scenes, the castle is CGI; in others, it is standard 2D. Either way, it is a marvel and at the heart of the story, which is loosely based on a novel by legendary fantasy author Diana Jones. Emily Mortimer plays Sophie, the heroine of the story. Christian Bale is Howl. Billy Crystal is the fire that keeps Howl's castle together (don't ask), and he is very funny. A mute scarecrow plays an equally important role. Highly recommended. Make sure you also catch SPIRITED AWAY, PRINCES MONONOKE, NAUSICAA and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO by this animation genius.

248,26 December 2006,Andy-296,8, Convoluted tale betrays Miyazaki's love for Victorian fantasy,"The action of Hayao Miyazaki's latest animated fantasy takes place in an undetermined place and age, though it looks like the late 19th century (allowing for a number of anachronistic details) in a Central European kingdom (the Austro Hungarian empire of the time seems the country where the action takes place, and the book happens in a place called Ingary, though the kingdom in the movie has a large port by the sea, which the Austro Hungarian empire didn't). The story starts with a young woman called Sophie working in a hat factory who is suddenly turned into a 90 year woman through a curse by some witch. She then tries to meet the wizard Howl, to see if he can help her. As it later turns out, Howl faces some curses of its own. The story soon becomes very convoluted, almost impossible to follow it wholly in just one sighting. After a while, you give up on understanding everything that is going on, and concentrate on enjoying its vivid details (Howl's literal melting of sadness is probably my favorite scene). What I found most engaging about the movie, rather than certain aspects of the plot, is its background details, which betrays Miyazaki's love for Victorian fantasy. I haven't read the original book, I know some people who had has taken issue with Miyazaki's liberties with the plot, but as it is, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch, even if the ending is a bit preachy in its endorsement of pacifism and environmentalism.",

That said, Howl is the 3rd animation I have seen from Miyazaki. I think it is generally a respectable work, immensely enjoyable from start to late into the film, but somehow the last 20 minutes or so seems less polished in terms of story and character transition, resulting in a *slightly* disappointing ending. One aspect I really like from Miyazaki's works is that the characters are almost never one dimensional--for example our master Howl who first seems like the perfect leader may have surprised us when his semi-metrosexual attitude is revealed. In this manner, Howl's Moving Castle, like the other films I have seen by Miyazaki, blends reality (imperfect human traits) and rich imagination (excellent visual) in its magical universe.",

262,2 May 2021,EdwardtheBlackPrince,8, Artistically stunning,"Directed by Hayao Miyazaki Studio Ghibli 14th film Howl's Moving castle tells the story of Sophie who works at her late father hat shop along with her sisters and mother. She meets a Wizard name Howl and she rather smitten with him. She's then return to the shop late night is approach by the witch of the wastes who's jealous of her and curses her into an old woman. Desperate to find a way to lift the curse she leaves home traveling west, meets a scarecrow name turnip head who leads her to Howl's moving castle where she ends up becoming the housekeeper. The characters are all unique having something different to offer. Sophie is rather Unconfident with herself she doesn't really feel happy with her life at home. However she still has a optimistic attitude even when she becomes old, it doesn't seem as if she acts like a old women but just herself. She finds some sort of peace staying with the others and doesn't actually mind. Markl who looks very similar to Oliver from Ni no Kung : Wrath of the White Witch is the apprentice of Howl,spends a considerable amount of time with Sophie and is really likeable he's not annoying like a lot of little kids in films and is actually useful. Calcifer a fire demon who powers Howl castle that aloud it to move has a mysterious past to him. Lastly there's Howl himself he probably the most laid back of all the ghibli characters he's a mysterious figure to the public everybody knows who is but nobody knows who is. He uses several false identities to conduct business with various kingdom while still keeping his freedom to do as he pleases. He gets to the point where the war between the lands start to take it toll on him starts to lose control of himself. The Film's visual stunning. With the idea of having a castle that move it offer many opportunities for various locations. There several shot of landscapes accompanied by the music the film seem to take inspiration from Belle Époque France the towns are full of color, the outfits are vivid to building's are vivid. The neighboring kingdom palace is it lined with gold ornament decor it's stunning. Lastly is of course the castle industrial steam punk this one of the most bizarre design creation ever the amount of detail to the animation is remarkable each piece moves seperate. The only problems is the curse with Sophie is inconsistent there are points. She Just swaps back to herself with no reason. Turnip head is alright he's funny but kinda obvious that they were trying to go with another character similar to No-face from Spirited away. He just doesn't leave the same impact and exactly want he is come completely out of nowhere.",

273,5 December 2011,estreet-eva,8, Must see in the kid's anime subgenre,"This weekend took the kids to another Hayao Miyazaki film known as ""Hauru No Ugoku Shiroâ? in Japanese or ""Howl's Moving Castle (2004)â? in English. The film is advertised as being based loosely on a novel and I would hazard to say the loosely part probably has something to do with the injection of Miyazaki's frequent themes which include allusions to the Hiroshima bombing, and pacifism. However, this time out Miyazaki doesn't demonstrate the environmental concern normally prevalent in his work. Our eighteen year old animated heroine is Sophie who hides from society after being cursed into old age by the Witch of the Waste. Miyazaki borrows some elements of ""The Wizard of Ozâ? in the witch's name and in the form of a talking scarecrow. Sophie takes refuge in the moving castle of the title and consistent with the dream-like quality of Miyazaki's films, this keep is a monstrous contraption composed of thousands of moving, steaming and grinding parts on 4 spindly legs powered by a fire demon called Calcifer. Howl is a self-centered wizard who is struggling to avoid being drafted into destructive war along with the rest of the kingdom's magic denizens. The war is over the disappearance of the prince of the land â"" a plot point that does not become important until the very end of the picture. Markl, Howl's apprentice and Suliman, his former tutor, round out the cast of good and evil respectively. Sophie's first task is to bring order to Howl's castle and by extension to Howl himself who is extremely powerful but largely adrift in self-indulgence. Her second task is to get the Witch of the Waste to lift the curse which she ultimately fails at because Suliman tricks and disarms the Witch first. Sophie makes peace with this former enemy and winds up caring for her. It is left to the newly focused Howl to defeat his former tutor lifting the curse from Sophie and from the scarecrow who turns out to be the missing prince thus stopping the war. The story drifts quite a bit and there are definitely points in the film where things grind to halt. However, the animation, particularly the actual castle, are amazing and this helps to carry the audience through the 2 hour runtime.",

The movie was thoroughly enjoyable, though it employs too many tricks from the director's previous works. For those who have seen Spirited Away, I find too many similarities between it & Howl's Moving Castle. I can't remember the name of the dragon wizard in Spirited Away but I feel that Howl is like an adult version of the dragon wizard. For instance, both are ""trapped"" by some form of evil forces and risk turning into demons. the whole plot was also a tad too confusing. I had to watch it twice to grasp the full meaning. (and even after that, I'm not sure I really do understand it). I therefore won't recommend it to young viewers.

This lively adventure captivated my heart and took me to where my imagination never dared to go! Sophie, a 18-year old girl, worked in a hat shop, which was passed down to her from her father. One day, while she was walking in a alley, she is confronted by two men who seem to be flirting or trying to get a number. Luckily, sexy Howl (voice by Christian Bale) saves her and takes her through a unforgettable stroll in the sky. But, the Witch of the Waste (voice by Lauren Bacall) finds out about this stroll and casts a wicked curse on Sophie, making her a 90-year old woman. From there, old Sophie walks great lengths to find this witch and comes upon Howl's Moving Castle. She then meets Calcifer (voice by Billy Crystal), a smart-mouthed and witty fire demon and a aspiring young magician named Markl (voice by Josh Hutcherson). Sophie then falls dramatically in love with Howl. Howl often turns into a bird-like figure, trying to stop the idiotic war that is going on, and in result, comes back to his castle in blood or slime. Whenever Sophie would feel beautiful or happy, her true young self would reappear, but vanish if she began negative. Howl and Sophie go through hard times and adventurous moments, but come out OK. This wonderful romance was sweet and simple. DO NOT MISS HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE!",

(There are plenty of explosions for those who need them. *laughs*) I saw this while in Japan on vacation and it was certainly worth the 1800 yen (about $18) I paid for the privilege. This is an adaption of the book by Diana Wynne Jones, so don't be surprised when you hear English names throughout. While I normally disapprove of overhauling a novel for the big screen, this is one occasion when it seriously needed it and it was masterfully done. Howl is a far more admirable character in the film than he was in the book and the movie moves along at a fair clip without ever getting bogged down. Sophie's many transformations from young to old to not so old to young and back again (many of them very short-lived) are wonderfully done and add a wonderful dimension to the story that I'm sure Ms. Jones would (and probably does) approve of. The book was perfect as a book, but the screenplay is perfect for the screen while retaining the essence of the book. I look forward to dragging my friends to the theater to see if the translators and English voice actors have done it justice.",

I am going to point out a trend I have noticed on this website and possibly ridicule some of the opinions of other IMDb contributors.

That is like spitting on a man ablaze. First of all, you are spitting on someone. Secondly, the ludicrously small amount of water in the spit couldn't put out a match (of course unless you are a spit marksman, in which case I apologize). And finally, you ARE spitting on someone. That is how I felt about this movie. I was actually hoping Miyazaki could help me out in my temporal predicament, as he had done many times in the past. With hopeful enthusiasm, my confidence and trust of my fellow humans deteriorated to the point of despair and disdain. I realize I should probably sleep on this topic before writing a review, but here we are. ",

This has all the magical and fantastical elements you would expect from the mind of a mad Japanese animator. It pure fantasy and freedom the kind you can only do in a cartoon. It looks great the style is amazing and it's the attention to detail that stands out as far as the graphics go, howl's castle as it walks round the land wobbling and creaking like a huge engine. It is just a delight that adults and kids alike can sit together and enjoy this film for all sorts of different reasons. From wildly bizarre to oddly strange the story twists so many times you never know where it's going to end up and by the end I still had no idea. I think that is where some of this films charms are, in that it doesn't have to make sense to be enjoyed its just so mystical and aesthetically pleasing.

I found the story and characters not as likable or relatable as in ""Spirited"", and the convoluted plot involving a war taking place in the background didn't really pull me in as much.

302,15 July 2005,conormcdonnell,7, howl's moving castle,"Having seen Spirited Away I came to this movie with high expectations. However those were slightly dampened by again seeing the Disney brand attached to this man's wonderful work. I have browsed a lot of sites, reviews, etc to see if anybody else came away from this movie with the same impression as me and so far I have not seen any similar views. Maybe some of this site's users can give me some feedback. The references to The Wizard of Oz are numerous and obvious and yet there seems to be a subtext here that is not so much explained by The Wizard of Oz but is more in keeping with a Japanese man who knows his work will be distributed by a major American company. The images of war and aerial bombings are not in keeping with a treatment of Oz and it is only when you view the ""Wicked Witch of the Waste"" in her powerless state with her bulbous, purple nose puffing on a cigar that only one character comes to mind. Winston Churchill! This movie to me is a Japanese viewpoint on World War II. When viewed in this light even the blob-men who come out at night during bombings take on a cancerous appearance that echoes the mutations suffered by generations of Japanese civilians post Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even the main character, Howl, suffers a struggle of duality where he was once blonde, beautiful and pure but is increasingly in danger of turning into a large black bird due to his increasing involvement in war. The more this movie continues the more his bird-form resembles the black eagle of Nazi Germany. To me this movie is an attempt to explain the duality of Japan's involvement in the war. Continue to fight and end up as the fascist state of the southern hemisphere or withdraw and yield to the inevitable revenge bombings of the US as retaliation for Pearl Harbour. You may call me mad but there are many more instances to support this theory scattered throughout the movie and that is why I don't think this is a great movie. It is too concerned with making a heartfelt point while dressing it up in a more superficial wrapping as a Wizard of Oz-like commentary on age and beauty. However, this is probably the most subversive movie we will see for many a time.",
303,25 June 2005,eagleknight98,8, A bit less than anticipated,"I guess I will start my short review by saying that I am a huge fan of Miyazaki since the 70's that is why I rushed to watch this movie. The movie, in short, is about a girl with low self esteem and poor self image. It is also about a selfish, egoistic and pampered boy who is too indulged with his beauty sometimes. Then fate brings those two, along with a lot of marvelous characters, together in a motivating, breathtaking adventure where each and everyone learns there weakness and strength through the other. Perhaps i was a little biased with the last two lines, because that is how i hoped it would be... The story line is somewhat weak, and if you watch it once, might look purposeless. The animation was great, but less than what he has achieved in Spirited Away. The English dubbing was good, yet weak when it comes to the fire spirit and the heroin. Overall: The movie is worth watching once in the cinema. And it is definitely worth getting the DVD to add it to the Miyazaki collection and to pay attention to those minor, yet powerful, details that one can never catch from watching the movie once.",

Here we don't have anthological creatures like Totoro or No-Face, nor do we have such charismatic characters like Mononoke, Chihiro, Haku, Lupin III, Nausicaa, Porco Rosso. The plot is confusing, tiring and boring. Miyazaki movies usually have crazy twists and crazy situations, but the Howl's Moving Castle is just too confusing in excess. The beginning, when Sophie is a young woman, is spectacular, but then the story becomes a mess as it moves on - the idea was good, but it was not well executed.

The characters are fascinating to hear and watch, and have very interesting stories, all rounding up in a way that each of them make the film balanced in its list of characters. The story flops in some spots, but it holds up very strong in plenty of places, and most of the time I barely noticed potential flaws since I was still recovering from what had occurred beforehand. Studio Ghibli has proved once again that animation is for all to cherish for lifetimes, and compared to plenty of other 2004 animated films (besides The Incredibles and maybe Shrek 2), this is top tier stuff that you don't want to miss. Anyone who tells you to skip this film (besides Miyazaki fans who have seen a majority if not all of these films) clearly is only jealous of how much Miyazaki has implanted himself into critics' minds and has made ""animation"" not synonymous with ""cartoon"".",

Interesting plot devices lead nowhere in particular but appear to have been invested with a significance that altogether escaped me. The backdrop of the film is a war, but whether the films motivation is to say something about that war or war in general or anything else relating to the characters whether allegorical or literal, it's just too meandering to say, it's just lots of little scenes that, while connected and lovely as snippets, don't go anywhere and often seem to go on for far too long.

His salvation occurs when he discovers something worth protecting and fighting for, Sophie and the small family she has gathered about the two of them: Markl,the Scarecrow, Heen, and, yes! even the Witch of the Waste, who, at the climatic moment, resigns Howl's stolen heart into Sophie's hands. In the end even the fire demon Calcifer cannot resist Sophie's love. And so Miyazaki, following his heart, draws good out of evil. What a wonderful story with a truly glorious ending! I love it!",

But when I saw the whole thing, I was astonished of how great the animations were and the beautiful, gorgeous artwork. I wouldn't call this movie the greatest movie by Hayou Miyazaki... okay... maybe not. I'd give it a 3rd place behind Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. While because, this film is not in the Top: 250, it should receive a third place. I've seen not all of the Hayou Miyazaki movies, but Spirited Away (which I'll mostly compare) was amazing. Howl's Moving Castle I don't think suits the writer. I'd have to read the book, I know it's based off a book. But Hayou Miyazaki usually makes some movies with child-like romances like let me explain, Porco Rosso... I didn't really enjoy. And Whisper of the Heart... the film I did enjoy. Hayou Miyazaki's movies have many adventures, friendship (with little romance), mostly fantasy. And some lyrical drama and comedy every once in a while. This film mostly had too many kisses especially the main character, who kissed almost everybody on the deck or whatever. But the film received its nice-paced drama and comedy and the action keeps some children from getting scared or crying.",

I found the final plot to be somewhat incoherent and very problematic in terms of reinforcing negative gender stereotypes and un-empowering gender roles. For example, why is the main female character and an additional female character attracted to Howl when he is never around, highly volatile and outrageously needy? Why does the main female character give up her hat business to clean his castle? Why are age and weight the predominate indicators of social disgust and unattractiveness? Why does Howl's big scene displaying his love for the main character consist of little more than buying her gifts and showing off his power? Why is the broomstick the most considerate, caring male character in the picture and also the one that no one wants to be in love with? I have very little experience with children's films, but would like to think that a theater full of attentive, undiscerning children would be an arena that demanded a higher level of responsibility in terms of presenting characters that empower the viewers as opposed to propagate oppressive stereotypes.",

After watching this anime, Howl's moving castle became my top anime which stays in my heart. The story of Howl's moving castle is mysterious and incredible. It is an illustration of the magical world that provides various stunning scenery. The production of this anime is perfect, the motion is smooth and clean. The anime covers color theory which could bring us to the wonderful world of Howl's moving castle. However, Howl's moving castle is not a realistic story. The story also presents the gap of the society which becomes a great war in animation and especially teaches me about self-worth. The one main character of Howl's moving castle, Sofia has a problem with being a confident person. There are various causes in her life. This point of a story became my inspiration for doing something. If you are going to watch Howl's moving castle, I hope this could be your inspiration either.

This was made seemingly apparent when he saves Sophie from the Witch of the Waste's minions lurking in the alley. After being harassed, Howl dashingly comes to Sophie's rescue, literally sweeps her off her feet, glides through the sky with her in arms, and safely carries her to the top of her home balcony.

Until one day she meets a strange wizard named Howl who literally sweeps her off her feet. Later she encounters The Witch of the Waste(an old flame of Howl's) who turns her into an old woman out of spite. Sophie now travels to Howl's Castle to try to break her spell and work as a cleaning lady. There she meets Howl's apprentice Markl, and a fire demon named Calcifer.

The story is about a young hatter, Sophie, who casually meets Howl, a wizard. But a baleful witch misunderstands the sort of their relationship and transforms the poor girl into an old woman. So, Sophie becomes the governess of the Howl's moving castle. Hayao Miyazaki is a great, not only in in the extent of Japanese animes, but he is a master of the world animation: for example, you must see the sequence of Howl and Sophie's flight.

362,13 October 2020,monsterhunt-94296,9, Another masterpiece from Miyazaki,"Alright today I watched Howl's Moving Castle, my fourth film from Studio Ghibli and third film from Hayao Miyazaki. It's always hard for me to figure out where to begin with reviews for Ghibli movies since they're so unique. So, I won't really say much about what the movie itself is about because I didn't really know anything going in and I'll let anybody who watches the movie after reading this review do the same. Howl's Moving Castle has such a wonderful cast of characters, each of them brings something great to the movie and they all have vibrant personalities. This movie also has one of the most interesting worlds I've seen on screen (much like Spirited Away). Miyazaki just has a talent when it comes to his sheer creativity of crafting worlds and characters. This movie does involve the use of magic, and usually everybody gets all caught up in magic systems and their rules and whatnot, but Howl's Moving Castle doesn't even need to worry about that. The couple of rules for magic laid out for us make sense, but you're so immersed in the world and story that if there are any inconsistencies I didn't even notice because the movie is, well it's magical. Something that I've learned since I started watching way more movies is that it's not about understanding every aspect of this world and the magic, it's simply about what the movie makes you feel. Howl's Moving Castle has so much heart and definitely makes you feel something. The animation looks fantastic here as well, the whole movie is just really beautiful. The score here is also great, and the audio editing in general works really well. This movie is just really captivating and entertaining, my only problem is that it starts to lose steam before we get into the finale.
Other than that, I didn't really have any problems. I feel like this review isn't as in depth or well written as my other reviews, but the truth is this movie is an experience, something I can't describe. I think I like it better than Spirited Away but I'd need to give it some time to decide. It is definitely a masterpiece, and I'm going to give Howl's Moving castle an 8.5/10.",

372,1 May 2008,lenore_andrea,10," Untrue to the novel, but with value of its own.","This movie is a very simplistic version of Diana Wynne Jones' excellent novel. Some of the best moments and characters of the book are absent or have been changed significantly. For instance, many of the angry and exasperated interaction of Sophie and Howl have been cut. For example, Sophie's anger when she realizes that Howl and Michael know that she is enchanted through espionage, or the battle of Howl's suits. However, it is redeemed through excellent animation, artwork, and characterization. All characters are excellently played, although Howl and Calcifer are most true to the book. It is disappointing that Sophie is portrayed as insecure about her appearance, although that is done excellently. However, I simply feel that Sophie's reasons for suppressing her independence were excellent in the book (a feeling that she would not amount to very much due to tradition, and that if she could not realize her dreams, she must take care of her family) and that appearance is too often a concern for young women in movies. While appearance can be a major factor in limiting young women, it is not the only factor. Only discussing appearance shapes how young women will often react to discussing other problems: they will be less likely to. Even more worrisome, they actually may begin to consider the problems unimportant and singular to themselves.",

I like the improvised storyline of the movie that Hayao Miyazaki wrote compared to the original. Yes, the original is funny and upbeat whereas the movie is a little dark. But I don't care. To me, it's a beautiful love story with an anti-war message. I feel Miyazaki san is right to have Sophie as a not-so-pretty girl in the movie rather than somebody lovely like in the book. OK, it makes me feel good that at the end of the day, the kindness of Sophie ie the inner beauty, overcame superficial look. Howl's character in the movie is also more interesting and I thought the the producer made the right choice of having Takuya Kimura to provide the voice-over for Howl's character. It makes him really attractive and fascinating. Somebody wrote that that Howl's character might bring in the female audience like Haku character did in 'Spirited Away'. I must say that person could be right. I was in Kinokuniya a few weeks ago, looking at the Japanese books of Howl. There was this girl with her kid brother also looking at the same books and she commented to him that all her friends like Howl. I thought that was pretty funny considering that Howl is an animated character and not a real person. But Takuya Kimura really breathed life into Howl making him into a sort of devil-may-care, sometime brooding, sometime rascally, good looking wizard who is swoon-worthy, thanks to the animated artists.",

387,1 March 2006,harsawa,9, Not on par with Spirited Away- but still an amazing film.,"I have and always will love Hayao Miyazaki's films. I first descovered him when I saw もののけ姫(US ""Princess Mononoke"") when it first hit the cinema. Howl's moving castle is his second adaptation of a novel by the same writer (The first being ""Castle in the sky"") and his latest film. It opens fairly quickly with not a lot of time to establish the characters, but then after a few other goes-by-fast events, the movie starts into an acceptable pace. Sophie is a young girl working for a hat-shop in a witch and wizard version of Europe. One of the most well known Wizards- Howl lives inside a giant legged castle, and is commonly believed to come down and steal the hearts (literally) of young and beautiful women. When the watch of the waste comes into the hat shop, after a brief argument of sorts, curses Sophie and turns her into an old woman. She then flees her town to the wastes in hope of finding a way to have the spell broken, and along the way finds a cursed scarecrow whom she asks to find a place to stay- and finds Sophie Howl's castle. When inside she meets Calcifur, a demon of flame who promises her he would break her curse if she freed him from Howl, he uses him as a slave. I do not know how close this adaptation is to the novel, as I have never read it, or even heard of the authors name until recently. This movie is extremely well done, as with Miyazaki's other films, but when it comes to Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, or any of his other films, Howl's moving castle falls short. It's lacking some of what made his original films so unique (Not to say it doesn't have some of that style) and doesn't feel as fresh or interesting as his others.",

Based upon the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle lacks nothing in terms of imagination or strong characters.

'Howl's Moving Castle' has a very strong charm about it that I love. The characters are all fabulous, detailed, and full of depth and life; my favourite parts of the movie are just watching these people be themselves (my favourite part of the entire film is when Sophie first arrives at the Castle and goes about cleaning and making breakfast). The animation and score are both superb as always and add a lot to the viewing experience. There's just nothing I dislike about this movie, and contrary to other Miyazaki films I find it every bit as gripping upon multiple rewatches.

396,24 September 2013,spaceymanatee,4, Howls Movie Castle,"Hayao Miyazaki's film, Howl's Moving Castle based off Diana Wayne Jones children's book, explores a beautifully animated fantasy world. The hand drawn scenes include everything from ""The Royal City,"" to a never ending flower filled valley, and, of course Howl's Moving Castle. Everything seems to be more exciting or thrilling and the viewer has to keep reminding themselves to pay attention to what is really going on. No one seems to care about the shallow characters or their lack of logical thoughts because the audience is too intrigued by the breath- taking images Miyazaki creates. Sophie, voiced by Emily Mortimer and Jean Simmons, is a young girl who is stuck working in a hat shop during what appears to be an industrial revolution. One day, while on her way to meet her sister, she encounters a problematic situation, but is luckily saved by a wizard named Howl, voiced by Christian Bale, but little does she know, she is actually being brought into an even larger problem. Sophie manages to instantly fall in love with Howl right as he leaves to take on a larger task at hand. Her love for him draws The Witch of the Waste, voiced by Lauren Bacall, to curse Sophie changing her into an old woman, who Howl will not be attracted to. Sophie, distraught that she is an old woman decides to walk up a mountain, because as a fail old woman, that is a great idea. She then seems to encounter all the magic and wizardry that exists even though she has no magical powers herself, first with encountering Howl's Moving Castle, just by accident. Though not much of a castle and there never is an explanation of why it is called a castle, quests occur for not only Howl, but Sophie and the gang of the cursed individuals who just seem to keep appearing. The film contains a mixture of cheesy lines and witty ones, whose only point is to entertain the audience because the characters are not remarkable. At one point, Howl, who is regularly throwing a temper tantrum, states, ""I see no point in living if I can't be beautiful"", and Calcifer, a talking fire, voiced by Billy Crystal, states, ""I can't stand the fire and gunpowder"". Laddie, Sophie's sister who is seen for part of a scene, has no significant value to the structure of the film, but is still put in. No matter what is going on in the film, Sophie's curse of an old woman seems to be the most important issue in the world, I mean it's not like larger issues are going on like a worldwide war. The characters' individuality stops functioning during the film and just seems to go wherever the director puts them, whether it makes sense or not. There are also countless moments where the question ""Why?"" comes to mind. The film is also very vague in describing why a specific scene is occurring, leading to a great deal confusion. There is no doubt that Miyazaki created a beautiful backdrop and characters, but the storyline was no match for the ""scenery porn"". The fact that everything was hand drawn with minimal computer enhancement made you wonder how Miyazaki did it. Drawn to how Miyazaki could continuously to top the images as the film progresses, the storyline just seemed to fade into the background. The only way to improve the film is to remove the characters, even with their witty comments, lack a connection with the audience. In this film, the characters are certainly upstaged by the backdrop. The film definitely has flair with all the beautiful scenes, but lacks something more from the plot. Film directors are pushing their limits with the backgrounds, forgetting to focus on a stimulating storyline.",

The general story is so utterly fantastic that you immediately know that it can't happen in real life. My only complaint is that there are so many times where it justdoesn't make ne sense. At the start of the movie, well, you basically have to take a long time to make sense of everything thats happening, especially since if u don't comprehend Japanese, everything has to be co-ordinated between your reading and watching. The ending really disappointed me, because it basically made so little sense it ruined (to a small extent) the wonderful experience of Howl's moving castle. What do I say? I recommend it to everybody, because it really has a good blend of the ingredients for wide appeal movies. Don't watch ne voice over versions, it completely ruins the delicate balance the movies achieve, especially when one character's lines stretches for 5 seconds after the animation's mouth has stopped moving.",

She then is attacked by the Witch of the waste who is very fat and becomes old.

403,11 November 2022,smoothrunner,10, mythological symbolism,"""My dear Lucy... girls grow quicker than books... you are already too old for fairy tales... but some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again"" wrote C. S. Lewis in the foreword to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". Apparently, a similar growing up overtook me. I had a strange attitude towards Miyazaki - on the one hand, I've watched and highly appreciate almost all of Ghibli's movies, which were not filmed by Miyazaki, but on the other hand, this were his movies, except for ""The Wind Rises"", which I did not ever bother watch completely. The same applies to the ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and ""Spirited Away"", which I began to watch several times, and was utterly bored somewhere in the middle. It's funny, but something unlikely brought me back to both films - the mythological symbolism in the pattern of interaction between masculine and feminine principles and proper representation of a female archetype in Miyazaki's movies. Indeed, what Miyazaki was filming are true fairy tales with the structure and symbolism of myths. Both ""Castle"" and ""Spirited Away"" tell about becoming feminine, about the transformation of girls into young women, their interaction with ""monsters"" - a male archetype embodied in one case in a shapeshifter-wizard, gradually forgetting himself and losing his humanity; in another case, in a shapeshifting river dragon, who has forgotten his name. Both beauties must first find their femininity in order to free the ""monsters"" (from the deal with the demon / evil sorceress), return them to normal from the borderline, awaken them as men. The heroines of these Miyazaki movies are the embodiment of femininity. They find their true strength and splendor through acceptance of their femininity, rather then through denial of femininity and imitation of men. They self-actualize through acceptance of their nature and following the greater good, not through self-denial and mimesis of men like Rene Girard would probably say and as it is customary to portray lately through the trope of a ""strong independent woman"", which is in the essence is epitome of self-denial and radical form of misogyny. Such self-denial and mimesis could only lead to conflict, scapegoating and destruction. Not so in the ""Castle"". The masculine and feminine are embodied here in a proper way, acquire completeness and integrity, creating harmony and the feeling of a fairy tale. Traditionally for Ghibli, the story is implemented through gorgeous animation and beautiful music, woven into the atmosphere of this fairy tale, which can absorb and hold your attention for two hours if you are still young enough or already old enough to love fairy tales.",

The story arc of Sophie's journey is fairly straightforward. Howl's adventures, however, are much more complicated & leave much to the imagination. The war he fights is never explained. I have read articles saying that villains in Miazaki's movies are never really all bad. The witch of the waste in this movie was used as an example. I somewhat disagree. While the witch was indeed on the darker side of the moral spectrum, she was not the true villain. The king character, whose motives are never clarified in the dub, seems to be bad with no redeeming qualities. So there goes that theory. I've heard a rumor that this will be Miazaki's last film. It does contain references to his other films throughout, such as the black ooze characters, which strongly resemble Noh Face from Spirited Away. It would be appropriate for him to pay homage to his earlier works if he is indeed no longer going to make films. It also creates a very sad blanket over the film.",

I liked the chemistry between Howl and Sophie, which is one of the central elements to this story; at first, Howl is fussy about his appearance, and he makes Sophie cry when they have the argument. Eventually, though, Howl learns to cope with his altered appearance, and he and Sophie develop a relationship with each other. It is a storyline that is almost like Beauty and the Beast in a sense; in both instances, you have the man in the relationship who has been ""dehumanized"" or turned into a monster, while you have the woman who wants to bring out the man trapped inside the monster. Some of the other characters, like Calcifer and Turnip Head, provide plenty of comic relief in this film, which further helps to engage the viewer.

425,9 July 2010,janecamacho,8, Beauty and the beast,"I saw this movie once more, an for its benefit I must say that it grows on me every time I see it! For a brief summary of the plot, Howl is a young yet powerful wizard who is very sought after by girls infatuated with him and by the King that wants to recruit his services to the ensuing war. Sophie, a young girl working at a hat store, is cursed by a witch that turns her in to an old woman. As she wonders out of town she ends up working as a cleaning lady in the moving castle where Howl roams about in the countryside, escaping the frantic of civilization. There she meets a fire demon that recognizes her spell and tells her of a mysterious spell that links him with Howl. Howl's moving castle is a touching love story and fantasy fable all rolled in to one. Of course, Myiazaki's trademarks (and Ghibli's production values) are very much present here. The painted landscapes are just breathtaking, among Myiazaki's best drawings. In deed the fictitious country where the movie takes place, that could very well by from turn of the century Europe, has much of nature depicted through these landscapes as of civilization and technology starting to boom from its cradle. Here magic and wizards are a part of society and the front line on the upcoming war with the neighboring country. War, civilization opposed to nature, the difficulties of growing up, all of these are usual themes in much of Myiazaki's work and are here presented in a way reminiscent of some of Disney's nineties classics. Another interesting fact, also common to many of the director's movies, is that some key elements from the story are suggested radder than explicitly presented, allowing you to sink in with every new viewing and reevaluating it's relevance in the Japonese master's work. A truly wonderful experience, that only a handful of directors know how to do. Despite it's inevitable similarities and comparisons with other Myiazaki movies (which tend to arouse criticism), Howl's moving castle is, first a foremost, a beautiful love story!",

Since watching Howl's Moving Castle (dubbed version) I have eagerly sought out other films by Ghibli and particularly by Miyazake. The artwork is stunning and the attention to detail beyond anything, especially since this is hand-drawn, with little, if any, CG. So much better than the flat 2-dimensional work seen in much of Disney's offerings. I'm not sure how much was lost in translation - but I found the story satisfying if occasionally a bit light in content and explanation (without spoiling - the details of the curses and their 'cures' are mainly left to the viewer to work out) - but this is minor in the overall effect of the film, which is amazing. You get sucked into this fantastic alternative reality; the characters are appealing and the stellar cast for the English language voice-over (Christian Bale, Lauren Bacall, Jean Simmons, etc)did justice to the animation characters. My one niggle was why Christian Bale had to adopt an American accent for Howl (when he is in fact British), whilst the character of Sophie spoke with a British accent - but this is just nit-picking!

Although it is based on a book (which I have not read), Miyazaki really makes the story his own. The world he crafts and the story he weaves are so amazingly detailed and interesting that I was truly spellbound for most of the film. Unfortunately, the ending does not live up to the promise of the film and is somewhat unsatisfying, which is the only reason I could not rate this as a 10. However, it is still worth seeing. As is typical with Miyazaki, he successfully relates the conflict and ambiguity of the world around us in an engaging way, without resorting to the Western ideals of good and evil. His characters really embody the concepts of yin/yang and wabi-sabi. Nothing and no one is completely good or completely evil and nothing is really as it may seem.

It's difficult enough to understand if you have read the book.

Although the story is one of the most complex ones, it really does have a proper plot from start to finish, unlike some other Miyazaki's movies which have weird endings/unfinished stories, well at least in my opinion... The visuals and the music are of course magnificent, I could listen to the soundtrack all day long... There are plenty of interesting, well-developed characters and of course Miyazaki's trademarks like an anti-war theme, flying aircrafts etc. There is a fine balance of action and ''calmer'' parts of the movie, also the line between magical and real is set very good in my opinion... I love how Howl's room is stuffed with so many things and looks so comfortable!^^ Whenever I'm feeling depressed, I like to watch this movie, especially the scenes that take place in large, open scenery like the woods and the mountains, it makes you feel very warm inside. One scene in particular always comes up first though, it's the one where they make and eat breakfast, I dunno why, maybe because the food looks so deliciousXD... Anyways, as a Miyazaki fan I urge you to watch this movie! You'll be taken into a world where not everything is perfect and good, but where friendship (and a little bit of magic;)) can do wonders!",

I deeply like both Miyazaki and Howl's Moving Castle. I found their combination to be jarring and distressing. If you've read the book, spare yourself and don't see the movie. I expected to see an animated adaption of the book and instead was treated to the disconcerting experience of seeing familiar characters, lines, and places juxtaposed with little or no reference for the original story. Minor points within the book become key to the plot of the movie, and major events/characters in the book fail to appear at all.",

I had read the original book before the movie (me being the book worm and all...) and I love how Miyazaki kept the essence of the book but added his own twist/style to his movie version. I've been an admirer of his art ever since I had seen Kiki's Delivery Service when I was 7 yrs. of age, and his unique style always seems to capture me in the world of the movie. Also, the way that Miyazaki always gives life lessons to each movie without being too obvious is a show of his experience as a director. Miyazaki gives all of his characters such life-like qualities (including the negative qualities), and I'm sure each of them would redefine the meaning of a hero or role model once you've seen his work. I'm sure many reviewers might say "" A 9/10! That's absurdly too high!"" Yet, Miyazaki has a way with weaving stories into brilliant tapestries unlike many of the other animators in his time.",

With each and every one of films one can expect lavish animation, an enormous amount of creativity and imagination, and an experience that pulls the viewer into another world. I find in each of his films there is a scene or two that simply puts one's jaw to the floor and leaves this sense of epic satisfaction. All of the above exist in Howl's Moving Castle, as does a certain amount of flaw. This flaw lies in two elements, and unfortunately they're the most important elements in the film, the story and characters. ",
475,23 February 2014,liamgoose,10, Yet another breathtaking film from Miyazaki!,"This movie is breathtaking! One of Miyazaki's best films ever (almost on par with Spirited Away which is my favorite anime film ever, and on par with Kiki's Delivery Service which is my second favorite Miyazaki film). The animation is stunning. Everything including the decor of the homes, the people and buildings in the cities, and characters especially are are guilty of taking your imagination and letting it run wild while you watch this film. The attention that Hayao Miyazaki put into Howl and Sophie with their personalities and flaw are very compelling, especially Howl. He is one of my favorite male characters from Miyazaki's work (I also really like Haku from Spirited Away they are both very relatable). Sophie is also one of my favorite female characters from Miyazaki's work as well (I have a huge crush on her, but I pretty much have one on all of the other female characters from Miyazaki's work, except the sisters from My Neighbor Totoro. I didn't really like that film). Overall this film is amazing. Practically perfect! I would give it a 12, but alas I can't.

The story is the only part I felt was lacking in this movie. Though I have to admit I see more flaws with the story after reading the book (even though I find the movie much better). Overall, I felt many of the war scenes were over-dramatized and left a lot of questions. There were also a lot of small things throughout that they could have done a better job at explaining. Even after watching the movie so many times I cannot fully explain some scenes and still have questions about the movie.",
477,19 April 2021,KARLS0NS,8, A struggle with self-worth,"Howl's Moving Castle, just as Studio Ghibli's previous movies, has the magical feeling and eye-candy visuals you would expect. Although this movie is close to the standards of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, its plot feels cut off and hard to follow at times. During various instances you are just let off wondering about the logical connections of character actions. The greatest attributes of this film are the contrasting main characters. After Sophie faces her curse, she does so with courage and positive look on life. She is forgiving and sweet. And then we have Howl, who is selfish, disorganized. He thinks that not being perfect looking makes him undesirable and ugly. But other than his obsession with his looks, he is kind and willing to give anyone a chance. The only character, that didn't really have any growth, was the Witch, for which I just couldn't feel any sympathy at any given time. The movie was emotional and several times left me with a tear in my eyes. In the end the movie was great and deserves the spot of being one of the studios best.",

The one thing that is holding this title back from getting a perfect score for me was that it lacks the huge emotional peek at the end when everything comes together.

Miyazaki Strikes Again.,"This is a Hayao Miyazaki film therefore there are a few things you can expect, a young girl, some adventures, strange fairy tale land and a voyage of self discovery. Of course the film does not disappoint all these elements are there. There is a sense that the film has some wider world elements that set it apart from other Miyazaki movies. This mainly comes from the backdrop of an Orwell 1984 type war with seemingly irrelevant sides and aims. This is developing into a common theme in Japanese cinema at the moment, perhaps unsurprisingly considering that is what the rest of the world is talking about. However the Japanese take on it is always a little obvious and is drilled home to such a degree it is less thought provoking. However it is a visually stunning film where the characters and plot are well developed. There are numerous quirky characters to keep younger movie goers entertained, although I haven't seen the dubbed versions so some of this may be lost in translation. All in all a good modern ""Brothers Grimm"" type tale. If you only watch one Miyazaki film watch ""Spirited Away"" if you want to see a few more this isn't a bad place to go next.",

490,8 October 2006,Jimi_01,8, A Masterful 'Love Will Conquer All' Fairytale,"With enough imagination to rival those boffins at Pixar, master animator Hayao Miyazaki (the Japanese Walt Disney) returns to the big screen with his follow up to the enchanting 'Spirited Away'. These days we are all too familiar with the 'Happy Meal' friendly characters brought to life by western animators through the wonders of CGI. However, this Japanese maestro distinctly resists the use of modern technology in favour of classical cel animation, which makes a refreshing change. Bored with her life in a sleepy town, the film's protagonist Sophie is cursed by an evil witch who transforms her into an elderly woman. Sophie escapes her village to a fantastical roaming castle, owned by the mysterious wizard Howl (voiced by Christian Bale). Howl's Moving Castle is a 'love will conquer all' fairytale that sees Sophie battle to reverse her altered state as she slowly falls for Howl's charms. Some of the visuals are quite Gothic and at times resemble the animated sketches used in Monty Python's Flying Circus. The animation is flawless throughout, engulfing the viewer in a truly bizarre world, whilst simultaneously elevating the film's more fragile moments that comment on war, greed and lost youth.",

502,1 December 2010,kathy89996,10, Excellent Movie Where Creativity Runs WILD,"Putting my absolute admiration for the director Hayao Miyazaki aside, Howl's Moving Castle is an epic and awesome anime movie. The art is amazing and is hand drawn, do not think for a second that this means that the characters don't look good. If anything, it makes it so much more human like and real. This fantasy movie rocks the world and the more times you watch it the more you like it and identify the clever hints hidden in dialogue. I Absolutely love the movie's magical world with it's charms and potions. It is only very loosely based on the book, in fact all that's the same is that character names and the moving castle. But for Hayao Miyazaki to actually IMAGINE and Flesh out the castle and the parallel worlds and magic is truly raw talent and skill. His movie should not really be compared to the book at all since they are nearly completely different. This is a must watch movie for all ages! AND if you happen to think your too old then wait till you have children and encourage them to watch this movie, its so rare to find a movie good in every aspect with originality these days and this movie deserves to be past on and remembered as a true classic.",

I think I'm more related to the second group of people. The characters are nice, the idea is nice , there is that GREAT ADVENTURE that makes a movie stand out in a crowd but I guess there isn't a MAIN IDEA, the clearly displayed idea. There were just A LOT OF INTERESTING sequences and quotes and thoughts, but none of them was developed enough. For example there is the interior conflict about beauty as Sophie is not beautiful and Howl is, then there is something about war, something about overcoming your hate and the will for revenge and many many other great concepts but they were not presented and developed clearly enough, as at some points the movie is moving too fast and you just don't get enough time to pay attention to them. Besides, there were also many useless details. So, in conclusion, if you want to make a good movie, the idea is JUST NOT ENOUGH. I guess it's sometimes complicated to get rid of all the details and focus on ONE main idea or maybe two, but that's what really makes a movie great, doesn't it?",

Though it was spectacular and amazing to watch ( a great pioneer in the world of animation) I prefer the story of Howl's Moving Castle. A young hat maker is cursed into becoming a old woman after meeting a mysterious stranger known as Howl. She soon discovers his walking ""castle"" and the creatures it holds. As she gets to know this mysterious man more and more she becomes younger and younger but also has to save Howl from the evil witch who cursed her in the first place. I have seen this movie more than any other Miyazaki's and love it every time. The animation is superb and as stated before the story is amazing.",

Still, if you sit through some heaviness of the film at its beginning, which I personally have nothing against and love viscous films, then later you will be generously rewarded with both miracles and yuroma of the second half of the film.

It tells the story of Sophie, an insecure eighteen-year-old girl, who works in her dad's hat shop even though she doesn't enjoy it that much. She found her life pretty much boring until the day she encountered the infamous sorcerer Howl. People say he is a really powerful sorcerer who steals girls hearts. But he and Sophie had a great time together. The witch of the land, who is in love with Howl, is jealous of Sophie therefore she turns her into an old lady which is a reflection of how Sophie sees herself. We will then follow Sophie in her journey to turn back into a young girl as she becomes more confident. I really enjoyed this movie, it is my comfort film, I have watched it several times! In my opinion it is the best Studio Ghibli film. Everything about it is beautiful : the soundtrack, the animation, the story, the drawings, and the character. My favourite character is Sophie because she is such a relatable character and I love her character development throughout the movie. I also love the love story between Howl and Sophie it is very touching but also funny! There is a hidden meaning to the movie that is so beautiful, I had to watch the movie twice before finding it.

542,24 August 2010,Akriloth2160,8, Howl's Moving Castle Review,"There have been a lot of anime movies that I really enjoy watching, although hardly any of them attract any sort of attention. It's a shame, because one particular anime studio, Studio Ghibli, has been responsible for some of the biggest masterpieces in Japanese cinema to date, such as My Neighbour Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, and the first ever anime film to receive an Oscar, Spirited Away. Now we have Howl's Moving Castle, a steampunk fantasy film based rather loosely on the British adult fantasy novel of the same name. The main plot is about a girl who offends a sorceress known as the witch of the waste, and as a result, gets transformed into an old woman. She seeks refuge in a giant frog/chicken-like structure which is the castle of a mysterious sorcerer known as Howl. There are some pretty odd elements in the whole film, such as Howl himself being able to transform into a giant bird, a door which leads to one of four completely different places depending on the twist of a coloured knob, a plucky fire demon who powers the whole castle (Who, by the way, has the voice of legendary American comedian, Billy Crystal), and something of a rarity for fictional structures, the fact that the entire castle is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside (As opposed to stuff like the TARDIS and the Narnia Wardrobe). Overall, this movie is a really captivating, immersive, moving (It moved me to tears at one point, I can tell you!) and sometimes quite funny (Especially that rather bored little dog!) roller-coaster ride of a fantasy film that really deserves more than it already has received at the box office. OK, so The Matrix still remains my favourite movie of all time, but Howl's Moving Castle just manages to scratch Neo's undercarriage (Eww!) since it's almost as amazing. Watch. This. Movie. Now.",

544,29 November 2011,vitaminkz,9, A work of art,"Based on the novel Howl's Moving Castle, written by Dianna Wynna Jones, Hayao Miyazaki had produced yet another phenomenal movie hit world wide. Like many of Miyazaki's successful movies such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Castle in the sky and many others, the stories in which these movies were based upon were altered and mixed with Miyazaki's own personal beliefs. Howl's Moving Castle is shown with classic Miyazaki: feminism, war, and love. The themes presented in the movie, although somewhat in a lull, progressively strengthen Sofi's and Howl's love story. Another key iconological factor to all Hayao Miyazaki films is the captivating traditional hand-drawn animation. ",

548,24 April 2015,strollins1,10, A woman finds herself on a dangerous adventure to find her old self and makes friends along the way.,"Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderful movie for all ages. It took me a few times of watching it to really understand what the movie was about and what was going on, but it makes a really good point. You really need to not take things for granted and you should live your life. I thought this movie was excellent at its use of imagery and details. It used a lot of creative examples of real-life events and issues that correlate to our world, and that's what I like to see. Yes, live your life how you want to and be who you want to, but don't let others try to control you and how you look or who you are on the inside--or outside. In the end, it's really what you make out of it. Seeing things that I could relate to really helped me as well, so I got think of it that way. At first, I kind of thought it was a little similar to the Wizard of Oz, but it's not really like that at all. You can see what I mean if you have seen both, but that confused me at first. So if you get confused by watching this movie the first time, just try to process it another way, or watch it again. It will really help you out. It is a little harder to understand, but you'll get it. Watching this movie taught me this and I hope that it inspires you to feel the same way.",
