0,16 September 2005,noralee,10, Samurai Genre is Used to Exposively Indict Japanese Politics and Culture,"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.",/
1,21 March 2007,Galina_movie_fan,10, Disharmony of Sword and Pen,"I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" ",r
2,7 October 2005,OttoVonB,10, Does to the Samurai genre what Wild Bunch did to the Western!,Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.,e
3,12 June 2020,frankde-jong,10, Humanism against the Samurai code of honor,"The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.",v
4,8 November 2001,Duree,10, 200 Proof,"This film is the purest distillation of the spirit of Greek tragedy ever put on celluloid.  Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962.  Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century.  That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving.  The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history.  It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death.  This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face.  There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.  Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof.  See it today.  Buy it yesterday.",i
5,13 April 2006,lstrawser,10, A Gem of Japanese Cinema,"Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.",e
6,17 February 2019,jonsefcik,9, So Close To Perfection,"Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.",w
7,16 September 2018,perica-43151,10," True masterpiece, exposing hypocrisy of the ruling classes perfectly","This movie is powerful classic, that is almost perfect. It was way ahead of its time, and comes from an era when Japanese cinema was one that brought us many timeless gems. The samurai story is eternal story of well placed revenge, hypocrisy, morality, it brings philosophical examinations to the forefront. Acting is exceptional, emotion is raw, film has many subtle yet brilliant moments. Certainly one of the great classics of Japanese cinema, not to be missed by anyone.",/
8,3 February 2012,claudio_carvalho,10, A Heartbreaking and Tragic Story of Poverty and Revenge,"In 1630, after a long period of peace in Japan after the end of the clans, thousand of samurais do not have masters and are living in absolute poverty. The ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) and former samurai of Lord of Geishu arrives at the house of Lord Lyi requesting a spot to commit hara-kiri (an honorable form of suicide through self-inflicted disembowelment followed by decapitation under the samurai code).",r

10,9 September 2006,tintin-23,10, Honor and Hypocrisy,"It would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.",2
11,21 February 2019,Gresh854,10, An Underappreciated Samurai Masterpiece,"Harakiri is about two hours and fourteen minutes of uncontaminated mystery/ suspense-driven domination. This samurai classic capers abroad its tale unlike anything else in cinematic existence, bleeding its reveals through evoking flashbacks, heated, verbal narratives, and hairsplitting symbolic portraits.",6
12,12 May 1999,FRANK13,10, This is the best character study & Samurai movie ever made.,"I have seen this movie numerous times (at least 10, probably many more), and enjoy it each time.  The first couple of times I saw it was right after it came out.  It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made.  That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.",2
13,8 January 2007,Ninja_Sinai,9, Harakiri,Well what can I say.. this 1962 movie directed by Masaki Kobayashi is one of the MOST powerful movies I have ever seen in my life! It is really a tremendous example of outstanding film making! The cinematography is absolutely exceptional! However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.,3
14,20 April 2006,dino_cattaneo,10, Excellent cinematography,It's quite surprising that some old masterpieces fall easily into the oblivion. Harakiri (Seppuku) is a good example. Quite simply this is one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen. ,6
15,19 May 2008,auberus,8," Eventually there is only one valid code of Honor, the Human one...","Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en sc√®ne"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression. ",6
16,9 June 2021,cwkenreich,10, Exceeded expectations! Near perfect! Better than every Kurosawa film,"Harakiri is an outsatanding and underrated Japanese masterpiece. It seems to be heavily overshadowed by so-called magnum opuses like seven samurai. However, this samurai film was truly incredible in almost every way. The visuals and the themes complimented each other perfectly. It really shed light on the samurai experience like no film before and subverts expectations with regards to numerous samurai cliches.",5
17,28 June 2005,WaveTossed,10, A classic!,"A classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome. ",/

19,28 March 2022,Tweetienator,9, Delicious,"An excellent work by Masaki Kobayashi, the story, the acting, the settings, everything is top-notch. Seppuku: a feast for every lover of movies about the age of samurais. The story unfolds very slowly but still provides just enough twists and revelations to hold one's attention. Strongly recommended, if you are on the hunt for something new and don't know this one and you seek out for more than just some sword fighting.",r
20,4 July 2021,briancham1994,9, Gripping critique of bushido,"This film ranks as a masterpiece among samurai films for its humanistic critique of the rigid, hierarchical bushido code of conduct. The samurai who espouse this code are depicted as either malicious or enslaved by its snare - reduced to begging or arbitrarily enforcing it as a tool of humiliation. The story unfolds in a gradual way, revealing how all the characters have interacted in the past, bringing a lot of context to the situation in the courtyard. This is all punctuated with skillful cinematography of claustrophobic architecture, heartfelt acting and desperate swordfights.",e
21,17 June 2014,paolaxsanchez13,7, Hanshiro is introduced as a Ronin asking the Iyi Clan masters if they would accept his desire to perform harakiri in their courtyard as a dignified samurai.,"This film is narrated by more than on e person. However the main character, Hanshiro, gets to tell his full story of how and why he got there to the Iyi Clan. There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue.",f

23,4 March 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""I came here with every intention of dying.""","Unlike all the Kurosawa films I've seen, this one has a principal protagonist that announces his intention early in the story and then takes the viewer on a stunning journey of revenge that's entirely unexpected. Director Masaki Kobayashi prepares the viewer with a preliminary accounting of the fate of thousands of unemployed Samurai as a result of the 17th Century dissolution of the Japanese Shogunate. Masterless Samurai, or ronin, appear at the doorstep of a feudal lord requesting a place in which to perform ritual suicide, but for the dishonorable, this effort is merely a ploy to accept some small token of monetary value before moving on. ""Harakiri"" tells the story of two such ronin, and until we learn the true relationship of both men to each other, the viewer is at a loss to understand the real motivation of Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). With frequent forays into the past utilizing a series of flashbacks, Tsugumo relates the story of his son-in-law, helpless in the face of his wife's deteriorating physical condition and unable to seek medical attention for their sick baby due to lack of resources.

28,15 October 2006,planktonrules,8," Sort of an ""Anti-Samurai"" flick","This film was very well-made and the story is excellent. The story begins with a man asking his local warlord permission to commit ritual suicide. His reason is that the country has been at peace so long that ronin (out of work and master-less Samurai) have no income and nothing to do. So, instead of the indignity of just wasting away, a vicious and painful suicide is apparently the best option! Instead of instantly granting this request, the Counselor tells the suicidal ronin about a similar request that occurred recently and how the ronin who killed himself probably only asked for permission to die as a ruse to get money from the warlord! In other words, this other man had hoped that his request would NOT be granted and he would instead been given a small income. But, not wanting to see the Bushido code perverted, the warlord demanded that this man commit ritual suicide--even though the sword the ronin had was made of bamboo and doing the painful ritual was super-painful and difficult with such a sword.",r
29,5 June 2011,nicholaslalich,8," Harakiri, the classic Samurai tale.","Harakiri is a classic tale of the Samurai, or in this case the Ronin. Masaki Kobayashi does an extraordinary job of incorporating western elements along with typical Japanese humor and vengeance, to deliver one of the key Jidai-Geki films in the history of Japanese cinema. The central idea of the film is to expose the audience to the egotistical, dishonorable side of the samurai, and does so by following Hanshiro (the protagonist) as he calls out the Iyi Clan for disobeying the Bushido Code. Samurai's live off honor, but in a world full of war and violence, this film proves that all morals and honor can be lost, and reveals the sick ways that people go about getting a form of entertainment.",v
30,25 January 2022,DoychTrendo,10, Ahead of its time.,A true classic. I can't believe this movie was released in 1962. Immersive and beautiful. The duel scene was a piece of cinematographic orgasm. Kobayashi was ahead of his time.,
31,23 June 2012,Koundinya,10, Enervated samurais living in penury perform the sacred act of Evisceration:- Hara-kiri,"While Japanese movies are synonymous to Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, this movie has neither of them. It's an unprecedented movie that leaves you brood over the plight of the once-great-warriors of the medieval Japan. The movie is aided by brilliant handling of the camera and loud yet powerful background music. The duel between Tsugumo and Omodaka set in the backdrop of plains with bushes ruffling against the gale was the most impressive scenes in the movie.",
32,30 September 2022,lee_eisenberg,10, representing hypocrisy across eras,"One of the major players in Japanese cinema in the post-war era was Masaki Kobayashi. I should admit that ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri"" in English) is the first of his movies that I've seen. Basically, it's an indictment of feudal hypocrisy, and also a warning about over-idealizing history. Rather than simply a samurai movie, this is an anti-samurai movie. The protagonist is a ronin (a samurai without a leader) in a peacetime era in Japan's history. Coming to an estate, he hopes to take his own life, but this is merely the jumping-off point for a long, complex story.",

36,16 October 2020,lasttimeisaw,9, Film Review - Harakiri (1962) 8.5/10,"""Most actions are confined in the palace's courtyard and other indoor spaces, HARAKIRI flags up Kobayashi's optimal stagecraft, the geometrical blocking of actors, the wide-screen spatial compositions, stationary but never feel constricted; when the actor moves, like in the final one-against-many m√™l√©e, everything is crystallized to a T, the minutely calibrated choreography, the lethal slash and damage caused by the swordplay, and Nakadai's total abandon into a bleeding beast and desperate iconoclast. In a sense, the set piece is even more extraordinary than Kurosawa's best offers in YOJIMNO and SEVEN SAMURAI, because Hanshiro is outnumbered, doomed, a forlorn hope who fights until his last breath, a hero whose valor and integrity will not be extolled but buried, but when the dust settles, we actually feel triumphant for him, what a glorious death!""",
37,26 October 2020,eddie_baggins,9, A genuine samurai classic.,"Firmly entrenched in movie bible IMDB's Top 250 Films of All-Time list, Masaki Kobayashi's anti-samurai film remains to this day a stunningly crafted achievement that subverts its genre's expectations to give us a samurai film that favors talking and mystery over sword play and sensationalising.",

39,12 April 2002,zetes,9, Stunning work,"Harakiri is a little slow, but stick with it. The film is exquisite in every way. Kobayashi's direction is simply beautiful. The camera movement is original, exciting, and effective. The script and its characters are endlessly complex. And Tatsuya Nakadai is great, as always.",
40,27 March 2016,bkrauser-81-311064,9, A Daring Repudiation of Collective Hubris,"American ethos has always had a soft-spot for the conscientious objector. We're a nation of fervent individualists and everything from the writings of Mark Twain to the film 12 Angry Men (1957) codifies that idea. The power of an individual against a torrent of common corruption and blind group-think is almost fetishized, especially in contemporary society. The Japanese, generally speaking, don't have such a provocative streak of individualism embedded in their culture. So it's interesting that one of the most eloquent and austerely beautiful films on the subject should come from the land of the rising sun. Harakiri is a repudiation of the collective values of Japan that, on its best days unites a population in tragedy and at its worst marches a people towards war.",
41,22 September 2014,Sergeant_Tibbs,9," Easily the best samurai film, perhaps the best Japanese film.","I usually don't like samurai movies. Even Kurosawa doesn't do it for me. I just can't sink into their ways of life and the world of 17th century Japan. However, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri totally subverts and questions everything they stand for in a compelling way. It's a study of the human condition in samurai form, naturally from the director of the epic saga The Human Condition, of which I need to finish after being impressed by the first part. It's a dissection of the metaphysical ideas of honour that bind the traditions of these men. While they try to commit to formalities, in the face of conflict they find it impossible. The story unravels like a psychological thriller although it's largely formed of flashbacks and talking but the connections that are drawn and the way the film blossoms to its explosive final 15 minutes is extraordinary. A suicide narrative like this is difficult, what are the stakes and what are the motives? Harakiri keeps you guessing, thanks to the incredible performances and when you feel like you've got it figured out, the whole picture changes. With its stark widescreen cinematography and disconcerting score, its technical aspects bolster the experience. It's a film that works on all levels, Harakiri is certainly the best Japanese film I've seen so far.",
42,6 February 2016,PimpinAinttEasy,9, Greatest revenge thriller of all time .....,"Dear Masaki Kobayashi, I am not a big fan of Japanese cinema or the Samurai genre. I have watched a few Kurosawas and Ozus and that's it. But things might change with Hara-Kiri which must be one of the greatest revenge films of all time.",
43,7 June 2012,Cosmoeticadotcom,10, Great,"The film that Harakiri shares the most cinematic DNA with is Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well. In a sense, that film is the modern retelling of this film, wherein a vengeance seeking hero plots to destroy his tormentors, only to have him end up dying, as well as having the real truth expunged. But, along with that film, Harakiri never errs by making its politics lead its art around. From the almost exact repetitions of the early actions of Chijiwa and Tsugumo in the Iyi house, to the repetition of the samurai armor to start and end the film, there is no doubt that politics is merely a weapon in the artistic arsenal; it is not its raison d'etre. But, the film also shares much artistry and narrative technique in common with Kurosawa's more placid Ikiru, which also has a large portion of its ending consist of characters relating flashbacks of what happened to the film's lead character. That this dialogue intensity occurs in a samurai film is unusual, but only at first blush, since Harakiri is, in reality, as much of a samurai film as Stanley Kubrick's Paths Of Glory can be called a 'war' film. And, like films like The Wild Bunch and Once Upoin A Time In The West, Harakiri ends with a symbolic foreshadow of the future of the nation it's set in. It is no happenstance that the rogue ronin Tsugumo is not felled by another's sword, but only by guns, for that was the way the Tokugawa Shogunate, the ultimate bad guy in this film, was to fall almost 240 years later.",
