0,22 October 2005,MaxBorg89,10," Dr.Lecter, I'd like to see you again...","The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.",/

And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did.

6,30 October 2005,Theo Robertson,8, Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice ",w

11,4 May 2019,pmtelefon,5, Top ten most overrated movies of all time.,"Overrated doesn't mean bad. It just means that something is not as good as people say it is. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" isn't a bad movie. It's an okay movie. The best part of the movie is the music. It gives the movie a creepy vibe. The rest of the movie isn't so hot. This is the kind of movie that while you are watching it you think it's really good. But when it's over and you begin to think about what you just watched, you realize that it's pretty dumb. Hannibal Lector escapes by wearing a dead guy's face. Silly. Oh by the way, how did Lector steal the pen? They don't tell you because it would have been impossible for him to steal it. Now after all these years (and years of CSI type tv shows) the little gross out elements that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has seem awfully tame. It's an okay, and I guess somewhat mandatory, watch.",2
12,11 August 2006,crisp_morning_2004,10, A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars,"It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.",8
13,17 January 2017,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,4, Why?,"Look, ""overrated"" doesn't necessarily mean bad. I liked this film when it first came out, and I found it very entertaining. But the extremely high amount of praise that this film gets, makes no sense to me at all. The supposedly menacing and creepy Hannibal Lecter, who ate his victims and is now locked away from society, sounds totally ridiculous with his cheesy one-liners about cannibalism and killing. Jodie Foster, who plays our main protagonist (an elite FBI agent in training) looks and sounds about thirteen years old, and the entire time I was watching, she kept reminding me of an actress from a television after-school special playing dress-up and pretending to be a cop. The pace of this film was rather dull as well, unnecessarily long with hammy characters that seem like they belong in a Troma movie rather than anything highly rated. It still blows my mind that a brilliant film like ""The Killing Fields"" has never been selected for national preservation, but this corny crime thriller was. Honestly I've seen low-budget slashers better than this thing... so why the high reputation and constant fans saying ""oh god, this film is awesome! Hannibal is soooo sexy!"" and all that? To each their own, everybody likes different things, but with this one, which currently has an 8.6/10 overall rating on IMDb, how did that even happen? Was this one of those ""right place at the right time"" kind of things where it hits a generation by doing something innovative for the time, thus becoming popular? Or is there seriously something here I'm missing? I've watched it several times and I don't find it complex or overly intriguing in any way whatsoever. And I really like Foster and Hopkins as actors, from Hopkins' role as the grieving father in Audrey-Rose, to Foster as the dying little girl on a Nova Scotia vacation in Echoes of a Summer, but in this film it tries to put them together in some sort of tragic love story, which really plays out strangely. I kept cringing at Foster's character's pretentiousness and show-off attitude and Hannibal Lecter's pointless riddles and games, which are interesting at first but quickly become boring and stupid.",8
14,1 August 2017,notoriousCASK,10, One of the Greatest Thrillers of all Time.,"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.",7

I have seen many thrillers and I can honestly say that this one is not even in my Top 20. Although I think Hopkins did a terrific job in Lecter's shoes, his 30 minutes on screen just were not enough. This was supposed to be a horror film but I think it barely managed to create the suspense atmosphere and it certainly did not scare me or made me feel uncomfortable at all. Perhaps I expected more since I have been hearing all the fuzz about this movie since I was a little kid. So I watched this film several times and I am still not enjoying it that much.",?
19,27 March 2002,moonspinner55,6," It tries to build a crawling sense of dread and menace, but...","Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" is a grisly spook show, and one without any sympathy for its victims (or for the audience, who get a good hammering on the head). Yes, the Oscar-winning performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have become legendary (and for good reason, they are both intensely focused and driven), but the picture leaves scummy feelings in its wake, as if Demme had suddenly turned carnival barker for the ultimate freak show. FBI trainee Foster, invited into the gruesome investigation of a serial killer, seems to climb the ranks awfully easily, being allowed to do potentially dangerous work on her own as well as going mano a mano with Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal who may hold the key to the crimes. There's chilly art in Demme's presentation--it's a polished piece of work--but I soon tired of the Woman as Hero underlying theme, complete with a who's-in-the-dungeon finale that doesn't work at all, the sacrificing of real human drama for shock value and lots of outlandish violence (such as a mutilated security guard hanging from the top of a prison cell like an angel). The black-humored kicker is that all this perverseness is good for a raunchy thrill, and what better way to arouse a stultified audience than to give us two psychopaths--one who eats his victims, the other who carves up women. **1/2 from ****",r

With plenty of ripe ham from Mr H. and some Nancy Drew like behaviour from Miss F.,the movie trundles over familiar ground with lots of shocks that aren't shocking for people who remember them from the first time around.Mr H escapes and eats somebody.Excuse me whilst I repair my split sides.

24,17 July 2005,nickpal1983,10, It's a classic!,"There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)",t

30,23 October 1998,Primtime,9, A classic,"After watching this movie, one can only imagine Hannibal Lecter waiting around the corner for them in great anticipation. Yes, this movie has a creepy theme to it that is usually saved for B-grade horror flicks, however it works very well in this intelligent and thought-provoking film. Hopkins performance was one of the ten best I've ever seen. Demme's direction was almost flawless and kept the viewer feeling disturbed throughout the film with his use of uncomfortable situations (ie- someone following you in the dark, being stuck in a well, being locked in a room with no way out). What struck me most about this film was the glorification of Hannibal which seemed to portray him as a good guy even while the viewer knows about his murders, cannibalism and mind-manipulating. I felt good about Hannibal getting free, which really disturbed me.",
31,24 April 2009,murtaza_mma,9, A Potpourr of Vestiges Review: Hannibal - The Cannibal,"Silence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study and a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and his improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter), almost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating himself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In fact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity while describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open glacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously equanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type sound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is chilling and Lecter's infamous ""Good evening, Clarice"", is as enthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the shortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading category. ",
32,18 March 2005,jboothmillard,9, The Silence of the Lambs,"This is often cited and one of the greatest in its genre, more a thriller than a horror, featuring one of the most recognisable villains of all time, based on the book by Thomas Harris, directed by Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, Philadelphia, The Manchurian Candidate). Basically young FBI trainee agent Clarice Starling (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jodie Foster) is assigned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), of the Behavioral Science Unit, to interview former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, aka Hannibal the Cannibal (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sir Anthony Hopkins). Lecter, being held in Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, has information about serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins the corpses of his female victims, Lecter is courteous, but hates Starling trying to dissect him. Lecter does tell Starling to seek out an old patient of his, later a cocoon containing a sphinx moth is found lodged in a victim's throat. Starling returns to Lecter, he agrees to give a physical description of Buffalo Bill, in exchange for him being transferred to a new facility, and away from Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), whom he detests. Crawford authorises a fake deal to be made with Lecter, meanwhile Buffalo Bill has kidnapped Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), daughter of U.S. Senator. Lecter demands a quid pro quo (""something for something"" in Latin) from Starling, in exchange for personal information about herself he will give her clues, so Starling tells him about her childhood and the murder of her father. Lecter is later flown to Memphis, Tennessee, there he verbally torments Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), before giving information about Buffalo Bill, some misleading, including the name ""Louis Friend"", an anagram of ""iron sulfide"", meaning fool's gold. Starling realises Lecter's deceit and asks for the truth from Lecter, now held in a cage-like cell, he tells that all information she needs is in the case file, rather than give a name. Lecter insists they continue quid pro quo, she recounts her traumatic childhood where spring lambs were being slaughtered, Lecter speculates saving Catherine will help her end the nightmares and the ""screaming of the lambs"". Lecter gives Starling back the case files on Buffalo Bill before they are interrupted and she is escorted out by police, later that night Lecter has taken a paper clip, uses it to uncuff himself, kills the guards, escapes from his cell and disappears, in fact using a guard's face and uniform to disguise himself. Starling examines the files and realises Buffalo Bill knew his first victim personally, going to the victim's hometown she discovers Buffalo Bill was a tailor, recognising his dress patterns as identical to his victims skins removed, she calls Crawford to inform him Buffalo Bill is fashioning a ""women suit"" of real skin. Crawford is already en route to make an arrest on a man named Jame Gumb, referenced in Lecter's notes and hospital archives, who once unsuccessfully applied for a sex-change, while Crawford leads an FBI tactical team to Gumb's address in Illinois, Starling interviews friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim in Ohio. The house in Illinois is empty, while Starling finds the house of ""Jack Gordon"", this is in fact Jamie Gumb, she recognises him as Buffalo Bill seeing a sphinx moth, she pursues him through the rooms of the basement, discovers Catherine alive, trapped in a dry well, then Starling is trapped in the dark, Gumb stalks her with night-vision goggles, but cocking his gun Starling instantly reacts and fires at Gumb, killing him. In the end Starling is given an FBI Academy graduation party, she is shocked to receive a phone call from Lecter, calling from an airport, he promises not to pursue her and asks she returns the favour, before hanging up he says he is ""having an old friend for dinner"", and follows newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd. Also starring Candyman's Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp, Lawrence T. Wrentz as Agent Burroughs, Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews, Charles Napier as Lt. Boyle, singer Chris Isaak as SWAT Commander, Roger Corman as FBI Director Hayden Burke and George A. Romero as FBI Agent in Memphis. Hopkins deserved his Oscar for his brilliantly sinister 24 minutes on screen as the intelligent serial killer; Foster deserved her Oscar as the young agent slowly toughening up following the clues, and Levine is splendidly disturbing as the killer taking skins for his demented pleasure. The relationship between Starling and Lecter is wonderfully twisted, and the mystery element to find the killer works well, this film became a big hit, legendary for many reasons, it is definitely a great psychological thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Film Score for Howard Shore, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

44,27 December 2012,Hey_Sweden,9, A dynamite Hollywood thriller.,"This is deservedly one of the most popular and praised of all the entries in the worn-out ""cop vs. killer"" genre, and represents a career high point for its key participants. It's especially noteworthy that it should have swept the five major Oscars for the year of its release, considering that the Academy wouldn't normally award such acclaim to a thriller with often grim and disturbing content - a tribute to how well crafted it is. Also worthy of a mention is the way that this film put the Behavioural Sciences unit of the FBI on the map - that unit devoted to the study of the most deviant ""human"" beings among us. Director Jonathan Demme shows a great skill for the genre, and with the assistance of a first rate crew creates some eerily effective suspense. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, it stars Jodie Foster as an eager beaver young FBI trainee who is sent by her superior (Scott Glenn) to interview an imprisoned murderer, the intelligent, cultured psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that he can lend his insight into the activities of ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), a serial killer currently on the loose. Other than a music score by Howard Shore that is a little *too* over the top and manipulative, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" hits all the right notes, telling a story in a taut and convincing manner. The subject matter admittedly is not to every taste - especially when one thinks about what Bills' ultimate plan is. The editing (by Craig McKay), production design (by Kristi Zea), and cinematography (by Tak Fujimoto) are exemplary; among the scariest scenes are Clarices' (Foster) search of a storage space, and the climactic action where agent and maniac are finally face to face (and the sequence leading up to that). Of course, the real meat of the story is the unusual relationship between the charismatic Lecter and the determined Clarice, as he demands she divulge personal information in return for his thoughts on the Buffalo Bill case. Lecter is a truly memorable character, from his choice of entertainment to the way that he gleefully toys with those people that he holds in contempt. Hopkins and Foster are both very effective in these parts, although the contributions of the supporting cast absolutely should not go overlooked. Given the way that Lecter dominates the proceedings, it's important to point out just how extremely creepy Bill is; his performance brought character actor Levine to real prominence. Brooke Smith is very good portraying a would-be victim who actually tries to use her wits and fight back in some way. Also appearing are many other familiar faces: Anthony Heald (as the smarmy jerk in charge of the insane asylum), Diane Baker, Kasi Lemmons, Demme regulars Charles Napier and Tracey Walter, his old mentor Roger Corman (as the director of the FBI), Frankie Faison, Dan Butler, Chris Isaak, and Daniel von Bargen. Even at just under two hours long, this is actually pretty taut in terms of pacing; there's no filler at all, just some very potent entertainment. This was preceded by another Harris adaptation, ""Manhunter"", in which Brian Cox played Lecter, and would be followed by ""Hannibal"" and, after that, ""Red Dragon"", another film version of the source novel for ""Manhunter"". Some people tend to prefer ""Manhunter"" and consider it superior; this viewer merely prefers to think that they each have their own heavy assets. Nine out of 10.",

This is a story of a young FBI Trainee, for lack of a better term, brought on board and investigation into the kidnapping and murder of women. Agent Starling, played here flawlessly by Jodi Foster, is a psyche major. She is asked to talk to a notorious serial murderer name Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal the cannibal, played by the Great Hopkins. It is hoped that Lecter can shed some light on who is perpetrating the murders, as his latest kidnapped victim is a senator's daughter. Foster and Hopkins are excellent together, and the story is solid. It does keep you wondering through the end if Buffalo Bill, the serial killer's nickname, will get caught.

As the film develops, a charming kind of standoff occurs. The FBI agent begins to see some humanity in this monster. She needs him, but she needs to trust him first. There are the scenes with the mask and the biting off of noses and other violence, but these show that he is in many ways a cunning beast. He is also a genius. As the profiling goes on, more and more layers of the mystery are cleared and the quarry knows the quarry. Hannibal Lecter is a celebrity brutalizer, and, of course, a cannibal.

Despite what Hannibal Lector said about that and director Jonathan Demme's trying to explain it it's remained an inaccurate and negative stereotype . I think the interaction between Clarice and Hannibal are a mixed bag but it seems to be an effort to control and manipulate Clarice. Clarice allows herself to be vulnerable around Hannibal probably because she suspects he will see through anything different. I don't ultimately know if he was that helpful more like he was helping himself all along but that should probably be obvious. Clarice does piece it together more or less on her own to where the killer is and solves it before the other agents have a full picture.",

The incredibly disciplined way in which the film restrains its two most flamboyant aspects - those being the serial killers Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill - to always maintain the perspective of its rookie FBI protagonist as she navigates her way through her newfound world of silver-tongued devils and elusive monsters is both impressive and necessary in elevating the piece above what could've been simple shock value. The feature is gripping right from its opening moments and always maintains a tight grip on its psychologically complex characters who remain fully rounded no matter on which side of sociopathy - or the law - they sit. Thanks to a mature treatment of its audience, it never feels as though it is pandering or dumbing itself down, rather elevating the viewer to its own level of intelligence. The picture also knows when to pull back on the reigns too, making for an experience far more cerebral than visceral; this is something perhaps unexpected from a thriller where a serial-killing cannibal is, for all intents and purposes, one of the 'good guys'. 8/10.",

This serial killer thriller concerns the efforts of an FBI agent in training who proves instrumental in cracking a case that nobody could have solved without her help. The daughter of a small-time cop, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster of ""Taxi Driver"") is minding her own business at Quantico, Virginia, negotiating an obstacle course when the FBI Chief of Behavioral Sciences, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn of ""Sucker Punch"") summons her for an interview. Crawford wants Clarice to visit convicted murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector where he has been imprisoned for eight years. In fact, Lector hasn't laid eyes on a woman for eight years. The warden in charge of Lector's incarnation is a conceited egotist, Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald of ""Red Dragon""), who makes a pass at her and fails. Before he allows Clarice to speak with Hannibal, Chilton shows her a photo of what happened to a nurse that Lector gnawed on. The nurse is permanently disfigured as a result of Lector's attack. Lector is now kept in a cell with a reinforced glass window and stone walls. Dr. Chilton is prepared to escort Clarice into Lector's presence, but she convinces him that Lector may clam up at the sight of Chilton. Rudely, Chilton dismisses himself and turns Clarice over to Barney. Barney (Frankie Faison of ""Hannibal"") provides Clarice with a chair and she and Lector talk briefly. Lector isn't the only unsavory soul in the prison. In what amounts to an infamous death row of sorts, other perverts are housed in the same area. One of them, Miggs, make a derogatory comment to Clarice about her body odor, and Lector later kills Miggs. Meantime, Clarice entices Lector to talk about Buffalo Bill. Bill is a serial killer who has slain five women. These women are a little bigger than the average. In Memphis, we watch as the killer, Jame Gumb (Ted Levine of ""Heat"") abducts a girl when he is struggling to load a sofa into his van. Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) backs into the rear of the van and Gumb traps her and takes her to his house. In the basement of his residence, Gumb has a pit where he holds Catherine. Meantime, Lector provides Catherine's mother with information and he is moved to another facility. During his sojourn at the new facility, Lector fakes off the guards, kills them, and manages to escape. Lector's escape is pretty incredible. By this time, Clarice believes that she has found a clue. Crawford warns her that they have found the killer. Clarice continues with her part of the investigation and stumbles onto Gumb living in the residence where she thought she would find somebody else. Clarice narrowly survives a suspenseful moment when Gumb extinguishes the lights and uses night-vision goggles to overpower her. Clarice cannot see but she can hear and she shoots at the sound of a revolver being cocked. She empties her gun into Gumb and he dies. In other words, he doesn't jump up a few moments later. ""Silence of the Lambs"" concludes with Clarice graduating from the FBI Academy. Well-made, well-acted, ""Silence"" is top-notch material.",

He looked much younger (because he is). I especially enjoyed the scenes with Ted Levine who plays Buffalo Bill, the serial madman that Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to find. I heard on some documentary and on the IMDb trivia page that Buffalo Bill was a combination of three real life killers. Ed Gein, Bundy and some other guy. I also heard that Jodie Foster was creeped out by the making of this film. Which is probably why she chose not to do the sequel, HANNIBAL. The film creates an eerie and chilling mood all by itself. It lets us know that something this sick and twisted has actually happened. All the performances in this film were great. Just about everyone I know has seen this movie.

82,15 October 2021,nickenchuggets,9," ""...Or else it gets the hose again""","If I had to pick a relatively recent movie that gets mistaken for something it's not more times than any other, I would probably choose this one. Even though Silence of the Lambs is frequently labeled as a horror film, I don't think this is entirely correct. Don't get me wrong, there's still several disturbing parts throughout it and the story itself is unsettling, but to me, this more closely resembles a crime movie with horror elements in the background. Probably the biggest reason this is mostly called a horror movie is because if you count it as such, it is the only horror film to ever win an oscar for best picture. The Exorcist and Jaws were nominated, but never won. Despite my comments on how this is more of a crime/drama film than horror, the horror element becomes apparent almost immediately because of one of the characters featured. The story follows a rookie working for the FBI named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is encountering much difficulty trying to find a serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill who has been abducting women and flaying their corpses. Clarice seems to understand that trying to comprehend the mind of a psychopath is like learning to tie a knot: you have to know how to tie one to untie it. If she can find a (less maniacal) serial killer and interview him, she might find out how Buffalo Bill's thought process works and predict where he'll show up next. To this end, Clarice is tasked with visiting the infamous Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a bloodthirsty madman who was once respected in the field of psychiatry. Now, he's a crazed murderer who eats other human beings. What makes Lecter so disturbing is how non-threatening he appears to be. He doesn't resemble a killer at all, at least not externally. He speaks in a very calm and patient manner with Clarice while discussing how to find Bill. After Clarice leaves Hecter's cell block, she's on the search for more evidence. Soon, a corpse of a young woman is found with several lacerations and skin mutilations indicative of Buffalo Bill's crimes. Strangely, a moth cocoon is found in her esophagus. Later on, we see how a seemingly innocent man acting too innocently for his own good asks a girl named Catherine (a senator's daughter) to help him place a heavy piece of furniture in the rear of his van. As she steps into the vehicle to make loading it easier, the guy (later shown to be Bill) assaults her and locks her inside. As she's driven to an unknown location, Clarice gets new orders to pressure Lecter into giving up more information on Buffalo Bill. As bait, she is told to tell him that he will be switched to a new prison if he complies. Lecter rejects the offer and will only give up the details if Clarice gives up secretive information about her own life. Lecter is moved to a cell in Tennessee where he tells the mother of the kidnapped Catherine that Bill's real name is Louis, but it's all nonsense. Clarice meets with Lecter again, who gives her a dossier on Bill. This time, the trust she puts in him does actually pay off and provide details, but Lecter has other ideas. The same day he meets with Clarice, he kills and mutilates his cell guards and then escapes via an ambulance after he switches costumes with a cop the paramedics thought was dead. Now that Lecter is free, Clarice is starting to feel the pressure even more. She eventually tracks Bill down to a house in Ohio after discovering his real name is Jame Gumb. At first, he seems like a stable, moderate person who has nothing wrong with him, but his body language obviously shows he's hiding something. A very awkward dialogue between him and Clarice follows, in which she determines he is Buffalo Bill after spotting a moth identical to the one placed in the mouth of the murdered woman from earlier. After a gunfight taking place in a huge and dark basement, Clarice kills Jame and discovers Catherine, who has been imprisoned in a large hole the entire time. Back at the FBI base, Clarice receives a celebration for her efforts, but one last ominous thing happens to her. Lecter calls her from a remote location, and says he's not going to bother killing her even though he's able to because the world is more interesting with her in it. He also hopes she'll leave him alone too, but Clarice can't comply with that. Lecter hangs up once he declares ""he's having a friend for dinner."" Movies like this make me realize how you don't need special effects or mindless action to make a compelling experience. What Silence of the Lambs does well is build tension. The audience is already aware of the fact that Lecter is a monster who deserves to be executed, but Clarice has no choice but to trust him so that she can stop another killer (the enemy of my enemy is my friend). Speaking of Lecter, Anthony Hopkins is the one who carries most of the movie. Despite only appearing for a combined time of around 24 minutes, he's so creepy you can't take your eyes off him. The reasons for this are obvious. Lecter may be a fictional character, but people like him do exist. The most terrifying murderers are the ones who don't feel the need to raise their voices, and he nails this performance. He's also not to be underestimated. You might think that a person with such a violent and grisly past must not be very intelligent, but Lecter is a highly adept and imposing man. He understands perfectly well what methods the cops are going to use to track him down, because he used to study the human mind. Jodie Foster as Clarice is obviously the person we are made to cheer for, as she is risking her life to track down a vicious killer as well as dealing with another madman who can end her life if he felt like it. So as you might expect, the acting in this movie is all good. Even George Romero makes an appearance after Lecter is transferred. Even though I like this movie, I have seen many saying it is overrated. That I can entirely understand. Many people don't think the performances of the two leading actors were oscar-worthy, even though acting well is a very hard thing to do. Lecter doesn't even appear that much in the movie but ended up being the most iconic thing about it. People who watched this soon found out why.",

Although he hasn't cooperated since his arrest and conviction for several grisly murders, a former psychiatrist named ""Dr. Hannibal Lector"" (Anthony Hopkins) is persuaded to do so by a young FBI agent-in-training named ""Clarice Starling"" (Jodie Foster). But with time on his side any assistance he gives will come at a very high price. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fascinating movie from start to finish with Academy Award winning performances rendered by both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.

Female victims are found skinned by Buffalo Bill and Hannibal Lector is believed to be able to identify him but every agent who has approached his realm of confinement has been led astray. The Senator's daughter is kidnapped so a female F.B.I. trainee is issued in hopes that Lector will give in to a female. We learn about her through Lector's ability to trespass the mind. Shocking thriller directed by Jonathan Demme who also made Melvin and Howard. Anthony Hopkins brilliantly demonstrates Lector's sly methods of penetrating the mind. He delights in toying with victims, which is why his brutal escape occurred. Jodie Foster is excellent as the young trainee haunted by her father's death. She is intelligent and brave particularly when dealing with Bill in the shocking climax. Ted Levine is monstrous as Buffalo Bill whose one breaking point arrives when the Senator's daughter gets hold of his dog. Scott Glenn is standard as the agent in charge of the case but instrumental at a wrong address. Diane Baker plays a Senator whose daughter is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. Penetrating thriller will shock your nerves and silence your senses. Score: 9 ½ / 10",

The casting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as the evil Dr. Hannibal Lector was a perfect choice and he won an Academy Award for his 16 minutes of airtime. Jodie Foster deserved her second Academy Award for Best Leading Actress in this film. Jodie's Clarice Starling is perhaps one of the best female heroine roles of all time. I enjoyed watching this film again on AMC with tidbits of information on the bottom of the screen about the film-making. I would have like to have seen more Diane Baker on screen. I would have like to have known more about Dr. Lector's past too. The film always packs a punch when you least expect it at the end of the film.

92,14 June 2016,avik-basu1889,9, An iconic thriller !!!,"Directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Ted Tally, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. One of the first themes that one can notice while watching the film is the element of feminism. This film has feminism and feminist ideals written all over it. What makes this work is that Demme in collaboration with Tally conveys these feminist ideas through visual filmmaking and frame compositions instead of blatant verbal delivery. The opening of the film itself is an example of this. This opening credits sequence which apparently was something Jodie Foster came up with starts with the image of barren, dry, leafless trees in a deserted foggy forest. Then Clarice appears out of this fog and we follow her as she runs and overcomes one obstacle after another on her own. This is visual storytelling at its best. The foggy, deserted, barren forest is what society can sometimes look like from a female perspective. Then we see this woman appear and face and overcome hurdles and obstacles alone and showcase her capabilities. Another great frame is that of Clarice getting dwarfed in the elevator by the big burly men standing alongside her. Clarice Sterling is an iconic female hero, but not in the clichéd sense of the word. She is strong, intelligent and idealistic. But she is still given the chance to have a sense of fear and be vulnerable which actually makes her real and very inspirational.",

In fact, horror can stem from many different aspects, one of them being psychological, which is the subgenre that the film caters to.

Hopkins steals the show, of course, and his Oscar is well-deserved despite it being the shortest performance for a winning lead actor; Foster provides a nice contrast to him, and is also deserving of the acclaim. The scenes between Lecter and Clarice are so exceptionally done that it's nearly a shame when the focus shifts from him to Buffalo Bill, but an underrated performance by Ted Levine makes the climax just a thrilling. The scene where Lecter escapes is one of my all-time favourite cinematic moments, not just because of the gore, but because of the pure horror that is developed without any supernatural elements.",

The foundations of this cinematic milestone couldn't have been better, of course, with Thomas Harris' intriguing characterizations and basic story-idea (the efficiency was already proved in 1986, with ""Manhunter"") but really a lot of the film's brilliance is added by the Jonathan Demme and his outstanding cast. Despite not having directed a lot of horror/thriller films before this, Demme's knowledge of the genres is impressive and he terrifically manages to bring a constant level of tension without ever resorting to graphic violence or explicit gore. And that's quite an accomplishment because, primarily, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" handles about a sadistic serial killer, who eats his victims, who's recruited to assist in catching another sadistic serial killer, who skins his victims! Young FBI-trainee Clarice Starling is sent to Dr. Hannibal Lector's isolated prison cell to profile the new killer Buffalo Bill.

For whatever reason, especially as a young adult, I had a fascination with crime stories - especially serial killer stories. There's just something inherently fascinating to me about a human who has crossed a sacred line of humanity into great evil. What can we do in the face of it? I know I'm not alone here; the history of cinema and television being filled with crime and murder stories demonstrates many of you are fascinated by it too. So what is it about The Silence of the Lambs that makes it stand out from so many of the other crime stories?

For me, whenever Silence of the Lambs is brought up I instantly think of Dr Hannibal Lecter. This speaks volumes for how much of a powerful and memorable performance he gives as one of the best villains of all time, despite only featuring for around an eighth of the movie. His performance/character is faultless and gives a completely different approach to so many other villains we see in the movies, he is calm, well educated, has an intelligent vocabulary, witty sarcasm and is brutally honest. But on the other hand he is also intriguing, disturbing and very uneasy to watch. The greatest thing about him though is how he is caged off from the world in each of his scenes, like a monster, he isn't accessible and comes across as untouchable. The most baffling thing of all though is that despite Hopkins playing a serial killer cannibal who is criminally deranged, you actually have a strange sense of fondness towards him. At one point I felt myself feeling sorry for him, how is that even possible? Hats off to the creators and Anthony Hopkins for that to give the viewer that feeling, quite the achievement!",
155,8 February 2020,THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,10," Masterpiece, My favorite movie of all-time! ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10","The greatest horror thriller ever made. Jonathan Demme's psychological horror thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a masterclass in creative filmmaking, poignant acting, and striking visual storytelling. Demme directs The Silence of the Lambs with an eye for visual metaphors whether it's FBI agent Clarice Starling, played by the endearing Jodie Foster, standing meekly as a short female FBI student among her tall male co-workers. Demme keeps you gripped by showing you crime evidence photos, realistic corpses of victims, cuts to the killer's activities, and showing consultations with an infamous cannibal doctor. Demme's direction is intriguing with a constant unnerving representation of killers or their victims. You are forced to follow Starling's investigation into the brutal killings of a madman named Buffalo Bill. It's a creative cinema masterpiece as it remains always entertaining and genuinely chilling. Howard Shore's score is unsettling with subtle eerie melodies and soaring scary themes rushing around the gruesome crimes herein. Shore composes memorable music for The Silence of the Lambs that continues to frighten any audience that dares to view this classic movie. Notably, Jodie Foster gives her arguably her greatest performance in The Silence of the Lambs, and she was in Taxi Driver! Foster brings a sincere warmth, sympathetic trauma, inspiring gusto, and engaging intelligence to her role as Clarice Starling. She's an ambitious and cool FBI woman with top ranking in her class and a desire to become a real FBI agent. I love how Foster depicts the investigative process as serious and rational, especially in the face of crazy, seemingly random killings. Foster finds Clarice's earnest approach to communicating with a flesh craving cannibal and brings Clarice a clarity of conscious and morality that is fascinating in every scene. I appreciate Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs more with each viewing of Jonathan Demme's iconic film. Of course, most remember Sir Anthony Hopkins in his groundbreaking performance as serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter also known as Hannibal the Cannibal. Hopkins never blinks to throw you off balance in his imposing staring portrayal is simply marvelously creepy. Hopkins boasts a frightening stocky stature and suddenly violent physicality to his Hannibal that makes his Lecter even scarier than Brian Cox's archetypal portrayal back in Michael Mann's Manhunter. Hopkins plays the psychological torture by the doctor's words toying with Clarice to perfection. He is curious and cruel with malicious intent and shocking again and again. Hopkins will never not scare me anytime I see him as Hannibal Lecter. I should mention Scott Glenn is great as the FBI head Jack Crawford. His accidental sexism is beautifully portrayed by the nuanced Glenn. He is steadfast as a lawman, but always belittles Clarice, while encouraging her work. It's an interesting bit of acting and writing for an interesting character. Anthony Heald is so slimy and creepy and the sadistic narcissist Dr. Frederick Chilton. Last, but surely not least, Ted Levine is absolutely terrifying as the serial killer Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. His feminine body language, effeminate voice, lithe appearance, brutal physicality, crafty killing, and playful attitude all culminate in the vicious atrocity of Buffalo Bill's character. Levine plays up the fact that Bill thinks he's a transsexual so well that you are fearful of his sudden changes in personality and masculinity. He embodies both masculine and feminine traits, thus creating a nebulous figure in Buffalo Bill. His character can be anyone and that's what makes him so scary. Levine's acting during the ""tuck"" scene as well as while meeting Clarice is just wonderful acting. Ted Levine is more versatile than I feel critics and audiences are willing to give him credit for as Levine is every bit a monstrous and scary as Hopkins' Hannibal. Overall, The Silence of the Lambs demands to be seen and will haunt you forever after witnessing all its glorious filmmaking and stunning crime.",

157,18 June 2008,axlrhodes,10, Possibly the best film of the 90's?,"Looking back at the 90's,some of the best films I saw in that era were very dark and sinister films that tapped into our fear factor and while compelling us also terrified us.Silence Of The Lambs and Se7en were both mainstream pictures that held aloft a very bleak vision but managed to garner massive public appeal as well as critical acclaim.Lambs will be best remembered for the scintillating performance provided by Anthony Hopkins but there really is a lot more to it than that.The film is alive with evil,it is a sinister and deeply disturbing film that gets under the skin, quite literally, and keeps the tension wound tight until the final act.Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice Starling displaying vulnerability and balls in equal measure, the follow up film should have never been made without her.Director Jonathan Demme didn't go on to make a film anywhere near as compelling as this,sure the film is driven by Hopkins' performance but Demme also gets the best out of Ted Levine and Foster as well managing to maintain the tension to tremendous effect throughout.In summary Silence Of The Lambs is a brilliant book to film adaptation that encapsulates everything that was great about the book and builds upon it. 10/10",

159,13 May 2016,PredragReviews,9, I've learned to appreciate fava beans!,"Johnathon Demme's The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is perhaps an anomaly - it's not your average slasher horror film or predictable thriller, which have come to dominant the genre. The haunting performances and psychological interaction between the characters, coupled with the presence of a strong female character, makes for an eerie production that brings raw emotion into the thriller genre. The plot is undoubtedly intense and well-written. However, it's not so much the story-line as the performances of the actors that make Silence a must-see. Hopkins' control and almost monotone high-pitched voice takes sadistic lines to a whole new level. His gaze brought shivers down my spine as he delves into Clarice's psyche. But Clarice can hold her own against the former psychiatrist. Foster plays her character as young and innocent, but not to a fault. She uses Clarice's naivety and lack of experience as an advantage to stand up to Lector, which he, in turn, finds admirable.",

163,22 October 1998,witch king,10, This movie takes a real bite out of you!,"The normal human being's fear of being attacked, bitten open in a violently impersonal manner and then taken in as food is as old as the first human being's shattering witness of such a primordial act. In the thousands of years of human evolution, intelligence has armored [most of us] against predations of that horrible sort. But even more incomprehensible is an attack, for mere hunger's sake, by one human being upon another! When first we see Dr. Hannibal Lecter, his madness is merely the subject of comment, responsible or otherwise. As we view him [uncomfortably] from the safety of a theatre seat, we can only imagine the deep wells of need which forced him to savage his fellow human beings in this manner, and this makes all the more terrible the awful scene in the Memphis courthouse. Into all this walks Clarice Starling, her innocence and anxiety both touching and troubling. She is essentially tricked into taking the assignment to ""interview"" Lecter by her superior, Jack Crawford, who callously deems her expendable. She somehow summons the rural courage of her youth, forged from the furnace of her weary sufferings, and becomes the blank sheet for both Crawford's and Lecter's amusement. As the result of being pulled in opposite directions in the murderous tug-of-war between Lecter and Crawford, Starling is almost totally alone in the film. In spite of her genuine liking for Aredlia Mapp, Starling's isolation is nearly so complete as to be claustrophobic. Director Jonathan Demme's finely-nuanced work here is well served. Her enlightenment takes place primarily in darkness, whether the setting is Lecter's cell in the dungeon, or whether the apotheosis takes place in the demon's lair. There are almost no likeable characters in the film save Starling. This makes it easy to root for her to overcome the furies which have pursued her since her tenth year. Clarice's predatory instincts are to bring a vicious psychopath within the scope of punishment. In sharp contrast, the other main characters in the film are possessed of predatory natures of a baser, more primitive kind, whether it is Dr. Frederick Chilton's need for sex, or Crawford's need for control, or Lecter's need to destroy for pleasure. The music score by Howard Shore is reminiscent, in a eerie way, of Bernard Herrmann's work in Psycho. Shore's opening theme foreshadows the loneliness and desperation of Starling's dual quest, which is to kill both beasts: the one without and the one within.",

Anthony Hopkins is just wild in his Academy Award winning performance. I find it amazing that I was getting chills up my spine just from watching him play Lecter. This is the best of his Lecter performances, as the other movies (that would be Hannibal and Red Dragon (though they were okay) lack the dramatical oomph so prevalent in this one.

187,10 September 1999,punctate,10, The best thriller of the 90's.,"This movie is probably my favorite thriller of all time. The silence of the lambs is the only horror / thriller to win an Academy award for best picture. It also won for best director, best actor for both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Buffalo Bill is murdering and skinny women across the country. Clarice Starling a student is sent to interview Dr. Hannibal Lector in hope that they will be able to create a profile for Buffalo Bill. Dr. Lector is called Hannibal the cannibal you can pretty much guess what he did. Dr. Lector keeps giving Starling clues in an exchange for answering his questions about her childhood. Anthony Hopkins performance stuns me every time it's simply brilliant. Scott Glen performance as the psychopath who wants to be a transvestite was bravo as well. Jodie Foster received an Academy award for her excellent performance as well. The scene when Jack is watching Clarice as she goes through the house is chilling. The story is strong and compelling with a stunning score. The movie is shocking, frightening and even disturbing with its subject matter. 10/10 The best thriller of the 90's.",
188,11 May 2013,patherwill,10, One of my Top Twenty Ever Movies!,"Over 20 years after I first saw this film I have now decided to put 'pen to paper' so to speak and praise what I think is one of the most gripping murder movies made, with a host of actors from Jodie Foster, Scott Glenn,Anthony Heald, Ted Levine - who was a relative newcomer then - and of course Anthony Hopkins firmly at the top of their game. Everyone knows the story by now of how Clarice Starling(Foster) has not yet passed-out of the FBIs famous academy at Quantico when and where she is under the close supervision of one of its chiefs Jack Crawford(Glenn)and they are on the hunt for a serial-killer 'Buffalo Bill'. They or perhaps SHE seeks the assistance of Dr.Hannibal Lekter, a brilliant but disturbed criminal killer himself and she has intimate talks with him in his cell to garner information she hopes will help find 'Bill' before he kills more innocent young women in his most deranged and brutal way mutilating them. The only criticism I saw throughout the film was the plausibility of the situation Foster finds herself in towards the very end and whether that would be possible? I don't know - I 'm NOT in the FBI and having read the 'Trivia' I think this has been explained. Other than that, a brilliant film that just keeps delivering and when I saw it recently on Spanish TV for about the 5th time it was just as good as when I first saw it and there are very few films that you can say THAT about!",

While there were certainly other iconic horror films at the time such as The Sixth Sense and Scream, the one thing The Silence of the Lambs did that those films didn't, was win the Oscar for Best Picture. Not only that, but it also won for Best Actor for Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress for Jodie Foster, Best Adapted Screenplay for Ted Tally, and Best Director for Jonathan Demme. It also became the fourth highest-grossing film of 1991. So with all that, you expect something special, right? Well, is it? Let's take a look, shall we?",

Demme's use of close-ups are there to put you in the face of the horror that is serial killing. Hopkins performance is a stand-out one, although I didn't care for Jodie Foster's performance much at all. Foster's southern accent sounded forced and slurry. This film is tight though and at 118 minutes it never seems to be long or drawn out. There are many scenes in this film you will never forget and many more that you will try to forget for a lifetime.",

The villain is legitimately creepy and scary, and every scene and sequence with Hannibal and Buffalo Bill are particularly evil.

It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself.

Soon another body is discovered then Buffalo Bill kidnaps another victim; this time the daughter of a US Senator; with the clock ticking before he kills her the FBI offer Lector a deal; unfortunately the doctor in charge of the facility housing Lector tells him the deal isn't real he then arranges another deal and Lector is transferred to Tennessee.

The same elecrifying thrill and fear you feel every time the shark approaches is mirrored by a terrifying monster in this film, one that also eats people - Dr Hannibal Lector. The popularity of this film was such that I knew the plot when  I was ten in 1991, although I only saw it about a month ago. I will usually never watch films that are disgusting, and I didn't really want to watch this. But rather than being a disgusting horror, it turned out to be a psychological thriller of the highest order. The movie is amazing. It presents a gritty, realistic world like that of a documentary, with no typical Hollywood cliches whatsoever. That way we don't know what to expect. The actors are actors first and stars second, and the two central performances are simply superb. Hopkins is so effective in his role, you could easily believe Hannibal Lector really exists.

As he helps to solve Buffalo Bill case, he digs deep into Clarice's hidden psyche. Every technical aspects of the film are just immaculate & gives you thrill feel from the beginning to end. It's waste of words if I say much about the performances since the film swept the Oscars, winning Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Director (Jonathan Demme), Best Picture, & Best Adapted Screenplay (Ted Tally). This is the third film who won Oscars in all 5 major categories; the other two were- 'It happened one night' & 'One flew over cuckoo's nest'. Hopkins won the Best Actor despite being in the film for about 30 minutes, may be the shortest screen appearance for any best actor winner & that itself proves that Anthony Hopkins has delivered his best in it.

Even the character of Buffalo Bill is very much creepy but Lekter wins for me. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal has delivered a stunning performance. Jodie Foster has also done a good job. The psycho-thriller theme is well established throughout the movie. Its creepy in a sense. The movie is nearly perfect in every aspect.

The conversation's between Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) must be some of the best dialogue I've ever heard. It keeps you constantly on your toes. The jostling for superiority of the conversation is brilliant-It almost feels like a game of chess.
The cinematography is haunting at times. It utilises the narrow shot to perfection, this is perfect for when Lecter is talking to Starling. The narrow shots here make a sense of claustrophobia, implying that Starling is frightened and does not really want to be there.
The performance across the board are sublime however Hopkins' and Foster's are unbeatable. Anthony Hopkins portrays Hannibal Lecter as the genius yet disturbed man he is, he does this so well that just from body language alone it feels intolerable to be with him. Foster's Clarice shows a beautiful development from a person scared of Hannibal Lecter even from behind glass to a woman going toe to toe with buffalo Bill.

For the 90s it may have been unique and freaky, but i really couldn't attain what all the constant hype is about, yes there are some tense moments here and there but Lecters character is really inconsistently acted out for half of his screen time. Don't really believe in being pretentious in this context but if you payed attention to Lecters dialogue you would see one moment he is a to the core amoral being who does not feel one iota of sympathy for humanity and the next he is interested in some rookie FBI agents childhood and not to mention infatuated enough to create art pieces of her, excuse me if i am mistaken but this is a chronic sociopath who eats humans. I don't know if you've watched interviews with psychopaths or insane persons but i can assure you none of them behave the way Lecter does and please spare me the ""but that's what makes him so different and ""good"" "". The writers who came up with Lecters lines got way too artsy by letting their creative exhibition blanket the brutal reality the character was meant to portray. Lecter was intriguing and enigmatic for the first few minutes of his appearance but his mysteriousness and guise got completely obliterated as the writers gave too much away too quickly leaving nothing to further entice the viewer on the central character. Other major detractors regarding Lecter included the scene where he escapes a HIGH SECURITY complex SURROUNDED by ARMED and TRAINED personal which was supposedly ""blocked off for 10 block"" or something along those lines, keep in mind that Lecter had been locked in a cell for 8 years straight, talk about muscle atrophy right? the man suddenly had the strength to scale fences and walls while avoiding only a couple dozen patrols...",

237,29 August 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Good, but inferior to Se7en","Hannibal Lecter. The name that will spark interest, gain recognition, and most likely send a chill down your spine. He's one of the most interesting and well-known fictional serial killers, and this is probably the movie that manages to do him most justice. Anthony Hopkins as the serial killer, psychiatrist and cannibal was a great casting decision. He definitely performed the role as perfectly as it could be done. However, when it comes to the overall quality of the film, it just doesn't entirely measure up. The plot is good, and evolves at a pretty good pace; however, I couldn't manage to sit through the entire thing... I only barely made it, half-attentive, through the first 45 minutes. I couldn't even sit through more than 3/8's of the movie, let alone the whole thing. Now, this may be because I've seen it many times in the past years, but usually, when I can't sit through a movie because I have seen it before, it's due to my remembering most of the key parts of the movie, and not being surprised by it... but not this movie; I can say, in entire honesty, that I didn't remember or even recognize any of the film, despite having seen it plenty of times before, about one time a year. If I remember anything from a movie, that I haven't seen for a long time, it's because it had an impact on me; for example, I still haven't forgotten the twist of the famous Hitchcock horror-thriller, Vertigo, despite the fact that I've seen it once, and that was about five years ago. Nothing in this movie had an impact on me, nothing affected me deeply. Maybe I'm hard to impress, maybe I am too hardened by worse films... but still. The film involves sick and disturbing characters and actions; it should have an impact on the viewer. Maybe I'm not smart enough to get it; maybe I keep expecting the film to be very different from what it was... I don't know. I just didn't find this film as good as it has been made out to be. The acting is very good; Hopkins nails the role of Lecter perfectly. Foster is good, too. Both portray their roles convincingly, and make their characters and their actions credible. The characters are well-written, credible and, well, colorful. Buffalo Bill makes a great villain, very psychotic and disturbing. Levine also gives a very good performance. All in all, a pretty good horror-thriller, but inferior to Se7en(arguably the best of the genre), and only enjoyable for people who can appreciate the psychological aspects of the film(which I guess I can't). I recommend it exclusively to people who can enjoy a very psychological thriller-horror piece. 8/10",

242,30 January 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Definitely one of the best thrillers of all time.,"I'm normally not one to spend much time concerning myself with who won what Oscar and who didn't win that Oscar, but if anyone but Anthony Hopkins had been awarded the Best Actor Oscar in 1991 I would have been bitterly disappointed. In my opinion, Hopkins' performance as the deceptively charming Hannibal Lecter is one of the best performances ever caught on film. Especially if you have read the novel by Thomas Harris, Hopkins flawlessly captures all sides of the tremendously complex personality of Hannibal Lecter, providing for one of the main things that made The Silence of the Lambs such a spectacular film.

245,14 October 2016,cdjh-81125,10, A Chilling Masterpiece,"The Silence of The Lambs is one of my all time favourite movies which surprises me because I am very much not a horror movie fan but I adore this movie it just does everything right not just in terms of a thriller but as a movie as well. Probably the most iconic thing about this movie is the characters and every character has something interesting about them whether it be an unhinged serial killer that has nothing else to lose or a young FBI agent trying to find her way in the world and the latter is what makes Clarice Starling such an excellent protagonist she gives the audience something to relate to in this film and Jodie Foster is absolutely amazing in this film she perfectly captures her characters wit, innocence and fear and is never anything less than convincing. But in the end it was Anthony Hopkins incredible turn as iconic serial killer Hannibal Lector that truly stole this movie. The film takes its time to build up Lecter as an antagonist so that when he isn't on screen were dying for him to return and makes Hopkins performance all the more terrifying. Make no mistake this movie is not for the faint of heart it has a lot of blood, guts and gore but all the violence serves a purpose it allows us to get sucked into this world and know just how much theses characters mean business. While Hannibal Lector is An Antagonist in this film he isn't the main one the main focus of this film is the Hunt for deranged serial killer Buffalo Bill. Not only is the mystery and hunt for him just incredibly interesting to watch but it makes the film an entertaining one its not just a compilation of death scenes it's what gives this movie it's rewatch value along with the scenes where Starling and Lector just talk. We learn so much about these two people in these scenes not just thought exposition but by the way they act towards one and other revealing both of their insecurities. ",
246,28 October 2008,jzappa,10," An Artistically Complex, Penetratingly Intimate Drama Leaning Towards the Thriller Genre","Broodingly, intimately and truthfully shot, quietly edited, with a gloomy orchestral score and a richly commanding cast everywhere from Hopkins and Foster's obvious milestones to Scott Glenn and Ted Levine, this artistically complex, penetratingly intimate movie is a masterpiece in all departments. I do not categorize it as a horror film. Maybe a suspense thriller, because whenever I watch it, I view it as such, but the reason it is so compelling is because it is not genre-specific. Yes, it is scary, it is suspenseful, especially in its heart-exploding climax, and our fear of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is established as soon as he appears for the first time, as FBI cadet Clarice Starling reticently passes the maximum security cells of clearly demented ward occupants, and director Jonathan Demme cuts to her point of view as she arrives at Hannibal's cell at the end of the dank corridor, and he is awaiting her already, standing with perfect posture, a pleasant, polite look on his face. His speaking voice has the care of a man having transcended the common cognizance that he can hardly be concerned to speak to the slack acumen of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie, affording fear to scenes that do not even have to do with him.",

There is nothing that can take your breath away with so much style and wit like Silence of the Lambs does. You'll need to watch this film in order to understand how thrillers are created and executed.",
248,16 September 2006,GOWBTW,10, Suspenseful and classy at the same time!,"This has everything it can give. The cast of the movie are anything but ordinary, and the plot is well made through and through. Jodie Foster does a spectacular job playing the role of Clarice Starling, a tough rookie FBI Agent. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as the clever, but sinister mass-murderer Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. She goes to where Lecter(Hopkins) was being held. To me I get the chills being around that guy. But as the old saying goes, ""to get a killer, to find a killer."" That other killer is ""Buffalo Bill""(Ted Levine), a Ed Geine-like killer who kidnapping and killing young women. Unlike Geine, he didn't eat his victims like Lecter. Trusting a killer like Lecter can be bone-chilling, but as long as a trust issue isn't a problem, they can work together. I like the scene where Lecter was in this round cage, and when he called out Clarice to get her papers, he strokes her hand with his finger. Some may call this scene nerve-racking, to me it's a flirt. He trusts Clarice, and I bet she does the same too. Hmmm! Then after that, he gets his dinner, he killed those two guards. He got the liver of the tougher one. Must tastes like foie gras. (HEH HEH!) And he wears the face of the other, another Ed Geine-like action. There's plenty to see in that movie, the moths, the booby traps, and the chilling climax this movie got. It didn't lack anything there! A Neo-classic! 5 stars!",

Whenever this movie is mentioned among people, they ALWAYS say it's incredibly scary. No one can sleep after watching it, and that's why I was so intrigued to watch it. I was a bit nervous while watching Silence because everyone made such a big deal about how scary it was. While watching it, I realized Silence is an incredibly action filled movie. It is done so well, the acting is perfect and the way everything turns out is amazing. I have to say that I didn't find it very scary ONLY because I had seen Hannibal before Silence. However, the ending is very, very intense, and I can see why people say it's scary. Also, just the fact what Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill do is scary enough. It's scary and not a movie to be seen alone on a rainy Friday night, it is a movie to see though because it is very well done.",

262,17 June 2019,dworldeater,10, Untouchable,"The Silence Of The Lambs is a riveting psychological thriller that gets in your head and under your skin. The film is done really well and the story is engrossing and both the motivations of the killer and law enforcement are explored and understood. Anthony Hopkins brings it big time with an iconic performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter which won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. The film won multi academy awards that year, which also had Jodie Foster walk away with a gold statue as well with her best performance ever as FBI agent/trainee Clarice Starling. Scott Glenn and Ted Levine are strong support for this very dark and suspenseful film. Director Jonathan Demme made a remarkable film that has no equal until Seven comes out. There is no doubt that The Silence Of The Lambs would be influential to Seven and many other films and for what it is, it is flawless. The sequel Hannibal however is not nearly as good, but this is mandatory viewing for anyone that wants to be movie literate, The Silence Of The Lambs is a must see.",
263,12 June 1999,eeq,9, Excellent as high level psychological drama (but the book is better),"All right you guys.  It's simply not appropriate to compare Silence of the Lambs with its 'prequel' Manhunter (Red Dragon). SOTL is a high level psychological drama targeted for the big audiences with top actors--with minimal procedurals. Manhunter is more of a procedural with attempts at psychology and targeted at a different (and smaller) audience with a virtually no-name cast.  Each does its job very well, but its really unfair to compare the 2.  After not getting to play Hannibal the cannibal in SOTL, I am glad to see Brian Cox getting other juicy (albeit smaller) roles, usually as the villain, in other action/suspense movies.  As far as the novels go, Red Dragon is better written, but SOTL has a superior (virtually perfect) ending.",

266,6 October 1999,saffron-3,2, This must be the most overrated movie in Hollywood history,"This film has a silly premise, a lousy script, an implausibility factor of about +100 and a dreadful performance by Anthony Hopkins.  It's the last point that I'll mention about first:  has a more pretentious, breathy performance ever been seen on film before (outside of the Richard Burton oeuvre)?  As for plausibility:  can you imagine the FBI sending a trainee to interview a serial killer, seeking information about another serial killer on the loose?  That was a major flaw in the (also overrated) novel.  I guess it's easier to write about, or make a movie with, a younger woman who's still apt to get all scared-ified and emotional and who doesn't have those annoying crows-feet.  The script is terrible, too--it tries to present Hannibal Lecter as being some kind of 'psychic vampire'.  Witness Hopkins' expression after Jodie Foster tells him her tale of lamb-napping woe--like a famished person who's just been given a good meal.  Give me a break!  And don't tell me that the FBI couldn't have made a connection between the missing skin pieces on the dead girls' bodies and figured out what the loony-tunes they were chasing was doing.  It takes Jodie Foster's character seeing a dress pattern with darts on it to make the connection.  What a group of dim bulbs.  And they wait until HOW MANY young women are killed before they scratch their heads and say, ""Hmmmm, maybe the killer knew one of the victims!""  How did this stupid waste of celluloid ever garner any critical praise?  I mean, I know the Oscars annually bestow 'Best Motion Picture' awards on undeserving titles, so I don't care that this movie won so many--but what were the nation's film critics thinking when this made so many 'Top 10' lists?",

277,24 April 2009,Jacques98,2," There are many different kinds of cheese. And in this case, mold isn't a good thing.","Ever since I was a little kid, I was obsessed with reading pulp horror. I've read more from the genre than anyone I personally know. Being a soon-to-be-published author myself, I've learned more about the genre by constantly reading than by any writing seminar I've ever been to. For those who don't read, by simple definition, pulp horror is: a story that is genuinely terrifying and thrilling, but purposely lacks any forced literary moral. Stephen King is pretty much the poster-child of this style of writing. With all of that said, when The Silence of the Lambs, the novel, was released and received mass critical acclaim for being the ""perfect"" horror-thriller, even being the major genre-whore that I am, I could really care less. Why? Simple because I'd read so many books EXACTLY like it, I had no interest. A few years later, when the movie was released, I felt the exact same way. This is why I've waited so long to view this ""impossible-to-miss!"" film. Because I knew it was just more of the same. When I finally decided to force myself to watch it, I found my gut instinct was underestimating. The Silence of the Lambs is not only just more of the same unoriginal story that we've all heard so many times that it's second nature to us, it's also cheesy, immature, over-glamorized, and, in the end, completely laughable.

I've been really anxious to see the film after I've heard so many good things about it, and as I sat through the first rather unremarkable half-an-hour, I kept saying to myself: ""Ok, it should get brilliant any time soon now... shouldn't it??"" But it didn't. It wasn't involving, it wasn't chilling or scary or compelling in any way.

Doesn't sound appetizing, but that's pretty much the point. It's a very vile and intense film, it's filled with dark, unnerving scenes that make you feel dirty for watching them. The tension just never goes away, it never gives you a moment to lay back and relax. Anthony Hopkins has surprisingly little screen time, but somehow his uncomfortable presence is always felt. Damn those prison scenes are ominous, downright unpleasant to watch really. Jodie Foster is pretty brilliant too, even with her much-ridiculed Southern accent she still gives a stellar performance. The climax is also everything you expect and more, excellent to say the least. To me this is one of the best and most exciting thrillers ever made.",

They were both notorious upon initial release for their surprising amount of violent and off-putting content that ultimately proved too much for some people and they are both incredible, visionary masterpieces. Demme's film, based on a very good book by Thomas Harris, is not only one of the creepiest films I've ever seen, but it's one of the two or three best horror films I've ever seen.

303,1 October 2015,sharky_55,10, He would consider that rude,"""People will say we're in love,"" jokes Lecter, as he tantalisingly squares up young FBI trainee Clarice Starling in the tense first meeting. The excellence in Demme's direction comes from knowing what to linger on and what to hint at. He milks that first encounter of the two leads to its extremes, leading a young Foster down into the underground cells, past a room flooded in frantic red light (along with strict instruction and warning) and finally along that long corridor. The other prisoners leer and jeer as expected, but arriving at the end is a glass cell and that still and unblinking monster in Lecter. This very first conversation is impeccably shot; they trade blows and tight POVs immerse us into their mind's inner sanctums, and as Clarice's thin facade and accent is shattered by a few choice words, she is pushed off centre, disorientated and vulnerable. The plexiglass walls augment the atmosphere of unnerving intimacy between the unconventional pair. Like several other figures throughout the film, Lecter's male gaze seeps into the frame from front on and in extreme close-up, hungrily eating up Clarice's insecure psyche and exposing the screaming of the lambs in her dreams. Foster plays this part magnificently, not with acts of bravado, but in the nervous addressing of a room full of male police officers questioning her authority, in the low-class accent she tries desperately to mask, and in her sense of honesty and goodness that sets her apart and convinces Lecter to take a liking to her. ""Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?"" We experience this in the rather nervous way her POV is presented to us, gazing absent-mindedly in every new scene, scanning the surroundings, and trying to avoid the sexualising and trivialising gazes of the male dominated law enforcement agency, which she must navigate with self awareness and a casual, tactful disposition despite it evidently worrying her. Lecter's eyes are also fixated intensely, but not on her body. ",

She's thrown into the wolves den and asked to interview an infamous cannibalistic serial killer, Dr Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Little does she know that she was chosen for ulterior motives, nether the less, she manages to extract information by forming a close bond with Dr Lecter - something nobody previously has been able to do. The information she is trying to get should lead to the capture of another serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who has previously cross paths with Dr Lecter. Currently terrorising the eastern states of the US, he's killed five victims and kidnapping the senator's daughter.

Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the second greatest movie villain of all time next to Lord Darth Vader, was so convincing that he more than deserved the Academy Award.  I am glad that he will reprise the role again. Jodie Foster was so good in her role of Clarice Starling that I am glad that she won the Academy Award.  She should come back for a sequel. More praise should go to Ted Levine.  With the exception of the nude shot, he was incredible as Jame Gumb, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill. I think it was interesting how he kept refering to Catherine Martin as `IT' instead of `SHE' OR `HER'.  Very convincing.  As I said before, a sequel is WAY overdue.

Anthony Hopkins steals the show here, even though he is not the serial killer at large.  He manages to be menacing yet charming at the same time, which is often a quality of our most infamous serial killers.  Jonathan Demme did an excellent job directing this move, and rightfully received an Oscar reward for best director.  He kept everything going at just the right pace and allowed enough time for character study to flavor the film further.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" is loaded with memorable scenes; my favorite one is where Jodie Foster has to feel her way around the dark while the killer (wearing night-vision goggles) just toys with her for a while.  Since ""we covet what we see everyday,"" try not to give in to the temptation of seeing ""Silence of the Lambs"" everyday as there is no telling what might happen then...",

Rare is the movie that gets everything right, but ""The Silence of the Lambs"" comes awfully close to providing the perfect example for a modern thriller. It's so disturbing to watch for some people that it's often described as a horror movie, which says more about other films involving serial killing, in my opinion, than it does about this one. We're not used to crime thrillers that actually show killing and its aftermath in gruesome, clinical detail-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. We're not used to films showing us psychopaths of unnerving ferocity-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. Most importantly, we're not used to seeing this kind of story presented in such a matter-of-fact way-- ""The Silence of Lambs"" is never showy in its camera work or its performances. Most crime thrillers don't quite thrill, and certainly don't frighten, because you never quite believe them. You believe ""The Silence of the Lambs"", especially when you wish you didn't.",

Lecter is still behind bars and he is once again called upon to assist in tracking down a disturbed serial killer. This time it is young FBI agent Clarice Starling who is assigned to talk to Lecter and with his information track down Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who kills young women and then skins them. But once again there is only so much trust you can put into a cannibal, and Lecter complicates things while at the same time giving subtle and vague clues to Clarice that might help track down Buffalo Bill.

Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector is something else. There are very few evil characters that you find yourself rooting for, and even despite knowing that he is a sicko mass murderer, you want him to escape from the prison.

Silence of the Lambs is a really good movie they make you care about Clarice Starling and know about her personal life in a really cleaver more realistic way and not her just blurting it out when necessary like you see in other films. Anthony Hopkins gives a performance so chilling and powerful, you want to know what he dose next every time he's on screen, doing this in a very calm and polite manner (most of the time) makes it even more suspenseful. The other serial killer in the movie, Buffalo Bill was just as gripping to watch, a man who kills and skins young women was truly scary. One of the best most suspenseful scenes iv ever seen, was near the end, a scene in which they find Buffalo Bill which was for me the most scariest scene in the whole move and props for the rest of the film for building up to the that bit so well!

Seems she somewhat randomly stumbles onto his house. 3) Too many closeups; too many plot contrivances. Nearly every scene is a closeup shot. Adds intensity at first, but quickly becomes annoying. That Lechter could uncuff himself from behind with the tip of a pen and overtake the two Keystone cops, not very believable. Less believable that he was ever placed is some makeshift iron box in the middle of a library or gymnasium. 4) She chases him down into his night vision dungeon? C'mon!!

At merely ten minutes in, we're already being introduced to Hannibal Lecter; and barely thirty minutes, Buffalo Bill. In between, and throughout, we're thrust into the investigative and detective side of things, while still being inflicted with the disturbing mannerisms and actions of the antagonists, enhanced by the intense and fitting music score. Although made 14 years after its predecessor, here we have a newly casted Anthony Hopkins as the notorious Lecter, who provides a chillingly mesmerizing performance, which the same can be said for Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, albeit with far less if any redeeming qualities - character wise. Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling feels so natural it's as if she was born for the role, although I can't speak on the source material; it's been eons since I've read it. In smaller but nonetheless effective roles we have Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald. Occasional flashbacks are handled beautifully, and help inject more humanity into the experience, which is already a harrowing one thanks to intermittent yet disturbing scenes of gore and tense editing.

Anthony Heald gives an underrated performance in his supporting role also. Silence is mandatory viewing but to get Silence in its full glory you must ignore the sequels.",
346,10 January 2006,PIST-OFF,10, A study in building up a character as a bad ass,"If silence of the lambs didn't do anything else right (in fact it did everything right) it would serve as the perfect example of how to build up a character as a bad ass. The secret is perfectly on display. All the rules are followed. Screen time for Hannibal Lecter is kept to a minimum, at just under sixteen minutes. This utter lack of screen time which build the anxiety necessary to the character subsequently was ignored in the sequels and the result is that Hannibal falls victim to the Freddie Krueger effect where your sympathies begin to cynically side with him, thus underplaying the currents of the movie. All great heroes and villains must follow this rule in order to be considered true movie bad asses. Think Darth Vader, or Clint Eastwood in unforgiven, or Micheal Madsen as Mr blonde in reservoir dogs. The second rule is to have you're bad ass doing things decidedly not bad ass, i.e. Eastwood getting beat up in unforgiven, and here Hannibal is mostly a caged animal. The third rule is to have other characters reference the potential violence your bad ass can unleash. Here, numerous characters talk about just how bad Hannibal is, and in a masterstroke, doctor Chilton shows a picture to Jodie Foster, that the audience never sees. This is like the scene in reservoir dogs, where the audience's imagination are encouraged to imagine the most horrific things. This movie follows all the rules and creates on of the all time hard core movie bad asses!!!!!! 10 out of 10",

352,24 February 2001,jhaggardjr,9, Brilliantly acted thriller,"Even though it's been 10 years since this film came out, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that I still can't believe won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1991. This is the kind of movie that Academy voters usually don't go for, and it was released in February of that year. Movies released very early in the year hardly ever win Oscar's top prize. But in another way I can see why this film went on the become the third movie in Oscar history to win the top 5 Oscars (the other two were 1934's ""It Happened One Night"" and 1975's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""). It's a very well made and brilliantly acted suspense-thriller. Jodie Foster has never been better in her second Best Actress Oscar-winning performance of her great career (following her first, 1988's ""The Accused"") as Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who goes to visit Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Best Actor Anthony Hopkins), a very smart man who has a nasty habit of eating human flesh (Yuck!). Starling hopes that Dr. Lecter can provide information for her and her FBI team in catching a serial killer who likes to skin his victims, and at the moment has kidnapped the daughter of a senator. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that is quite disturbing to watch at times. Some of the images are ugly and downright horrifying. But those two performances by Foster and Hopkins make this movie as good as it is. I couldn't take my eyes off of them everytime they were on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" certainly held my attention, and I would have to say of all the five movies nominated for Best Picture of 1991 (the other nominees were ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Bugsy"", ""JFK"", and ""The Prince of Tides""), this one is definitely the best.",

And Jodie Foster is the perfect actress to play it, conveying all the strength, toughness, resourcefulness, and vulnerability of Clarice Starling.  And while ""Buffalo Bill"" may kill women, none of the women portrayed in the film, from Brooke Smith as the one in the pit, to Diane Baker as her senator mother, and Kasi Lemmons as Clarice's partner, are seen as just victims (even Smith, once she gets over her initial terror, tries to fight back).

357,31 March 2022,GusherPop,10, A Must See Film for all generations and movie lovers.,"A fundamental difference between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and its sequel, ""Hannibal,"" is that the former is frightening, involving and disturbing, while the latter is merely disturbing. It is easy enough to construct a geek show if you start with a cannibal. The secret of ""Silence"" is that it doesn't start with the cannibal--it arrives at him, through the eyes and minds of a young woman. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the story of Clarice Starling, the FBI trainee played by Jodie Foster, and the story follows her without substantial interruption. Dr. Hannibal Lecter lurks at the heart of the story, a malevolent but somehow likable presence--likable because he likes Clarice, and helps her. But Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins, is the sideshow, and Clarice is in the center ring. The movie's soundtrack also carries themes all the way through. There are exhalations and sighs at many points, as when the cocoon of the gypsy moth is taken from the throat of Bill's first victim. Much heavy breathing. There are subterranean rumblings and faraway cries and laments, almost too low to be heard, at critical points. There is the sound of a heart monitor. Howard Shore's mournful music sets a funereal tone. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins won Oscars for best actress and actor (the movie also won for best picture, for Demme's direction and Ted Talley's screenplay, and was nominated for editing and sound). It is remarkable that the Academy would remember, let alone single out, a film released 13 months before the Oscarcast; it usually votes for films that are still in theaters, or new on video. But ""Silence"" was so clearly one of a kind that it could not be ignored. We are frightened both because of the film's clever manipulation of story and image, and for better reasons--we like Clarice, identify with her and fear for her. Just like Lecter.",

But, there is a lot more beneath the surface, which brings this film from merely a good thriller to a great film.

359,5 April 2019,Svenstadt,3," Overrated, intellectualized, ritualized trash heap!","This movie is just a mess from beginning to end. First of all, actors and actresses have a tendency to overact, so writers and directors will always try to throw realism out the window so that they can indulge themselves! While the character of Dr. Lecter is not technically impossible, it is highly unlikely. Sociopaths in real life are much more likely to be low functioning, impulsive, and not very good book learners. So this movie starts off with a bad premise. I'm not a very big fan of Jodie Foster movies to begin with, and her character is very annoying to me. The best part of the entire film is the Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) scenes. The idea that Lecter would give Starling such highly intellectualized clues is improbable, but I suppose I am being overly critical here. This is still less annoying than Manhunter, but not by much!!",

Usually movies take about 20 years before becoming a classic, but not Silence of the Lambs. This movie has a very complex storyline but that works to its advantage. The music is not really eerie, but thats what makes it SO eerie. Hannibal Lecter is VERY WELL played by Anthony Hopkins. He is so evil, so sneaky, he tops most other movie villains. His mere stare is enough to make someone tremble. Everyone who stands in his way seems to have bad luck come to them. Hannibal is the most sophisticated, evil, possibly bi-polar cannibal to ever grace the big screen. 17 years later, this movie hasn't become any less eerie. My only complaint was Jody Foster, she did play Clarice very well but was sometimes over the top and seems to fall out of character a little.

That villain can appear socially intelligent, a cunning schemer and, at times, sympathetic. In Hannibal Lecter we get both. All else is a police drama that allows Jodie Foster to star with a dismaying West Virginia accent and a propped up set of credentials that places her in a position to be at the center of it all. For me, although Foster is always interesting to look at, it is Ted Levines' ""Buffalo Bill"" that encases the chilling nature of the film because we get a glimpse of the biggest reason we watch horror films. What drive the evil found in mankind. Levine gives us a chilling and fascinatingly demented killer and we see why he's doing what he's doing.

This is based on the second book Thomas Harries wore about Hannibal L.e.c.t.e.r. His first book Red dragon was fist made into a movie in 1986. It is called man Man hunter. It is very scary. And this one is just overrated crap. The third one Hannibal is better. And that one is pretty bad. There is the Man hunter remake that people think is a prequel Red dragon. That is one of the scariest movies ever made. And this just crap. The prequel Hannibal rising is better. And that was not very good. For a movie that was supposed to be scarier Then A nightmare on elm street (1984) and Friday the 13th (1980) I was very disappointed. The best thing about this movie is that it is a precursors to Red dragon. This movie is badly written and has an awful ending. They was good actors in it and they wasted there talent being in this crap. The only reason any one a generation older me like is because of who is in it.

The children of the Academy members, who do the actual voting, have notoriously pedestrian tastes. This movie does add some dramatic scenes and character development to improve on a poorly written novel. This movie's big draws, it would appear, were cannibalism, masogeny, and over-acting. Really great acting is transparent. If you're marvelling at the fantastic acting during the movie, then what you're enjoying is watching someone ""ham it up"" on the screen, not fine acting. The important thing is that the villain didn't have sex with the women, he just murdered them and skinned them, thus avoiding an x rating. And the females that we were aware of that did have sex were properly tortured for their sins. What I really find offensive is that Hannibal the Cannibal is portrayed as a likable monster, even after cutting off the face of an innocent guard in order facilitate his escape. Hannibal's a winner and American's love a winner, regardless of the atrocities he commits in order to achieve his goals. This movie sends the message that if we are clever and have no moral limits as to what we are willing to do, we'll succeed -which Hannibal does!

389,15 January 2008,HelloTexas11,10, a few thoughts on a classic,"One of the things that strikes me whenever I watch 'Silence of the Lambs' again is how different Jodie Foster looks at various points in the movie. I don't know if this is deliberate or just the way her face comes across when filmed from different angles and with different lighting. At the risk of sounding as though I'm only focusing on her physical appearance, she sometimes appears radiantly beautiful, other times cute in a tomboy-ish way, and sometimes downright unattractive. I mention this because there are a number of quirky details in 'Silence of the Lambs' that one only picks up on with repeated viewings, and they all fall together in such a casual, unforced way that it's easy to believe they just happened. But no film turns out this well by accident. The director, Jonathan Demme, might have gotten lucky with one or two shots but I have to believe nearly everything in this movie was calculated to create the exact effect each renders. Anthony Hopkins had, prior to 'Lambs,' never been a favorite actor of mine. I was never particularly impressed with him in any role. In fact, it would be hard to think of one part that Hopkins was really identified with. But if ever the actor and the character and the moment came together in perfect realization, it was in this film. Hopkins grasps the complexities of Hannibal Lecter and presents them in such a way that it is now impossible to think of one and not the other. Just as Thomas Harris does in his books, Lecter is on film depicted as a cannibalistic madman but so much more than that; he is polite, resourceful, intolerant of most other criminals, tasteful, sophisticated... not to mention a genius. Given what Hannibal has done in the past and has every intention of doing in the future, his character would seem the most unlikely to appear even slightly sympathetic to the audience. And yet he does. Clarice Starling is a more straightforward character, easier to figure out, but Jodie Foster embodies her in a similar way. She is single-minded, on an almost holy quest to achieve success as an FBI agent, to rescue the helpless and imprison the guilty. She pushes herself relentlessly though Starling is not typically reflective unless forced into it by Lecter. When he tells her during their first meeting, ""You're so ambitious, aren't you?"", he has her nailed, dead to rights. Over the course of the film, Hannibal Lecter begins to display other qualities that almost qualify as superhuman. He is immensely strong. He can apparently control and manipulate his body's functions to create false readings. He seems at times capable of both telepathy and empathy. Nothing supernatural is suggested, only such finely-honed skills of observation and reasoning that not even the smallest detail escapes his notice. And most importantly, he never fails at anything he sets out to do. By the end of the film, one is convinced Lecter could have escaped from that jail cell anytime he wanted. In fact, his escape from the cage in Memphis is so improbable that in retrospect it borders on magic. For everything to have happened in the order it did and with the precise timing it needed to happen beggars belief, to say the least. And yet it is so well-staged, and we are so convinced by this point that Hannibal is perfectly capable of pulling it off, the audience never questions it.",

One of the finest examples of great contemporary film making.,"This film is brilliant, there is no other way to describe it, everything about this film is perfect.  When we all talk about a film that affected us the most, this should pop into most people minds.  It is extremely well crafted, from the acting, to the direction, editing, cinematography and screenplay.  Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are both brilliant, they give us all a clear example of what good acting is all about, and earned well deserved academy awards for their efforts.  This film is so gripping, it draws you in instantly and it holds you there right until the final credits end.  All I can say is what a movie!  TSOTL delves into the human psyche, and questions the way we think, why we act on things the way we do, is anything incidental?  How can we better judge people so we may have any idea to what goes on inside people's minds.  This film is mind boggling.  While it is  excessively violent in places, it has to be so the viewer can visualise the true horror of the character's actions. Everyone involved with this film should be given a medal, what an achievement.",

Clarice is told by Crawford that he wants her to travel to the Baltimore state hospital & interview the notorious serial killer Dr. Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to possibly help identify a current serial killer nick-named 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine) who has kidnapped, murdered & skinned several young girls. Clarice meets up with the slimy Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) who runs the hospital & has responsibility for Lecter, he tells her some basic rules & then she's ready. Clarice's meeting with Lecter goes O.K. & he gives her a few cryptic clues which leads her to a severed head in a jar, 'Buffalo Bills' first victim. Meanwhile 'Buffalo Bill' himself has abducted a young girl named Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) who is the daughter of a powerful Washington Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker). Lecter sees an opportunity to leave his miserable existence in his cramped brick cell behind & tries to strike a deal with the Senator in exchange for 'Buffalo Bills' name.

Demme's film is frightening on both visceral and intellectual levels, inviting favorable comparison with unnerving classics of the genre. Ingénue FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is sent to interview, the profoundly mad yet seemingly sane psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to prise clues about another serial killer dubbed 'Buffalo Bill', who has left a rash of unsavory murders along his trail. The killer is abducting corpulent young women, then mutilating them and dumping their bodies. Clarice summons all her courage to face the sadistic shrink, but Lecter has a commanding presence. Relishing the superiority of his intellect, he instantly recognizes her true vulnerability, watching with a self-satisfied smirk as Clarice struggles to maintain her professional composure. Still, there's a glimmer of admiration as Lecter examines Clarice with his penetrating eyes. He offers to help catch the serial killer (who is now holding the daughter of a U.S. senator hostage) but to learn what he knows, Clarice has to engage in his dangerous mind games. Forced to confront her own childhood fears, she hangs on like a terrier until he imparts a vital clue.",

403,25 February 2012,fredericksmith1952,10, There is something about this film that will continue to haunt me forever.,"There is something about this film that will continue to haunt me forever. Perhaps it is the idea that someone like Lector could actually exist. That thought exists due to the phenomenal acting of Anthony Hopkins. While there are many actors whom I would enjoy the privilege of sharing time with, I think to this day if I were to meet Anthony Hopkins, I would like it to be in an open room with plenty of people. That is how convincing his portrayal of Lector strikes me, and I know many people who feel the same way. Scott Glenn's portrayal of Jack Crawford is cool and calm, exactly what you might expect of a senior agent and department head in the FBI. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the ambitious Clarice Starling is as compelling and haunting as Hopkins', which would account for both of them winning their respective Academy Awards. Demme and the film itself also received Oscars, as did the screenwriters of this exceptional film. The film itself is superbly written, perfectly cast, and splendidly presented in every aspect. Details are important to Demme, obviously, so important that filming was done at Quantico for the academy shots, using actual FBI personnel in the training sequences. Perhaps the most riveting quality of the film is the portrayal of Buffalo Bill, and the ability of Ted Levine to carry off that twisted and complex role. Ted shows us how innocuous evil can be, and presents it with such flair and elegance we can imagine such a man being in a rural town like that, hiding his crimes beneath a veil of anonymity and isolation. Rated R for violence, language, gore, and some partial nudity, this is definitely not a film for the kids or even the young teens, if you ever want them to trust your neighbors and you live in a small town. Collectible? Without a doubt, one of the finest dramas ever brought to the screen.",

I guess if you took the word horror out, you'd still have the truth. I'm a movie addict. And this is The Perfect Movie. As a matter of fact, this film is the reason I love horror movies, and movies in general. I read the book the summer after my eighth grade year (a little too young, still to really appreciate it.) The novel, let me say, as an aspiring horror writer, is excellent and ranks in my top 10 desert island books. The film changes only minor aspects of the film, and is in itself almost as brilliant, with great writing, great directing and top notch acting from Jodie Foster as FBI agent (in training) Clarice Starling, Scott Glenn as her boss, Jack Crawford. Ted Levine plays a great villain as Jame Gumb. But of course, the crown jewel is Anthony Hopkins as the demonic cannibal madman Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who offers the key to solving the film's over arching serial killer mystery. As far as horror villains go, there are two kinds. The silent embodiment of rage: Jason, Michael Myers, xenomorphs, Leatherface. And then, there are the truly terrifying, intelligent villains: John Doe, John Kramer, the cenobites and of course Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's ego, his monstrous brain, and his constant presence throughout the work are what give him his power, and his ability to remain calm, even when committing unspeakable acts of murder and mutilation are what give the film its true ""horror"" quality.",

Apprentice Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) works hard to advance her career, as she tries to hide or leave behind her West Virginia roots, which, if some knew, they would automatically classify as backward or trash. White. Upon graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Sciences Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While still an apprentice, Crawford asks him to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, until now, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to realize that the task is to collect Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women, slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large stripes of fur. She also imagines that Crawford chose her, as a woman, in order to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking with Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, and often she will have to read between the very cryptic lines that he provides. She has to decide how long the game will continue, since her request in exchange for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more serious turn when a sixth victim is discovered, from whom they can retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being frank about its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high-profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Sen. Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), who puts increased scrutiny on the case as they search for a Catherine who is hopefully still alive. The one who can influence what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the prison warden, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, which means a higher profile for himself if he can successfully insert himself.

They plug the stuffing out of this movie on almost every TV show, especially those running around the time of this movie's release. So finally, I rented it from Blockbuster, expecting good things, because it won 5 Oscars, has Jodie Foster(who has since become my favorite actress and dream wife) in it, and it's notoriety. I got more than I asked for. Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling to the ""tee-est"" of ""T's"". Young, beautiful, determined, brilliant, vulnerable. Hopkins scares and intrigues me simultaneously, amazing how I would never want to be in the same room as Hannibal Lecter, yet would not mind terribly if he sat down next to me on a park bench. Hopkins calculated every movement, every speech, and basically brought Hannibal Lecter to life in which maybe no other fictional character has been brought to life, made a part of human consciousness. In 2010, he will face Keyzer Soze for the title of the most feared movie villain ever. This and ""Fatal Attraction"" have the distinction of being the only two films to ever scare me, frighten me, seriously unsettle me.

In order to catch Buffalo Bill she must speak with another murderer: Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter played by the man born to play Dr. Lecter: Anthony Hopkins.

It is routine behaviour for psychopaths to attempt to team split, as Lekter does, but it is such a standard ploy that it would be recognised in any institution other than the toyland one in the film and quickly dealt with, and I resent the attitude of the storyline in glorifying this behaviour. Trust me people, if you are in this situation, don't allow patients to split you away from your colleagues, you may think they are interested in you but they will get bored with playing with you in the end. When patients are given this power, which they cannot handle, it makes them more scared, and less likely to learn. In his attempt to make Frederick Chilton, the character that should be the good guy, in to the bad guy, either the actor or the director has gone way over the top, to the point where where pathos becomes bathos, and as for Anthony Hopkins, he lost all credibility for me when he announced in a British tabloid that he was sorry for seeming to condone violence in the role he was playing, and then within a few months proceeded to repeat the role in the sequel, ""Hannibal"". That's why I never bothered to see the film until just recently.",
