0,10 September 2017,Leofwine_draca,10, War movie masterwork,"Mel Gibson is a director with two masterpieces behind him - the superlative BRAVEHEART and the even better APOCALYPTO. Sadly, due to his ridiculous pillorying in the press and subsequent ostracising in Hollywood, he hasn't directed a film for a decade, but now he's back with HACKSAW RIDGE, the true story of a pacifist who joined the US army and took part in the Battle of Okinawa as a medic. The good news? Gibson hasn't lost his touch (of course), and this is his third masterpiece.",/
1,28 January 2017,littlemartinarocena,9, At The Very Center Of It All,"We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!",r

I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.",e
3,25 September 2016,bartonj2410,10, Welcome back Mr Gibson,"When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.",v
4,18 October 2016,CineMuseFilms,8, one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema,Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.,i

6,5 November 2016,classicsoncall,10," ""Lord, please help me get one more.""","""It was a scene straight out of hell. There is no other way to describe it."" This quote from Higa Tomiko, a survivor of the Battle of Okinawa when she was seven years old, may be the best description one can take away from ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the most recent World War II film directed by Mel Gibson in a stunning return to prominence among his Hollywood peers. It tells the story of Private Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to handle a weapon, but felt it was his moral duty to serve his country in a time of war when many of his friends and neighbors opted to do the same. It's a story of perseverance, courage and sheer fortitude, and one bound to affect even the most hardened viewer.",w
7,13 September 2016,trublu215,9, A film that is as courageous as its subject and as violent as the war it portrays.,"Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield's Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she'll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone's parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson's excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does.",/
8,22 September 2016,conan-2,9, Powerful - well acted piece,"As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.",r
9,3 April 2017,bkoganbing,8, The 'using kind of religion'.,"I guess that Hacksaw Ridge could probably best be compared to the great Gary Cooper film Sergeant York which hewed pretty close to the truth about Alvin C. York, his background in Eastern Tennessee and his exploits in World War I. ",w
10,28 October 2019,Hitchcoc,9, Stirring War Film,"The resistant soldier has been a theme for many films over the years. The young man here who serves as a medic has several good reasons for not carrying a gun. Apparently, putting yourself into harms way, unarmed is not adequate to keep you from being tormented. This could have been a cliche, but the acting is superb, the effects amazing, and the pacing works wonderfully. Basing it on an actual Medal of Honor recipient gives it a little push ahead of most others.",5

15,2 November 2016,Vladimir-14,9, Saviour Private Doss,"Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.",3

17,18 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8, Hacksaw Ridge marks a triumphant return for Mel Gibson.,"Ten years since his last directorial effort 'Apocalypto' and many were wondering if he could match the excellence of his previous work, especially since this hiatus consisted of many controversies for the actor/director. Well, I'm pleased to say that Hacksaw Ridge is most definitely one of the best war films of this century. A bold claim such as this needs proof, and I always say ""proof is in the pudding"". Detailing the efforts of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to carry a weapon, during the battle for Hacksaw Ridge against the Japanese. Illustrating the heroism, valour and bravery of one man who, through inner strength and conviction, saved the lives of many wounded soldiers. I am a sucker for good old fashioned Hollywood stories about a hero who defied all the odds. Everyone and everything was against Doss, including the rest of his unit at first, which automatically creates emotional investment towards our protagonist. You want him to succeed in his endeavours, you want him to prove all the naysayers wrong. He does...and then some. Through visceral direction from Gibson, who honestly directed the heck out of this, Doss was portrayed enigmatically by Garfield. Balancing both innocence and conviction in equal measures to produce a character that breaks your heart. Every facial expression and action Garfield makes feels natural and racks up to be one of his best performances. Supported by an excellent cast, particularly Vaughn, Weaving and Worthington, who provide backstory and development to what could've been expendable assets. The battle scenes were breathtakingly claustrophobic, the usage of blood and violence contradicts the religious subtext in the narrative which further enhances the ideologies of pacifism. Countless bodies on fire and limbs gliding through the explosions, just relentless filmmaking. The overuse of melodrama during the first half did provide an unusual tonal shift for the second half, took me a while to adjust. But, in the end, all I have to say is ""Mel, welcome back!"".",/

Doss, who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people, and becomes the first man in American history to win the Medal of Honor without firing a shot."" The film is biopic of Desmond Doss and not so much a story of Hacksaw Ridge. We only get his biographical background. The working title was ""The Conscientious Objector"" but war films market better. There is a teaser in the beginning and then the movie looks at the events that shaped Desmond's life and how a conscientious objector comes to serve in the army. He was hazed and beaten as a recruit and turned around and saved the lives of many of them who threw the punches. Don't want to say too much, just go see it.",r

21,8 December 2016,tavm,9, Hacksaw Ridge was a compelling take on the heroism of one Desmond Doss,"Watched this with my movie theatre-working friend yesterday, the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Desmond Doss was a conscience objector during World War II meaning he refused to carry a gun while in the Army. He eventually managed to save many of his fellow comrades during the battle of Okinawa by moving them to safety using the rope tricks he learned during basic training. If you're familiar with director Mel Gibson's graphic take on The Passion of the Christ, those battle scenes shouldn't surprise here nor how long it is being depicted. Still, there's also a nice romance between Desmond and Dorothy (Andrew Garfield and Teresa Palmer) in the beginning parts. Overall, me and my friend highly recommend Hacksaw Ridge.",f

This World War ll film focuses on a conscientious objector named Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield). The horrifying war is messing with America's attitudes and patriotism and who would ever think that a non-violent man would go from ridicule to admiration. Doss refused to touch a gun, but knew he could serve his country's efforts as a medic. During one of the deadliest battles in all of the Pacific Theater, the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the unarmed medic saved 75 wounded soldiers, dragging them to safety.

29,26 February 2017,denis888,7," Good Movie, Although A Bit Uneven","Mel Gibson is a very good film director, and a very fine actor, although not without failures or errors on his way. His resume is fairly spectacular, and here he touches upon a very delicate and a very serious subject - the conflict between religious beliefs and military duties. Desmond Doss was a very famous Seventh Day Adventist who took part in Battle Of Okinawa and due to his belief never took up a rifle and never killed anyone, but he saved as many as 100 lives of wounded soldiers and officers. The film is about this modest and brave man, who spared no effort to save his comrades. Was the film a success? Well, with all the coming Oscar nods, and with Mel Gibson and a stellar cast behind, this is very tough to be very critical. Let's say this - the movie is good, but not awesome, good but not perfect. This is not Saving Private Ryan or The Longest Day, for sure. Why? Well, there are some almost cringe-worthy pathetic scenes, that awake all the worst clichés of Hollywood, the battle scenes are impressive but hardly anything but already many times repeated gruesome bloody things. The slower part of the movie is often boring and too slow, and the main actor, well he is OK, but sorry, not higher than just average. This is a good film that must be seen at least once.",v

Incredible true-story account of Desmond Doss (Garfield in a career defining performance of heart-breaking vigilance) a Virginia bred youth who enlists in WWII to become a field medic as a conscientious observer only to face a gauntlet of anger, indifference and resentment from the Army, his fellow soldiers and officers, while relying on his spiritual faith in God to get him thru literally a baptism of fire on the battlefield (skillfully and graphically recounted by Mel Gibson returning to form as a gritty filmmaker with no holds barred after a decade of personal controversy and questionable career choices). Well cast ensemble includes a funny and dedicated Vaughn as Doss' sergeant at arms/drill instructor, Worthington as his officer in command, Weaving and Griffiths as his loving yet troubled parents (Weaving is amazing as a demon-plagued alcoholic WWI vet who shows his true colors) and fresh-faced newcomer Palmer as his beloved fiancée. The war sequences are truly harrowing and give SAVING PRIVATE RYAN a run for its money on the bloodshed, anarchy and destruction embroiled on the big-screen. Epic filmmaking and a must-see to see what being a true hero is truly about thanks to a recognizable yet profound screenplay by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight . One of the year's best films.",

There is nothing left to the imagination with shock after visceral shock coming at you for a good twenty minutes. The effect is an adrenaline surge as you feel like you are trying to survive with Doss and the rest of his troop. The payoff occurs after Doss does what he does and comes off Hacksaw Ridge. It is so emotional. The effect is amazing and it is all steered by Gibson's intense direction.

It's the true story of Desmond Doss(in a strong performance from Andrew Garfield)a medic and self proclaimed pacifist who won a Medal of Honor without ever even using a weapon. And this film is in detail showing the rural life that Desmond lived in Virginia growing up. As he becomes a man he has a pure romance with a young nurse all while maintaining his faith in Sunday, and after going in service to fight in Okinawa, Japan Desmond and others experience hell on the battlefield as this film is very graphic with bullets, blood, bombings, and partial body parts of death all caused by war. Thru it all it takes extra courage for this man who went a different path of being brave to become a hero to be remembered.

41,21 January 2017,KineticSeoul,9," Incredible story about conviction, family and honor.","This is a film about prejudice against sensitive men and their conviction. Which is thoroughly shown through the mistreatment of Desmond Doss. Who is a stand up guy that wanted to do good for his country by being a medic for the wounded soldiers in battle. The mistreatment came from Doss being a pacifist and for him sticking to his conviction not to kill but to save lives instead in battle by being a medic. Which leads to Doss facing hatred, trials and hazing from the other soldiers because they all think he won't be able to protect them in battle. This is based on a true story of conviction, family and honor. And it's directed very well from the build up to the convincing and engaging violent battle sequences for the second half. Andrew Garfield plays a lovable character as Desmond T. Doss. Garfield did a great job playing Desmond T. Doss as this dorky, lovable, kind and honorable guy. I am going to be very honest though, during the whole film he reminded me of Fix It Felix Jr. from ""Wreck-It Ralph"". As a matter of fact if Fix It Felix Jr. came to real life in human form it would be Andrew Garfield in this film. This is a powerful movie about a man standing up for his conviction at all cost. And the brutality of war and the incredible and inspirational will power a honorable man had when it came to saving lives. It's a film that I can highly recommend to just about anyone.",

45,5 November 2016,oscaralbert,10, Mel Gibson has John Wayne somersaulting in his grave . . .,". . . with his latest flick, HACKSAW RIDGE, which can be best described as APOCALYPTO on steroids. Draft dodger Wayne's ""Sgt. Stryker"" character definitely would have killed the mutinous vegetarian Bible Thumper Desmond Doss in boot camp. Fortunately for America, in Real Life Wayne's wide yellow streak prevented his Unconstitutional Fascist Ideals from directly contaminating Our Real Heroes, such as the pacifist Doss. Without making a fist, let alone firing a shot or throwing a grenade, Doss broke the spirit of Japan's Suicide Squad on Okinawa by combating the Japanese Death Eater Culture with America's Vibrant Life Spirit. Director Gibson makes the case with HACKSAW that the current Millennial Generation is unlikely to produce enough stalwarts like Doss to win the next World War. Therefore, by picturing nearly naked Japanese soldiers using the White Flag of Surrender to launch a grenade attack against the Americans AFTER targeting U.S. medics and savagely executing dozens of helpless U.S. wounded guys, Gibson is implicitly endorsing Leader Trump's Plan to nuke Syria, Iran, Russia, North Korea, China, and, probably, Japan again for good measure. This will allow Fortess America to get rid of our aging H-Bomb inventory in order to make room for Trump's new generation of Peace-Making Bombs. Tuesday you can put America's Future in the hands of Crooked Hillary's Legion of Brave Vegetarians (IF ANY!), or keep our soldiers' hands clean with Leader Trump's Nuclear Rocketeers.",

Looking back at the critically acclaimed 'Braveheart' and the highly controversial 'Passion of The Christ', Gibson's depictions of violence clashing with spirituality has proved to be far more effective than contrived; and this World War II biopic centering on the true story of a soldier driven by his firm spirituality to the take a different path in active combat instead of being a man carrying a gun in the midst of the bloodshed. His path is not to take the lives of others with the use of bullets, but save them. What could have been just your average faith-based drama feeling like a clichéd religious sermon ends up being a powerful testament of war pacifism and a man's challenge against the tyranny that targets his religious ideology. The film tells the true story of Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), a devout Christian and member of the Seventh-Day Adventist raised by his caring mother Bertha (played by Rachel Griffiths) and abusive alcohol father Tom (played by Hugo Weaving) strained by his experience in World War I. With World War II ravaging, Desmond enlists in the army as a Conscious Objector.

We've all been there, but few of us have had to risk as much for our convictions as World War II Army medic Desmond T. Doss. You see, as a Seventh-day Adventist, Doss took the Bible literally. To him, the sixth commandment means God forbids killing anyone – ever – for any reason – even in war. He volunteered to be a medic in the war, but even in basic training, he steadfastly refused to even touch a gun. The law calls someone like Doss a conscientious objector. His fellow soldiers just called him a coward. That is until they went into battle with him.

I expected the director to look at Mr Doss and his colleagues from a psychological point of view I was hoping to see something akin to Platoon. No! What we got was more akin to Captain America. In the hands of Mel Gibson, Desmond Doss was more of a cartoon character than a real hero. It was so over the top I was actually embarrassed. Now for a fictitious character this movie would be OK.

88,5 November 2016,cultfilmfan,10, Hacksaw Ridge,"Mel Gibson's new directorial effort, Hacksaw Ridge, is not only one of the best war movies of recent years (some are saying the best since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which I would agree with), but it is also a rare film of courage, standing true to what one believes in and is ultimately an excellent and encouraging story of one man's Christian faith and the decision to go to war as a medic and yet refuse to carry a gun, or use or deploy any acts of violence whatsoever based on his beliefs. Our main character Desmond Doss, is brought up in a home where there is a fair bit of dysfunction largely based on the father's difficulty with what was then horrific memories and reflections of the first world war in which he served and which now causes him much pain and sorrow leading him to use alcohol as a means of trying to heal his wounds in what would today be considered as post traumatic stress disorder. While there is fighting and arguments among the Doss household, Desmond does cling to his Christian faith and even as an adult carries those beliefs with him even while enlisting to go to war. Desmond's idea is to be a war medic and save lives instead of killing others as he considered himself to be a conscientious objector and was totally opposed to violence and killing based on his strong Christian beliefs. Desmond while at boot camp and training to go to war is often made fun of verbally and also attacked physically for what the other soon to be soldiers did not understand and took to be an act of cowardice and oh how Desmond would prove them wrong. Desmond was certainly persecuted for his beliefs and his faith, but the absolutely amazing thing is that he never denounced his faith, or wanted to give up and he kept persevering even though it brought about condemnation and laughs and jeers from others. This is not giving any spoilers away, but Desmond does make it to the war and through praying and keeping true to the word of God as well as obeying the fellow soldiers and ultimately having the outlook of loving your neighbour as yourself he does far more than any of his fellow soldiers thinks he is capable of and truly proves himself to be a hero not only as a soldier and medic, but also as a true Christian soldier and one who placed God first and foremost in his life and would not disobey on the battlefield, or more importantly to the God who saw him through these personal and physical battles and would ultimately see him not only rewarded for his faith and devotion, but also Desmond truly becomes a wonderful example to his fellow soldiers and those in command of what a great Christian witness he is and one that the other soldiers because of his example that they would not soon forget. The film while very violent at times especially in it's second half should not stop viewers from seeing and embracing this inspiring and truly inspirational film and true story. This is not just simply a war film, but a man's own personal war against the people and powers that be that tried to suppress him and his faith only to be proved wrong and ultimately giving God the true and total glory that he deserves through Desmond's wonderful example and act of courage and faith. This film is about as good as you can get these days and everything here is done to sheer perfection from the outstanding acting to the war scenes to the makeup, sets and everything done to capture not only the period elements of the time, but also to not only take us to those battle lines, but make us feel as if we were right there and experiencing them for ourselves. There were some scenes that were so realistic that there were certainly times I jumped out of my seat in pure terror and other scenes were I was so deeply engrossed into the film and it's story as well. I hope that the R rating and the more graphic violence does not keep people away, but instead that people give this film a chance and be totally encouraged and yet blown away by the sheer power and yet beautiful nature of this amazing film. I hope that those who have written Mel Gibson off for comments he made ten years ago, can look past that and judge the man's art and not the man himself because he truly made a masterpiece with this film and it not only stands as one of this year's finest films, but also shows that good movies can still be made these days and I hope this film takes off and not only inspires, but truly shows what a Hollywood production can still do in the proper hands and that they can still achieve greatness.

This movie is high on action, but not over the top ""expendables"" type, not that I don't enjoy those movies as well, but this is realistic. It is also inspirational. I for one am not or can never be a conscientious objector but what this soldier did and how he remained true to his convictions and why is what makes it inspirational.

91,30 March 2017,pal05052003,9, A story of how a pacifist participated in WWII without firing a single shot.,"Directed by Mel Gibson, I knew this was one movie to look forward too. Starring Andrew Garfield as war medic who chose to serve in World War 2 but not to kill, the movie explores a very unique side of war. In the first part of the movie, we get to know Desmond Doss, our protagonist played by Garfield. We see his trials and tribulations (literally) for following his beliefs. In the next part, we see non-stop action where Garfield's character proves his bravery in battle. The casting choice was brilliant and all the supporting casts have a chance to shine. Hugo Weaving, an already talented actor gave a great performance as Garfield's troubled father, while Vince Vaughn gets to shine as a no-nonsense Sargeant ( which is surprising considering I used to see him in comedic roles). Sam Worthington was also great as Garfield's superior. In the movie, Gibson is able to display the gruesome violence of war without really criticizing war. This is not exactly an antiwar movie, it is just a movie about how a pacifist can apply his beliefs even in war. The soldiers in the movie are portrayed as real humans, with fears. Even the nameless Japanese fighting our protagonists are shown as normal people fighting for their lives. You can say it is an antiwar movie without looking like an antiwar movie. It does not preach pacifism, it just focuses on one pivotal moment in the protagonist's life and this focus makes the movie engaging. The war scenes are really gruesome, as you would expect from a Mel Gibson movie, but the gore serves to heighten the stakes, and not done for just the sake of gore. In short, this is a terrific war drama that delivers without being too weepy, and contains a lot of action and tension. Looking forward to the next Mel Gibson directed movie.",

This movie is based upon true events and tells the story of Seventh-day Adventist Desmond Thomas Doss who enlists in the Army to take part in the Second World War to defend his country but refuses to carry a gun due to his religious beliefs and negative experiences with his violent father who is a war veteran.

Say what you will about Mel Gibson as a person, but he is a magnificent director. He navigates this complex and difficult story with ease, knowing the perfect ratio of character-driven moments to war-filled madness. The different aesthetic choices he made, in terms of the tone of the film and his approach to the different aspects of the movie, continue to prove his ability as a director. I'll get more into the war scenes later, but the way he chooses to showcase these sequences is masterful. Sure, we get tons of gory and bloody violence, but never does it feel glorified or for entertainment. It is purely to show the horrors of war and the madness that ensues on the battlefield, and Gibson walked that line perfectly. He also does fantastic things with the character of Desmond Doss, and how he uses other people's reactions to him to tell Desmond's story for him. Gibson easily could have had Desmond give us long, exposition-filled speeches about why he chooses not to kill, and we do get a couple of those, but only when they are absolutely necessary. Instead, Gibson utilizes supporting characters and the environment to paint the picture of why Desmond won't kill. It's a perfect example of show not tell, and I think it ultimately shows Gibson's mastery as a director...",

This movie comes close to being just that, a great movie, but just misses the mark. It has lots of action and excellent acting set in a time and place that is still known and remembered with reverence today. But most of all, it is about a man who stays true to his principles, and against all odds triumphs. The battle of Okinawa is depicted in all its gory violence. Soldiers on both sides are dying by the hundreds. Through it all, Desmond Doss does his duty, which, as a medic, is to save lives. Nothing stops him, not even a grenade. And if that isn't enough, he's married to a beautiful young lady who adores him and whose photograph he carries in his Bible, which she gave him as a present and which he takes into battle. To tell this story, the director Mel Gibson, pulls out the stops. It is Hollywood through and through. From the confrontation scene in the barracks, to the presence of the overbearing sergeant, to the inclusion of the devoted girlfriend, the hero perseveres and finally proves himself on the battlefield, proving all his detractors wrong.

Desmond figures the best way to serve his country is to be a medic after meeting his love interest Dorothy and says something very touching that world seems so determined to tear itself apart with violence that feels that he wants to put part of it back together. Another saying that I feel was rather touching, was when Desmond mentioned while others would be taking lives, he would be saving it. Other aspects that his character deals with is how his beliefs differ from those of his fellow comrades and superiors who think it is foolish of him to want to serve in the military without using a weapon to defend himself despite his bravery, the backstory of Desmond father who served in the First World War war seeing the horrors of violence which turned him into a drunk and why Desmond refused to use a gun.

112,13 November 2016,paytonsapp,8, Mel Gibson's Triumphant Return,"Mel Gibson returns behind the camera a full 10 years after his last directorial outing in Apocalypto (2006). Mel Gibson has proved to be a master when it comes to direction particularly when he is constructing a battle scene. However, being a full 21 years after Braveheart (1995) I myself was a little worried that Gibson had gotten a little rusty. Regardless of this, when I heard he was going to direct another war film I was very excited to see him back behind the camera. But the question remains. Has Gibson lost a step in his 10 year hiatus from directing? The answer is NO. Mel Gibson has proved that he has perfected his craft and in my opinion he is the best when it comes to crafting a battle sequence. The action is gritty, violent, realistic and most of all, it is absolutely terrifying. The battles in this film resemble a horror movie and a few times I even jumped. The intensity is constantly cranked up to 100% through out the second half of the film. Notice that I said 2nd half, that is because through out the 1st half this film is about the Character of Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spiderman, 99 Homes), struggling to stay true to his beliefs and attempting to prove to his peers that he is no coward. There is also a very heartfelt love story between Doss and his girlfriend Dorothy, played by Teresa Palmer (Lights Out), their relationship in no way feels forced and feels very authentic. I was very shocked when during the first hour there was little to no violence considering this was a Mel Gibson picture, but don't make the mistake of thinking he is only skilled at directing battle scenes because the character build up portrayed by Gibson is enthralling and allows you to invest in the characters as actual people so you care about them when it all goes down. So all in all, Gibson has proved that he is without a doubt one of the top 5 directors working today and he has no doubt earned, in my opinion, an Oscar nomination for Best Director.",

119,8 April 2017,icasilas,7, An unexpectedly entertaining journey through the cruel depths of war.,"Hacksaw ridge is by far Mel Gibson's best movie as director; it had all the criteria for it to be this year's best picture. It is a calm journey through the life of a simple yet unstable southern family; it brought us to admire the simplest joys of life, the happy and loving daily life of the American suburban families before the war. This movie showed us the true meaning of love and compassion and restored our hope in humanity. And then as expected gave us its obscure side, throwing us in the most well directed and performed war decors ever filmed, a true human carnage between the seemingly weak American army and the ruthless Japanese battalions. Hacksaw ridge is a story of pain and suffering and war, but it also represents the eternal fight between good and evil, and by that not meaning the two armies themselves but the true battle between faith and despair. Hacksaw ridge is truly a modern odyssey. One of the most crucial elements of such an amazing quest is the protagonist Desmond doss, a man of iron will and unbreakable faith who tried to save humanity in my opinion from violence and war. Portraying such a persona is undoubtedly a great challenge, and Andrew Garfield was up to it: The young actor exhibited with the help of the industry's veteran Mel Gibson one of the most sincere performances in the history of war films, his great acting skills were a key element to the success of this picture. The character of private doss was itself a fascinating trait that contributed to the critical acclamation this picture had received, he is as Andrew Garfield perfectly fits a man of a poor physique yet of great courage and altruism, his a medic that dived head first into the hordes of dead in the battlefield without hesitation, he is a loving husband, a great son and a true patriot who stood willingly in the face of the dreadful war in japan in order to save his fellow brothers in arms. In this dire times , the only one who truly stood by the side of private doss was his father Thomas , a good turned cruel man that lived to tell about the war to end all wars, he was disturbed and traumatised , something that Hugo weaving mastered on screen , he was such a great cast choice and delivered more than what was needed from a secondary character, he visualized in every move he did and every word he spoke the true horrors of war, he was all the time dark and shocked demonstrating what a war could do to a country, a family and a man. To sum it up, hacksaw ridge is definitely a must watch, it's by far one of this year's most exciting and overwhelming pictures. It is a top notch movie that depicts unprecedentedly the march of one man to end a war, it's the story of a real war hero who chose not to take the life of his brethren, and it's a movie for the director Mel Gibson to be proud of.",

121,5 June 2017,sol-,7, Brave,"Based on the true story of an army medic who insisted on never carrying a weapon, 'Hacksaw Ridge' tells a slice of World War II history that dares to redefine traditional notions of bravery. The graphic battle scenes are very well done with Gibson never shying away from the severity of battle wounds and how precious life in war is. For all is virtues though, the film often feels preachy with the protagonist's religion-motivated pacifism (and how this repulses everyone in the army) repeatedly brought up. A formulaic romance also weighs against the film and some of the casting is downright odd, with Vince Vaughn especially awkward as a drill sergeant who is hardly fearsome and seldom angry. The casting of Hugo Weaving as the medic's father is a stroke of genius though with Weaving stealing every scene as a former war veteran plagued by inner demons and horrific memories of World War I. Andrew Garfield is fine in the lead role, though against 'The Social Network', '99 Homes' and others, it is hardly his best work. Overall, this is an easy to film to recommend for those keen on unflinchingly realistic battle scenes and detailed insights into military bureaucracy. It is hardly a flawless film and perhaps a little message-heavy for its own good, however, it says quite a lot that the movie manages to pack a punch even when one knows about his heroism to come.",

The story of Desmond Doss is a compelling one which needed to be told cinematically, and Gibson was the right man for this. The first hour has many virtues, but also problems: Doss' mistreatment seems to lack (comparisons with Full Metal Jacket are inevitable) and the court martial hearing does not ring true. But once they move to Okinawa, what follows is a technical tour de force, with realistic, gruesome battle scenes, extremely well and clearly directed and photographed action, and with an impressive emotional and transcendental punch to boost, which will make you stand up and applaud at the end. I don't see Gibson glorifying war while condemning it, I see him as a true artist, with a view of the history of mankind as war and violence, presenting life in all its hellish reality, and a hero pursuing a higher aim amid the brutality and personal challenge. This film should gather Oscar nominations for best picture, direction, actor in a leading role, script, cinematography, production design and sound, at least.

The battle scenes seem realistic: chaotic, noisy, and gruesome (but I have no military experience with which to judge). The first half of the film is a bit slow, yet I was surprised that there were no scenes of his medic training (the sudden jump from the court martial to Okinawa was unexpected).

For all its blood, gore, explosions and injury detail, it never forgets the human story it is telling and guarantees that the themes are always front and centre of the picture. Andrew Garfield delivers a career-best performance and Mel Gibson crafts this harrowing and violent tale with enough thought-provoking and moral questioning to ensure you are totally absorbed in this pacifist story.

Movie is divided in two part first is a love story and second is war story with some features of kindness and caring. As we learn more and more about Desmond we are learning about his father and every scene that Tom Doss was in was stolen by him as he portrays a veteran that has seen unimaginable things which left mark on him. His perception and understanding was incredible but at the same time emotional and powerful. Then we lean more into Desmond and Dorothy and their love and caring for each other. As everyone in camp starts to realize what their life is with Desmond and his believes they are all unable to stop themselves form hurting him but his love and believes are so great that he forgives all. Just as everything couldn't get worse Tom Doss finally show how he cares and loves his son but also by his decision Desmond saved 75 men. Then war scenes came into first plan and they were absolutely staggering showing us what true horror and pain looks like. First sequence was about 15 minutes long and it was one of the most brutal war scenes every shown, with so many details and absolutely incredible directing throughout them. Next came the commitment combined with pain and struggle in his amazing saving of every wounded men despite threat that was always upon Desmond's neck and how he continued with pure will to push himself to limit. After that he was everybody's hero that they all need to keep pushing and just to give their best. Garfield played Desmond and he played it like it was his last, so much power and emotions made role of his career in this picture. Weaving as Tom Doss is one of the biggest surprises, giving an extraordinary performance as he is believable and shows us every little thing about his struggle.

The action was honestly some of the most Intense I have seen in a Military Movie to date and I have watched a ton of Military films and I have studied military history. The depiction of the battle of Hacksaw Ridge was very authentic and extremely heart palpitating. The Japanese were and are in my opinion the greatest threat that Americans have ever faced in battle. They were extremely formidable and were not afraid to die at any given second. I digress but the battle was bloody and full of shock value but not unrealistic by any sense. The cinematography was honestly perfect in every shot and frame. I will close by saying this is honestly the Best Military movie I have seen to date including in my opinion surpassing ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Mel Gibson as always is a Beast of a director. I was honestly in tears at the end of the movie when they showed the real life interviews of the actual heroes of that real life event. Go and Watch this movie.",

This time around, at the heart of this cinematic cyclone is a more conventional character study; of a man torn by his need to serve in a fight against Japan and a strict moral code that prevents him from taking life.

Mr. Garfield sparkles as Desmond Doss, with the real-life's characters sweet earnestness and simple, religious convictions. The rest of the cast does well, too. Vince Vaughn is a convincingly tough Army sergeant. The battle field scenes are horrific and brutal. It is incredible that our fathers and grandfathers went through such horrors. Mr. Gibson brings it all back with a great directing touch and outstanding cinematography. As an Army veteran, I wanted to see the movie.

The standard boring music doesn't even matter, after you notice the big bad problem: there is no scenario, absolutely no intrigue or plot, nothing actually happens, there are no negative characters, there is no actual threat or problem to be solved, no twist, no surprise, nothing. So: boring. Predictable. Heroic. Anachronistic. Full of cliché-s. No plot whatsoever. Poor simple guy has small childhood trauma, grows up to be a fine man, goes to war, is a hero. Now, this might be a summary of a great movie; but in our case, it is everything you will find out in this one. There is, literally, nothing else. I am afraid of saying unrealistic as well, because the character was probably pretty much as depicted. Still, the portrayal is anachronistic, quite false. In fact, we have this huge powerful invading American army, smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic Japs (as expected) (no surprise here) (difficult to sympathize, but anyway, need to have some baddies around). And here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life, while his mates massacre their enemies all around, and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre, for a not-really clear reason.

He made the same mistake with We We Soldiers but in this one he kicks it up a notch. He must have looked at the average Call of Duty videogame or something because the troops move the way I did when I was playing soldiers as a kid.

147,30 January 2017,wittkecmission,10, The Angel,"First of all, I love Mel Gibson as a director. Not as a celebrity or as a wife-beater, but as an artist. Two of his films, Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, have both become instant favorites of mine. It's been 10 years since his last film, Apocalypto (which I haven't seen yet). When I heard he made a new film, I was hooked immediately. I suppose the main reason I love Gibson's directing style is because he gets really intimate with the content and characters of his films, close-ups and all. When I saw Hacksaw Ridge in a nearly-empty theater, my expectations were exceeded. The intensity of the battle scenes, and I cannot believe I'm saying this, rival those of Saving Private Ryan. During those scenes, the whole theater rumbled like an earthquake with the sounds of gunshots, flying bullets, mortars, grenades, and earth- shattering explosions. The gore was not in the least bit hidden or sugar coated. There was blood, bones, and limbless bodies galore! Because that's the way the Battle of Okinawa really was. Surprisingly, I wouldn't call the violence gratuitous but I know that other people would. Even casted B-movie actors Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington couldn't bring this film down. The only thing that I genuinely condemn about the movie was the portrayal of the Japanese soldiers, who were portrayed as a mix of savages and zombies. It's definitely an American propaganda film, but even so, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING.",

The first is a cheeky family romance as Doss is grows up and meets a girl; the second is a comedy where the men at the army base are getting trained; the third is the classic war movie action thriller out on the battlefield; and the final part in an uplifting piece of emotional drama which demonstrates the heart of the man. The way in which it appeared to cover everything to such a high level is extraordinary. Garfield displayed one of the best performances in his career. He managed to play a character who was sweet and innocent, who had the courage to stand up for his beliefs and who was prepared to give his life in order to save another's. A special performance in a special movie. Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell is also good. Here he uses his comedic skills brilliantly during the training section of the film. Hugo Weaving who plays Tom Doss, Desmond's father. A WW1 veteran who had become somewhat of a violent drunk, he is really good as a way of steering Desmond towards his moral compass. Not a major role, but an important one well executed. Gibson has done in directing this movie is portray the brutality of war in the most visually stunning way that also tugs at the heart strings very effectively. Great film.",

The word ""hero"" is used too lightly today, usually for multi million dollar earning sports stars...but these soldiers were the real thing. Mel Gibson has made a worthy tribute not just to the main character, but to all the brave guys who endured and sacrificed so much so that we can sit in our homes with the freedom to speak our minds. While I don't agree with the anti-Semitic views that Mel Gibson uttered when he was being arrested, I feel he has done his penance and shouldn't be ostracized by the Academy....and I bet there are quite a few among Hollywood's actors who have similar unacceptable views about Jewish people, gay people, anyone who is not white etc etc....but they are careful not to let it slip in public.

158,14 December 2016,howboutthisone_huh,5," extraordinary story, stupid movie","This movie is typical of what Hollywood produces about wars, and particularly what mel Gibson is involved in. The story is very poorly directed. If it wasn't for the subject matter, a movie like this would likely get panned. Mr. Doss was driven by his strong personal and religious convictions which the movie failed miserably to really explain deeply. Many parts of his story were told as if you were being tutored as school children. Are we all dumbing down? All movies based on a true story take some liberties with the facts in order to convey the story. I wouldn't have an issue if the story stayed true to Mr. Doss but instead it's boring and punctuated with cliché war threads. Interesting story, poor film making. For comparison watch ""paths to glory"", a film made over 50 years ago but light years ahead of this atrocity. Also, I strongly recommend watching the documentary produced about Mr. Doss with interviews of the men that he served with. On the other hand if you like special effects, blowing things up and watching body parts being torn apart, this is your movie; there's plenty of that. What it doesn't have is a script or a director who can tell Mr. Doss's story the way it should be told. It doesn't have a production designer who understands the historical period. And the whole thing looks like it was shot with video and converted to film. Lot of action in front of the camera, not so much behind the camera.",

161,8 February 2017,Figgy66-915-598470,10, A brilliant telling of our awful history,"8 February 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Hacksaw Ridge. Everyone should watch films like this. Everyone should share the horrors of war and realise what this world has gone through, what people do to each other and how futile it all is. As the years go on we still keep discovering stories that need to be told and this was definitely in that category. Desmond T Doss was a Seventh-Day Adventist and a CO, a Conscientious Objector, who felt it was his duty to join up not to fight, but to serve in another way. Following the Lord's commandment to the letter telling him thou shalt not kill, he refused to touch a gun, instead demanding he be allowed to go into battle as a medic. Meeting all kinds of resistance he stayed true to his faith and his beliefs and what followed was truly remarkable resulting in Doss becoming the first man in US history to be awarded the medal of honour having never fired a shot. Comparing this film to Saving Private Ryan does both films an injustice. Hacksaw Ridge, in no way detracts from the horror of Private Ryan, but stands out as one of those truly unmissable films. Directed by Mel Gibson, who has done an great job in bringing this tale of heroism to the screen, Hacksaw Ridge, before the bloodshed starts, is almost comedic at times and you find yourself grinning along with Andrew Garfield's infectious smile. Vince Vaughn did a pretty good job in his role as Sargent Howell,and Hugo Weaving was brilliant as Desmond's Father. This is a tale of our recent history, it needs to be told and it must never be forgotten, men like Doss and his beliefs alongside all our military both serving, retired and those no longer with us are the reason we go to work in normal jobs and live our normal lives. Well done!!!!",

As we've seen from some of his other directorial efforts, he is skilled behind the lens, even if many themes remain the same. From Braveheart (1995) to The Passion of the Christ (2004), Gibson has a tendency to be pretty brutal in the imagery he brings to the screen.

Being brought up on a diet of the Lone Ranger, Tarzan, Superman, etc where the hero steadfastly fights for justice for all, I do love stories about courageous people and especially ones where the good guys win. Hacksaw Ridge tells just such a story and most wonderfully it is true. Doss goes through his own personal battle of holding on to what he believes no matter the treatment he receives from both his fellow soldiers as well as the army commanders. He could have so easily given in but was determined to find a way of helping others, something he achieves in spades. But it is also a movie that reveals the courage of all the soldiers who fight in wars. How did these men find the guts to scale that cliff and face the barrage of bullets they knew were coming, how does anyone do that? Wonderfully acted and filmed. I admit to having grave fears about Garfield being capable of portraying Doss but wow he pulled it off so very well.

I've been a big fan of Mel Gibson's work despite the lows of his career, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is no exception. One of the biggest strengths of Mel Gibson's direction is that he doesn't shy away from depicting violence in his films, and with this film he shouldn't, war is one of if not the ugliest thing to exist in the history of mankind, war SHOULD be gory, it SHOULD feel like you're watching a horror movie. Andrew Garfield is very good as Private Desmond Doss, he perfectly portrayed the good hearted nature of his character, and his accent for the most part wasn't too distracting, the film also stars Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughn, and Sam Worthington, they too give very good performances in the movie, but most surprisingly of all we also see ""Point Break"" remake star Luke Bracey EASILY giving the best performance of his young career.

In that sense, Hacksaw Ridge is the most Jungian war movie ever made, and I'm not sure if that's entirely a great thing. It may be fascinating after the fact, that it could be a film that's worth talking about after it ends, but while watching it this dichotomy is bizarre. I think part of this too goes back to Francois Truffaut's quote about war movies, that it's very difficult, close to impossible, to make an anti-war film when the action itself makes war look like a bloody good action movie.",

189,18 November 2016,lacatusalexandru,10, One of the greatest war movies I've ever saw.,"Hacksaw Ridge is an excellent movie,it tells the story of Desmond Doss,a real hero who had done more than any man on the battlefied could had done.For me this movie was more than great,I think that it doesn't exist a word to describe how this movie was,the story was great,the actors were great and when you look at Desmond Doss,when he joined the army,after he refused to carry a weapon and after the beating he went through(he was beaten by his own comrades because he refused to carry a gun) and when everybody else left the battlefield and he continued to stay to help the other by himself,after all those thing you would think that it's impossible to see a person like him to do what he did.Again,this movie was and it will remain(for me) one of the greatest movies based on a true story as well as one of the greates war movies because this movie really showed the true face of a war(more precisely the true face of the World War II) and I would definitely recommend to watch it,not to mention that I'm sure this movie will get an Oscar.",

192,19 March 2017,colm-hearne365,9, A great come back for Mel Gibson,"I like Mel Gibson as an actor and director but I think he does better as a director and Hacksaw Ridge was a great return for him and it turned out to be one of my favourite war movies alongside Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan. But what makes Hacksaw Ridge so special is that it's based on the true story of Desmond Doss (played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield), a Christian soldier who refuses to take up arms and becomes a war hero in the Battle of Okinawa in World War II by single-handedly saving over 70 soldiers without firing a single shot nor killing anyone and in the end is awarded the Medal of Honour. And it just goes to show you that miracles can happen anywhere at anytime to anyone. I'm also glad that Hacksaw Ridge was a success both with critics and audiences and did well in awards season by winning 2 Oscars for Film Editing and Sound Mixing but I think Andrew Garfield should've won the award for Best Leading Actor instead of Casey Affleck because Manchester by the Sea is really overrated and underwhelming. I mean Garfield's character was more challenging because he had to play a real life war hero and had to put on the accent as well. But in conclusion, I just want to say I really enjoyed Hacksaw Ridge and I hope we will get to see more of Gibson and Garfield in the future.",

196,1 February 2017,PyroSikTh,8, One of the Most Horrifying Depictions of War,"Hacksaw Ridge is a movie very neatly divided, and each section is better than the last. The first act is all introductions and character building. We meet a young Desmond Doss and his brother, including a near-fatal scuffle between them, sowing the seeds of Desmond's stubborn anti-violence stance. We establish that their father is an abusive drunk, haunted by the horrors of World War One. Desmond grows up, shows an early sense of heroism, and meets his beloved in a whirling romance, before he decides it's time he went and helped defend his country. This opening section is weak, to put it bluntly. It's kind of boring, very cheesy, and mirrors classic Hollywood quite a lot (and in more than just costumes and hair-styling). It has it's high points for sure, but I was almost ready to chuck this movie under the bus at this point. Hugo Weaving single-handedly manages to keep this act engaging. In the hands of a lesser actor, the role could've easily drifted into cliché abusive father tropes, but Weaving manages to tap into the trauma behind the abuse and make him a sympathetic figure. His breakdown at the table when Desmond's brother appears in military garb is heartbreaking.",

This movie blew away people across the world and movie critics are scoring high. Desmond Doss's actions in the movie were based on truly heroic true events, which needed to be carried out with a lot of courage and bravery.

First of its depiction of war and its horrors was masterfully done, the war scenes were horrifically gory, the use of visual effects and makeup were to a degree of brilliance in these scenes. As we follow the protagonist through and through the battlefield the horrors we see just so brilliantly reflects the horrors of war, from the rats and maggots eating away the deteriorating bodies to the bodies with their internal organs out, it was like a scene from a horror movie, which makes it all the more powerful as we as audiences understand that this is in fact the 'truth of war'. It was very impactful, most importantly the atmosphere that the film sets up for the war scenes are truly indulging, through the use of smoke and special effects I really found myself sort of 'lost' in the horrors of this battle. Everything were presented in a very realist way, I remember quite vividly the scenes in which the men would just lift their heads and immediately get gunned down to their deaths or how many of the men dies almost instantaneously, this idea of how easily a life could be taken did leave a large impact on me.",

214,22 February 2021,rudicantfail,10, Blown away!,"Wow! Where to begin with this awesome piece of cinematic brilliance? I don't know how I have missed this classic up to now? Hacksaw Ridge is on par with the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", but unlike that movie, this keeps the hard, gritty drama going through out the whole film. I know that it is based on real events, and as usual, Hollywood has spun it in its predicable way, but look beyond that. I have read that Okinawa was a very bloody battle, and this movie does portray the absolute horror of the struggle between the Americans and the Japanese. As I said, it has been painted with the Hollywood brush, but one can only imagine the terrifying events that took place on that ridge, so I guess the battle scenes are particularly graphic. I was somewhat hesitant at the beginning of the movie, thinking it would not amount to much; it seemed to lack pace and interest. However, once the main character, Desmond Doss enlisted, the viewer quickly becomes captivated. Once again, the portrayal of man's hurtfulness towards other human beings due to that persons beliefs or religion are laid bare. Because Desmond Doss was a conscientious objector, and refused to bare arms, he became a target of harsh, brutal and physical harm. He was inflicted with physical and emotional pain, and this really starts to draw the viewer deeper and deeper into the movie, until the audience feel part of the story. It is harrowing, it is graphic and it is a journey. Brilliantly filmed. Highly recommended.",

I had heard it was bloody which was true in part. The battle scenes are confronting but I suspect quite realistic. How any soldier retained sanity after WW11 is a mystery. This movie engaged me from the beginning. Andrew Garfield played the role perfectly capturing a sense of strength, confusion and dignity mixed up with boyish charm. He was a fully rounded real person that perhaps confounds one but the strength of his conviction is compelling. This is a true story of a real hero. I was left in awe of his humbleness yet greatness. This is the sort of person we should hold up to our kids to emulate, rather than a Kardashian and their ilk. It was great to see so many Australian actors in the various cameo and supporting roles. All did a stellar job except perhaps Sam Worthington's American accent which kept slipping. Vincent Vaughan has such presence. I enjoyed his performance greatly.

227,23 April 2017,pniemeyer-47222,8, Truth is stranger than fiction,"Desmond Doss is one of those people whose story seems almost too perfect to be true. It's almost unthinkable that anybody would have the nerve to march into battle not carrying a weapon, and even more unthinkable that that person would somehow manage to save dozens of lives and win the respect of his armed peers in the process. But Desmond Doss did exactly that, and if the movie about his life portrays him as a gawky, unimposing saint, maybe that's just the way he was. Andrew Garfield is very good in the lead role here, bringing to life the sort of character who very easily could have felt like a cardboard cutout.

Mel Gibson might be a bit of a dick, but we have missed him as a director. Here he is at his sentimental best, holding back no punches in his personal views and making a pretty good damned film to go with it. Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who still wanted to do his bit in WW2, and how he works during one of the wars bloodiest battles. I've never been a massive Andrew Garfield fan. Oh the boy can act, but he always has this look of someone who is hurt, pining for a lost love. He has always looked weak to me. In this he has grown up though. It's ironic that it takes a film where he won't hold a rifle to show that he is indeed a man, a telling tale for the world today. This is a film where everyone is just great, and it has a cast where that's the last thing you expect. Vince Vaughan is the rough and ready drill sergeant, with Sam Washington as the Captain in charge. Special mention needs to go to Theresa Palmer (so underrated, loving her more and more in everything she is in) and most of all Hugo Weaving, who may well garner an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a broken father. The film does tug on the heart strings and probably takes some of the truths with a pinch of salt but this is exactly the kind of film we need in today's political climate. It is directed with maturity and gusto. Mel is a director not afraid to get his hands dirty and when the action is needed, he is among st the best in a realistic portrayal.",

So much that I saw it twice! Desmond Doss was a true American hero who was misunderstood and abused at first (because they took his religious beliefs for cowardice), but who eventually became a WW2 hero. In the end, he earned not only the respect of his fellow soldiers, but also the medal of honor. What did he do? He single-handedly saved 75 of his wounded comrades after the orders to retreat were given. Whilst doing all this, he was totally unarmed (by choice), with enemy soldiers on patrol. It was funny because Sargeant Howell said ""do not count on pvt. doss to save you on the battlefield because he will be too busy wrestling with his conscience to help"" but it was later proved that when the orders came to retreat, he was the only one to come back and save Sgt. Howell and dozens of others. It was awesome when he had gained their respect in the end and Capt. Glover, who had ridiculed Doss so much and tried to kick him out of his unit said he was wrong about doss, and begged him for forgiveness and to join them on a Saturday assault even though he knew it was Doss' Sabbath day because the other soldiers wanted Doss beside them on the battlefield.

To be part of a fight that was in all intent to the bitter demise of all those involved is something we in general will never know. War is not something that needs to be glorified.

240,13 March 2017,orpheus-73398,10, Great come back for Mel Gibson,"This was by far the best picture of the year and a great comeback for Mel Gibson. It didn't win best picture because of the politicization of the Oscars. No way that ""Moonlight"" even came close to this film. To win an Oscar now you have to be non-white and LGBT. It reminds me of how ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to a ho-hum movie ""Shakespeare in Love."" People still watch SPR but who ever talks about the other movie. So I predict that Hacksaw Ridge will become a classic while the other movies is well forgotten. Hacksaw Ridge, on the other hand, is a story that is so unbelievable because it stretches all credibility but hits us in the face because it actually happened. One of those ""no one would believe it if they made a movie"" but it actually happened. The courage of that man going alone, unarmed, except for his faith in God, directly into the mouth of hell. I am not a Christian but the devotional aspect of this movie was very inspiring. I would recommend anyone to see this movie and forget the other movie.",

243,5 November 2016,Troy_Campbell,7, A solid return for Gibbo.,"It has been ten years since Mel Gibson was calling the shots for Mayan saga Apocalypto, but his direction here is so confident and ambitious you wouldn't know it. It's like he never left. This true story is essentially split into three parts: the introductory story to our heroic protagonist, the training segment full of adversity, and the horrific battle between the Yanks and the Japanese atop the eponymous ridge. Each act is better than the last, with the family and romantic drama at the beginning slow and not totally convincing, the boot camp section predictable but highly engaging, and the extended war climax an immersive triumph. It doesn't come as a surprise that Gibbo feels most comfortable with the battle scenes—he is the director of Braveheart after all—and in this respect he is firing on all cylinders, creating a truly intense and visceral experience. The death and decay is gruesome and unsettling—you can almost smell the burning flesh and rotting corpses—but the savagery is necessary to generate the authentic juxtaposition of horror and heroism. Portraying Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to win the Medal of Honor, Andrew Garfield is put the through the wringer both physically and emotionally, ultimately giving a solid performance despite working with some cheesy melodrama at the start. The supporting cast are predominantly strong, particularly Hugo Weaving who acts the hell out of his drunken WWI vet and Vince Vaughn who dishes out a delightfully shouty and zinger-filled turn as Doss' drill sergeant. A moving tale of one man's struggle to stay true to his beliefs whilst helping his country in the most harrowing of circumstances, Hacksaw Ridge is proof that Gibson should be behind the camera more often.",
244,7 November 2016,theinspireroffaith,10, Simply as Good as it could have been,"It has been just a while since the movie released and I have already watched it three times. This movie is beautiful and emotional. Mel Gibson has made a perfect comeback and I do think, not appreciating his work and his film would be totally unfair. The score is the backbone to the film just like Braveheart. I really loved Rupert-Gregson Williams work and I would compare it to likes of Hans Zimmer and Late James Horner. The movie is more about a love story than War, instead this film actually condemns war. If the critics stop their hatred for Mel Gibson then this will certainly be Best Picture and will wind up the whole Academy Awards. Andrew Garfield's intense acting fuels the film and keeps you interested. The only problem that I found in the film was that a lot of actors had their accent, this I found quite minor and not notable. People complaining about the violence will be shocked to see how beautifully Mel has handled those scenes. I would compare it to Saving Private Ryan and I personally feel like I has an edge over Spielberg's Movie. I am myself a Jew and I don't like Mel Gibson for his Anti-Semitic attitude, but denying his art would be wrong. ****I LOVED IT****",

His work exceeds any prejudice and differences his critics might have, and this movie especially after overcoming the raw and realistic scenes of war, it only touches on human level, emotions that are undeniable for anyone, hence the recognition. The main character could have chosen not to enlist but his love for his country and his belief in God was a conviction at its best combination since we must admit it was a miracle he was able so save so many lives. A-must-watch movie, will leave you with what is really important in life: A belief in a stronger power all around us.

247,8 February 2017,billcr12,8, Gibson's War,"Mel Gibson may be a racist lunatic in his real world life, but he is one hell of a movie director. His eye for detail in Hacksaw Ridge is impeccable. Andrew Garfield is Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who will not carry a weapon or kill due to his Seventh Day Adventist upbringing. Early on, he encounters a bureaucratic wall, as the military informs him of the necessity of carrying a gun in combat. Doss eventually is able to travel to Japan as a medic and winds up in some extremely vicious and bloody battles near Okinawa in 1945, just before the end of World War II. The fighting scenes are fairly typical of previous war films and the basic training insult laden, politically incorrect drill sergeant are lifted from Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" Mel can be forgiven for this, as the character development is fully realized by Garfield and the supporting cast never hits a false note. The last few minutes are a beautiful tribute to a real American hero and Hacksaw Ridge is one of the ten best movies of the year.",

With Private Ryan, it was D-day and the landing of Normandy beach, France. With Hacksaw Ridge, it's the battle of the escarpment in Okinawa, Japan. Both were pivotal, defining battles towards the end of World War II. ",
249,3 July 2017,christophershobris,10, An Emotionally Powerful Film,"This film blew me away in all the right ways. I admit I cried a few...well more then a few times. What sells it for me is the superb acting by 4 people in particular. Andrew Garfield was outstanding, a completely different role and a real showcase of skill compared to the disappointing Amazing Spider-Man series. He portrays Doss beautifully in a way I think he would approve of. Watching him go through the struggles to become what he is and staying true to who you are and what you believe was what made me quite emotional throughout. Vince Vaughn, goodness what a surprise. He needs to be in more roles like this rather than the stale, run-of-the-mill comedies he often stars in. This is an entirely different Vince Vaughn that we rarely get to see. I was at first legitimately intimidated by his performance in a good way. As the film went on you see he's not a bad guy. As a whole Vaughn does a great job portraying such a complex character, that I thought he would never be able to pull off, I'm glad to say, he surprised me. Sam Worthington, going from the cocky but respectable Jake Sully in Avatar, to this powerful performance. He isn't in the much but when he is it is a delight to see. And lastly, Hugo Weaving, again like Worthington he isn't in it much, but he adds some mustard to this spicy film, and is different from what we are use to. Not make-up riven, just classic and wonderful on-screen acting. The film as a whole is beautifully done and Mel Gibson shows he can direct. Say what you will about the man, but he can direct. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is heartwarming, and the on-screen action is riveting. What else is their to say, I loved this film, and teaches self-worth in a way no other film has done. That's why it gets a perfect score, great film! Now to grade: Acting: A+ Music: A, Effects: A, Directing: A+, Story/Plot: A+. Overall: A+",

This story of Desmond Doss reminds of the books of David McCullough. He writes his books about people in American history that have too long not received their dues, and it's about time we gave credit where credit is due. That is how I feel about the main character in this movie. Why haven't I ever heard about him before now!? The gore in the battle scenes puts Walking Dead to shame, but it's about time we see what war is really like. It's not about parades and flags and fireworks; it's the hand to hand blood and fire, sweat, and unimaginable fear that these people endured. It is no wonder they are called the greatest generation. Desmond Doss is my new hero because of this movie, and it deserves every nomination it has received for every award. Bravo!",

260,17 November 2016,Geff,10, One of the best of the WWII film genre. Amazing.,"Hacksaw Ridge: I just saw it and had to write. I left the theatre in a deeply moved state. The film about America's only CO to win The Medal of Honor for heroism in combat is stunning in its realism and depiction of the horrors of the South Pacific Campaign in WWII. The story is true, and at the end of the film the real main character addresses some of the film's content. The special effects are incredible to behold, and the thunderous roar of the battleships' big guns is only topped by the barrage of huge explosions on Hacksaw Ridge. I was additionally attached to the film's content b/c my own father fought in three similar battles in the South Pacific in WWII. He never spoke of it. I only found out after his death in 2010 that he was awarded six medals during WWII and fought and survived three of the most savage battles in the war against Japan: Anguar Island, Peleliu, and Luzon. The film brings it all to you , and I realized that this is what my quiet, peaceful, unassuming father had kept to himself all my life.

Mel Gibson didn't even try to be subtle with the themes - everything, including spilled bloody guts and other anatomy, is splashed on your full-alert consciousness. Heck! The movie has no shades of grey but yet he delivers with a true story so amazing that my heart swelled up like a balloon. This is one of the most harrowing war stories ever put on screen and it is definitely not for the faint-hearted.

I see Saving Private Ryan as the definitive World War II film. The battles in this movie were comparably shot, maybe more cinematic as opposed to live action, but the comparisons stop there. What shines through the most in this film heart, the triumphant glory we normally see reserved for sports films. While Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington pleasantly surprised me, Garfield's performance really carried the picture.

In Ridge's case it's one of the best: Desmond Doss has become one of history's great 'conscientious objectors' of violence in war. He saved many lives during the Second World War, and he's still considered a hero by those he saved and those he loved. His exploits during the Battle of Okinawa proved a turning point in pacifistic participation in modern warfare, and this movie essentially spills blood around the character.

While many of today's war films offer ""war is hell"" chaos and fervor with an underlying tinge of anti-war proselytizing, Hacksaw Ridge dares to be different.

Yes it was violent, but to be honest the gory war scenes were necessary in order to give the viewer an idea of what Desmond Doss went through, the true atrocity of war, and a mans courage to serve when everything and everyone was against him.

Yes, the actions of Doss were heroic, but could he have accomplished what he did without a soldier with a gun beside his side doing the killing for him? And if that's the case, what's the difference? The Japanese soldier is not any less dead no matter who pulled the trigger and Private Doss is no less involved in the death of that soldier than if he had pulled the trigger. Is the soldier who pulled the trigger on Doss' behalf more morally stained by the act of killing for another? Perhaps less so since he stepped forward to perform a necessary evil when another would not. The movie tries to make all of this a black and white morality issue and it is so far from that.",

This movie is totally immersive, the combat scenes make you feel like you're really there. I have a whole new respect for Andrew Garfield because now that I've seen it, I couldn't picture anyone else in this role. You can tell he took a lot of pride in his depiction of Doss.Vince Vaughn was also really good in his role which was a surprise since he sticks to comedy most of the time. It was also a different shift of focus for a WWII film since most cover the fighting that took place in Germany. I think being from Lynchburg, VA myself allows me to feel extra pride in this story of a hero from my home town. If you haven't already, I can't recommend to see this movie enough.",

I can honestly say that the only war movie that comes close to this one's quality and realism is Saving Private Ryan. Realistic, gripping, and even humorous at times, Hacksaw Ridge is filled with beautiful cinematography and scenery, and great acting, particularly from Garfield, Vaughn, and Weaving. Garfield should certainly be nominated for Best Actor, and both Vaughn and Weaving could potentially win in the Best Supporting Actor category. The film also tackles controversial and heavy themes admirably, and doesn't pander to its audience, which I appreciate. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that it ends somewhat abruptly. I urge you to check out this cinematic achievement, and I certainly hope it wins big at the Oscars this year.",
300,29 September 2017,bryno92,6," Decent story, poor execution, laughable battle scenes","The film is split into 3 parts: The romance/backstory, boot-camp, and the actual war. The romance part was the most cheesy thing I have seen. I get that it's hard to really encapsulate romance in short amount of time, but they could of at least done a little better. Still, the buildup was decent enough to keep my attention. The second part of the movie was probably the best part. I won't spoil too much, but there was a lot going on that made it interesting. I will say that this part was a little too religious for me, but I knew that going into the movie. Now on to the actual battle part of the movie, this is honestly the worst depiction of battle I have seen. I felt like I was watching a cartoon for some reason. The actual battle map is the most ridiculous thing ever as well. One rope ladder? Are you serious? None of it was believable. It had the potential to be something, but they went for the Hollywood glorification. This is laughable compared to the battles in Saving Private Ryan. There was one scene where the main character was pulling a character on some sort of make-shift sled and the injured soldier was shooting and mowed down like 5 people. Not realistic at all. There is no emotional involvement in this film because the scenes made it so cheesy.",

In some epic moments, the music and the action make you cry. I thought the movie was going to be a little bizarre because Desmond Doss didn't want to kill during the war but after seeing it, I changed my mind. He saved a lot of lives without takes any other one and it's really amazing to say that this really happened in real life. The movie lasts 2 hours and 11 minutes but you don't really see the time going.

306,26 February 2017,Paulyreviews,8, Paolo's movie picks on Hacksaw Ridge,"After the great success with Bravehart, The Passion of Christ and Apocalypto, Mel Gibson makes a great comeback with Hacksaw Ridge. Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) enlists in the army during the American invasion of Japan ( World War II). However for his strong ethical and religious convictions he decides to do so without shooting (without ever handling a rifle), and after being vilified by all his comrades during the prep phase, will act as the doctor in the assault line of Hacksaw Ridge, on the coast of the island of Okinawa. Desmond Doss is a historical figure and is the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor from the American government. Fortunately (I hope I wont be bashed for this) the film does not become a tribute to the US Army, an exaltation of the war and its heroes. The battle scenes (stunning) are not only visually violent, but they're psychologically gut wrenching and portray the horrors in a sublime way. Very good interpretations by the entire cast. If this is your genre then it's a MUST SEE. Score: 8",

310,2 June 2018,adam-may-bower,8, Epic and Powerful,"'Hacksaw Ridge' may have its cheesy moments influenced by Hollywood blockbusters, but ultimately this film is an epic and powerful portrayal of the real-life hero Desmond Doss. Since the 1950's people were wanting to make the inspiring story of Desmond Doss into a film. The Christian who served in WWII without a single weapon and saved approximately 75 individuals is definitely a story worthy to be told on the screen, and after decades of several directors attempting to do so, Mel Gibson was fortunate enough to receive the green light and turn the story into a film. While I definitely think Gibson did a great job with this film, there were several moments that were quite melodramatic and cheesy - particularly with the approach to the love story of Doss and his wife Dorothy. However, that doesn't stop this film from being an amazing triumph. The acting is brilliant, with an A+ performance from Andrew Garfield who portrays Doss fantastically, and other highlights being Hugo Weaving and Sam Worthington. The action in this film is brutally realistic, with great direction by Gibson. There were some parts that seemed exaggerated and unnecessarily gory, but that's the realism of war - unnecessarily gory! The soundtrack Rupert Gregson-Williams is brilliant and really helps this film feel emotional and inspiring. Overall, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a great and inspiring film with only a few cheesy moments that rob the movie of being perfect.",

I also loved the fact that it is not trying to create cheap emotions but it stays real yet manages to be very powerful. It is definitely one of the best movies this year.

318,12 November 2016,charliesonnyray,9," A Great War Movie That Weaves Fact, Faith, & Fiction","It's been a while since a good old fashion war movie came out but if it was all building up to Hacksaw then it was totally worth it. Let's be honest: almost every ""based on a true story"" film has some made up parts. If it were completely true then the movie would be pretty boring. But for Hacksaw Ridge, most of it did actually happen and I am a bit shocked it wasn't made into a film earlier. Desmond Dos is a naive southerner who decides to join World War 2 despite the fact that he despises violence. He simply wants to help a unit as a medic but he finds opposition along the way as many believe he is simply a coward. By the end of the film though, he proves himself worthy of the title ""hero"". Andrew Garfield does a wonderful job of playing Desmond as he brings a simple charm to the character. He is very likable and I experienced some of the same emotions he was going through in the film. When he was frustrated, I was frustrated. When he was happy, I was happy for him. It felt like I was actually watching this man's life and not just a movie based on it. The other actors do a great job as well especially Vincent Vaughn who manages to be both funny and dramatic at the same time. The one thing about this film that might hurt it is the violence. The first third of the film is shot very beautifully and looks like an ideal vision of that time period. But the last third is all on top of Hacksaw Ridge which is piled with dead bodies, intestines, rats, blood, decapitated heads, you name it they got it. It works in a story sense because they never portray war as a pretty or fun thing but the film is also filled with Christian themes. Box office wise those Christian messages might have helped the film but because of it's R rating I doubt any youth groups are going to be piling into vans to see it. Which is a shame since the film is honestly a great representation of holding onto your beliefs no matter how others maybe feel about them. Over all, Hacksaw Ridge is a great film with a well structured story, likable characters, beautiful direction and tons of events to keep you entertained.",

Hacksaw Ridge is a great film, I was surprised by a direction by Mel Gibson, never seen a production commanded by it, but it shows incredible quality when it comes to portraying a war, with battle scenes being filmed with mastery, showing all the weight and the Horror of the battlefield. Perhaps the only ""negative"" points of the direction are attributed to some slow ""unnecessary"" movements. I also felt that ""something is missing"" in the scenes that start a movie story, and show a family, city and love life of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) character, but nothing that is extremely bad. Talking about Garfield, the actor is incredible, managing to pass on his character's ""innocence"" during the whole movie, making the viewer that this man really would die for his personal belief. Make an analysis of a change, putting a test one more time an ability to do, becoming more ""physical"". In short, the best Spider-Man in the theaters, shows that he has an undeniable talent throughout the film. The story, while not having anything great, is built very well, arresting the audience to the movie pace with certain ease, and thrilled in its ""climax"", in addition, all the cast of excellent support, For Hugo Tecendo, but making clear that the rest of the cast delivers what is expected, when necessary.

It tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a man who refused to even touch a weapon, who despite this, volunteered to serve as a medic in WWII and saved the lives of 75 to 100 men at Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Japan. He won the medal of honor and the deep respect of all his brothers in arms. It's a very moving and inspiring story, perfectly tailored to the sensibilities of Gibson as a filmmaker. In this film, He revisits the themes that we have come to know in each of his works. As with Braveheart, and Passion before it, HACKSAW RIDGE is a sacrificial love story. One man's love is tested and perfected through great suffering. Through the violence he finds redemption...Its obvious Mel Gibson is trying to reach that same audience that responded so strongly to The Passion. The violence is there, the biblical imagery is there, the higher spiritual plane is there, it's all there. Yet even though it gets the job done, it is certainly not a flawless film and doesn't quite reach the artistic peaks of his last two efforts...My biggest issue with this movie is how it doesn't try to break the mold with the characterizations. All of Desmond's fellow soldiers are stock characters. You have the funny drill sergeant. The guy with the New York accent. The guy with the funny nickname. You never really get to know these characters. They're just cliches. Another thing was with the war scenes, which are actually the highlight of the film. Yet, stylistically, it's admittedly a little strange with all the guys constantly flying through the air, i'ts a little over the top. Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers were prime examples of gritty, realistic, and involving WW2 films. And they had real characters with nuance and personality. Hacksaw Ridge is an inspiring true story with some brutal and well-directed war sequences, but with a lot of cliches. Now even though the movie works within the confines of conventions we've seen, it still manages to move you, which is what matters most. So overall I recommend it. I would've liked a little more grit and nuance with the characters but I Think with the audience they were trying to reach, the choices they made are somewhat understandable.",

This was actually an excellent movie and it wasn't about religion or war to me, it was a story of a man who wanted to do what he believed was the right thing for him based in what he believed which is all any of us can do. It is hard to say what you will do unless you have walked in someone's shoes, and this movie portrayed how there is more than one way to serve your country and still be true to yourself.",

Yet it exceeded all my expectations. We faith-people got used to our heroes being presented in minimized, exaggerated or convenient ways, while God they believed in is being put aside (sadly, Gifted Hands falls into this category with its ridiculous 'it's all in here/in your brain' catchphrase). This is not the case with Hacksaw Ridge. It takes the man Desmond Doss with all he was and lets him speak for himself. True, some of the family details were modified (e.g. Doss' real father was not that abusive and that incident with the gun happened with his brother instead of his wife; or, Doss didn't meet Dorothy in the hospital but in the church – perhaps their shared Adventist identity could've been exploited for an even more convincing narration), but the bulk of the movie is seeping with integrity towards Doss' story and character. Desmond Jr. himself told Mel Gibson he was amazed by how similar to his dad Garfield's impersonation was.",
357,21 December 2016,my-name-is-ns,10, Triumph of Spirit,"Battle depictions are always going to be gut crunching & emotionally disturbing whilst there is always that calm soothing subject to keep the platoon sewed, well this time it's in form of a godly medic in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 WWII. The incredible true story of Corporal Desmond Doss is genuinely heart wrecking and has been captured aesthetically on the big screen right from his uncustomary childhood to his admission into the B-Company breezing through a rather-fascinatingly presented love life. Mr Director strikes the right chord while sailing past the humanistic approach to ""hell of a battle"" churning out the triumphant as Spirit of an individual. Aptly titled as HACKSAW RIDGE, it's been supremely uplifted by it's cast & crew probably making it the Best Movie of 2016, even from the technical front. The movie climaxes with the clips of the real life soldiers expressing their grief and pain which might force out a drop of gratitude rolling down your cheek. Don't miss this masterpiece. 10/10",

It is obvious that most of the scenes are made in front of a blue screen. I doubt there is any scene that's made outside the studio. Acting is okay per se, but not superb. There are some inconsistency in the story line. There is not much detail on the night of which Doss was left ""alone"" on the ridge, that is highly unlikely, not with Japanese soldiers scouting the area. Maybe Mel should spend more time and provide more details or make it less dramatic. It needs more explanation on why he turned to a ""conscientious objector"". If you like this kind of movie, watch saving private Ryan. It is better. Though Mel did a better job on describing gruesomeness of the battle field.

The pretend American accents were so bad they were distracting and many of the settings seemed false, especially those around Hacksaw Ridge itself.

366,30 March 2017,jpozenel,6, Could have been a great movie,"If it hadn't been for the typical overdone battle scenes, this could have been a great movie and a tribute to the man it was about. Anyone who has had any kind of military training can see that the battle scenes were totally over the top and unrealistic. There didn't seem to be any kind of battle strategy. There were so many weapons that never have to be reloaded, and when they fire them, they almost never miss the target. Even fully automatic weapons being sprayed wildly never seem to miss. Go to a shooting range and see how many there can shoot anywhere near that good, and those are the ones that go there on a regular basis. If you've never been, see if you can rent a gun. You'll be surprised at how difficult it really is. Granted, a rifle is much more accurate than a pistol, but in the high stress of battle, it's not going to be like shooting at targets. People that believe this kind of ""action"" are the same ones that probably think that police can shoot the guns out of the bad guys hands. It's just impossible to shoot that rapidly with any kind of accuracy. This was a golden opportunity to make a really good movie about an important character in American history, but it missed the mark. Life is not a video game.",

Next thing the viewer sees is the younger brother grabbing a brick and hitting his brother on the head. The mother and father quickly pick up their eldest of two sons, hoping their other son did not kill him, as he passes out. Nevertheless, the younger brother, whom is Desmond looks at the crucifix on the wall probably thinking he is going straight to hell if his brother dies. Flash forward a couple of years later. By now, you know the father beats up the mother, and possibly both his children because he is a drunk that was in WW I and cannot live with the atrocities of war and losing his friends in the military. In the meantime, Desmond takes an injured person to the hospital and meets his future wife who is a nurse with beautiful red hair with blue eyes. Desmond is quite mesmerized with her so much so that he must donate blood, a task that she has been assigned to that particular day. While there, he decides he wants to be a medic in the army. Desmond's brother enlists as well as all the rest of the boys in their town. Desmond feels it is his duty. Flashforward to basic training with Vince Vaughn as his sergeant and his fellow officers. They are all friends and getting along until Desmond will not bear arms. However, he is an Adventist and will not bear arms to kill a soul. He feels he can fulfill his duty as a medic. Then, the top officials in the ARMY find out his dilemma. They court marshall him. I won't spoil this part for you. Then, he goes overseas to Japan. While over there, the soldiers are made to learn everybody is different in a life changing way and not everybody is what they seem. The viewer definitely sees the ugliness of a war and the pure hell of death, but with this film's fabulous way of inspiring a man, it is most definitely worth seeing. A very original film and the best one I have seen in a very long time. Kudos to Mel Gibson.",
380,15 April 2019,PWNYCNY,9, Hero without a gun.,"This is a good movie. A conscientious objector wins the Medal of Honor. Shows that one need not use a weapon to be a hero. It also shows the fanaticism of the Japanese troops who had zero chance of winning, yet would rather die than surrender. The movie would have been stronger if it had provided more historical context to the story. For instance, why the US found it necessary to invade Okinawa and why the Japanese fought fanatically to defend it. The movie presumes that the audience knows the history of the US-Japanese war in the Pacific. It also does not provide more depth into the characters and personalities of the Japanese soldiers who, without exception, are ALL depicted as mad, blood thirsty maniacs. Nevertheless, the movie succeeds in telling a story of one man who stayed true to his principles and emerged a hero.",

Firstly, the main character who plays Doss is so achingly awful in the beginning of the film that it is hard to watch. The scenes where he interacts with the woman who later becomes his wife are so cringe worthy I wanted to turn away. The action scenes in the film are pretty amazing but it just lies flat. The scene where Vince Vaughn is killing the Japanese while Garfield pulls him along on some type of material while rescuing him is just ridiculous and more suited to a teenage video game. Its an interesting story but the ending just leaves you with nothing. They spend a huge amount of time including his love interest in the story and then you never hear from her again. I also found it weird that they included the scene where he almost kills his brother at the beginning and then discounts this scene by saying he chose to never touch a weapon after he held a gun to his Father's head. I love war films but this was disappointing on all levels. Unbroken, fury etc. are just far better films. I really don't know what all the carry on is about. Its lazy and the ending is cop out.

It's a shame Mel Gibson's past haunts him (for right or wrong), because we need his movies. This movie may have also revitalized Andrew Garfield's career, because after two mediocre Spider-man movies, I was afraid he would drift off into irrelevance. The acting, writing, and directing were all phenomenal, but a characteristic that is often over-looked is cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is incredible. The battle scenes in this are also amazing. I never been in war, but if it is anything like this movie it is truly hell on earth. Mel Gibson has never been hesitant when it comes to brutality and gore, and this movie is no different. I felt like I almost needed to take cover behind my couch watching this, as bullets were going to fly out of the TV. There are also some truly suspenseful moments as well.

Films like American Sniper, 13 Hours and Patriots Day, that play extremely well with audiences across America and provide soaring box-office returns, but are scoffed at by films critics as being cliché, jingoist, patriarchal.. you name the buzz word.

The heroism as depicted on screen is hard to believe, although in reality Army Medic Desmond T. Doss really did indeed achieve what any normal human being would imagine to be the impossible. While it understandably takes a while for the background story to be established, once the action starts the 'lead to air' ratio increases to the max. Director Mel Gibson and crew clearly pulled out all the stops to make the action scenes as realistic as possible. Some might even say the combat scenes are a little overdone, but then again you would have had to have been there to know for sure. Despite the various references to 'action' in this review, it's important to conclude by emphasizing the movie also tells a great story and encourages the viewer to reflect on the human costs of war.",

I believe Mel is brilliant, and not just with the war scenes. From beginning to end, Doss's life and journey and convictions amaze me. Getting to know the main character, and knowing this movie is based upon truth makes it more all the more incredible. The protagonist's internal conflict is real - and we see that. Great hero. Great movie. Great directing and acting by all the cast. I don't know movie terminology, but all involved in this film - excellent. Hacksaw Ridge is the real deal.",

And indeed, everything here is writ large - from the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains (or convincing Australian substitutes thereof), to the awe-inspiring wonder and purity of the love interest in the film between Desmond Doss (as superbly played by Brit Andrew Garfield) and Dorothy Schutte (played with total commitment by a simply exquisite Teresa Palmer), to the spectacle of the drunken-aggressive-shellshocked apparently-hopeless WWI veteran that is Doss's father stepping back into uniform and pulling himself together to save his son from court-martial; and through to some of the strongest and most trully appalling battle scenes you have ever seen - in what is an amazing and shocking contrast with the earlier part of the film, if only a confirmation of the message about war Doss received from his broken father (here played wonderfully by Hugo Weaving).

Then I realized the10 star ratings were those who were truly moved by the movie.while the 1 star ratings were those that thought the movie should somehow be a documentary with real footage exclusively. One genius self proclaimed vet of multiple wars had a problem with the cargo net used to ascend the ridge being in his view as not at all plausible.

He is backed up by Teresa Palmer as his future wife and Luke Bracey whose career is growing as a fellow soldier.",
418,1 February 2017,jboothmillard,8, Hacksaw Ridge,"From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Mel Gibson (Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ, Apocalypto), this film served as his big chance to return to form, he has had it hard the last few years since his drunken outbursts and conflicts. Based on the true story, young Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce) was traumatised and his religious beliefs reinforced after he almost killed his brother Harold ""Hal"" (Roman Guerriero) during an argument, hitting him on the head with a brick. Years later, Desmond Doss (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Andrew Garfield) saves a man injured by a car, taking the man to hospital he is instantly smitten with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), they soon start dating and fall in love. The majority of his town, including his brother Harold ""Hal"" (Nathaniel Buzolic), are enlisting in the army to fight in World War II, having learned about medicine from Dorothy's work, Doss is motivated to sign up. Doss's father Tom (Hugo Weaving), a troubled veteran of the First World War, is upset at the thought of losing his sons, having lost his childhood friends, with his beliefs as a conscientious objector, Desmond intends to serve as a combat medic, before he leaves Dorothy accepts Desmond's proposal of marriage. At Fort Jackson, under the command of Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), Doss excels physically, but is immediately an outcast from his fellow soldiers, refusing to handle his rifle and train on Saturdays, due to his beliefs. Howell and Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) cannot get Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons, Doss is put through gruelling labour by Howell, his fellow soldiers turn against him, mistaking his beliefs for cowardice, they try to get Doss to leave of his own accord, and despite a beating one night, Doss wants to continue training. The squad complete basic training and are released on leave, Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but he is arrested for insubordination, Dorothy visits him in jail and tries to convince him to plead guilty to be released without charges, but Doss does not want to compromise his beliefs. In the trial, Doss pleads not guilty, before he is sentenced his father barges into the courtroom with a letter from a Brigardier General stating that his son's refusal to carry a firearm is protected by an Act of Congress, the charges are dropped and Doss marries Dorothy. Doss and his unit are assigned to the 77th Infantry Division, to participate in the Battle of Okinawa, they are reliving the 96th Infantry Division, tasked with climbing the cliff face of the Maeda Escarpment, nicknamed ""Hacksaw Ridge"", to battle the stationed Japanese forces, artillery bombardments from the U.S. Navy have had little success, U.S. forces have been pushed off the ridge repeatedly and suffered heavy casualties. In the initial fight both sides suffer heavy losses, Doss successfully saves several soldiers, including those with injuries that appear too severe to survive. The Americans shelter for the night, Doss spends the night in a foxhole with Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey), the first of his squad to call him a coward, Doss reveals his aversion to holding a firearm is due to a night where he nearly shot his drunken father after he threatened his mother with a gun, Smitty and Doss make amends. Next morning, the Japanese drive the Americans off Hacksaw Ridge, launching a massive counterattack, Smitty is killed, while many Americans, including Howell and Doss' squad mates, are severely injured and have been behind on the battlefield, Doss hears the cries and decides to run back into the carnage to save them. Doss spends the entire day and night carrying and dragging wounded soldiers to the edge of the cliff and rappelling them down on rope, Doss prays each time to save one more, the rest of the unit below are shocked by the arrival of dozens of wounded soldiers presumed dead. Day breaks, Doss rescues Howell, they escape enemy fire and finally escape Hacksaw, Captain Glover tells Doss the man have been inspired by what they see as a miracle, and that they will not launch the next attack without him, despite it being Doss' Sabbath Day, he joins his fellow soldiers to care for the wounded, with extra reinforcements they begin to win the battle. Falsely surrendering Japanese soldiers create an ambush, Doss manages to save Glover and others, knocking grenades away with his bare hands, one of which wounds him, Doss is safely lowered down the cliff, clutching the Bible that Dorothy gave him. Desmond Doss saved the lives of 75 men, he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman, the first time in history for a conscientious objector, Doss stayed married to Dorothy until her death in 1991, he died aged 87 on 23 March 2006. Also starring Rachel Griffiths as Bertha Doss, Richard Roxburgh as Colonel Stelzer and Luke Pegler as Milt ""Hollywood"" Zane. Garfield gives a splendid performance as the man who risked all to save many, Vaughn and Worthington do well also, it is an extraordinary story of bravery and courage, there are the odd sentimental bits, but it really grips you with its high amount of violence on the battlefield, it really proves that against catastrophic odds, doing the right thing is not impossible, a brilliant, must see biographical Second World War drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

I don't think I will ever see better movies than what Mel has been putting out there lately. Keep it up please!!! In these dark times in our world we need more of such eye-opening films to show the reality to our ignorant selves.

The war scenes would have been 10 times more effective if Gibson and his crew eliminated the use of Computer generated blood and gore.

The plot moves at a reasonable rate and the movie never feels like it's slowing down for any unreasonable reason. The movie gives a good explanation of his motives and you really understand why the guy was a pacifist and how difficult it was being in his shoes. The movie seems really historically accurate; there aren't too many ""Hollywood"" moments, where the hero gets saved at the minute, excluding the moment at the courthouse where he's getting court-marshaled. About half-way through the movie, the violence really starts to kick up a notch. The first scene in ""Japan"" you see a bunch of bloody dead bodies as they are brought past the soldiers. From then on, there is astonishingly disturbing and accurate war violence. Men are blown to pieces, people are shown disemboweled and with bullet holes through their bodies and without legs or with muscle showing. Trust me, this review does not do justice how gory this movie is. I implore you, once again, if you are even remotely put off by gore to avoid this movie, as it is unremitting past the one hour mark. If you can make it past the extreme gore, however, the movie is really good, well worth your time. The storytelling is excellent and the dialogue is very accurate.

457,11 November 2016,doctor_ledo,10, The Creative Mel Gibson Returns,"Desmond Doss with serious faithful sincerity and a ludicrous Southern accent, was the first conscientious objector in his words. It's a movie about a pacifist in wartime that wants to celebrate the subject's moral code while also reveling in the blood and guts of battle. It's a story of faith and humanity told by a man with, let's call them extremely suspect views. It's a movie that seeks to honor an honorable man, but does so at the expense of other honorable men. His father, a traumatized World War I veteran and violent alcoholic, beats Doss and his brother and mother, and Doss fears the same violence within himself. So he swears off guns and violence and clings tightly to his Bible. It's the first movie Gibson has directed since ""Apocalypto"" 10 years ago and i expect he will get Oscar for his directing.the only deficient thing But one surprise, given the drama of pacifism-versus-war that the movie has set up, is that there's never a single scene in which Desmond has to consider violating his principles and picking up a weapon in order to save himself or somebody else. A scene like that would have brought the two sides of ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" the violent and the pacifist — and, implicitly, the two sides of Mel Gibson — crashing together. But that would have been a different movie. One that, in the end, was a little less safe.Good movie and Bravo Great Mel Gibson.",

Everything in this movie worked and I don't have any complains, and I don't want to spoil any scene for you.. *ONE ADVICE - don't watch trailer for this film, it will ruin some great scenes for you, and spoil some important ones!!",
460,7 August 2017,eddiecatone,7, Mel Gibson sticks to his guns,"""A single man, driven by faith endures all possible torments without giving up hope."" I think this works quite well for most of Mel Gibson's films from ""Braveheart"" (1995) to ""The Passion of the Christ"" (2004) and the brilliant ""Apocalypto"" (2006). ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is no exception telling the story of another man of faith and determination, a man who ""sticked to his guns"" however this idiom sounds particularly ironic in this case because the man in question, corporal and U.S army medic Desmond Doss achieved military glory while being a conscientious objector that refused to carry or even touch a gun or any other weapon.",

Life is messy and we often find ourselves having live in the awkward space created by seemingly conflicting moral priorities. This becomes all the more complicated when those priorities are tested in the context of the battlefield. Andrew Garfield shines in this film as he portrays a man clinging to two such seemingly irreconcilable convictions. How does a man who won't even carry a gun serve his country's military? It's complex and it's difficult and it's beautiful. Well-worth the watch.,
469,17 November 2016,Oberrated,9, A rarity to ever take your eyes off the screen,"From start to finish, 'Hacksaw Ridge' practically demands attention. From the early phases of backstory and developing the ""who is Desmond Doss?"" answer, to the 100 mile an hour action sequences. 'Hacksaw Ridge' leaves its audience in awe at what is occurring on screen, and as previously stated before; this is a film to see for the year... Andrew Garfield does such a phenomenal job at portraying the kind-hearted Desmond Doss. In an environment filled with rough and tough characters and an enemy with nothing but bad intentions, Garfield creates a loving and heart warming character that you can not help but smile at... The battle scenes were incredible. From the very start, my jaw was floored and I could not take my eyes off the screen. It was just a constant barrage of chaotic action. Quite possibly one of my favorite aspects of this film due to the sheer intensity of the action portrayed... Lastly, I was very impressed by how Mel Gibson and company took true accounts said by Desmond Doss himself and inputted them into the film. Without spoils, this was very pleasing to watch as it happened.",
470,26 April 2018,blrnani,8, A masterpiece of filmmaking!,Mel Gibson has managed to portray the integrity of an individual standing by his beliefs and insisting on serving his country in the best way he knows - despite that country's sometimes perverse efforts to thwart his intentions and challenge his faith - while simultaneously portraying with frightening realism the savagery of modern warfare that showed up so starkly everything the hero was against.

484,4 December 2016,ccorral419,8, Both Garfield and Gibson could be a dark horses here for Lead Actor /Director recognition.,"Yup, Mel Gibson (the director) is back, as he presents the true story of Conscientious Objector WWII medic Desmond Doss (well acted by Andrew Garfield ""The Amazing Super-man"" 2012), who served during the Battle of Okinawa without firing a shot and received the Medal of Honor. While the first part of the film is a bit of a cheesy set-up love story between Doss and Dorothy (Teresa Palmer ""Break Point"" 2015), the actual story that follows, Gibson's final battle scene, the writing by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, and the battle cinematography by Simon Duggan make the wait well worth the build-up. Unfortunately, Doss's reluctance to ""bear arms"" gets lost in the initial love story, until it become evident that this is the reason for the story. It also doesn't help that Vince Vaughan (""The Break-up"" 2006"") is completely miscast as Doss' s loud and confrontational Sgt. Howell. Vaughn looks out of place in this role, in both his presence and dialogue delivery. The same goes for many of the interactions Doss endures with his fellow barrack-mates, and the under utilized Rachel Griffiths (Brothers & Sisters"" 2006- 2011) as Doss's mom. However, just when all seems ""just another film,"" the battle begins and the film turns into breathtaking greatness. Much like the initial scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" when the battle and struggle begins one can only hold on for the experience that is presented. Both Garfield and Gibson could be a dark horses here for Lead Actor /Director recognition. Mel Gibson is back, at least as a director, and you should get reacquainted with him here again.",
485,15 May 2017,lordgachu,10, A movie worth watching,An excellent piece of work by Mel Gibson. This film deserves highest rating cause there is no single boring moment from beginning to end.

487,15 February 2017,majaho21,9, It has it all - a great film!!!,"At the moment when I watched the very first second of the trailer, I knew I had to watch this film. First, it was directed by Mel Gibson which was a great sign that it would to be a hit(although I still don't understand his talking-to-beaver role :) Then, it was based on a true heroic story and it has a lot of action. Since Mel Gibson is a master of directing war and action scenes, the film had a big chance of becoming as successful as Braveheart. In my opinion, they're equally good. *SPOILERS* What I liked about the film is that you can really relate to all the Doss's feelings. Andrew Garfield did a great job of expressing his inner self. The audience can feel every slightest change in his tone of voice and every look. When he is in love, you feel his joy. When they beat him in the barrack, you feel his pain. And you fear for his life when he's under fire. What I also like is the sense of true brotherhood between soldiers depicted in the film. They were afraid when they saw a cart of corpses - their fellow American soldiers. They knew that they could be next in just a few minutes or hours. So, they paid them respect, they took off their helmets and they bowed. There is a thin line between life and death at the battlefield. The structure of the film is interesting. It starts with a playful and romantic Desmond who starts to feel a duty to protect his homeland. Along the way he meets his future wife. The beginning is idyllic and colourful. Then the film shifts to the military green. Desmond knew that he had once made a promise and that he had to keep it at all cost - He Will take no lives - not even in the battlefield. Desmond grew up at this point and took the responsibility of protecting his fellow soldiers. The third part is action, action, action! The grayish, burnt land, bullets everywhere, exploding mines and grenades and amid all this craziness there is a man without a gun helping others and saving lives. It is hard to believe that this kind of a brave man ever existed. A true hero!",
488,14 December 2016,atmjameel-1,10, Let all see it,"So much has been written and said of this film that anything more from me would be insignificant. Since its release I have looked at the Budget and been closely looking at earnings thus far (as I thought that initially it was unjustifiably weak) subsequently I wanted to see earnings break-even with Budget and go beyond to make sufficient money to do justice to the noble contribution the long list of about 35 producers. Following that its my humble suggestion to Mr. Mel Gibson and the producers that this film be made available free for viewing through channels like Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and so on, such that as many people as possible around the world see it and benefit from the message this amazing film carries. Also I suggest the film be dubbed in as many languages in the best way possible to be viewed by a wider audience world over. Oh & I mean Dubbed not subtitled as I find subtitles painfully difficult to catch-up with as they are a big distraction from the narration of any film. My suggestion is based on the fact that during 70's & 80's in India one film maker the respected Mr. Manoj Kumar used to make patriotic and social issues based films for whom the Govt of India would waive off the taxes so that as many people as possible can see the films and benefit from them. I sincerely hope my suggestion is looked into seriously!",

After it ended, it got a standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination..

493,21 December 2016,buzzkill-28812,10, Emotional and Impactful,"Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most impactful war movies of the year. I am a fan of war movies to start, but this movie brings great things to the genre. The story is full of morals that will move everyone in a way. The main story follows a conscientious objector as he joins the army during World War II to make a difference with his fellow soldiers, even if that means he does not prefer to kill. His challenges include his fellow soldiers and officers who do not take him seriously as he must prove himself that he is just as determined to make a difference. Throughout the movie, he is motivated by God as the driving force for his volunteering into the army and his Christian morals that stop him from holding a weapon. I am an atheist, and this story moved me by his faith. I can respect a person's religion if it for a good cause, and his faith in the movie pushes him fight for what he believes in and in the end, enables him to save dozens of soldiers without firing a shot. He kept pushing himself to save as many soldiers as he could. The visuals in the movie are stunning and as gory as Saving Private Ryan, which I appreciate, because it really emphasizes the struggle and hell soldiers have gone through and can make us appreciate their sacrifices more. We cannot sugar coat war, because war is hell and we need to be presented with the challenges they face, especially the soldiers from the great wars. This movie is emotional and impactful and highlights the strength and preference humans have in them when they are motivated by a cause they truly believe in. Hacksaw Ridge, is my favorite movie of 2016.",

It is real, raw, and is definitely not for those who can't handle blood! Its lack of swearing is unique to this genre, but the brutality of some of the scenery makes up for the missing profanity. It puts you in the heart of someone's moral struggle of wanting to help, but being unwilling to submit to changing one's self. It makes you think about where you personally stand on issues, while causing you to reflect on the history of America and the very real battles we faced. It makes you respect those who have come before us all, and what their families and love ones have overcome.",

I have never been to war or any armed conflict, but I believe that this film would be a rather accurate portrayal of what that hell would be like. Garfield was a lovable character that brought live to the mythos of Doss. As a man who has strong personal beliefs, Doss/Garfield is willingly thrust into a torment that puts all of his creeds to the test. As most movies that are based on a true story or a real person do, there is a small scene at the credits with the actual people, I was touched by this point. A very good film.",

502,25 December 2016,sachu018,9, One of the best war movies ever made!!!,"#DevilsLordReviews 11. Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Director : Mel Gibson Genre : Drama,War,History Starring : Andrew Garfield,Vince Vaughn,Sam Worthington,Luke Bracey,Hugo Weaving,Teresa Palmer Another one of the most expected films this year for me since the time i saw its trailer and also the director - MEL Gibson. We all know he is a great actor and an awesome director as well from his previous films like Braveheart,Apocalypto,Passion of the Christ etc. The film shows the experiences of Desmond Doss an American army medic who served during the battle of Okinawa (WW2) who is a pacifist and a very religious man who refuses to carry a gun or any weapon and refuses to kill anyone,even then becoming the first person to receive Medal of Honor without firing a single shot. The film can be divided into two halves where first half shows the childhood and adolescence of Desmond and how he joins the US army as a medic and second half shows the brutality of war and how Desmond saves the lives of 75 army men single handedly and what he witnesses and experiences in the war forms the rest of movie. Movie mainly focuses on anti-war elements and really shows how brutal war can be.Mel Gibson who is known for portraying brutal scenes beautifully does it this time too and the way he blends brutality and faith is just awesome.Some scenes were really scary that even it shook me from my seat and i was like dammmnnnnnn!!!! Cinematography is really great and war scenes are just beautifully shot. Coming to performances,Andrew Garfield is the one we should mention first (ofcourse!!!) He became popular by doing The Amazing Spiderman and was well appreciated by all for portraying a teenage amateur spidey really well. This role was like a big opportunity for him to prove his acting skills,that its not just limited to that of a typical teenager role and he just nailed this role. He was really living as Desmond Doss i would say.His performance was so moving and touchy. A definite Oscar worthy performance from the guy.Vince Vaughn,Hugo Weaving,Teresa Palmer,Luke Bracey all gave great performances but the guy who surprised me was Sam Worthington. I never thought he was able to act this mature. It was really great to see him in such a mature and serious role and he really did well. So all in all a very well made war movie and probably one of the best action sequences we have got in the last few years too.Mel Gibson's direction,performances from the whole cast,breathtaking action scenes and cinematography all these makes this film a must watch movie this year and probably one of the best movies released this year.Where people who have killed 160 or more people are celebrated as heroes and movies are made on them,i think a guy like Desmond Doss who saved 75 lives and even tried to save some Japs,that too without even touching a weapon or firing a shot is the one who should be celebrated and declared as real hero (just my opinion).So don't miss out this awesome movie from theatres everyone. Its a must watch for all. Give it a try and you wont regret it. My Rating : 9/10",

504,8 November 2016,szadhik,2, complete waste,"I've to tell you I left the movie before the end. We were forced to watch the war. The movie was very light in the inception. We expected a comedy type movie when Vincent Vaugh appeared first, conversely the movie turned out to be a complete blood bath. When war started, I worried that when it will stop.I completely could not resist the war and left it. Also one guy has automatic rifle on one hand and he is holding a dead torso of other man. You do not see this sort of action even in Bollywood movie. The very first opening was a disaster with ships bombarding the fire and bombs. You can do animation however too much animation simply kills. Instead of a full bloodbath, the movie could be made a war comedy as it was difficult to be serious and the main character still cannot lead the movie. Hope we'll not have to see this sort of movie often however this movie started to get good votes. The war scene was unnecessary. At one point it was not clear whether I was watching a X Box game or a movie. The movie timing simply dragged on without any substance.",

509,1 October 2017,merrib13,10, What An Incredible Movie,"It is such an incredible movie with amazing actors, and the battle scenes are so realistic, it may be considered too mature for some audiences. The story told though the main character as he struggles and suffers for his belief but never wavers is a truly inspiring tale. Even more so because its true, every bit is true, they even had to leave some things out of the movie because they knew people wouldn't believe it actually happened. His heroic actions in the end of the movie was so moving my sister and I were pride crying. Yes that's actually a thing. Anyway, its movie with a fantastic story line. Would definitely recommend it as one of my top rate movies of all time.",

512,3 December 2016,pc95,7, Remarkable Story a Bit Overcooked,"(Major Spoilers) Director Mel Gibson has a flare for the dramatic in ""Hacksaw Ridge"", and the blasting score and unrelenting violence is lathered on a little heavy for this reviewer's taste. Not knowing the story, I find it difficult to fathom that all fellow troops sat idol while Private Doss lowered down man after man after man. No one bothered to help him apparently. Performances range from very good from Weaving, to good from Garfield and Worthington, to out-of-place for Vince Vaughn. Stealing the show for certain though about a third through is introduced Aussie Luke Bracey - a breakout movie for him as Smitty, owning most every scene he's in. Although he's in a supporting role, he's magnetic, and Gibson figured it out. The movie, a tale of 2 halves is beautifully shot, but the music gets a little much as does the violence - a misplaced glory with it sort of feels off-kilter and strangely hypocritical between content and portrayal. Still recommended though for the captivating story. 7.5/10",

I know people will say, ""What about Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now"". This movie had elements from all war movies,, but what made it different was the war-hero was a bad-ass without shooting one bullet. I have to say that Mel Gibson is back and better than ever! The way he told this story and filmed it was phenomenal. Definite Oscar Nom, if not win. And Andrew Garfield. He went from a Marvel teen actor to a definite Oscar winner. His performance was breathtaking. But one of the biggest surprises in this movie had to be Vince Vaughn. I mean the casting people couldn't have picked a better person for this role and you would have never expected it. He was just the right amount of comic relief you needed and at the same time he played a very realistic sergeant.",
517,25 November 2016,reid-hawk,4, Like two completely separate movies mixed together,"This movie is a painfully average picture filled with great battle scenes. The acting is fine. Hugo Weaving does a great job as the drunk a**hole dad and everyone else is passable (except maybe those cringy child actors who cant fake a hit to save their lives). The lighting is horrible. It's painfully obvious that every non-battle scene has a sh*tty looking bright filter put on top of them all, which really makes no sense. Why would you make the film seem so fake when all the battlefield scenes are made to seem extremely realistic? Let's not forget how cheesy the story is too. It's the clichéd awkward boy meets cute girl, they fall in love, and then their plot is completely dropped from the story just like every single other subplot in the film. The film makes a huge jump from our hero surviving the threat of getting court martialed by the meany military men to straight into battle. I mean I was thankful that we got to finally leave the godawful bootcamp sequence(which basically is a much worse version of Full Metal Jacket's bootcamp complete with Vince Vaugn doing the most unconvincing job of a drill instructor I think I have ever seen in a big budget movie) but the jump completely slices out every part of the story that it had just created and never reintroduces them back into the movie. Now compare the clichéd beginning of this movie (as well as the clichéd ""super patriot"" ending) to the visceral and brutal battle scenes. It's as if this movie has two different directors. One is the real Mel Gibson, who basically sh*ts blood, guts, and mutilation on the screen for an incredible hour, and the other is Mel Gibson who lost his testicles and uses cable. Basically the film boils down to this (if I haven't already made this blatantly obvious). Battle scenes (besides the terrible CGI boats and cannons)= good. Dialogue, characters, and the beginning and end of the film = bad. Overall the film isn't as terrible as I am making it sound, but lets end this circle jerk of calling this the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. This movie isn't even the best war movie of the past few years. If you want to see what this movie should have been go watch The Pacific. 6/10 don't waste your money unless you just really love war movies.",

519,15 March 2017,marktuovinen32,8, Hacksaw Ridge - Review,"Mel Gibson has come out of his 10 year directing hole and shown us all once again how brilliant he is at directing. His last three films Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ & Apocalypto were all absolutely brilliant films and I'm glad to say, he isn't making rubbish anytime soon. Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of Desmond Doss, an Army Medic who served in the battle of Okinawa but refused to kill people. ""One of the greatest heroes in American history never fired a bullet"". Desmond is portrayed by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man [2012] & Silence [2016]), the film also stars Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving & Vince Vaughan. There is not one performance that I can find a flaw in during the whole duration of the film. The acting is superb which is wonderful, you can connect and empathize with the characters easily. The film does not only explore what Desmond experienced during the battle but explores his childhood, relationships with his family and his partner. It also shows how Desmond came to be on the battlefield without a weapon as a medic. Desmond is a Christian and has a strong belief that going out into the battlefield and fighting is murder, at the same time he wants to serve for his country whilst staying true to his beliefs. When it comes down to the battle sequences in this film, words can't describe it. When the battles start, THEY START! I have never seen battles more terrifying, harrowing, bloody and intense as Hacksaw Ridge. Every single camera angle, all the make-up and CGI are beyond phenomenal. I have never seen war sequences this terrifying since Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". I cannot praise this film enough for the amount of terror it imparts during these sequences. Andrew Garfield is phenomenal, after being in two awful Spiderman films to be portraying one the greatest war heroes of all time is an astonishing achievement. When it comes to brilliant war movies you think Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. Well Mel has put himself on the map of absolutely stunning War Films. I highly recommend this film, especially to those who are Christian, as a Christian myself it made me think about my morals and how I view ""The Act of War"". I think everybody should see this film at least once. It's not for the faint of heart, but it gives a brutally accurate representation of the battlefield and a glimpse at what it was actually like for Desmond.

There are some scenes that are far reaching and quite brutal; this coming from someone that has been desensitized to almost everything. What I enjoyed most about Hacksaw Ridge is that in a time where our freedom was at the highest risk of loss; regardless of beliefs, race, color or creed, Americans had to come together to fight for what makes our country great, or at least laid the framework to greatness.

While I have watched countless war films from the grave black and white In Harm's Way, to comical war scenes of Forrest Gump, Hacksaw Ridge trumps them all because of Mel Gibson unification of war with personal story allowing the viewer to relate a gigantic, incomprehensible war on a personal level. Because Gibson synergizes macroscopic and microscopic events, the macroscopic being the historic battle of Okinawa and the microscopic being the life and war efforts of the courageous medic, Desmond Doss, the viewer can be impacted by the film in a way that could never be accomplished in a documentary.",

What unfolds is the trials and tribulations faced by him leading up to the events of the Battle of Okinawa, where he shows exemplary human spirit. Andrew Garfield is surprisingly convincing as Doss, with Sam Worthington at his best as Captain Clover, among others. It takes a little time to get a hold of the plot but once you do, it matures with minor aberrations and does justice to the story. Mel Gibson helms the plot well and cinematography is realistic and keeps you hooked you to the scenes. The background score is not great, but gives adequate support to the film.

Hacksaw Ridge is a mix between Saving Private Ryan and chariots of Fire. Based on a true story the war footage is unbelievably realistic. The intensity of the battles fought and courage it took to fight them had me squirming in my seat. The faith of the hero in the story is nothing short of astounding. The romance facet of an innocent time long long was also very well done. It is the perfect Holiday movie. It is very inspiring and would be broadly appealing. I rarely see a movie twice in a theater but this is one I would in a New York minute.,
539,11 December 2016,christine_diane,10, Must see so we don't forget the horrors of war,"This is a great WWII movie and a must see. Until now, Saving Private Ryan, in my opinion, depicted the best WWII battle scene as the soldiers landed on Normandy. I now feel that the atrocities and realism of battle have been perfectly captured by Hacksaw Ridge. A part of this film that is not often captured in other war films is the traumatic reaction that the soldiers experience after battle, subtleties like weeping and shocked or sorrowful expressions even on the faces of the background characters. This along with the graphic nature of the kill scenes moved me emotionally, and I am unable to watch anything violent in nature right now as I have had my fill of human suffering for awhile. I think all high school students should watch this movie as a reminder that there was a time when 18 year old young adults were brave and self-sacrificing, a time before the self-absorbed, compliment-fishing selfie. After the movie ended, the audience clapped which is a rarity today. This film will stick with you, and perhaps you will have a conversation with yourself regarding the necessity of war.",

I think everyone felt that, and understood where he was coming from. Then, later in the film, he is faced with a decision: does he go against what he believes, and go to work on the sabbath? He does. He went against everything he ""believes in."" At first, I thought he would be consistent and not go back into battle, and the other soldiers would follow suit.

However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent enlistment of every able-bodied person that he knows, Desmond enlists in the Army as a combat medic. Yet even though he is told he would not have to shoulder a rifle, Desmond discovers that his entire chain-of-command requires him to do so anyway. This results in an incredible strain on him when he decides to follow his religious convictions but refuses to accept any kind of discharge which might be prejudicial to him or his religious beliefs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film featured intense action in addition to some decent human drama.

We seem to forget that the key aspects of a true hero are bravery and selflessness. Mel Gibson's first film in over a decade is the biography of such a hero, a man who wasn't particularly strong or skilled, but was ready to risk his life to save others. Hacksaw Ridge is an inspiring story based on true events although at times it seems too romanticized.",
560,27 March 2017,garciaanahit,10, Amazing Masterpiece,"From the director of ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"", Mel Gibson brings us another phenomenal and realistic movie based on the true story of the American War hero, Desmond T. Doss. Released on November 4th of 2016, Hacksaw Ridge was nominated for six Oscar Awards and ranked third best on opening weekend. This biographical war and drama film described the American war hero's experience in the battle of Okinawa of World War II. Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), a Pacifist, found it tough to stay true to his religion as a Seventh-day Adventist Christian and serve his country simultaneously vowing never to touch a combat weapon. It was his belief to save lives and not take them away after he had met a nurse who soon became his wife as he was required to enlist for the war. Facing the consequences and punishments by both his family and the sergeants of camp, he declared the right to serve in the army without weapons under religious belief and saved seventy-five of his wounded men alone from the fire of war. He soon was known as the first conscientious objector to become a combat medic. With over $158 million made worldwide, it continues to be one of the most critically acclaimed movies up to date.",

563,12 May 2018,deloudelouvain,9, One of the best war movies ever.,"This movie deserves it's high rating totally. I'm just flabbergasted when I read reviews from people that score it the lowest possible. How the hell can you score this movie with a one? Seriously, are those people ever satisfied? A one means to me that it is one of the worst movies you ever saw. So to me that means those reviewers barely watch any movies at all. Hacksaw Ridge is not only based on a true story, from a 'soldier' that clearly deserves a medal by going to war without touching a gun but by saving alot of lives. He deserves that medal more than any other soldier that had to kill for having the honor to receive a medal. Andrew Garfield did a wonderful job playing the character of Desmond Doss. In fact, as an atheist I hate everything about God and religion, but in this movie I looked passed it because the vision of Doss that you have to save people instead of killing them is a thing that can only applaud. Every war is stupid, and Mel Gibson did a great job to make this clear in this brilliant movie. With sometimes very hard to watch scenes, but it was a cruel war so you should show those atrocities to make everyone understand what war really is. The whole cast of Hacksaw Bridge did a great job, from actors to editors, it's just one of the better war movies I ever saw. Deep respect for Desmond Doss, and that comes from a guy that would never go to a war, not from cowardness but from believing wars are just a tool from the so-called 'powerful' to control the world.",

A hero in its truest sense. In this year's another sensational film, La La Land, we saw how it is important to never let go of what you want or what you dream, even if the circumstances are trying. In Hacksaw Ridge, we see even in dire situations and in face of dreadful consequences how it is important to never let go of who you are. ",

""To believe in God is to believe in humanity.To believe in humanity is to believe in God"".Starting with this quote I'm focusing now on the story of Desmond Doss,who served as an army medic in Okinawa war, a greatest hero that saved a lot of lifes without firing a bullet. President of the US gives to Doss the Medal of Honor in October 12,1945. The story clearly illustrates that the only weapon can be faith and pure love for life,combining with a remarkable dose of courage.I have to mention about the injustice born of inability and deep understanding,when soldier Doss in the training camp was one step away to face the martial court because he didn't want to use a gun,a crucial moment which eventually solved well,I was glad and relieved when his father came with the 'saving' letter from the general. Great actors,wonderful effects and a very emotionant scenery that makes your heart trembling,from the beginning to the extraordinary end. This film is worthy of respect.",
573,26 November 2020,fakeashcom,8, Rather Different Than Other War Movies I've Seen So Far,"Hacksaw Ridge is such a different movie to me that it felt like I was watching a movie that's not about war. It's so heartwarming that I can't express how the movie even felt like. It starts off with young Doss who almost killed his brother with a brick during a fight. It was at that moment, he started to listen to the commandments since he is in a pretty religious family. All of them were pretty religious but Doss stood out above all of them as he couldn't even hold a gun. Because of this the military made his life harder by forcing the whole squad to be punished all because he couldn't hold a gun. He was bullied by his roommates but he never blamed them even once, that is where the brotherhood begins. Everybody entrusted Doss as their trustworthy medic. However, this didn't end there. The military still thinks that this is considered a crime so moments before he was almost going to the prison, he was locked up in a cell which at the same time happens to be his marriage day that he wishes to be on time but sadly didn't end well. Luckily, his father, whom Foss used to hate, helped Doss to get out of this situation by begging a high commanding officer to write a letter to allow him not to yield a weapon. See, that's quite sweet (in my opinion)",

Hacksaw Ridge is a throwback to those dark days. It's like Mel watched Private Ryan and Band Of Brothers and liked some parts, but didn't really understand the whole, so just stole the best bits without realising that things only work as a whole. It's so stupid that it feels like you're watching a load of kids playing soldiers, it doesn't feel like a glimpse of war. And all that military jargon that was well researched and difficult to understand, like when they come under fire, ""Over there, those bunkers"", or when the sarge gets on the radio to give the enemy position, ""they're straight ahead."" These gems sandwiched between about a dozen ""cover my/his/their/our ass/asses"", and the rather poetic, ""let's go to work"". Just as an example of how gung-ho silly it is, when they take the ridge, about half way through, and then the next morning the Japs counter charge, and hundreds of them pour out of their tunnel network, all the soldiers, who were all laying relatively safely in artillery their holes, and other appropriate cover where they couldn't be shot, all jumped out of them to start shooting at the attackers. Why? Because it might look good on camera. Kids playing soldiers. And yeah, the bit where he carries the upper half of that blokes body with one hand while hip shooting dozen or so Japs with his infinite ammo BAR (in fairness there wasn't a single reload throughout the entire film (no wonder the Americans won the war, they used hax)) was barmy, I just wish I could say it was the silliest thing about the film.",

Ridiculous. We have the stereotypical drunk father and saintly mother for his parents as we've seen in countless other Hollywood narratives, but we are to feel sorry for his father because he too was in a war. That always makes it OK to beat your wife in American movies so the writers play that up to the best of their ability, which is not that impressive and frankly lacking in believability. What would an American warmongering movie be without a love story thrown in to attract the ladies, huh? I mean surely every guy who signs up for war has a beautiful woman waiting for him back home, right?! Well, this crap of a movie is no different, like I told you from the beginning. The hero always has to seem like a coward or at least a weakling until the bullets start flying and then he comes into his own as a courageous bad-ass with no fear.

There were a lot of moments i had to look away as it almost got to much, it isn't over censored which really helps show how bad some situations were. There is a lot of scenes with significant amount of gore which is good as a lot of war movies don't do this and it does help contribute to getting the full experience of war and what they dealt with and how they suffered.

Took my breath away!!!!,How anybody could rate this below a 10 is beyond me it's a flawless movie in every way imaginable. The cast is fantastic and mr. Doss who this movie is about is a true American hero!! My father served in 3 wars and was in the service as a navy seabee for 30 years I instantly thought of him and his 3 purple hearts he received!! I am glad however he didnt see Wednesday what happened to our Capitol!! Only TRUE Veterans understand what I mean. Anyway this is the best war movie and super hero movie I've ever seen. Doss was a true captain America.,

Andrew Garfield produces what in my opinion his greatest performance to date his performance as Desmond Doss was nothing short of brilliant his performance and Gibson's performance in directing this masterpiece gave the film not only the credit the truly inspirational story deserved but gave me and everyone a great movie to enjoy. The way the film builds as it goes along keeps you glued to the screen not only drawing you in with the action but the emotion of the film was something to behold and how a act of true courage can inspire a entire country. I must add Vince Vaughn was also brilliant in the film, I had only seen him in comedies before and I was more than impressed with his skills outside of the comedy genre.

I was right. Mel puts the ""hack"" in ""Hacksaw"" with men-at-arms having their limbs severed, their heads dismembered, and their fragile bodies being pierced by razor sharp bayonets. When Gibson perpetrates violence, it's to glorify, to sensationalize, to make you turn away in disgust. Oh and did I mention he includes several sequences of rats nibbling on decomposed body parts.

My hands were shaking and heart pounding for two hours of the 2 1/2 hours of the movie. The movie portrays well why so many American lost their lives in Okinawa (WWII).Doss was an incredible man.

640,9 November 2020,TheHonestCritic,4," If only a hacksaw would cut off the head of this ""movie""!","""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016), let me just say right off the bat, I'm not that big a fan of war films overall. There are a few that I do like, but the majority of them suck. This ""movie"" is a whole different level of terrible! It has a very boring and jumbled storyline, bad and stilted acting, and a dull generic soundtrack. The plot of this ""film"" is based off a true story (what a surprise). A man named Desmond Doss joins the Army to be a combat medic. He is against carrying a weapon of any kind. So, joining the Army sounds like a reasonable decision. Before I go any further, I just want to say to all military folks out there, no one appreciates your service to our country and the rest of the world as much as I do. Including you, Desmond Doss. Thank you for your service! But, if you're going to enlist in the military, you had better be prepared to carry a weapon. Otherwise, there's no point in joining in the first place! Granted, being in a war zone without a weapon does deserve some praise for bravery. However, running around without a weapon during a battle just makes you look stupid. The plot is that a man joins the Army, he's afraid to carry a weapon, he runs around like a confused moron with gunfire and explosions going on in the background and that's it. Seriously, did the last 1/3 of the script just say: ""a series of gunfire, poorly choreographed fights and bad dialogue""? You do see a war going on, but you don't experience it. I just told you the whole concept in ten seconds and saved you two and a half hours of your time, you're welcome. As for the acting, it is nothing short of a joke from all the actors and actresses. The worst performance comes from Andrew Garfield. That's usually a given for any film he stars in. He's a horrible actor, and whenever he speaks it's nothing but a cringe-fest! Desmond Doss would be very disappointed with Andrew Garfield's portrayal of him. The bad thing is, he's playing as the main character and it's the worst performance of the ""movie"", how ironic! Andrew Garfield just taints any film or TV show he's in and this is no different! He should just pick another career, because he can't act in any sense of the word. As for the soundtrack, it's a generic bore. To be honest, if the ""film"" didn't have a film score, it would sound exactly the same. The soundtrack is so dull, that it adds nothing to the story, what little there is! Now for the positives, yes there are two positives in this ""film"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are nice and reflect the time period. Therefore, it results in a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects are fantastic. Being a movie made in 2016, that's not surprising! ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is nothing but a major disappointment in the genre of war films. I don't care how praised a film is, I don't care how much money it makes and I don't care how many awards it wins. All of that means nothing! If I think a film is trash, then it's trash. The fact that anyone could like this ""movie"" just blows my mind! I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you want to look up the story of Desmond Doss, don't watch this ""film"". You're going to be let down, big time. Just look up the true story online. To be honest, reading about it is much more entertaining than this ""movie"" and that's not saying much! That just goes to show that some stories should never be retold.",

The movie captures a dubious trick of being both overly melodramatic and emotionally unengaging. Andrew Garfield is the best thing about the movie: human, flawed and heroic in ways that feel very true to life. Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths do very good work too. Sadly, the rest of the movie doesn't live up to their performances. Doss' platoon-mates are poorly realized and unmemorable; we struggled to keep track of who was supposed to be who. The battle scenes are over-the-top orgies of mud, blood, flame, and suffering, with no rhythm or sense of moving action. This blunt force trauma builds until the final shot, which is hamfisted and groan-worthy. Only the coda, delivering interviews with the actual participants, brings the movie to a somewhat satisfying conclusion.

The incident with the brick, yeah, that was me gasping. Sixty years ago when I was a little kid my barber had a totally burnt head. At the clinic in town Doss paused to let him by. ",
679,1 June 2021,EdwardtheBlackPrince,7, Please Lord let me get one more,"Directed by Mel Gibson Hacksaw Ridge tell the story of real life veteran Desmond miles. A pacifist combat medic who during the battle of Okinawa saved over 75 man. This film stand as a testament of one beliefs & faith and not always having to convert do the masses. It's an anti-war film where the war is a factor of the movie, but decides to put more emphasis on the character outlook and statement as opposed to just showing the carnage of war. Andrew Garfield as Desmond gives an amazing performance as he comes off as this nice guy who doesn't want to fight, but yet he still believes in the greater good. He still wants to help, even though he's scolded by his comrades and superiors for his beliefs. With over a two hour run time the movie takes its time to build Desmond and the people around him. The first half of the movie pretty much focuses on his character. Sets up his reasons for why he's not a violent person how he comes to meet his love, as well as how he struggled through military training. The movie doesn't just jump to the war not until like halfway through the movie by the time that happens we've had enough time to actually get to know the troops without being distracted by all the shooting going around. The atmosphere because now there being thrown into the mitts of this battle. The Battlefield is Reminence of saving Private Ryan where it doesn't hold back on the Graphic or grittiness off of war. People are blown up, missing legs and rats feasting on corpses. Define between the Americans and Japanese is very intense very respectable of Japanese tactics where you notice how they have bayonets attached to their guns. The point where it's they don't even care necessarily if they do die because It's considered an honorable thing to them, so you just have Raid of Japanese hiding on the ground and swarming.",

Now those were the bad things, lemme go over the great things, Andrew Garfield is pretty good in it, not really best actor worthy, but still really good!

This gives us plenty of time to meet Desmond Doss (Garfield) and his family and find out how/why he ticks. He decides he can't sit by why others go off to defend America, but he also conscientiously objects to killing another human, so can't use any weapons. Big moral dilemma and the film deals with it well. It also gives us time to care about some of the other characters in the unit, so we know who's who when the fighting starts.",
699,22 April 2019,mike_baynes,10, Masterpiece,"This is the 'Saving Private Ryan' of this decade. No it's not star studded like Ron Howard's film is but I think that makes 'Hacksaw Ridge' feel more authentic in a way. While I did enjoy all the major stars in 'Saving Private Ryan' I feel like a film made up of one big name star surrounded by a cast of lesser known actors and actresses let's my mind focus more on the story instead of the people playing the characters. I don't know, maybe that's just me.
I have never a biography or self biography of Desmond Daws or any official documents about the events of what happened at Hacksaw Ridge, so I don't know how true the entire movie is or if they changed any details to make the movie better, but I love this movie! It is a must watch if you love war movies. This has to be on your list of Memorial day or Veterans day movie marathon (if you do that kind if thing) I love turning on AMC or the History Channel and spending the majority of the day on Military Holidays watching war movies and thinking about my Relatives that Served in the Military. Now there is a lot of blood and guts so if your sensitive to that kind if thing, be prepared for that from the get go. There is a pretty sizable degree of Religious overtones so be ready for that too if you are a non Believer in GOD. I am a Baptist so I love the Christian message that the ending sends.

(I've followed Mr Gibson since Gallipoli, and Patriot is still one of my all-time faves.) The fact that this is based on a true story, just puts it over the top for deep, emotional inspiration. I didn't know this war story before, but it has to be one of the greatest of all time. Every character role was played brilliantly by the cast. The directing and cinematography were flawless.

The Army had tried to Court Marshall him for not following orders but with the help of his father played by Hugo Weaving he was able to drop the charges and to continue his service. He became the only man to never fire a shot during the war and received the Medal of Honor for saving over 70 wounded soldiers all by himself. Sam Worthington acted as Desmond's commanding officer along with Vince Vaughn as Sgt Howell of the platoon. Overall great movie, beautifully put together by Gibson.

712,5 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, A war film with embellishment of faith and love,"A few days ago, a friend shared with me and watched this movie. After two days of delay, I just watched it when I was free. In short: Wow, I'm so touched, this movie is great.
Expand to talk about feelings, there are the following aspects
1. In terms of freedom of belief. I like the quote at the end of the film ""I think any behavior that interferes with the beliefs of others is wrong."" The belief of the male lead in the film is really difficult to understand and has an impact on others and even yourself. But the principle-driven spirit of the male host is hard to follow. Dare to ask you in your life, when you encounter other people's incomprehension, and when people around you persuade you to give up your obsession many times, can you be brave and say no? I might be hesitant. It's a lot. It can be really difficult to insist on self regardless of everything.
2. Love respect. The love of the male host is also very sweet, full of love from all angles. From the ignorance of the male host when he fell in love at first sight, to the regretful wedding scene, the dialogue between the female host and the priest when the male host was absent. Priest: ""Sometimes men will flinch"" Mistress: ""Some men will, but my Desmond will not."" There will be follow-ups when the male host is stubbornly imprisoned, the female host backs up, I think this is inseparable It is also a good point to see the true feelings in adversity without giving up. The ending paragraph was also very touching. The male host was injured and was put on a stretcher. He still remembered to blow up the bible sent by the female host. About this Bible throughout the movie, it is faith and love. Perhaps the sentence of the hostess: ""I think you put me in my heart"" or the ""I'm waiting for you to come back"" behind the hostess's photo, all support the male host to go through every moment. With the victory of Gang Saw Ridge, the stage of seeing Wu Siren finally came to an end.
3. War aspect. As a war movie, there are definitely many details about war. From the perspective of the male father, from the male father 's father borrowing wine to visit the sacrificed comrades, to the helplessness of the father when he saw the male brother wearing the military uniform, and then to the male father 's father to put on the military uniform again to save the male father. Perhaps the understanding of war seems to be changing quietly. From the perspective of the male lead, from volunteering to be a military doctor, to insisting on self in the face of other people's incomprehension, to the end to save the wounded regardless of his own safety, these deeply moved me. The pinnacle lies in the silent line in the mind of the male host when he saves himself: ""Help me got one more."" This sentence reminded me of the medical staff and many beautiful retrogrades who faced the epidemic and ignored the danger of life. Perhaps it is the phrase ""Let me save another one"". This selfless spirit is sublime and respectable.",
713,14 December 2021,Joshumms,10, Made Me Love War Movies,I was not a big fan of war movies up until I watched this masterpiece. The movie consistently keeps a lighter tone and intertwines it with the brutality of the battle scenes and it surprisingly works without ruining the movie. The first hour of this movie is lighthearted with some love story tropes but overall a great personality with great characters and acting. When the battling comes it is brutal and intense and it made me more tense than any horror movie I've ever seen. I think I'm gonna be watching more war movies soon.,

719,1 December 2016,julia-00157,9, Brutal but heartfelt War Drama,"""In a world so set on tearing itself apart it doesn't seem to me like such a bad thing to want to put a little bit of it back together."" This film pulls you in within the first few minutes with brutal shots of battle in dramatic slow motion to a haunting score, which I can say now was the perfect preview of what was to come later in the movie. Andrew Garfield's character is introduced to the audience as a simple minded but well meaning, all around smiley, adorable young man. When we get farther into the movie we see the depth of his bravery and his values, and Garfield did this wonderfully. We felt the fear and the need to protect, the grief and the struggle to get people to listen, and the frustration when they refused to. I could sing my praises for this performance all day long. Shot in a two act format, that deviates from the standard three act formula, the first act is bright and happy with a bit of cloudiness, like one half of a yin yang, the other the opposite half, so they fit together quite nicely. This movie is brutal in its battle scenes. It is intense and merciless. I cannot emphasize this enough. Before our boys go into battle, we are introduced to them enough that you learn their complexities and loveliness and confusion for what is right; You fall in love with them a little. Therefore, it is so shocking when they enter the battlefield and you see young men getting blown to bits or shot through the back of the head with less than a second of screen time. There is no denying this is a fantastic movie, but the violence was a bit much for me. I only recommend knowing what you're getting into. A story about course and innovation and a desire to serve, this is the epitome of a Hero story with a capital H.",
720,13 August 2017,belacane,5, A story with a lot of holes in it,"I felt very oddly confused by this movie. Desmond decides to enlist and ""be a medic,"" yet the only medical preparation we see is him on the porch reading a book on anatomy. There is no mention made of any Army training, or any schooling in medicine he may have done before enlisting. I'm unfamiliar with the Army (especially in that era) but it seemed very bizarre that a boy could just ""decide"" to be a medic and that's all it took. I was also distracted by the end (after the war flashbacks ended). Thought that they should have shown what happened to him when he got home. Was his father still around? Was he proud of Desmond? They did show the still photos of the real Desmond, but it would have wrapped up more satisfactorily if they had concluded the story with a return of the actor playing Desmond, coming back to his home and family.",

726,6 February 2017,aidanvoonav,8, Wonderful directing,"Okay, okay. Before anybody gets angry at me for saying the directing is good, i meant that the directing by Mel Gibson was wonderful, splendid and all round beautiful. It does not mean in anyway that i agree with what he said in the past nor do i like him as a person. IF you guys are actual movie goers and actual movie enthusiasts like i am, you cannot argue about how gorgeously this film was directed. This film was directed in a way to show us exactly how gruesome and horrid war can be. It shows us how violent and terrible and outcome of a war is and i like it. Too many times movies have shown us war heroes that go through war like as though it were some sort of video game. War is not a video game nor is it adventurous nor is it fun. This film shows war as it is and doesn't glorify war either. Another thing that this movie does is that it doesn't try and justify itself and it doesn't try and explain much about why people do what they do. Which in my opinion is good, because people in general are like that. People in general do not need a reason to hate, they do not need a reason to love nor do they need a reason to do anything. This movie is surreal and realistic (for the most part) in their representation of war. And i like that. For the acting, it's not extremely great but it is fairly good. As this is based of a true story, the story isn't exactly original, but hey, it's based of a true event. Another notable thing about this movie is its pacing. There was not a time where i felt like they should skip a scene nor should they push the story a head nor did i feel like a scene was unnecessary. In fact, i was very invested in the film and wanted to watch it through. As a whole, this film is very nice and entertaining and it is by far, way better than the film ""Unbreakable"" by Angelina Jolie which i found slightly overrated and dry. (both films are depictions of war heroes and even though Louis Zamperini arguably did way more than Desmond Doss, Hacksaw Ridge made Desmond Doss look like more of a hero as it looked like Desmond had to go through a tougher time even though he did not compared to Louis Zamperini)",

All of them loved their country and were willing to die for it to protect their loved ones. Just as importantly, as Americans, our Founding Fathers understood and recognized the importance of not compelling free people to violate their conscience. So agree or disagree with Doss' stance, he was the real deal, and clearly was honored by God and man for it. The ending scene was an acknowledgment of sorts to the faith of his fellow soldiers, by choosing to lead them into battle with prayer on Saturday (his Sabbath).",

The bar for war movies has been considerably raised. (ie. Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, The Pacific) and by that standard, Hacksaw is shabby and inferior. There are two movies here. The first part so horribly acted, corny and badly written that it's hard to believe they nominated Garfield for anything but a 'Raspberry'. The second half is all combat and here Gibson is in his element and the acting improves considerably. You wont believe it's the same movie. Is it worth watching? I guess if you like combat scenes. (I do.) Vince Vaughn is miscast as the tough 'Sarge' with the heart of gold. We've seen this character so many times and Vaughn brings nothing new to it. The Aussie actors struggle with the accents. (Apparently everybody in the war was a tough guy from the lower east side of New York.) Garfield plays his character with a syrupy excessiveness.

The much hyped war scenes are a true indication of the horror of war but are filmed at times like an action movie. I don't think I saw a single soldier reload a gun and ammo just never ran out. The cinematography also had a TV feel to it. ( A noticeable quality of films shot in Australia portraying other countries) I wasn't aware of Hacksaw Ridge from previous war movies or Docos but I have one massive plot problem that was made worse by the end scenes. When the Japanese were shooting down from the top of the ridge..At what point did they not just cut the ropes to prevent the US army climbing back up??? This movie is cliché at best and every stereotype for the Japanese is on display. the scene where the Commander commits suicide before having his head chopped off was like a scene from a John Woo film!! it is a terrible scene and offered nothing to the film.

The first hour is a bit pedestrian and plays out a little bit like Forest Gump (in my humble opinion you could have shaved half an hour off the running time).The film comes to life in the amazing battle scenes which (in places) were like nothing I have ever seen. Some times the action is bit too frenetic and you can lose track of who is who. Occasionally the tight production values show as it clear the whole thing was shot on quite a small set. Also (without spoiling anything) why did the Japanese not cut the ropes (you will know what I mean when you see the movie). On the subject of the Japanese..they were all a bit one dimensional.

The first half an hour was a bit boring at times, and didn't feel necessary to the rest of the film. I like the idea of a film about a pacifist in war, and that motivation is set up well within Doss at the beginning. The training stuff is fairly entertaining, but the film doesn't really pick up until they get to Hacksaw Ridge. That part is genuinely really uplifting, if a bit over the top at times. Garfield was phenomenal, Gibson's direction was very strong and the production design really stood out as detailed to me, particularly during the war scenes. For a film about a pacifist, some of the violence was way too over the top in my opinion, but most of it was good. I thought some of the editing was bad at points, but apparently this won Best Editing at the Oscars so what do I know. The score was good and the story of Doss is genuinely really inspirational. I think with a weaker story this would have a much lower score, as I had a lot of smaller issues with the film that decreased my overall enjoyment of it. Overall, it's still a good film, but it's one of the weaker war films I've seen.",

Mel hits lots of home runs and that should not be underestimated when something has his name attached to it. I have nothing to say about the movie, as lots of others will tell you about it.

776,2 February 2022,amirhoseinahg,10, amirhoseinahg,"The storyline of ""The Jungle Book"" is what we have heard before and seen in various adaptations. A young boy named Mowgli, who was left in the forest as a child, is raised by wolves and becomes a member of their gang. They are living happily ever after when one day a fierce tiger named Shir Khan is found, and the film is about Desmond Das, a US Army soldier who decides to go to war after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Desmond, however, has one difference from the rest of the soldiers, and that is that he is very religious and he is one of those people who, because of his beliefs, considers killing a great sin that can not be avoided. So that Desmond refuses to take up arms, even in the face of an enemy who intends to kill him, and in the hell of a war with whom he has no acquaintance, and instead wants to help as a relief force on the battlefield. In his own words, when others take each other's lives, he saves others. The reason for this decision is Desmond's quarrel between a child who is nearing the end of his brother's death and his alcoholic and violent father, who loses control and beats their mother due to the psychological trauma left over from World War I. The film is divided into two parts. In the first part, we are dealing with a historical drama in which there is no news of cannons, guns and deaths. But those who are familiar with Gibson should know that the bright and lush suburban atmosphere of Virginia in the 1940s and 1940s will soon be replaced by a dark and dirty battlefield, and this is what happens, and Gibson's in this part of the film. Reduces the risk of bleeding and bleeding. Requires Muggle taste. Now Mowgli must escape from the forest with the help of his friends. The biggest thing we need to know about The Jungle Book is that you should not be shocked when you see the phrase ""filmed in Los Angeles"" in the film's final credits. In other words, only Muggle is alive in this movie and almost everything is CGI.

778,7 June 2022,yoshbuck,7, High 7/10,"For a modern war movie, they sure don't reload a lot. Its lack of realistic military tactics lowers this movie's score. But the ambiance of war is perfectly depicted, from the boot camp, the battlefield, and the different soldiers we encountered. But the highlight of this movie is the main star himself, Desmond Doss, the central part of the story. His story of a conscientious objector in the middle of world war 2. A conscientious objector is a person who believes that even in war, killing the enemy is murder. So we see the life of Desmond from his childhood days to the battle of Okinawa. This movie inspired me as a Christian cause Doss was a Christian himself. I may disagree with the conscientious belief, but I love that he shows an attribute all Christians must have, standing for what you believe. Andrew Garfield provides a fantastic performance of a man with resilience, someone who's fearless and always cares for everybody. The other cast members are outstanding with their characters. Desmond's father, a traumatized drunk yet a loving father, Dorothy as Demond's lover, and many of Desmond's fellow soldiers have their niche. But the one that standout is Luke Bracey as Smitty, the first soldier who changed his mind about Doss, and Vince Vaugn playing an excellent drill sergeant, fits him very well. I love the battle scenes. The movie is dirty, with mud, blood, and sweat. I love the grimy feel. Even though the film portrays Hacksaw Ridge as Doss's first and last combat experience, in reality, it was his last. He fought in different places like the Philippines before. But even though the movie undermines the actual Desmond's heroic actions, you still feel overwhelmed by his action in the film. Thinking he wants above and beyond. This movie indeed shows that amidst all horror called war, the light being lit is by the soldiers.",

A big part of this is the movie has somewhat of a unique approach to the standard war film fare. In that the main character is a pacifist, who still wants to serve in his own way. And the main character's religious conviction is something you don't see in nearly every war movie, and even then it's usually an afterthought or just there to provide dialogue. I felt a huge emotional investment towards the main character. Going in, I didn't know it was based off a true story, so I didn't know the ending. I'd say this helps, but isn't necessary to enjoy the movie. You can't help but have tremendous respect for the main character. The emotional angle is why I feel it's the best war movie.

A biographic account of conscientious objector Desmond Doss who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving 75 wounded men while under fire during the assault on ""Hacksaw Ridge"" during the Battle for Okinawa in World War II. The battle scenes are quite graphic with gory depictions of wounds and death, which only helps to emphasize the enormity of what Doss did. The first part of the film deals with his religious and moral development which led to his decision to not to touch a weapon. That, of course, didn't go over well with the military, which apparently figured if they could convince an equally-religious Sergeant Alvin York to take up a gun during World War I they could convince anyone. But Doss held firm to his beliefs and, after barely avoiding a court martial, was granted his request to become a battlefield medic. However, in the lead-up to the fighting scenes there isn't much background on the impact of his religious church affiliation. In fact, when he tells his sergeant that he can't fight because he is a Seventh Day Adventist it is the first mention in the movie of any organized religious influence. Later, in battle, he turns down an offer of C-rations, reminding his buddy that he ""doesn't eat meat."" That is the first and last mention of him also being a vegetarian. Andrew Garfield, (who -- unlike Gary Cooper and Alvin York -- physically resembles the real Desmond Doss) gave a remarkable performance and deserved his Oscar Nomination.",

796,20 July 2020,Diablo1616,9, One of The Best War Movies,"An extraordinary film about an extraordinary man who, true to his beliefs saved the lives of a reported 75 men without firing a single shot during the battle for Okinawa in WWII, if the story is to be believed and apparently it is, then I couldn't help but think that miracles do actually occur when -after watching this- I checked it out and found that historically, apart from the usual so-called 'artistic licence' without which no such film could exist and be 'entertaining', the detail is essentially correct (phew).
Desmond Doss refuses to give in to those ('lessers' as it turns out) around him during basic training only to go on to prove his strength under real duress when the time comes, by demonstrating true courage in the face of enemy fire and true compassion also (he tends the wounds of Japanese soldiers on occasion so the story goes).
Mel Gibson and his team do a brilliant job of re-creating the battle scenes even if the gore is heaped on, but there can be no such things without such scenes in to-days modern cinema and I doubt anyone would watch without being so aware, they also deal well with the more sentimental issues which are an inevitable part of the human condition on a daily basis anyway, but under such circumstances are inevitably heightened.
I found the film hard-hitting, but ultimately satisfying no doubt due to the 'under-dog' theme which carried it along for the first hour or so which was turned on its' head in the finale, nice touch too from those survivors of the time as the final credits are about to roll...",

I feel like I saw a totally different movie. The dialogue was extremely cheesy, the battle scenes were fine, but not realistic or emotionally effective. There's a scene where a soldier picks up a limbless torso and uses it as a shield with one hand, as he's running and firing a large assault rifle. Another scene has Desmond dragging a wounded soldier across the battlefield on a sheet as the man mows down scores of enemy soldiers. Seems more like something from a John Wick or Rambo movie if you ask me. The acting is good, nothing special, Garfield seems to lose his accent in a few scenes, Vince Vaughn is great as always but sort of out of place here. It's much more of a Hollywood action flick than a serious war film. I didn't hate it, but I'm utterly confused at all the praise it's getting.",

Sure Gibson did a nice job with the combat scenes and that's the only reason I gave it a 3 and not a 1 but the rest is just garbage. Andrew Garfield is a mediocre actor at best and the story is just laughable. Gibson lets his own religious bias shine through and portrays Doss as some kind of Jesus figure even adding that ridiculous light shining on him at the end. Anyone who believes Doss never picked up a weapon of any kind while rescuing those soldiers all by himself and surrounded by Japanese troops are either stupid or so gullible they believe in the same imaginary friend as Doss did!,

One massive letdown from this movie was the god awful cheesy script, with boring character conversations the audience wasn't able to identify strong relationships and vital character bonds, unfortunately this brought the movie from a solid 10/10 to a undeserved 8/10. Don't get me wrong Hacksaw Ridge is still an always will be one of if not the greatest war film to this date. The confronting battle scenes are the most amazing I've ever seen, with bullets bouncing all of the place and the beautiful ""war zone"" atmosphere Mel Gibson brings the audience right into the action giving us an unforgettable experience that was so unique it gave me chills and goosebumps just from the sounds and visuals alone.

821,7 August 2018,KidWithOpinions,9, Hacksaw Ridge,"Hacksaw Ridge is a World War Two movie made by Mel Gibson. I loved this movie and I think that it deserves an A, for its well-told story and its acting.
Hacksaw Ridge is a good war movie that you could show your kids when they get into middle school ( around 8th grade would be best). Sure it is violent and pretty gory, but compared to the other war movies it is not as bad. There are no F-words, but there is one scene where a character is naked, and some implied sex, but other than that it is a pretty appropriate movie sexuality-wise. You should go into this movie knowing that it is made by Mel Gibson, and he makes very bloody films, but hopefully, that should already be expected. The movie has some parts in it that might scare young kids and it also might scare older viewers, because it is pretty disturbing, but if they are in the age range of 12 and 13 they should not get scared.
Hacksaw Ridge is a World War Two movie that shows us an American medic helping soldiers on the Pacific Front. The medic is Virginian Desmond Doss, who is very religious, and that will play a part in him being in the military. He refuses to pick up a weapon, and he does not want to kill anyone or in his words, "" I do not want to take the life of another human being, because that is the greatest sin,"". It starts out with Desmond and his brother ( whose name I do not have) hiking. It cuts to them fighting back at home, I do not want to spoil anything so I will just say that Desmond wins in the bad way. We then have to sit through an hour of Desmond dealing with a girl and his father disapproving of Desmond's choice's and actually getting to fight in the war, and then we get about 20 minutes of Doss at boot camp. It takes an hour and twenty minutes to get to the actual war part, but let me tell you that if you are missing the violence of war you will still see lots of blood in Desmond's everyday life, we only get about an hour of the war and fighting. 
What I really liked about Hacksaw Ridge was how they are showing us the Pacific Front instead of the European Front. Because we have seen enough movies about the Nazi party being overthrown by America because they were screwing with the American military ( the Nazi's), give us something new! Now I thought that Hugo Weaving did a great job acting. The entire cast does a really good job at acting, but I think the best acting was actually done by the people whom Doss was saving.
I am very sad that Andrew Garfield did not win Best Actor because he did a phenomenal job as Desmond Doss. I seem to forget he is British because all of his best roles are Americans. But I will still say my congratulations to Casey Affleck for winning his first Oscar.
Hacksaw Ridge was different from all the other war movies. Besides the immense amount of violence, it was a different kind of war movie. So it does not remind me of any movies. 
My final grade for Hacksaw Ridge is an A, for its well-told story and its great acting.",
822,20 July 2022,den_quixote,3, The worst war movie ever made,"Three stars only because some of the acting was average or better (that does not apply to you Vince Vaughan.) Other than Vaughan there is no one in this movie that I ever heard of which is actually a selling point, it is nice to see some new faces. Unfortunately I never heard of the writer (there were two) before either and what is really unfortunate is that he and Director Gibson don't seem to be familiar with the idea of plagiarism other than that they seem to be for it.

The central premise is a fresh perspective on familiar territory. But whilst Gibson is accomplished in depicting the horror of battle, his broad directorial brush strokes struggle to give the backstory any convincing emotional heft. It's to Garfield's credit that he works his way into our affections in spite of cringeworthy dialogue and rushed exposition. Vaughn too brings some needed comedy in the training camp. Hacksaw Ridge is nonetheless at times a powerful film, if not the most accomplished one to depict the horrors of war.",
847,13 March 2019,wbuttle,8, Excellent War Film,I have spoken about how good Andrew Garfield is as an actor many a time before. But he really hits it with this one as Desmond Doss. He's incredible as the war hero and probably deserved the biggest award in cinema. The Oscar.,

852,14 July 2018,juliareyor,10, Favorite movie of all time...,"Mel Gibson never fails to disappoint on and off the screen. He has such vision and it shows and pays off on film. I have never heard of Doss's story before this movie and I think that is such a shame because like they said in the movie, what he did was ""nothing short from a miracle."" If you have never seen this movie than I recommend it 1000%!",

There's no doubt in my mind he would have loved this epic war flick. I, on the other hand, hardly ever watch these type movies. Basically, I avoid them, at least to some degree. Maybe it's the blood and gore. This film had more than its fair share of it - so be warned. ",
854,2 February 2017,ciarajade22,10," Well paced, amazing plot, great acting. A truly amazing film","This film deserves bounteous amounts of recognition and is worthy of a 10/10. Without spoiling anything, this film not only excels in setting the scene, character development and pacing. It is a truly wonderful representation of a true story, it is heartfelt, brutal and real. I couldn't look away from the screen and had goose bumps for the majority of its length. The acting was superb; Andrew Garfield, Theresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn and all of the soldiers embodied their roles phenomenally and made every scene a pleasure to watch and experience. The war scenes were indefinitely on par with Platoon and Saving Private Ryan and managed to maintain a balance between drama and action. The music accompanying every scene was subtle yet perfect, and I can't express how well it all came together. The religious aspect of the film also is not overpowering or unrealistic, it is genuine and easy to watch even if viewers have different values/religions. This film was in one word, beautiful. I felt the need to write a review about it as soon as I left the cinema and I implore every lover of a great movie to pay to see it in the cinema and not stream it online or wait for the DVD. It was a cinematic experience I will never forget and I'd say it is one of the best films I have seen in years. Go see it.",

Mel Gibson was not a ""heavy"" actor in cinema, but apparently directing this film can not be matched too soon for a medium to large actor who becomes a director like him. A film that looks pretty pale note 10, even if is the existing maximum (1 to 10). Congratulations Mel Gibson and the entire team.",

I feel as if this film captures some essence of what it was like to be there, however I don't believe anyone (including myself) who hasn't experienced war will ever be able to comprehend it. It didn't hold back with the violence, explosions, or blood, which created this feeling and atmosphere of hell in the scenes of taking back Hacksaw. The audience seeing where Desmond Dawes started off, and what he became is something inspiring, never questioning his commitment to god, and never faulting to adversity in others not being able to understand this level of commitment and faith.",

One more just one more. I was shouting no more, but he kelp going. Heavenly Father and Angels were truly with private Dobbs. Nobody respected him in the beginning because he had faith. He had enough faith for all of his fellow soliders wether they were from American or from Japan, in his eye they were fellow human beings. He was a true hero in every sense of the word. No gun, just bandages and morphine, that's all he carried. He saved so many.

863,19 October 2022,emmaricherzhagen,7, Leader,"Hacksaw Ridge is a very intense movie that never has a boring point, this movie helps see more in depth how war was, like people losing limbs or just getting blasted and dying. War is something everyone needs to understand so we can thank those who serve for us. This movie helps examine how one person can change a lot of peoples perspectives on many things. One key thing that Hacksaw Ridge helps to see is that there's always going to be one person you meet that would die for you, they are brave and have a huge kind heart, these are the people you want around you. I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn more about war or how a person can step up and be the leader.",

865,19 October 2022,alexaalvarez-44695,10, Loved it,The movie was phenomenal. Andrew Garfield did an amazing job with portraying his character. I absolutely loved the story line and the fact that they included the actual people that the movie characters were based on at the end of the film. This film very well shows the life of Desmond Doss and his troubles from enlisting in the military to being a combat weapon without holding an armed weapon. I was happy to see that the director took the creative liberty and chose not to romanticize Doss' life and tried their best to depict the conditions that Doss' and the other soldiers went through while fighting in the second world war.,
866,19 October 2022,kalebstjohn,5, i did not see the first half sorry:(,"Hacksaw is an interesting one because of how many people basically got their heart ripped out, tapped on to their shirt and somehow survived. The war decisions were also questionable Like the climbing up the side of a cliff and fighting a massive cloud of dust. The cloud also acted like it was alive when it just moves wherever it wants and disappears whenever it wants. Also physics like the fact that if you put a bomb in a cave that cave should collaps and people hidding in it should make a good pancake breakfast in bed for any five star uncharted island hotel. Also the floating rope that appeared out of nowhere with one side connected to what I'm assuming is a rock with the powers of a god and the other is all the way at the end of space wrapped around an alien spaceship. And somehow they made a sky hammock with it. The enemy could easily just grab a knife and cut the rope. Other than that its good and justice was served i can only assume though.",

868,19 October 2022,melyssamuwanga-65716,6, It was okay I guess,"I think this movie was ok. I don't think they tried to make it realistic enough. I'm pretty sure some of these things did not happen for Doss in real life. It's a little bit fabricated in my own opinion but then again. I would have liked for this movie to have a more humane take on the Japanese part. Instead, the Japanese army was at some point in the movie faking its surrender, whereas the Americans were depicted really honest with their intentions and had a selfless hero medic. I do not believe that is how it goes down in war - both sides have tricks up their sleeves, which was just not presented in the movie. So I think people should watch this movie the cinematography is good and who doesn't love Andrew Garfield!",
869,19 October 2022,hayleecook-52748,9, Good job movie,"This movie was perfect in my opinion, I liked the acting and the storyline they gave was easy to follow. Specifically, I liked the acting of Andrew Garfield was good and it made me believe in the character, so it made me think I know who Desman Doss actually is. It felt like a genuine biopic and not some cheap excuse to use a man's life in a movie. The characters we met in the company kind of faded away and then we only got to know others in depth so that made me want to know more about them. The cinematography was a little goofy at some points and it was clearly obvious that it was a green screen but I can't help but compare it to the other war movie '1917'. Overall this was a good movie and pretty respectable to Desman Doss in my opinion so *thumbs up*.",
870,19 October 2022,abigailperezalbarran,7, Abi's Review- Hacksaw Ridge,"I liked this movie. I like watching movies and shows that have to do with the World Wars. They did a good job with the casting for this movie. Andrew Garfield did an amazing job with Desmond Doss. The main thing that made me not like this movie is when Smitty Ryker, played by Luke Bracey, dies in the battle field. Rykar and Doss were just starting to become friends, they were starting to trust each other during battle. But I do think that it was needed in order to show how during that time and during the first World War, that many of their comrades and friends did not make it back to their families. I also liked how they added interviews of the real people that the movie was based on. I liked that it showed how the soldiers fought during different parts of the day and how they lived on the battlefield.",
871,19 October 2022,cheilyporoj,10, I like the explosions,"While watching this film, from what I have seen and watched, I see this as a great film. While doing some research about the information contained inside the movie, I discovered that this movie was told by a true, real life person and event during World War II and how the real Desmond Thomas Doss became a hero for everyone as a medic and brave soldier. From everything, the explosions and gun scenes were my most favorite and interesting part because (come on it was epic right) of the way these actors contributed with their roles in this film. From the use of flame throwers to the bombs being thrown at opposing sides, everything when it comes to war and battle movies is seen here. We see a perspective of hopelessness, terror, trauma, and other emotions that were considered normal during back then and even considered true in today's world and society.",
872,7 June 2019,saeedmilani,9, Powerfull movie!,"It was really a good movie! What special effects did you make when it came up to you! The selection of his cast was really impeccable. Very beautiful warfare that forces the viewer to stomp the heart. The latest episode by Mel Gibson is one of his best works so far. With elegance and deep depth. Filled with a sense of philanthropy in the most horrific conditions of human conflict. Hecha Ridge represents the highest level of humanity in a situation that even having personal beliefs contradicts the system. Desmond Dos is leading the fight against war, and the ideal of a world without violence. Undoubtedly, alongside the rescue of Ryan's soldier, now the apocalypse and all-metal sheath is one of the best war film of history in the field of battlefield illustration.",
873,20 October 2022,cortlynbrown-09242,7, It wasn't bad but it wasnt good,"Hacksaw Ridge seemed immediately interesting, from the time period to the true story. I did not have high expectations going into the movie. I have seen many films and claims about Christians being oppressed, and to make that scenario would take impossible events to happen. However, though, I did quite enjoy the use of Constitutional rights and how they are applied in America. WW2 was an extremely high tension time, and to see how they still held onto the core values of this nation was refreshing to see.",

875,19 October 2022,dylandyson-20923,9, Doss on the ridge,"The film ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was spectacular. This movie really shows what it means to be a true American hero. This film is centered around the character Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield. Doss really made this movie for me and I really enjoyed how he never backed down from what he believed in no matter what he was told. Doss gaining respect throughout his unit all through this film was really nice to see considering how harshly they treated him early on. Seeing Doss save 75 men who were nearly dead was truly inspirational. This movies war scenes are quite graphic and can really show the conditions these men went through as a comparison to the actual event. Overall this movie really developed in to a all around great film that will inspire many for years to come.",
876,19 October 2022,noahbishop-68103,9, The Ridge that is Hacksaw,"Hacksaw Ridge was a story of a brave soldier who would not touch a gun but was determined to serve his country and save lives. This story is a very interesting and peculiar one since most people in the armed forces are armed. The story of this brave soldier is from the life of Desmon Doss and his ideologies and past made it so the story told was interesting and entertaining. He believed no murder was rightous, not even in war, because of the biblical verses and examples in the Bible. He almost killed his brother when he was young and almost killed his father in an attempt to protect his mother. These experiences created this ideology Doss believed in and that ultimately this is what made this movie so interesting. Typical war movies usually have the same concept of building friendship and fighting the enemy but in this movie it shows how Doss was bullied and how the higher ranking officers tried to stop his goals of saving lives for his country. He did not build much friendship with anyone until they started to respect him for his heroic actions at Hacksaw Ridge. This movie is one of the best of its kind because it doesn't have much of a kind. While it is a war movie it has such an interesting concept that it feels differently from any other out there.",
877,19 October 2022,jonathanhume-38655,9, Doss vs. the Japanese,"Hacksaw Ridge is one of my all time favorite war movies I have watched. It blows out a lot of other history movies like 1913 and Lincoln. And those movies were good as well. It is so fascinating to see that a medic who fought in the Japanese war managed to save seventy five soldier lives without even carrying a weapon. It almost sounds like a fiction story! I really like how the movie casts Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss because I felt as if he played the role great. The fight scenes in the film were super detailed and very tense to watch. The gory parts really showed what war was like. The profanity the soldiers spoke, how they communicated, the artillery they used, how training was like, etc. I also really enjoyed the comedic scenes that were shown, it brought some light into the movie before all of the darker war scenes started to happen. I would highly recommend everyone to watch this film before you go out and look at any other war movies.",
878,19 October 2022,takiyapatton-53976,10, Hacksaw Ridge,"I really liked this movie, i really didn't think i would like it because it looked kind of boring. I ended up liking the movie because Andrew Garfield was in it and he's kind of a great actor. Overall the movie was very good the end of the movie was kind of short I wished they would have showed more. Instead of him just being injured should have showed him like leaving the army at the end to return back with his wife. The ending kind of disappointed me. I liked when they had the Battle of Okinawa. It made me sad a little bit because most of the people died in the war. This movie was very good.",
879,1 November 2017,pongup,6, Long boring movie,"A war movie for me is difficult to make. Making one side morally better than the other, it became propaganda. Even though the movie tried not to focus on the war, rather the life of the miracle man, Mr. Doss, himself, I felt it was too long to take. The first half of the movie is just for the background of him, and I felt it was unnecessary. You can literally enter the theater an hour late, and still wouldn't miss the point. I believe this story is true and give so much respect to Mr. Doss for what he have done. But while watching, my mind was asking what American doing there in Japanese territories. Maybe I am not American so I was not so much into the movie. But, ironically, the director, Mel Gibson is not American either. For me, this one is just another long boring movie.",
880,19 October 2022,chloegosdin,10, Amazing film,"This film is amazing. It demonstrates that you don't need to carry a weapon to serve your country. Doss had a sense of duty and this made him join the army. He goes through boot camp not being respected, and he does anything his sergeant asks of him. In battle after everyone else retreated, Doss stayed on top of the ridge to save his fellow soldiers. This demonstrates that will do what he believes is right even though others may disagree. He finally earns respect from his unit.",
881,19 October 2022,avelise35,7, Hacksaw Ridge,"I'm not the biggest fan of war movies, but Hacksaw Ridge is an exception. The fact that British Andrew Garfield is able to make me believe that he is a hick from Virginia is amazing. It almost makes you forget that he is from the U. K. It also makes me happy that they didn't glamorize war, they showed the truth in all its horror. At points, it did feel like the war scenes were just a bit to long and almost to much to watch. Definitely something you have to take a break from so you can fully appreciate it. I almost felt queasy watching it so that wasn't much fun. But I do believe it is an important message and a good watch.",
882,20 October 2022,Hydro71,10, Naked dude is the best part of the movie,"This movie is not just another classic war flic, I mean it is but this one is severely better than most of them. Andrew Garfield does an outstanding performance in the movie, he portrays Desmond Doss so well. The best part of the movie was definitely that Naked Guy, man really carried the movie. The way that Doss' father comes in to save him at the last second is good character development for the character. The ending of the movie is good, I like that they took clips from Desmond's video interview before the credits. This movie is 11/10 yeah Andrew Garfield is a strange choice for the main protagonist BUT he did a good performance as Desmond Doss. Overall 10/10.",
883,19 October 2022,tristanjordan-57374,10, An amazing film,"Hacksaw Ridge, an amazing movie. This movie portrays heroism in many different ways. Doss, the main character, proves this. He dedicated his life to saving his troops without thinking of himself first. He put himself in front of a grenade and slapped it away from everyone. He was hated, absolutely hated. He was beaten and discriminated against by the other troops and even the higher ups. They almost didn't let him even go to battle because he refused to go through the gun training, even though he was told he didn't have to at one point. He took it to court to fight for his right to protect his religion and won. This was a great film by Mel Gibson.",
884,22 April 2017,simonetti-33557,5, Mel Gibson shouldn't have taken so much creative freedom,"First of all, my review is not a reflect of Desmond Doss' actions, life, bravery or courage. He is unarguably a hero, a man who deserves our utmost respect, admiration and gratitude. ",

What I didn't like was the fact that he only got his respect at the end when he should of had it all along; also the fact that it took him saving people and risking his life for his unit to finally acknowledge and respect him, and with the ending I feel like the movie should of took inspiration from the fact that what happened to Doss at the end of the movie isn't what happened in real life; but other than that i still enjoyed it.",
886,20 October 2022,chrisleyharper-21324,7, I LOVE ANDREW GARFEILD,Hacksaw Ridge is a very unique story of religion and war. Private Doss's strong beliefs that are demonstrated throughout the movie show true heroism in combat through his determination and loyalty to his beliefs and to his colleagues. I not only enjoyed Private Doss's character but I also enjoyed the character development of the other people in his troop who grew to support and respect Doss in battle and off. One thing that I didn't like was the extensive and violent battle scenes. The up close shot of people's heads being blown off was something I didn't find enjoyable. They were not only gory but also very long. I didn't think that these scenes added to the plot in any way but other than that a great movie with a great character.,
887,19 October 2022,milesashford,10, Hacksaw Ridge review,This was a phenomenal movie. This film showed many acts of heroism all throughout. The main character Doss was a hero on and off the battle field. If it wasn't for him trusting in god and following his ways the Americans would have never won that war. He inspired many people that violence isn't always the answer. Simply just helping people can make such a big difference in the world. I couldn't imagine what all the soldiers had to go through every single day. Just the fact that they had to go to sleep knowing that they might not survive that next day. If it wasn't for doss most soldiers wouldn't have been able to go back home to their families. Even though he used to get made fun of and bullied for not wanting to hold a gun he still stayed strong he believed in what he thought was right. Amazing film!,
888,20 October 2022,aliyastephens,7, hack hack hack hacksaw,"I think that this movie was an interesting take on those who don't believe in violence. Taking that this is based off of a true story, I think being like this takes a lot of courage. I highly enjoyed the interactions Doss and the other soldiers had with each other. It really implemented the dire situation they were in and also helped them break down walls that they had since they were forced into a life or death situation. I think Andrew Garfield did a great job playing Doss and I highly enjoyed his character. Unfortunately I would not rewatch the movie since the gore was a little too much for me.",
889,19 October 2022,waynelusk-53626,10, loved it,Loved it. Doss does what he says no matter what and that is why i think he is a good character persisting through beatings and doubting from his own squad mates to save them no matter what through gunfire and explosions that is what it means to have a sense of duty. The way Doss is we can clearly see because of his dad. He is the exact opposite of his dad being his dad seeing all his friends die while fighting in his war with violent tendencies while Doss save more than his friends with no way of protection on his own even working with people who are knocked out so he has no way that he could escape if he got cornered.,
890,19 October 2022,maryjoanmartin,8, Andrew did a good job,This movie is not for the light-hearten or people with a weak stomach as it is filled with gory and loud war scenes. I think they did a good job at showing all of the feelings Doss experienced throughout the movie. For example there was a scene explaining his dislike for guns as he had an abusive drunk father that shot a gun while fighting him. I think this gave Doss some PTSD around touching a gun. I think they did a good job at telling the war story of Desmond Doss. However I wish they wouldn't have ended the movie so abruptly. I would have loved to see Desmond accept awards after the war ended and see him go through recovery. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 as I thought it was a pretty good movie. I deducted a point for the semi-par ending and an additional point deducted for the overly gory scenes although realistically portrayed.,
891,19 October 2022,davisthomas-76784,9, Hacksaw Ridge Movie Review,"At first, I found this movie a little bit corny. Desmond's life story that was told prior to him joining the war seemed a little unrealistic and sugar coated in some areas, but I'm sure that's sort of what life was like during that time. This movie was super funny outside of the gruesome war scenes. These actors were very humorous and portrayed these characters greatly. Andrew Garfield is one of my favorites and was fun to watch in this film. This movie caused me to research on Desmond Doss even further and find out some more about him. This story is super interesting and I'm glad this movie was made to tell it. I was locked in the entire time and would now have to consider this one of my favorite movies. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't heard of Doss' story and would enjoy an action-packed war movie.",
892,20 October 2022,rylancrapet,10, Hacksaw Ridge more like haha,Hacksaw ridge was one of my favorite movies I've seen in our class that i haven't seen already. The use of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss was a really good decision. My favorite part of the movie was when Doss' dad came and got him out of the trial. The comedy aspect of the movie was good too and every joke gave me a laugh. The story of Desmond Doss was really good and made me feel happy Doss decided to never pick up a gun. At the end of the movie i liked the way that it showed Doss in real life and all of his friends. Overall it was a really good movie that had me like learning more about wars.,
893,19 October 2022,loganfuqua-40382,10, AMEN,I Looooooooove this movie there is not one thing that I didn't like about this movie. This movie is a true story about a war in Guam. This follows Desmond Doss on his journey to becoming a soldier. In the beginning of the movie Doss is at home with his family; we discover early on that his home life is not the best and his father is a drunk. Doss has strong beliefs and does not want to use a weapon in war. He goes to train for war and is disliked by most of the other soldiers. The part where they are training is literally so funny. I loved it because the sergeant was making fun of them. But they didn't respect him at all because of what he believed in. They went on to fight and quickly realized that they could lose their lives that day. Doss was saving anyone that he could even if he was told that they wouldn't make it. The next day he proves his worth by staying behind and saving as many men as he could by himself!,
894,20 October 2022,caidenturner,6, Good but Gory,"This movie was a little too real. I didn't think it was gonna be that gory but what should I expect from a war movie. The scenes from when they first attacked had my stomach turning. This movie had my heart racing, I almost felt like I was there. Even though it was really gory and might have scared me a little bit I still enjoyed the movie. The little love story in the beginning was a good touch it added more to the story and made it more interesting. I also loved the comedic scenes like how for some reason that guy was randomly naked when Dawson first arrived at the military base. It was overall a good movie that I will definitely remember.",
895,13 July 2017,peter-376-761113,7, Old fashioned movie making with Mel Gibson's bloody touch.,"OK. It's like a 1950's epic, patriotic war movie ... but with Mel Gibson's signature sado-masochistic touch. It's certainly an interesting story, but played out with an extremely heavy hand that makes it a bit cringe-inducing at times. ",
896,20 October 2022,rhyancarson,9, War Movie = Good Movie,"Can we just get into the acting of Andrew Garfield. Like yea he's Spiderman, but beyond that he is more. The emotion he brings not only outside the war but inside of the war. Though the real guy he is portraying has got to be one of the bravest people I've heard of. I feel that the story was portrayed perfectly on screen. The sense of heroism I felt while watching is almost indescribable. The only thing I didn't really like was the amount of gore that was presented. But, I cannot handle a lot of gore so I feel like that played apart. The intensity of the movie from the middle of the end really surprised me. I wouldn't have thought that the movie would have shifted so quickly from training to war. Also I felt like Doss did not deserve that trial, because there were medics needed specifically in this war due to the amount of lives lost already. Overall this was a great movie.",
897,20 October 2022,churchtwatters,7, Solid.,"This movie, while definitely not groundbreaking, was still enjoyable to watch. The plot of the movie was pretty good. It was fast paced and exciting most of the time but knew how to slow down and build up some anticipation. There are some small plot holes that just weren't important to the story but there wasn't anything that ruined the movie. The acting was also done well. I think Andrew Garfield is a great actor and does well in this movie as Doss (even though his accent sounds kind of dumb). There was a little comedic relief in the movie as well. In a movie about WWII that might irritate some people but I think it really shows that the soldiers who signed up were not truly prepared for the seriousness of the war. The movie looked fantastic as well. Even the scenes that were the darkest or the most brutal had a certain beauty to them. This movie was definitely worth the watch.",

899,21 October 2022,johnwashington-87142,7, good,I gave this movie 7/10 because I like how they did this movie and also the funny scenes but there are scenes that it was sad how so many people died in the war. From back then but also how the one who saved these people was Andrew Garfield in the movie but in life was Desmond Doss. He was a hero back in that war but how it sucks that so many of them died in the war for us and but. I did love some of the scenes they had in the movie. It was good and funny but also how sad it was back then that how many people died in the war but I am also glad about that. We had people like that who were brave that they did that for us and that we have people like that in our country.,

And how the actions and effects were still interesting but didn't take away the emotion in the faces. You were drawled in by the acting and the emotion that was really in this piece. It showed so much heroism as well. I don't really see how the beginning really helped with the story. It was just him hitting his brother in the head with a brick but maybe that showed he was a fighter, that he always fought back? I love how they laid out the movie and that you weren't confused or anything. How the back stories were made since in that way the movie played the character out. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good hero film. You can easily learn from this movie and write a paper on this historical figure.

Although inspired by real facts - being the main reason I struggled to watch it to the end - the film literally begs for mercy to the point it becomes irritatingly pathetic for a ""heroes journey"". With a ranking of 8.2 on IMDb, watching Hacksaw Ridge feels like an over- priced bag of potatoes chips compared with masterpieces like Letters from Iwo Jima, Empire of the Sun, The Pacific series, etc. or any WWII German production for that matter.

You can tell that there are times where there is humr and times where there isn't, no out of place jokes or akward dialogue. Everything here fits. It hurts to see characters die, you feel the hope of a character when they may be saved. Camera work is good, no shot feels long or drawn out, no shot feels out of place, like it was poorly cut or anything in between. The acting is S tier, all of the characters feel like real people you may meet in a barrack if you were really going to fight in a war. All in all this movie was great an i highly recommend it.",

I would scroll through the channels and see it playing and constantly think, ""Well there's that war movie again"". I never gave it much thought mainly due to my dislike of war movies, however I'm glad I finally gave it a shot. Doss is the perfect example of a good man. He stood firmly behind his beliefs and I appreciated that this movie isn't just about war, but about his life before it. There was no point during this movie where I felt bored or disconnected from the story. I was on the edge of my seat during the battle scenes, I was amazed by Doss' drive to save his fellow soldiers, and I was relieved when I saw him finally gain the respect of those around him.

I give this movie a 10/10!!!

I loved how he saved each and every man he could get to he put all his strength into it even with people still catching him. The saddest part when a good friend of his died and even took his body with him. Doss was trying to kick a bomb away his leg got blew off. Soldier and heroes always leave early.",

Andrew Garfield was a great actor to put as the main character, he portrayed Desmond and his emotions very well. The whole movie was chaotic but interesting, his character never got a break either from his commanders or the soldiers he was staying with. One moment that changed the way they look at him and his character development completely was when his fellow soldiers beat him up during his sleep and he knew who did it exactly but he chose to not snitch on them. Another reason was his commanding officer was telling him to go home after the beating because he looked so defeated but he didn't give up he chose to go do his daily job.",

While this movie was VERY gorey during the actual war parts, this was hard to watch, but a very tough reality that was portrayed greatly. The character build up of Doss was AMAZING. It is often hard to sympathize with characters in war movies because there is often little to no background of the character besides their lives in war. It is simply impossible to not have a love for Desmond Doss. Andrew Garfield does right by Doss. The courage displayed by Doss even when those around him doubted his is inspiring. Saving people by saving people. Love this adaptation of the real life of Desmond Doss.",

The amazingly written characters that you learn to love and cherish really pull on your heart strings.. And the beautiful love story between Dorothy and Desmond doss was just perfect. This movie did very well to give Desmond Doss' story justice and light. Displaying the pain and the suffering perfectly, while showing how resilient Doss was!! Absolutely recommend!",
927,18 March 2017,viniciusandraderibeiro,7, It feels like a movie,"Everyone is saying it is a great produced war movie. First of all, a considerable part of the story takes place at the protagonist life before he went to war and, honestly, I think this is the best part. We have great comic events on the army training. Then we see the war we were waiting and yes, the wounds are very realistic and you do have to have stomach to watch. But still it looked like a movie. If I had to tell one reason I would say the camera movements and takes. All we see is the common beautiful shots we are used to. Everything is so clean that at the end the protagonist's hair remains untouchable. The script does not surprises us as well. The dialogues are simple and it leaves the impression that the movie is too anxious to get to the war as fast as possible. At the end we see it taking the side of religion and exalting the hero. I do think Desmond Doss is a hero but I do not think we should say what he did was a good thing. What he did was madness and he was very lucky to came out alive. The performances are very impressive especially Andrew Garfield's. To conclude, if you enjoy a good war movie this is the right way to go. If you don't, it does not worth to see too much blood for a weak plot.",

Although the movie makes efforts to convince I was rolling my eyes throughout the first part of the film, in particular anytime Desmond Doss talked about why he refused to carry a weapon or was seen quietly contemplating his bible. These aww-shucks moments were too numerous when coupled with the overly saccharine love story. I was left perplexed by the first part of the movie to be honest, it was basically Leave It To Beaver levels of 1950's white male delusions coupled with off the wall christian cult blathering. BUT just when I was ready to give up on the movie they start killing each other, and by they I mean Japanese and American soldiers, which really makes it all worth watching.

It was an excellent example of what war might have actually looked like back then.it had some very explicit scenes when it was portraying what happened during the battles but that just made it so much more interesting. Even though the scenes were gruesome you couldn't look away I always had to be looking at the screen because it just kept me so intrigue. But you do kind feel bad for the soldiers that had passed. It had great representation of what they might have been feeling and the injuries they might have inquired during war battles and i just think its cool how they actually made it look like the people were in a real battle and actually getting there heads blown of and things like that. That is why i rated the movie a seven out of ten.,

Perhaps inspired by the true story of Desmond Doss, but to say this movie is a true story is ridiculous - watch or read a GOOD documentary of Desmond Doss with the filmed interviews of him and you will see why this attempt is an affront to the poor guy.

It ticks all the boxes of a typical war movie loud and mean drill sergaent, guy getting bullied in barracks, the bully having a change of heart at the end, red head/blonde lover waiting back home, action set pieces ripped from private ryan you know the usual.
Its selling point was the guy didnt want to use a gun or kill and his superiors gave him hell for it. Looking back at it the superiors were really worried and trying to protect the guy even as far as trying to get him court marshalled to keep him of the field (yes there was a millitary court scene, few good men). I remember playing call of duty 1 remember one part where there where not enough guns and the play was just given bullets n told to run behind some one with a gun so if he died i got a gun n had extra ammo we were just cannon fodder. I admire the US Army for the lengths they went to stop him and the lengths he went to not go to war to kill. im gonna read the book to see if it delves deeper into the battle of ideaologies.

The father of the movie was someone you can actually understand and feel bad for but also hate cause of he instead of doing better got worse and had even been abusing his wife but the reason why makes sense. The main plot does and will always stay true to the story and that's amazing. The main character is written amazingly and honestly pretty well rounded with his logic of not wanting to hurt or kill people. I gave this movie 10/10.,

966,15 March 2020,Adil90,8, Tour de force,Based on real World-War II events a peculiar young man named Desmond Doss is eager to participate in the war with just one holding hook: refusing to bear arms. Desmond is a committed Christian and fully adheres to the commandment 'thou shall not kill'. He sticks to this non-violence principle after childhood trauma involving violence.,
967,20 November 2020,murat_dolan,10, Perfect,"MEL GIBSON has the signature structure of an incredibly successful person as a successful director. I would like to thank you, my love for film, cinema, film and cinema, which is a very effective production with this movie that should shoot more",
968,19 October 2022,nataliacompean,10, A great movie about war,"In my opinion, this is an excellent film about the Second World War and an army to which an extraordinary man belonged who saved the lives of men without firing a shot (he also tends to wounded soldiers)... and about Doss, whose objective main is the basic training of his soldiers just to test their strength and prepare them for war, showing true courage in the face of enemies and compassion as well. It also has a bit of romance, as one of the soldiers was about to get married but couldn't attend his own wedding because he had to stay locked up in his army.",
969,14 December 2017,Mr-Mingz,8, A great retelling of an inspiring story,"I was very impressed by the direction considering the large gap between productions Mel Gibson taken on and directed. I feel the screenplay really captured the atmosphere in a platoon you would expect from a soldier who doesn't want to carry firearms into battle.
I did feel that Andrew Garfield maybe wasn't the best choice for the role and I hadn't even heard of Pvt Doss before this. The lack of funding may have contributed to this and I guess the family members of the real Pvt Doss were happy enough so go figure.
Hugo Weaving however, was brilliant, and it took me to the middle point of the feature to realise it was Hugo Weaving.
The biggest surprise was seeing Vince Vaughn in a serious war movie...he makes a few jokes towards the latter half....but he actually pulls it off surprisingly well.
Sam Worthington brought nothing to his role and might aswell have not been there.
Being a thrilling, dramatic and story-telling war, I do feel we were not given enough character development for his fellow comrades besides the 10 minutes or so during his introduction to the platoon. I feel this is crucial in gripping war movies. The movie lasts longer than 2 hours as it is...but still.
The other thing that was missing was a lot more intensity. There were really 2 scenes or so which really had you on the edge of your seat yet the set design for the battlegrounds were created incredibly well so it was a shame not to make better use.",

I grew up with people telling me that non-violence can't work in the present world but I believe it can. Non-violence is not for the cowards its for the bravest of men and this is what the life of Desmond Doss teaches us.",

While not a documentary, any film which takes on the mantle of re-creating a true story on screen (especially one about war) should, in my opinion, feel compelled to pay attention to detail. Some brief research online suggests this wasn't the case. I also think one-sided war films are a dangerous way to stir nationalistic views to modern audiences. I'd have much preferred to see both sides tales somewhat represented. In saying this, the very fact that this memorable film brings the story of one man's conviction in his faith leading to him saving 75 lives, deserves immense respect.",

983,21 November 2022,hjorose,5, Hackneyed Ridge,"The true story this is based on offers a fascinating chance to do more than the usual war film; to really delve into an alternative presentation and discussion of mankind's tendancy to war, as well of course to honour the lives lost to war by so many men and women, whether they condone or object to it. Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor. His nuanced portrayal of an alternative Christian's actions in Under the Banner of Heaven shows how much he could have brought to this film. Sadly he has little to work with here where all we get are trite sentimentalism and plenty of gore. I see from IMDB that Mel Gibson's son has high billing in the credits for his debut role although he made little impression. It is worth seeing Desmond Doss and some of the remaining soldiers portrayed here speak at the end, but you don't need to sit through the whole film to do that. Otherwise give this a miss and watch/rewatch Under the Banner of Heaven and Band of Brothers instead.",

But just one thing, why didn't the Japanese soldiers either chop down the climbing net or just stand at the top and blast the attacking American soldiers every time they climbed up?!!! Presumably the real events made that impossible so why did the film put so much effort into making everything so authentic yet omit to explain a totally simple premise. Towards the end the Japanese are literally at the top of the net being shot at by the Americans below yet the next day the net is still perfectly in place. Why didn't the remaining Japanese soldiers hack the netting away or wait with weapons at the ready for the next wave of attack???

1002,19 January 2017,alshaikha-44,6, average,"the movie seemed quite unfair to Japan, they were brave soldiers who fought for their country, so hearing that victory song along the scene were the US soldiers were fighting the Japs and killing them was just sad. If the director believed in ""not using the weapons"" the song would not seem so victorious when great men died fighting for their country, even if they eventually lost. Moreover, If The weapon did not exists in the US Army as what Doss wanted, HE would have died, because at the end the Japs followed him to the end of the ""cliff"" and were surprised by the numerous numbers of Soldiers fighting back with weapons and saving Doss. All in all, the movie was not interesting, he has childhood trauma, he grows up, serves in the army, he is a hero. All men who fought are heroes, It is not by the number of men saved, or killed, It is about sacrificing your life to save your country, whether you died of fever during your time in the army, or saved 100 men on duty.

Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield was absolutely amazing in this(never really been a fan of his).

1038,3 October 2020,cpeffer,10, Response to DukeEman's review,"I found this review of Hacksaw Ridge. Hacksaw Ridge is one of my personal favorite movies. This review was written by someone with the username DukeEman, who said that he is not a Christian. Despite this, he said that he appreciated the religious aspect of the film because of how well Mel Gibson incorporated it with the main character, Desmond Doss. DukeEman's review of the film was very good, as he covered many of the media keys in his review. He viewed all angles of the film, paying attention to everything, the characters, the casting, the plot, the dialogue, the special effects. He is very aware of the attitudes conveyed by the film, as he pointed out many of the main points that the film was emphasizing, like here: ""It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss' moral and internal conflict with using a gun!"" He did not really touch on the dignity of the human person or truth-filled keys, although based on his overall analysis of the film, he probably would agree that these two keys are represented well. If he were to touch on these, he could have said that Doss' refusal to take human life, as well as his willingness to save as many men as possible, even some of the Japanese men, promotes the dignity of the human person. He also could have pointed out how this film is truth-filled, not only because it is literally based on a true story, and tells the story accurately, but because it shows the truth that faith, whether well-placed or not, is a powerful motivator, and faith can lead to extraordinary acts, like in Desmond Doss' case. DukeEman mentioned in his review that he was inspired by the film, specifically by the courage and faith of Doss' character. Multiple times he marvels at the technical brilliance of the film and the overall skillful development of the film, particularly the special effects and casting. He points out how detailed and realistic the battle scenes are, saying: ""The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish."" He also mentioned how Doss' character is relatable. Overall, I think that this is an incredible review, and I agree with many of his observations about the film as well.",

If you're into slow motion, dramatic music and comic book action, then this movie is for you. If not, then avoid this. Without a doubt Doss was a brave man, and his story would have earned a much better movie. A pity that mr. Gibson decided to continue on his old way of making movies. I mean, there was a lot of stuff that reminded me of his older work, like Patriot and We Were Warriors (which were good), but I think this story would have had ingredients for much better than this.

Besides not being physically similar to the protagonist of the story, I don't think he could give enough of the emotion in the scenes. In addition, in the rescue scenes, the feeling of how close the Japanese were to the hero was not given well. Gunfight scenes didn't look realistic to me. It was as if the soldiers were not aiming, but they were constantly on target. There are lots of errors in the movie. In real life:
1-Dorothy was not a nurse when she met with Doss
2-Doss was never in the court-martial
3- Hacksaw Ridge's height was at most one fifth of height of the ridge depicted in the movie.",

Believing that the war was just but killing was nevertheless wrong, he was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon.

He was the first conscientious objector to ever win the Congressional Medal of Honor. ""please god help me to save one more"" best sentence i ever heard in movie Mel Gibson is the greatest director for the next century excellent sound design and sound effects the actors were amazing the locations too, as a viewer i was totally attached i could not take my breath. its my favorite type of movies when you feel like its a real experience and it will make a difference in your life for the next 10 20 years. when you keep telling your self he will do it he will do it now and he DID NOT!!!!! you feel like he is giving you all the reasons to say its a war and you must do it and hold your gun no ethics in the war it is not the perfect time to improve what you believe in you will die. the movie is romantic, comedy, thriller, suspense movie i consider it a new history in the world of cinema",
1054,8 February 2017,billcr-80682,8, Gritty,"Mel Gibson may be a racist lunatic in his real world life, but he is one hell of a movie director. His eye for detail in Hacksaw Ridge is impeccable. Andrew Garfield is Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who will not carry a weapon or kill due to his Seventh Day Adventist upbringing. Early on, he encounters a bureaucratic wall, as the military informs him of the necessity of carrying a gun in combat. Doss eventually is able to travel to Japan as a medic and winds up in some extremely vicious and bloody battles near Okinawa in 1945, just before the end of World War II. The fighting scenes are fairly typical of previous war films and the basic training insult laden, politically incorrect drill sergeant are lifted from Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" Mel can be forgiven for this, as the character development is fully realized by Garfield and the supporting cast never hits a false note. The last few minutes are a beautiful tribute to a real American hero and Hacksaw Ridge is one of the ten best movies of the year.",

The story of Desmond Doss, an army medic that he refused to carry the weapon in the whole battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. This the untold story of Desmond Doss and the finer war hero in these stories. In this whole film, he didn't use any weapon and save many peoples. First of all, he was struggling, no one accepts him for this reason. During the movie there have tears movement and overall emotions gripping. Hacksaw Ridge the film which was based on a true story. And he won the battle without weapon use. In the film, Mel Gibson works flaws works and gives their best to make this film. When the story needs to established Doss's kind heart gives him the best.
The journey as Doss experiencing the wide range of emotions endures by the heroic character along his journey. After the Japanese attack on pearl harbor, doss was the army to serve as a compact medic. His father was upset about his decision. doss is placed in basic training under the command of Sergeant Howell. And that's the time he was refused to handle a rifle. There captain discharge, Doss. After completing his basic training and release to leave Doss intends to marry Dorothy. For refused the rifle he was going to jail. His father was former commanding and save her. After the Japanese attack, Smitty is killed and some other was injured in the battle. Doss cries for dying soldiers and returned to save them. He is the gentlemen who save his own commands even more deadly hated by his enemy to have so many of them and it's simply epic in this battle. He also saves by belaying them down by rope and each time he was praying to save one more. After that, the captain apologizes to Doss's beliefs as cowardice and will not go without him. All the things after that the battle is won.
In the terms of acting, the cast of the whole is incredibly giving the best key performance in this film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor in this film. In this film, to describe his role as Doss. He gives in this film in quality to define him as a simple man with values while he facing some problems or struggles. Garfield has given some much study and preparation for his character's journey as a wisely simple man, emotion, and bravery. This is also the wonderful inspiration in this movie because how Doss saw us his courage, he never backs her leg in his decision when he was 20 years old.
Overall. Hacksaw Ridge gives the audience of emotion that describes the horrors of war. Watching the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike. Mel Gibson as a director, he knows how to put the moment, where will be heart touching and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent in the film.",

Offering a vulnerable hero who becomes great for his apparent vulnerability. As an Andrew Garfield fan, it's very hard for me to be objective about this movie.

1098,27 November 2017,roby0067001,5, Over-hyped,"Can't say much about this movie in particular... Based on a real story that is of a brave young religious man i respect it and that they don't tweak it too much out of reality. The things i disliked a lot were the characters.Very generic military personas and not so much to add about them.Our main character childhood was not one to envy and leaved some marks on him on the use of weapons. He stays true to his beliefs and that is trait that shines the most. The bad thing : I felt nothing for no character at all(yes, even the Doss) the screen time development was little to none but i just saw a bunch of love scenes and felt like Doss went to war just not to be left out and feel inferior. Could not care less about his desire to save the country and protect the loved ones since there is no interior monologue in thought of what his decision are. He is very very straight to the point not even thinking about other influences, and while is not a bad thing it shows how little character inking i got for him.So characters where not to be cared of. I rate it a 4/10. Story was the interesting part that got me in and it speaks for itself i rate it a solid 7/10. The visuals are really good for the budget and look fairly realistic expect the ship attack. I rate it a fair 7/10. Overall unsatisfied with ending and wasting so much screen time with no build of emotion in a war that screams hell but we don't see any changes in other individuals(The cowards remain cowards the bully's appreciation for Doss work felt so out of passion) Overall enjoyment was a 5 , no more no less , not a waste of time but a huge disappointment of what it could have been.",

There are still some parts to the movie that have you cheering for Doss and his company, but I just can't get past so many things that are more like a superhero movie than a ""based on real life events"" movie. If you want to see a great war hero movie that is about a man who doesn't want to fight on religious grounds and is not overly dramatized, watch ""Sergeant York"".",

A true story which proves that one man truly can make change. A story of one man's faith in God and conviction to refrain from killing even when facing pure evil in hell like circumstances. Only thing I don't get is why Desmond had to make a fuss about not touching a gun during basic training. I think he should have just completed it like the rest of them, firing range and all, it would have spared everyone a lot of trouble but he chose the hard way.

Discovered this because I enjoyed Bracey in a new film.,

1113,27 June 2020,alexgamer-51570,10, Amazing acting and directing. Superb.,"One man to do all this good is absolutely amazing. A true story that is legendary. The screenplay is so authentic and true to the colours of war. Already from the first second in this movie, I knew it was a work of art. Desmond was hated by his own fellow troops and his enemies and then to save so many men, is absolutely monumental. The scenes of him saying ""Lord, help me get one more"" was so adrenaline-pumping and absolutely epic. Overall the movie for me is perfect. Best movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and I was stunned to silence several times in the movie.",
