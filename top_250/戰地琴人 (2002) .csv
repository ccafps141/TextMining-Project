0,1 November 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Excellent, depressing, but excellent","Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.",/
1,9 September 2013,Fella_shibby,10, A Masterpiece. Awesome acting by Brody.,"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.",r
2,28 April 2003,FilmOtaku,8, An astonishing film,"The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.",e
3,21 January 2003,jotix100,10, To hell and back.,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.",v
4,16 January 2003,Quinoa1984,10," Stoic, haunting tale of survival","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  ",i
5,3 February 2013,classicsoncall,10," ""You musicians don't make good conspirators.""","Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.",e
6,9 January 2004,dtb,10, Adrien Brody's Minimalist Acting Packs Maximum Emotional Punch,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)",w
7,6 September 2005,Nazi_Fighter_David,10, Definitively an inspiring epic...,"'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' ",/
8,7 April 2005,baba44713,9," terrific movie, if relentlessly gritty and realistic","I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.",r
9,20 January 2003,Xanan,10, 10 out of 10,"The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.",w
10,19 April 2017,Leofwine_draca,9, Heartfelt and enthralling,"THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.",6
11,10 September 2009,Hitchcoc,10, Tour de Force,"There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see.",6
12,1 February 2003,ashcoounter,9," Brilliantly Narrated, Visually Stunning!","Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.",6
13,30 April 2008,rmax304823,8, Survivor,"Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.",1
14,23 October 2021,johnharapa,10, Harrowing Performance by Adrian Brody,"Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.",3
15,13 February 2019,csab-39797,10, Adrien Brody at his best. A True heartbreaking story!,"Everything about this movie is made in perfect detail; the clothes, the buildings etc. The audience gets to see how the Jewish population in Warsaw started out as normal everyday citizens and how the German government slowly brought them to their deaths.
The acting is not over the top it's completely realistic and Adrien Brody is MAGNIFICANT! If you don't shed a tear or get chills watching this true story then you have no soul!",5
16,16 February 2011,KineticSeoul,7, Lacks a bit of character development and not as powerful as I expected it to be,"This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.",5
17,28 October 2020,Xstal,7, Warsaw Fact...,"Around 30% of Warsaw's population was Jewish in 1939, about 375,000 people; with refugees, the population of the ghetto rose to 450,000 - over 80,000 perished in it; deportations to Treblinka began in July 1942 (Yad Vashem).",/
18,18 November 2008,ma-cortes,8, Intense biography about a Polish pianist named Szpilman during the Warsaw ghetto,"This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and proper experience on his childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides splendid actors, Frank Finlay,Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. Evocative cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's usual. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor, Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.",?
19,29 December 2005,dbdumonteil,10, Spilzman? What a beautiful name for a pianist...,"In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.",r
20,21 February 2011,orangeisthenewawesome,10, Unforgettable,My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. ,e
21,6 July 2003,zetes,8," Good, but imdb voters are overrating it","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.",f

23,30 March 2003,Derek237,10, Shock appeal?,"The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.",=
24,4 August 2010,evanston_dad,9, Polanski's New Spin on an Old Classic,"Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.",t
25,4 November 2009,sddavis63,6, Sobering Depiction Of Warsaw Under German Occupation,"The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.",t

33,20 September 2009,Theo Robertson,8, Despite The Over Familiarity A Good Film,The problem with making a holocaust film is that it's a subject that's been done before . Everyone from Steven Spielberg to ( Amazingly and somewhat hypocritically I say ) Vanessa Redgrave has made a film centering around the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry . I have a problem with this because it denigrates history to an extent . If people have to make a film featuring man's inhumanity to man as a reminder what does this say for the rest of humanity ? Can't the rest of humanity watch a documentary like SHOA or the Genocide episode of THE WORLD AT WAR ( My first introduction to The Holocaust ) or read a book of the accounts of Nazi mass murder ? Would it be too cynical to point out how well rewarded Holocaust movies are ? It's also noticeable how formulaic these type of movies are . We start at the beginning of the war and follow the protagonist's survival until they're liberated by the allies in 1945 ,

35,5 April 2012,Steffi_P,9," ""That's what we have to believe""","The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.",
36,7 August 2005,dbborroughs,4, Over-rated story of survival,"I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment",

49,12 March 2005,diane-34,10, I feel dumb that I did not watch this brilliant film earlier.,"Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.",

51,18 January 2004,claudio_carvalho,7," Another Movie About the Massacre of Jews in the Second World War, With an Outstanding Performance of Adrien Brody","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Polish Jewish pianist very famous in Warsaw. When Germany invades Poland, his wealthy family and him are sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Them they are sent to Treblinka, but Szpilman escapes in the train station. He struggles to survive, hidden in the most different places and depending on friend's sympathy to stay alive. He survives the war and died in the year 2000. This movie is a super production, very well directed by Roman Polanski and having an outstanding performance of Adrien Brody. However, this sad story does not present anything that was not showed before, like, for example, `Schindler`s List' did some years ago. There is a good movie (`Uprising' (2001), TV), showing better the events of the Warsow Ghetto uprising, but the intention of `The Pianist' is to show the true saga of Szpilman. I can perfectly understand that Jewish persons, who are majority in the cinema industry, have a great interest in keeping alive the atrocities of the Second World War. But these movies are very repetitive, showing horrible dramas of the most different survivors, or persons who died. However, there are so many other massacres of races to be explored through the human history and unfortunately they are not showed in movies like the murder of Jewish in the WWII. My vote is eight.",

A Jewish classic pianist's career was upended in 1940 in Germany because of.....well, we all know the answer to that. This movie's telling of the methodical NAZI takeover and extermination of the Jewish people is brutal and chilling in detail. It portrays the crescendo of evil inflicted upon those people as their rights slowly were stripped away through the eyes of Wladyslaw Szpilman. This sugarcoats absolutely nothing. It sears many horrific scenes into your brain at the lack of any ounce of humanity by the NAZI's. It is of the highest quality in terms of production, screenplay, editing and of course the musical moments. This is top quality on this subject. Do not watch.....on a whim.

As is the case with all of Polanski's movies, there are some very harrowing scenes, namely when the Nazi planes first start bombing the city, and when Szpilman has to hide.

It was a very sad and tragic film compared to Schindler's List because of some gruesome events of the Holocaust. Since the film was set up in Warsaw, Poland it helps the viewers to delve more on the life of Szpilman. The music and sound effects that were used on the movie was also natural and added more emotions to the story. However, There are lots of disturbing scenes in this film that will make your stomach roll. The movie is not gory but the events will let you question how evil a man can be. All in all, The Pianist because it was based on real events of the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman. While watching the movie you will realize that you are actually not watching a film about a hero but rather a survivor. Adrien Brody's method acting makes this movie one of a kind.

The writer must pay attention to the details of the events and bring them across in the most respectful nature without exploiting the events for cinematic gain. The actors must have the utmost care for the characters they portray in order to properly tell such a tragic story. Roman Polanski's The Pianist hits all these marks. The film is adapted from the memoirs of a famed Polish Jewish pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. It chronicles the events of the Jewish exile into the Polish ghettos and their eventual relocation to the concentration camps. Szpilman, however, was not taken to a concentration camp and had to spend months hiding out from the Germans as they destroyed Warsaw, Poland.

The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict.

However, though this film has all of that and then some, the sum of the parts is equal to the incredible story of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Having not heard of him before, the first time I saw this film I was shocked on many levels.

It distinguishes itself from Polanski's other masterpieces because it has the heart his films usually do not possess.

It was as heartrending, fearful, expressive and disastrous as the characters of Spielberg's film experienced, though in a different view of course. This film again showed us the misery of innocent people experienced in the hands of vile Germany. But then it left me a room to think in my head that not everything of Germany is as vile as the mainstream thinks. It's the same lesson I picked when watching Schindler's List. And the suffering of the protagonist opened once more parts of life you never thought would happen to anyone. And there are so many things you would never thought of letting go or letting it happen before your eyes and conscience. Such burden and misfortune one has to carry just to survive, Adrien's character lived up to that. We saw it, the struggle and transformation.

Another thing I noticed, and liked, in the film is that some Nazis (specially Captain Hosenfeld) were presented in a positive way that I have not seen in any movie about the WW2 before, it just proves that some of them contained humanity. Also, needless to say but I will say it anyway, the acting game was at a spectacular level.

The main character did an excellent job I think in his role and taking up through the ordeal of a persecuted Jew in that war. The character development suffered a bit I think in getting this message across and we didn't get much of a sense of what came before it and what led up to it. The viewer is just sort of air-dropped into this nightmare. The piano angle was interesting also, but again context lacking as far as the society he lived in. In other words, if you're going to dehumanize the German people, not just the military, show us how it happened.

Some men might call statutory rape Getting Lucky but generally not when the girl is 13, definitely not if the girl is drugged-up by the assailant in order to assure her co-operation. I say it's reprehensible and Mr. Polanksi needs to return to face his crime.",

In symbolic terms it regards our condition under huge duress as when Adrien Brody moves his fingers through the air and the audiences hears the beautiful sounds of the piano that are only evident in his tarnished mind. His family was separated from him and we can sense his loneliness as he walks a street littered with bodies and fallen structures. He is forced to help rebuild a separation wall as well as endure brutal treatment from the Nazis. Directed by Roman Polanski who himself is a survivor of such conditions, and his passion for the material is evident. His previous films contain such classics as Chinatown and Repulsion. He creates the nightmarish atmosphere of the period and succeeds with great results. Flawless acting by Brody whose grief is only subsided by the sounds of piano. Strong supporting work by Thomas Kretschmann as a German soldier who happens upon him and the interesting situation that transpires as a result. Frank Finley, Maureen Lipman as his parents are more or less obvious in terms of their fate. We can feel the anguish and his sense of longing as the cherished strokes of the piano keys reflect his memory. Score: 9 / 10",
105,20 July 2019,Sylviastel,10, Poland is no longer alone.,"Roman Polanski was a holocaust survivor. He directed perhaps the most important film about the period based on the true story of Wladislaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist, who survived on his own strength with the help of his friends and even a German soldier who helped him in the end. The film is based on the true story. They're were horrible events that actually happened in the Warsaw Ghetto. Warsaw today was built upon the ruins of World War II. Adrien Brody was well honored with an Academy Award. The supporting cast was excellent with Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman as his parents. Roman Polanski is the best person to direct a film about the Holocaust and even from his own experiences. This film is perhaps Polanski's best film and most personal of all.",

The Pianist differs from Schindlers List because it spends all of its time in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Schindlers List spent time in the Ghetto and Labor Camps. We get a different point of view what it was like for the Jews. The Jews that stayed behind were forced to do some labor work for Nazis but their were Jews who were hiding in the Ghetto that fought back against them, though they didnt succeed.

119,11 December 2020,BlizzyFoxTF,7," A very good war film that centers on the brutalities and travails of war, but lacks the ambition of a genre masterpiece.","A very good war film that depicts the throes of war to a tee, but lacking the nuance that is evident in Spielberg or Cauron's works. Polanski seemed to opt for a less realistic approach in directing this movie, and characters seem more aware that they are in a film than in Schindler's List or Children of Men. In other words, despite the direction being incredibly deft and skillful, it can feel stiff at certain points of the film, and the set pieces artificial and unnatural. The pacing is very well done here, but the fast pace bereaves time for character building. As a result, despite the plethora of violence and moments of despair, they don't land as hard on an emotional level. The side characters/victims are not fleshed out enough, and there's a feel of spectacle for spectacle sake, where scenes play out for an overt intention to fish out visceral reactions. Without ample build up, I find it rather void. There are also quite a few plot contrivances in the film, which point to its main goal of achieving mainstream appeal. The story is decent, and I do not consider it a weak asset despite how simple it is. The protagonist's journey is wild and gripping, but it is not consistently interesting enough to considered very memorable - there aren't quite enough iconic moments or sequences that leaves a profound mark. The reaction between two certain characters at the end of the film could have used a bit more development, especially for one person whom we only come across at the end of the film; a better approach would be to do a dual/ interspersing narrative to introduce that character before that critical scene, such that it holds more weight. Speaking of characters, I feel like there are not enough bad important characters in the film, as opposed to a few good ones that exist. Perhaps it is intentional, with which the film conveys the message that warfare itself is the evil menace while humanity is inherently kind. Still, if there is more contrast presented in certain individuals, those ""noble"" characters would make a bigger impact in both the story and the audience, since it would accentuate the film's ""message"". Lastly, the film's core theme isn't entirely new either. I don't see any new ideas presented in the film other than the cruelty of war, and the struggles of suppressed ethnic groups under tyranny. The protagonist is a lovable character, carried by an amazing performance by Brody, but it is also rather one dimensional that sees little character growth by the end of the film. The Pianist is after all a standard war film, a very well rounded, crowd-pleasing one at that, or at least it feels like one. It does not seem to try achieve much more beyond that.",

I've seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity's history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I've seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn't muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle, and almost feel like I've become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can't continue to break every time I see it.

Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is one of those rare breed of movies that can actually do that. It's undoubtedly one of the most impressive movies you will ever see. From The Solid Direction Of Roman Polanski to the Flawless acting of Adrien Brody This Movie without a doubt can be called a Masterpiece. The Movie is based on The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who in the 1930s was considered one of the most accomplished Pianist. But the movie is not about his fame, Nor his Glory as a pianist. It's About A Polish Jew, who fought against all odds, Faced situations that he never even imagined and Finally Survived by losing almost everything and everyone he loved. It shows not only a tale of horrific surviving, but also the emotions that many people had to face and fight in order to live. It makes you wonder how people who really faced and Fought against those odd and lived, makes you ask yourself what would i do in that situation? The Cast is great, Whether it is a important character like Fox as Dorota or Minor character such as Ronan Vibert as Janina's Husband. But Adrian Broody Truly proved his worth as an actor in this film, i mean he was so into the character that he will make you believe that he really is Szpilman, He lost over 14 kilograms and developed a unusual body language for some scenes, and an actor of his level deserve much more recognition, but it's a fact that people nowadays prefer flash and looks over true art, however if you are one of those who can appreciate a true masterpiece you must have a look at ""The Pianist""",

130,4 November 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Breathtaking,"It's rare to see a film of such quality. Polanski has been directing marvelous films for decades, with effective editing and his seemingly unique cinematography. When a brilliant director goes to work on a very personal project, it is almost invariably a certainty that their heart and soul will be put into making it. When a film is made about a major historic event, in particular when countless films have been made regarding it already(and one would be quite hard pressed to find an event that has had more films made about it than World War 2), it needs to make a point or to offer something that we have yet to see. A new perspective, an idea that hasn't been explored before. Benigni gave us Life Is Beautiful(La Vita é Bella), which had one such idea, a beautiful, sweetly naive one. Polanski offers another, one that is at least as heart-warming and life-affirming. He brings the history to life, and does so with such effective direction that the film holds you in an iron grip. You feel compelled to refrain from watching more, yet you cannot look away. Such pain, horror and despair is depicted without flinching, without holding back, without censoring the worst parts out. You see all the cruelty of the Nazis, the degeneration of the health, lives and dignity of the Jews, and the slow but inevitable destruction of Warsaw. All from Szpilman's point of view. That was part of what made this so strong and affecting; he was there. Every single one of these situations, countless of times that he could have been killed... he was there. And at the end of it all, when you hear this man's beautiful music being played, one can't help but think; if war, hate and the rest of the world's evils are a result of the flaws of human beings... then the fact that this man, this creative being, this artist, made it through seemingly impossible odds, and came out of so many potentially lethal situations alive, must surely be proof that in spite of aforementioned evils, in spite of how hopeless it all may seem at times... there is still hope and beauty. It may be beaten down, it may be injured, but it shall never truly perish. The plot is well-written, and develops nicely throughout. The pacing is perfect, there's not a boring or overly fast moment to be found. The effects and design are flawless, it's all extremely authentic and realistic, as are most of the scenes. The cinematography is amazing. As my father commented while we watched: ""You really feel like you are him(Wladyslaw)."" A beautiful film, that takes you through arguably the worst historic event of the latter half of the previous century. I recommend this very highly to anyone who believes that they are strong enough to sit through it. It's most definitely not pleasant. Not to be missed. 10/10",

138,28 May 2003,bkam,3, Nothing redeeming about this drivel...,"Having read a fair amount about the Warsaw Ghetto, this movie seemed to trivialize it to me. I know that I am not stating a popular opinion, but I found that this film, which put so little into character development and so much into plot, was a failure. *We already know the plot*. So what is the point of the film? Nothing, in my opinion, it adds nothing to what has already been established, and pales in comparison to reading memoirs from the people who were there. Even in terms of plot, there are jagged edges in this film and it is generally an unsmooth and uninteresting ride through material that has been covered ad infinitum by better writers. Rarely have I been this bored in a movie. The violence, I felt, was extremely Hollywood--it was meant to portray the evil Germans against the good Jews. Not that I am a Nazi, but such a ridiculous simplification annoys me. More interesting is how an entire nation (Germany) could allow this to happen--a point which goes entirely unaddressed as we watch three hours of another Jew in another awful situation. A member of the Einsatzgruppen who was killing the Jews was as much a person as Szpilman, with emotions and responses just like his.  The fact that they are destroying other humans does not mean that they themselves are not human, although this fact is ignored in this movie and others by portraying them as monsters.  Isn't there some psychological (and as a result, cinematic) ground to break here?  I feel that most people are familiar with the experience of the Jews--if we must revisit this part of history again, why not try it in a different way?  I hope I don't offend anyone with these comments, because I don't mean to marginalize the suffering that happened, but I feel that with distance we get clarity about a situation. Since no large group (to my limited knowledge of the world) still misunderstands the holocaust, this type of emotional drivel is pointless and gets the public riled up over something long dead, without adding anything new whatsoever.",

Unlike the characters of other Holocaust films, he is an everyman who is just doing the best he can without fighting back.

The pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was able to escape to this deportation owing to various Jewish persons who helped him. Finally he escaped from the workshop, where selected Jewish people were working under control of Nazis, and decided to hide himself.

144,4 March 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Humanity manages to survive in apocalyptic horror,"Polanski had to make a film about the tragic past of the country whose name he carries. He had to concentrate on the primal historical ""crime"" committed by cosmic time and the war in 1939-1945, the extermination of the Jews by the Germans with the vast complicity of the Poles. The film is brilliant in its dense darkness because Polanski does not concentrate his tale so much on the community but on one particular Jew and his family he will be the only survivor of (it is a true story). He does not choose a Jew that would represent money or work, but a pianist, an artist representing cultural, universal and human talent that has no ethnic color whatsoever. And yet he moves further. After showing the ghettoization of the Jews in Warsaw, then their enslavement and extermination, then the escape of this pianist and his clandestine survival in the hands of non-Jews, some honest resistant fighters who put themselves in danger because of their political action, some (at least one) making a personal profit out of their help, the pianist also sees the meaningful and significant upheaval of the Jews when the ghetto is nearly empty. Pathetic but too late. He sees the doomed upheaval of the liberal resistant fighters and this time too early so that the Germans can exterminate them. Note here the film never really concentrate on the SS as the evil doers and the others as submissive followers. All Germans are concerned. The sacrifice of these resistant fighters leads to nothing since it clears the way for the communists to be the only ones to profit from the arrival of the Russians. Polanski even pushes one step further and there the film becomes a gospel about the shiny side of humanity. That pianist will survive the last few weeks thanks to a Wehrmacht officer who will accept to hide his presence and to feed him through to the end , and even give him a coat  that could have been tragic when the Russians arrived  before leaving. The officer had been convinced to provide this help by some music played on a piano by the Jew in the middle of ruins and on the eve to the final defeat. Music as the universal humanistic language beyond barbarity. Beautiful. Inspiring. A real salvation and epiphany for us all. That is exactly where pathos is discarded and love comes into the picture. A love that can transcend hatred and reach cosmic time in the smallness of human historical if not purely existential time. And If the pianist survive up to 2000, the German officer died in captivity in the USSR in 1952. Irony of irony, it is nothing but irony.",

It is Saturday, and the British and American armies and air forces are in day four of their invasion of Iraq. I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the German invasion of Poland in the movie, and events just now unfolding. In 1939 the Germans had their own ""documented"" grievances against the ""aggressive"" Poles. Later it was revealed that the dead German bodies produced for the German newsreel footage justifying their invasion of Poland were just some corpses the Nazis rounded up, and dressed in German and Polish uniforms. Point to make is that 69% of the Germans--- otherwise law abiding, Christian, decent people, probably felt the same grim determination modern day American and British peoples feel toward Iraq. No one is cheering the deaths, but they are nonetheless sanctioning them, in the name of some political agenda. Saddam as Hitler? Yes--- but Bush and Blair as Hitlers, too? Sadly, it seems so. ""The Pianist"" gives a human face to the real victims--- and I am fearful that many innocent Iraqis may get a double dose of what this movie points out--- first from their own government, and now again from ours.",

163,29 January 2007,gelman@attglobal.net,9, Different than what I expected: Spoilers,"Reviews of ""The Pianist"" had led me to expect that Adrien Brody's real life character, Wladyslav Szpilman, had survived the Holocaust because the Nazis valued him as an entertainer. Strictly speaking, that is true in the sense that one particular high-ranking Nazi hears him play near the very end of the film and does not betray him. However, the film is mainly about the Szpilman's survival within the Warsaw ghetto, his escape from the ghetto while the dispatch of Jews to the death camps is underway, his existence in hiding with the help of a Polish couple, the destruction of much of Warsaw by the Nazis during the uprising and, penultimately, his retreat back to the ghetto to hide until the Russians arrive. In short, 99 percent of the film has absolutely nothing to do with Nazi patronage and the 1 percent is the mercy extended to him because of his talent by a single Nazi commander. It is nonetheless a brilliant film, and Adrien Brody certainly deserves all the praise he received for his role as Szpilman. However, because of his unsavory reputation in the U.S., Roman Polanski received insufficient attention as the director of this film. Polanski's achievement is at least equal to Brody's and I believe that he would have received an Oscar if he weren't persona non grata in the U.S. and in Hollywood.",

I'm not a big fan of Maureen Lipman and with actors like her that makes it look even more less like a big movie. There are other things that don't ring true in the film. In the Jewish Ghetto the people were just walking past dead children without even looking or moving them and i don't care how bad things are you wouldn't ignore a dead or dying child. Also there is a scene where Szpilman is shot at when he comes out of building in a German coat but it's blindingly obvious that he was a Jewish survivor and it wouldn't happen.

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust (of which there are many all-consuming portrayals of only a fraction of the stories which occurred). Brody puts in a marvellous and utterly touching performance as Szpilman. The story is abound with terribly moving vignettes which depict the emotional and cultural breakdown of Warsaw's persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them; the overall inability of the community to stand-up to the systematic destruction of their neighbours; the acceptance to wear the Star of David armband (the scene where his father is hit by Nazis and forced to walk in the gutter rather than on the pavement); the arrogant survivalist attitudes of the Jewish Sonderkomando-police force; the young Jewish boy profiteering from petty food-stocks in the ghetto holding area; and then the opportunists, like Szalas, who manipulate Jewish fugitives in hiding outside of the ghetto.

Saved from the concentration camps by the Jewish police, he relied on the Underground--as well as on one remarkable German soldier--to stay alive and eventually tell his story. Adrien Brody's sadly quizzical, sensitive face takes the screen like a beacon of light; he obviously put himself through hell to get this physically demanding role just right, and his emotional performance is incredibly rich. Not so some of the overacting supporting players, particularly those cast as Szpilman's close-knit family members (however, the scene where the father splits a piece of caramel five ways is a heartbreaker). Roman Polanski won the Oscar as Best Director; however, some of his bigger scenes (such as the Russian Liberation) don't pack the wallop expected. The filmmaker does catch the numbing brutality and violence of the time with an unerring eye, and his film is arguably a more lasting statement of Nazi-atrocity than Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"".

He takes on a big subject - the holocaust - and brings to it a mastery of cinematic procedure and a surprisingly sure touch to a subject highly sensitive and also, through its terrible enormity, innately prone to melodrama if represented on screen. Like most films of its type, it tries to avoid this danger by steering clear of Auschwitz, which is probably incapable of inclusion in any sort of story without completely overbalancing it and isolating it from any point of connection with normal, human themes. But the horrors of what happened are in no sense hidden in the story of a survivor of the Polish ghetto who witnessed the most dreadful events, depicted here in a straightforward chronology encompassing the entire war. What happened first was that a community was forced to co-operate in its own extermination, induced to do so by the basic human need for hope; the eventual uprising was heroic but as doomed as non-resistance. By the time this happens, the hero has already escaped, but Polanski focuses on the desperate reality of his ""fortunate"" situation: the lack of heating, food, water, and also intellectual nourishment; and the near-unbearable psychology of living when any moment might be your last. And in this remarkable film, everything seems both appalling and yet natural; the movie is littered with arresting images that in no way seem forced upon the viewer; and every performance is spot on, with Aiden Brody superb in the lead (Frank Findlay in particular is also excellent, but there are no weak points at all). While very detail that is needed to make the story convincing is covered - Brody's body double (who actually plays the piano for him) has long, pianist's fingers, we know this man to be a pianist as surely as the German officer who eventually pities him.",

'The Pianist' is one of the best movies in the genre. The comparison with 'Schindler's List' is immediate, as both films look at the Holocaust from the angle of the tragedy of the Jewish people with personal or family connotations for the directors, as well as they bring the perspective of the True Human Beings who risked their own lives to save the lives of individuals threatened by the Nazi death machine.

Throughout the movie, you will witness his process of trying to escape the war. Szpilman was acted by Adrien Brody and his performance was amazing. When I watched this movie for the first time, I felt every emotion so intense. I felt his loneliness, despair, sadness, and tiredness. Especially, the scene of walking in the street -between a lot of ruins- and playing piano in his mind on a chair was impressive. Adrien Brody won the Oscar for the Best Actor with this performance and it made him the youngest actor to win in this category. If I watched this movie at that time, I could say this was not a surprise. As far as I can remember, I was also impressed by the colors of the scenes. You can see so much grey and blue in the scenes. They made the scenes colder and more effective. There was a lot of pain in the movie and to know they are real is really painful.

The title refers to Wladyslaw Szpilman (upon whose memoirs the film is based), a young Polish Jew living in Warsaw at the time of the Nazi invasion in 1939. He is a pianist by profession and nature, which the film and book make abundantly clear. Polanski's film, primarily due to its cautious and intelligent restraint, achieves a haunting resonance and brutal realism, but most importantly, through the story of Szpilman, it captures the horrors of the Jewish experience during WWII. Indeed, Polanski tells Szpilman's story true to its source, without moralizing, histrionics, and glorifying certain characters while vilifying others.",

I thought even after the first half hour of the film that even though The Pianist was great, it was going to be stereotypical in it's story about the Holocaust and World War Two and I could not have been more wrong. This is not a film about the horror of those years but rather the story of one man's survival against unbelievable odds. It is truly an epic about one man.

And it serves both purposes well - did I say well? I meant... brilliantly. Whereas Schindler's List's settings were very authentic yet always very organised, The Pianist's settings are more run-down and actually look like they've been through something terrible. The acting is top-notch - Adrien Brody delivers the feelings and emotions of a Polish Jew in WWII separated from everything and everyone he loves in all aspects. And the harrowing heights of this film do reach Schindler's List's heights - perhaps even exceeding that when Polish Jews lay down on their faces and were shot in the head.. The piano tunes were beautiful and Adrien Brody really did make a good on-screen musician - even if his fake playing wasn't exactly brilliant in quality. The ending was emotional and nearly brought a tear to my eye (MAJOR SPOILERS COMING UP!) - I can't imagine how it would have felt if Szpilman had been killed after surviving and going through so much. But that is the true unfairness and unpredictability of war, and though The Pianist isn't quite as famous as Schindler's List, it sure is as good. I would have given this film a well-deserved 10 if the fake piano playing had been done a bit better. But it's so emotionally brilliant and harrowing in parts, I think I'll give it the 10 anyway.

200,9 November 2002,poetellect,10, what can I say?,"Seek out this film.  That's all; anything else seems unimportant. Superlatives would simply debase, compliments reify, flattery insult- this is a film that needs to be seen to be believed, appreciated, understood, cried over.  It will touch the bottommost recesses of your heart.",
201,7 February 2019,ironhorse_iv,9, The Pianist plays the right keys. It's more A Minor than a B Flat. It's a cinematic masterpiece.,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Those whom lived through it, are forever scarred by its horrors. Even today, few can muster the courage to bring themselves to discuss the subject. However, one person did, and his name was Wladyslaw Szpilman. Based off his memoirs of the same name, 'The Pianist' tells the story of how he was able to survive the war, while living in fear, under Nazi Control, Warsaw, Poland. Without spoiling this 2002 film, too much, I have to say director, Roman Polanski and screenwriter, Ronald Harwood tried to keep the motion picture as historically accurate as possible. Why? It's because Polanski's inspiration for the film, came from the fact that he himself, had been a prisoner of a polish ghetto during the war. He wanted to make sure, common folks see the harsh heart breaking realistic truths about the events similar to what Steven Spielberg did with his 1993 masterpiece's 'Schindler's List'; rather than viewing something that is semi-safe, sugar coated & crowd-pleasing like the fictional movies, 1997's 'Life is Beautiful' & 1999's film 'Jacob the Liar'. Plus, he wanted to make sure, that there was no stone left unturned for Holocaust deniers to say that the events, feature in the film, did not happen. While, the movie does have some scenes inserted just to express the horror of the Holocaust, they far from legends. They come from Polanski's own accounts. Nevertheless, there was a few minor inaccuracy, I found, that didn't happen at all. One such thing was the relationship between Wladyslaw (Adrian Brody) and Dorota (Emilia Fox). Not only, was Dorota appears to be a made up character for the movie, but there was no apparent love connection between Wladyslaw and any woman, during the war. While, I do understand, that this character was probably created, in order to give a look at Szpilman's life before the occupation and to evoke audience sympathy for all that he lost during the war, but it wasn't really needed. The chocolate dinner scene with his family was really strong. If that wasn't enough, just rewatch the part where the titular character walk, through the empty ghetto. You see the pain, through Adrian Brody's eyes & body language. No able of dialogue, can vivid depict, how haunting & powerful, the actor's facial reactions are, throughout this movie. It reach me on a deeper level. Much in the same way, how the actor lost weight, in order to look more exhausted & weary & Brody learning how to really play the piano, very well. It's no wonder, why Adrien Brody became the youngest person to date to win an Academy Award for Best Actor at the age of 29. He did a good job, here. He deserve winning that prize in 2003. Honestly, to tell you, the truth, Polanski & his crew has cast this movie nearly perfectly. However, due to the huge amount of supporting performers and the lack of screen time focus on them. They don't really stand out, much as I wish, even though, their acting was great. Despite that, nearly every performer look and felt authentic with the little amount of time, they had. However, some of the literary references calls outs like the works of William Shakespeare & Fyodor Dostoevsky from Wladyslaw's brother, Henryk (Ed Stoppard) felt a little bit jarring. I doubt, he quotes those works in real-life. Despite that, I did like how the film shows that there is good & bad people, within both sides of the fence through the actions of German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) & Szalas (Andrew Tiernan). Nice to see national groups so complex, than lopsided 100% demonic & angelic. The only real nitpick, I had on the historical value of them, were the fact that some of the army uniforms of the German soldiers, were a bit off. Nevertheless, the rest of wardrobe seem fitting with what people wore during that era. Another inaccuracy that, I notice in the film, was the idea that there was running water in abandoned bomb out buildings. In truth, water within the city, run out, way before the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. As for action, the film focused on the terrible treatment and unjust punishment that the Jewish & Polish people really had to go through. The violence are really graphic and somewhat hard to watch, at times. According to the bonus features of the DVD, many such acts of cruelty in the film were recreated from actual photographs and archival film footage shot by the Nazis. Nevertheless, the way, the movie was shot, was also amazing. A good example is the opening sequence, where we see a statue with its arm pointing to the left, and people & the city in the background. Every so often throughout the movie, we see the same figure, only this time, the background is more & more ruin by war, until nothing is left, but rubble. That is highly great use of props and scenery. Despite, the loss of his wife and her friends at the hands of Manson's family, and his infamous involvement with an 13 year old girl which forced him to flee the United States. Polanski in the midst of this controversies, has always been a great director, which to be reckoned with. Through the help of real-life locations in Europe, cinematic CGI effects and camera techniques, Polanski & his crew was able to immerse the audience in the determination and will for survival that was displayed by Szpilman. It's no wonder, why he won Best Director at the Academy Award. It's one of his best works. This motion picture is able to offer a voice to the millions of Jews who lost their lives to the Holocaust. Overall: It's a film that needs to be seen, both a history lesson and morality tale. A must watch for sure.",

210,30 August 2015,leonblackwood,8, Powerful Masterpiece! 8/10,"Review: I know that I'm a bit late with this movie, 13 years to be exact but now that I've watched it, I must admit, it is a powerful masterpiece. The movie is about a talented, Jewish pianist who uses all of his resources to escape from German soldiers during World War II. After splitting up from his family, he is left to fend for himself in a Warsaw ghetto, whilst fighting for food and cover. The acting from Adrien Brody was superb, especially when times were extremely hard for his character and the storyline was put together very well by Roman Polanski. I was a bit skeptical about the length of the film before watching it but it really didn't seem that long because of the detailed content and amazing cinematography. The ironic ending was shocking and surprising, which added to his amazing journey were he really hit rock bottom. I still find it hard to believe that it was a true story and it was one of those films were it takes some time to get out of that mode after watching it. Anyway, I'm not going to praise it anymore because I think you can tell that I really enjoyed it. Its hard to find a fault with the film so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!",
211,17 March 2004,helpless_dancer,7," This should have been called ""The Hiding Place 2""","This film was not what I expected, which was something along the lines of the first half of Leon Uris' novel ""Exodus""; a rousing bloodletter depicting the Jews as a down but not out band of rubble rousers kicking some major Kraut ass. Instead I got some weasely little musician skulking from hidey hole to hidey hole with the help of kindhearted, caring Poles. I never understood why this guy was the recipient of all this largesse nor why he was spared by a German officer who just happened along when it could just as easily have been Herr Jackboot and his lucky Luger. Also fortunate for me as I was convinced every human in a German uniform was a re-tread of Attilla the Hun. Not a bad picture but it was too long and full of holes, however that could be due to the rapid jumps through time. How this movie won so many oscars I don't know: seems that if a picture deals with the Holocaust it stands a better chance of being awarded.

212,7 September 2015,Vartiainen,8, Harrowing tale,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist has earned recognition as one of the best films about Holocaust ever made. And for a good reason. Based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, it tells the story of him and his family trying to survive through the World War while at first harassed and then outright hunted by the Nazi government. It is the tale of Holocaust seen through one human fate. And while Szpilman's experiences were not the worst ones imaginable – if such things should even be measured – they are among the more unbelievable, showcasing his resilience, will to survive, and at times sheer dumb luck.",
213,5 February 2014,BeneCumb,8," Strong survival story, without black-and-white approaches","As stories about vast sufferings such as genocide, holocaust, ethnic cleansing etc. are mostly revealed by sufferers-survivors, then they tend to be subjective and individualistic, full of hatred and grief, without so-called big picture, ""we"" are always good/right and ""they"" are always bad/wrong. Both the author of the autobiographical book (Władysław Szpilman) and its screenwriter (Ronald Harwood) have avoided the above and created a warmhearted, yet realistic and reasoned story about a Jewish family's fate around the events related to Warsaw Ghetto. The narration runs smoothly, we see people with different attitudes and characters among the Jews also, and not all Nazis were humiliators or ruthless killers... True, intellectuals such as musicians perceive the world in a different manner, they have more compassion and eagerness to understand rather than condemn, but still... The atmosphere is realistic, provides additional historical knowledge, and great choice of music plus talented aggregate direction makes The Pianist enjoyable to watch even if you the Szpilman's story (as I did not, the twists were additional value to me).",

The other film was the Jack Nicholson Oscar nominated role and although I watched it yesterday, I have already forgotten it's name. Unlike many reviewers, I have seen many films dealing with the Holocaust. I have not become immune to the subject and frankly, Polanski does start to touch on the horror and the random acts of inhumanity. However, the pianist character left me cold. A man who is almost completely devoid of any character. Neither a hero or a villain, but just a dull, cold fish. He barely shows fear and certainly aside from two moments when he looks upset (family taken off and little boy beaten to death) is robotic. I saw no Oscar performance here, found the constant leaping from subject to subject disorienting and had no time to really get to know anyone in the story but the robot. I am not sure what Polanski's goal was in making this movie but it came off as neither drama nor documentary. Too little of everything except perhaps, historical accuracy.",

Too much blood has been spilled on the streets and plains of that benighted continent for the sovereign nations within its boundaries ever to live in anything but wary suspicion of one another. From the Balkans to the Mediterranean tribal hatreds have reigned supreme for a thousand years. To the Polish people it made little difference whether the Germans or the Russians occupied their country.In implementing the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem, the Germans ethnically cleansed Warsaw. Later,fearing a resurgence of Polish militarism,the Russians took 20,000 army officers,intellectuals and aristocrats and shot them dead in the infamous Katyn Forest massacre.Not content with perpetrating this appalling atrocity,the Russians then did their best to make sure the Germans were blamed for it. Later still,rather than offend his ""good friend"" Stalin,Churchill declined to interfere with the Russian dictator's plans for thousands of Polish prisoners of war,thus condemning them to a lingering death in the Gulags. It would hardly be surprising then if Poland were to look at its E.U. colleagues in a rather jaundiced fashion. As well as demolishing for ever the pipe dream of Europeans living together in brotherly love,""The Pianist"" also looks at the idea of the role of the artist in a disintegrating society. Here he observes rather than participates, and survives. Of course many musicians and entertainers collaborated with the Nazis and lived well under their patronage.But this option was not available to a Jew from the Warsaw ghetto. Spiellman survives by becoming the Invisible Jew right up until the end of the German Occupation when his last hiding place is discovered by a Wermacht officer who,recognising his artistry,helps him to survive. Unfortunately he is not able to return the favour as the officer dies in a Russian p.o.w. camp a full seven years after the war actually ended. Mr Polanski's vision is a bleak one indeed. The brutalisation of an intelligent and sensitive man who gradually becomes a zombie - like figure totally unresponsive to the horrors around him,desiring only one thing - his personal survival. The contempt for human life shown by ""ordinary"" German soldiers,shooting Jews at random for no better reason other than that they could. Images linger;a man in a wheelchair being tipped over a balcony,a young woman shot in the head at point blank range for asking what was happening,ghetto police beating their fellow Jews enthusiastically to gain the approval of their masters,the Wermacht officer listening poker - faced to the ""untermenschen"" Jew playing Chopin on a grand piano and,most disturbing of all - and demonstrating the utter futility of hope - the look on the face of the man on the end of the row of workers being summarily executed when the killer's pistol runs out of ammunition.Thinking he has been spared he dares to look up for a second or two before the magazine is replaced and he shares the fate of his colleagues. Spiellman,""The Pianist"",untermenschen,invisible Jew,zombie,died at the age of 88 in 2000.I don't know whether he ever forgave;he certainly never forgot.If Polanski's movie helps to ensure that what happened to him and millions like him is never forgotten then not a single frame of it has been wasted.",

It is only in this context that one must consider The Pianist.This film is just plain OK nothing great or spectacular as everything can be foretold beforehand such as atrocities,suffering and ultimately liberation.The choice of Adrien Brody as the pianist is a good one as he carries the film single handedly on his shoulders.There is no other good reason which can justify the goodness of this film.",

227,30 January 2011,andy-933-696608,10, The Pianist Review,"It is a film worthy of rivaling the legendary ""Chinatown"". Director Roman Polanski brings viewers a dark and almost painful to watch reminder of one man's struggle for survival in one of the world's darkest times. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody), a Polish Pianist who's love for the piano could not be further defined than in this remarkable tale of courage, misery, and determined survival. Adrian Brody gives a performance that is believable in every account. He doesn't go all dramatic. It is the very essence of his performance that is significant. Just by watching him, you'll think that he is Szpilman, and mastering the Polish accent, playing Chopin on the piano, as well simply showing a sense of confidence in his character. When I watched the film, I saw the very Pianist himself. The tale of this extraordinary musician begins with the end of his career in Polish radio, and it ends with his eventual return to it, as in over the course of 5 years, Spzilman's life is destroyed bit by bit. It all began with a shred of hope, as his family listened and celebrated Britain and France's declaration of war on Nazi Germany, only for it slowly form into the many forms of despair to come. Growing up in a Polish Jewish family, and in the times of the Holocaust, the Szpilman family faced many of the atrocities Jews were subjected to. It all started with the limited financial rights, up to the required cloth of The Star of David, and up to the moments when they moved into poverty infested Warsaw Ghetto. Desperation, humiliation, starvation, death, persecution, and even debt were the many challenges brought on the Szpilman family, losing more and more at the hands of the inhuman Nazi's. The very sight of Jews being forced to dance for their amusement, or even being beaten by their own kind can be very sickening, knowing that these people faced so many atrocities. One scene in particular shocked me, as the Szpilman's witness a brutal murder of Jewish cripple being tossed out his window, thus his own family following him to death's door at the hands of machine gun fire, and sadistic torture. Despite all this, Wladysaw pushed towards the chance for his family's survival, as his last effort to keep them from leaving the Ghetto becomes meaningless, as operation Reinhard came into play, sending many Jews to the camps were their very extermination was its main purpose. All alone, Szpilman survived, living in the Ghetto, as a laborer, secretly working for those who were willing to fight, while hoping for an eventual chance out. His wish is granted as he makes out the wall, and back into the very world that rejected his kind. His difficulties arise as he moves from one location to the next, hiding out wherever he can, avoiding discovery and capture. I have to say this out of a personal respect for Szpilman, he is a tough SOB. He suffered from Jaundice, Malnutrition, and even pure madness as he had to flee from the very war that was taking place right outside his apartment window. Near the film's conclusion, his long urge to play the piano is fulfilled in the presence of Wilm Hosenfeld, a man known today as one of the few members of the Nazi party to willingly hide out and assist Jews. His last words as he gives a farewell to the grateful pianist ""God wants us to survive"" are both strong and powerful, signifying the good few Nazi's had against the Third Reich's perverted vision of God's work. Szpilman's freedom and desire to find this man lead only to the discovery of his deportation, and thus later informed death in 1952 in imprisonment in a Soviet camp. Our film concludes with Szpilman's return to Polish radio, and a grand finale as he plays the grand Polonaise brillante. It is with the very focus of this 5 minute ending scene that the very beauty of his love for Piano is expressed by the very hands of a dedicated actor, moving his hands at the very rhythm of the music. As the credits have rolled, and we continue to watch Brody master Szpilman's masterpiece of musical art, we come to think this is truly a magnificent movie. The director is excellent, the actor not only portrays him on a professionally dramatic level, but also on a physical level, embodying both the weight loss and as well as the practice required to perfectly portray this damaged character. ""The Pianist"" can honest to God be called one of the greatest film's I've ever seen, as Mr. Brody brings the revelation of this renowned Pianist to life further and further as the film progresses, and as we viewers witness further and further what this man has gone thru. He lost his family, he went into hiding, and he even risked his life on multiple occasions in various situations. When you look at how much Polanski's dives us into the life of this man, we start to see that this film is more of personal tribute because as a matter of fact Polanski himself has lost his loved ones to the Holocaust. ""The Pianist"" is more than just a dedication to Szpilman, but it is also a dedication to all the Jews who became victims to the evil that was Adolf Hitler.",

But also how he found both cruelty and kindness were least expected. At the same time it is a good testament of how Jews in common around him were treated.

Every part of the movie, from cinematography to acting, is some of the best all time. One of the most difficult watches of all time but that interests you even more as the movie goes on.
The movie does a better job of scaring and haunting you than most horrors, yes they aren't the same sort of scare but emotionally you are terrified. The movie had this impending dread the whole way through Mainly because of the score, and especially the lack there of. The only music throughout is a single piano showing that's all our protagonist has left. On top of that it shows the single minded focus he has left. The eerie streets are a personification of his emotions to the end.
The movie comments on humanity and what it takes to lose it. The Germans are shown as almost comic book villains in there single minded pursuit to kill Germans.
The piano exemplifies the humanity that Wladyslaw Szpilman (yeah I'm not typing that again-The protagonist) has throughout the movie as he only hears the piano in times of fearfulness It being the light through his darkness.
The protagonist undergoes one of the most interesting arcs. At the beginning he is an affluent pianist in the Warsaw, always speaking from what we can see. But by thee no he has no city and he is too scared and afraid.
The grainy quality of video makes you feel a sense of disgust, compounding the effect already presented by the movie. But what the quality lacks in, the camera direction and sets are jaw dropping.
Not my favourite but I might have to say this is the best movie I've seen so far. It's pretty hard to enjoy this movie outside of the quality because it is so dark and so scary.",

One, I feel its a notch or two below ""Schindler's List"" and we have seen this type of story filmed before. Two, a week after seeing this film I was still haunted by several scenes in the film and by the whole story itself. Very strong images that I just cannot forget. I guess thats the ultimate compliment. I just can't forget it. Adrien Brody is very strong in this film and his performance shows not just a character who survived but was so strong willed while everything began to unfold in his country and the atrocities started to rear its head and part of his strength shows as he helps hold his family together for as long as he can. The shots of the burnt out neighborhoods in Warsaw are very striking to look at. Brody climbs a wall and heads into what looks like miles of a demolished city.",

We are spared nothing of the sheer brutality of those butchers and the reproduction of several aspects of everyday life in the occupied city is shown in a very realistic and convincing way. In the second part the protagonist (a renowned Jewish pianist) without ceasing to be a victim manages by hiding himself until the end of the occupation and thus becomes also a terrified witness of all the events which took place in Warsaw between 1942 and 1945 namely the ghetto and the city uprisings and finally its liberation by the Red Army. He owes his survival after all not only to good luck but also to the help of friends and foes with human feelings namely a member of the Jewish police created by the Nazis and a German officer who listens to him playing piano for the first time after the beginning of his ordeal. This is a climax scene which will make you swallow a lump in your throat out of emotion while watching it. It's a scene which will remain in the History of Cinema.

258,27 June 2003,d1494,8, This film is not outstanding but..,"I have to agree with a number of comments about this film being somewhat standard and numbing. Indeed much of the film goes by and leaves one in that state. However, the beginning and end do transcend that, which is all to the good. Brody gives a fine performance; the music is beautiful as is the photography and the setting.Unfortunately, the other actors are given short shrift and they are one feels, also capable of giving fine performances,had their characters been more fleshed out. Having seen many of Polansky's films, I must say I don't recognize his artistic style here as I've come to know it over the  years. That in itself is not necessarily a negative, however he has made some gripping films and this one just doesn't quite live up to that standard. There are some fine things about this film and I do not dismiss it, and indeed would recommend it to others with some caveats. The film is rather too long for what it is and could have been 20 minutes shorter with no harm done. The thing that most impressed me about the experience of watching this was that I had just watched another holocaust film, albeit one about the holocaust of Cambodia, The Killing Fields. This film has all the emotional tension after repeated viewings that it had the first time, this is what I wanted from The Pianist but it wasn't there. 'The Killing Fields' conveys the nightmare scene of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and shows how it got there. It also shows very well the drama of people being caught up in the maw of evil beyond their ken. Having watched this extraordinary film first, I found myself  feeling a little detached from the plight of those in this film and it felt like nothing in the movie really reached out and grabbed me the way the subject normally would. I would also say that while I felt 'bludgeoned' by the impact of 'Schindler's List', it also did not reach out to me in the way that 'The Killing Fields' does. It seems that while some movies are greater than the sum of their parts, some are less. This one was less and thus somewhat disappointing, albeit still worthy of watching. I give this film 8/10.",

261,3 June 2004,jiffyxpop,10, See the Pianist - Especially Now,"A movie about the atrocities committed during WWII could not be more timely to watch than now, at a time when George Bush is comparing the ""War on Terrorism"" to WWII - odd since depending on what your politics are you might think that lately the US is acting more like the Nazis in this film than the rescuing Russians, with the common people of Afghanistan, Iraq and the US, like the Pianist, being caught in between as the inadvertent, non-politicized victims of the ideological/political war between the government of fascists and fundamentalists. Roman Polanski does a tremendous job of portraying the brutality and ugliness of war, and the beauty of human individuality when mercy, kindness, and love are demonstrated in the face of it.    If all the political leaders with their agendas today were forced to sit in a room and watch this together, I wonder what they would say afterwards about it. Polanski had made a movie that will haunt those who see it forever -- a cinematic revelation that wisely reminds us--""Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it."" It makes me hope that if perhaps if more love, kindness, mercy and understanding were demonstrated in politics today, we might be able to get further toward global peace.  Using words like ""Axis of Evil"" on our side, and the terms fanatical fundamentalists use to describe us, only fan the flames of hatred - it does not help to put them out.",

But the film is flawed - Polanski has never been very subtle as a director lately and there are times when he could have pulled back (the little girl with the empty bird cage, the freakish looking jews being forced to dance with each other, etc.) - and the script in the long run (maybe because of the scope of the whole thing) is a bit thin in places - I never felt like I knew that much about Brody's character so while I was certainly invested in his survival - I didnt really feel much dimension to him.

296,8 October 2020,mbrandlymolett-53-897035,8, Tragedy,"This is the second Roman Polanski film I have ever watched. This is probably now inserted in my Top 10 of films.
I'll note that I did not notice how much of a staple Adrien Brody is an actor, and well he may not have deserved to steal a kiss from Halle Berry, I'll respect it and am definitely a fan and I would love to have dinner. He acts in one of my favorite Wes Anderson films Darjeeling Limited, and I managed to overlook this historical gem. I saw the 2005 rendition of King of Kong a solid 4 times in theaters and I always just knew Adrien Brody as the guy who kissed Halle Berry.
This film is first of a reminder of what blind following can lead to. I try to make light to deal with my own sense of dealing, but this film is dark and it is truly an inspirational film. I managed to watch through critical lenses, a stiff drink(s) and that's just an unhealthy way I learned to cope, function and minimize. There is no minimizing of this film in so many levels. Watched through blank eyes, I've never heard of Adrien Brody or seen the impact of the saddening ensemble cast was overwhelming. How I did not cry is beyond me, but my heart goes out to anyone and has always gone out to the Jewish community. I do forget that Jewish people are descendents of the children of Israel. I believe the persecution felt so normal to them because of many years of persecution from every community they've lived in.
On track, this film is a biopic of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brodey) a Polish Pianist for the Polish Public Radio. The film opens up with Wladyslaw at work, playing the piano live on radio, as the not visible Nazi's cause very visible damage to the Polish. The setting is Warsaw, Poland, 1939. What starts off light, ends with complete demolition.
Today classical music is almost considered a dying genre of music. Sense there's no words or stories being told to people they have little interests. However, music is a powerful source and relay so much information in a film. Polanski is of the time where films also have composed pieces. This is often done with major budget films and this is a major budget film. Rightfully so, as a story of survival, unity and compassion lie deep within us all.
Wladyslaw is playing the piano for the Polish radio as bombs are bombarding the city. Wladyslaw is in the middle of a beautiful number live on the radio and is advised by his producers to cut the number and go off air. By no judgement he continues to play until in a shot that is only contained by the music itself. There is a 180 line between the composer and the producers with mid shots of the producer's booth. The scene starts off with Wladyslaw and his producers, they run, there is an explosion, now Wladyslaw runs. This scene tells of Wladyslaw's dedication to music and ignorance.
The next scene I want to discuss is the thrown out neighbor scene. This consists of beautiful pans and tilts. We see a captivating shot of the Nazi's awkening neighbors from acros the street through their balcony windows. One family has a handicapped member and that member is made to suffer. However the suffering continues. We pan back down to the streets and the Nazi's have the Jewish neighbors shot in the streets. The audience is given a limited view to their surroundings as does our protagonist. We often only get the 180 degree rule in this film for that reason. We mentally are constrained, as well as physically, and emotionally.
The last shot I will discuss is when Wladyslaw yet again escapes the clutches of death and jumps to the other side of the hospital wall. In the middle of two rows of destroyed Polish housing stands Wladyslaw. Looking at the shot on pause I thought a needle in a haystack if it were unspeakable hell. At first the audience is centered with the wall then we pan up and see all of the destruction that has been caused. In relation to the haystack comment, Wladyslaw is one of few who escape death. Sadly, he watched from his window as life vanished at every moment.
I loved this film. The content to me would put it in the Horror category more so than the drama. It just felt like Wlad kept finding new hiding places then the bad guys would discover him. I enjoyed finding the compassion in the characters throughout the film.",
297,8 March 2023,alexpeychev,8," Stoic, haunting tale of survival","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away. During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.",

My favorite part is when the pianist hides himself in that apartment, eating crumbs, starving nearly to death, playing imaginary piano and watching tank destroying resistentes from window - it's a confinement but also a safe shell, with delicate comfort and delusion and temptation of death and aspiration of life. It's like my own personal experience when facing stress, hiding myself in a physiological or physical safe corner, facing the temptation to live like this for the rest of my life, and finally force myself to get out to face the outside world. It's really some echo here.",
301,17 November 2003,ecatalan98,9, Superb Drama,"Last night I finally rented ""The Pianist"" on DVD. It was a superb film and a crude drama on the realities of world war two. Although it has a good pace for a non-action movie, it does tend to get sluggish in parts and you can't help but wonder what actually happens to the rest of the pianist's family (probably killed in Treblinka, but the film never addresses their fate). Also, I wish some more insight could have been given to the Nazi Officer who ultimately became the pianist's savior, as it was truly rare to see such human kindness during a war like this. At parts, it reminded me a bit of ""Schindler's List"", although this is a more personal story and one of survival. Polanski did a terrific job capturing the atmosphere of Warsaw in Ruins and it's good to see that the Academy finally lifted their ""ban"" on him. If you want to see a good world war 2 drama, don't hesitate to rent this movie.",
302,15 February 2003,smakawhat,7," Great start, slow pacing middle, triumphant end","One of the best picture nominees this year about the true life of a Jewish Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, who somehow in the madness of W.W.II managed to elude the death camps.  Yes it is a holocaust film, albeit it does not take place there, but in the ghettos of Warsaw where over 300,000 jews were rounded up and confined to live in a small segregated area of the city in absolute squalor.  I've always said that good films are never depressing, but this one does get there.  And how can it not sometimes. Towards the middle of the film when the audience is aware of the impending doom, the characters still cling on to hope of radio contacts that the allies are coming to save them (not knowing of course they will fail), and the idea that all the moving is temporary..  This is the only slow part of the film, and we're stuck in some powerful yet obligatory scenes,  soldiers whipping and torturing jews, starvation, plagues, death marches, random on the spot executions,  jews turning on each other in the ghetto just to survive, some pretty hellish stuff.  But Polanski manages to bring together a great cast (nazis and jews alike both good and bad) that bring the film to its peak as Szpilman at one point manages to escape and live with the resistance who will protect him.  But life is not easy, and a crushingly good scene involves Szpliman hiding out in an apartment by himself, running out of food and then we watch helplessly as he breaks several dishes accidentally while rummaging through the cupboards and gives himself away to his German neighbors.",

304,23 February 2003,bix171,10, An Underrated Genius,"Perhaps because he generally works in a direct, naturalistic style and in a variety of genres, Roman Polanski could quite possibly be the most underrated filmmaker working today--which makes a film like `The Pianist' all the more startling. It's unexpected filmmaking, a complex yet measured account of Jewish life in wartime Warsaw, both in the ghetto and outside of it, filmed, as always, in Polanski's clean, simple style with beautiful camerawork (by Pawel Edelman) and evocative lighting. Though it may appear cold and methodical, Polanski's passion is subversively striking. Based on pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoir (unread) and adapted in an admirably economical fashion by Ronald Harwood, his story probably serves as a counterpoint to Polanski's own: the end titles reveal Szpilman remained in Poland until his death in 2000 whereas Polanski has essentially exiled himself from his native land and there's a sense of wistfulness in his recreation of the time; Warsaw is displayed as a peaceful urban center disrupted only by the advent of Nazism and, with one notable exception, the Poles are depicted as concerned citizens given to either helping or at least ignoring the Jews. Although it's as brutal to watch as `Schindler's List' (there are some short images that are truly troubling) the comparisons are not quite apt: whereas `Schindler's List' concerned itself with the Holocaust as a topic in and of itself, `The Pianist' seems intrigued not only with that subject but also with art's critical importance in a crisis society: not only is it a savior in troubled times but it's the bridge that bonds victim and barbarian; Polanski seems intent on providing a no-fuss definition of art that can have meaning to any audience. Adrien Brody plays the title role, subtly moving from cocksure artist to emaciated blank canvas for the director to project his fears and wonders. Absolutely outstanding, the work of a true cinematic genius.",

And it is indeed a return to form: Polanski recollects a true story, and depicts the horrors and the human paradox present in the darkest time for humanity. Adrien Brody looks like he was born for the role - his face alone provides everything we need to understand what he feels. The result is altogether touching and striking, even if the story doesn't benefit from some real life facts: if you think about it, the hero is never responsible for his own survival, always helped by friends. But even if this will make the experience a little more bitter for screenwriters and story-obsessed people, the movie is still chilling, and every time you see it and remember that it all happened once, you'll be hair-raised.",

""The Pianist"" isn't as bloody or deathly as ""Schindler's List"" but it definitely shows that survivors came out of it due to pure luck, and that life is very fragile. Adrien Brody as the pianist, Szpilman, lives in the Warsaw Ghetto and after his family is taken to concentration camps, he must survive on luck and his own willpower. He works manual labor and hides at every opportunity. The film is very tense, because his fate is often uncertain, and his allies are often thwarted for their immeasurable help in hiding him. Brody gives an impeccable and heart wrenching performance, starting out with his family and trying to remain light about the situation, but eventually he becomes frail and hollow inside. The film is a shocking depiction of the war, as it should be, and comes from the uncommon perspective of a direct survivor.

The biggest strength of this movie is that it does not try to take any sides. Only a great director like Polanski could have made such a heart touching and sensitive movie.

Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well.

333,17 March 2003,ilovedolby,10, Polanski has poured his heart and soul into this picture!,"Acclaimed director Roman Polanski (`Rosemary's Baby,' `Chinatown') brings us one of the most stirring Holocaust pictures ever seen, `The Pianist,' based on the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman, who is a Jew that survived a Nazi ghetto in Warsaw, Poland. Szpilman is the central character of the film, portrayed by actor Adrian Brody (`Summer Of Sam') who provides such greatness in his performance that it's hard to find a better actor in any film of 2002. Undoubtedly, part of `The Pianist's' magnificence can be attributed to the real life conditions that Polanski faced while growing up. He himself lived in a Nazi ghetto as a child, until he escaped. Both of his parents spent time in concentrations camps, where his mother eventually died. However, Polanski was reacquainted with his father in 1945. 	While watching the film, I couldn't help but feel absolute humility for the real-life characters. Even though most people are aware of the revolting things that Nazis did to Jewish prisoners, it's still quite heart wrenching to watch. For example, from the simple embarrassment that Jews endured in the ghetto of having to dance in the streets for the Nazi soldiers to another scene that depicted Nazis throwing an elderly man out of his wheelchair from an apartment building into the street, only to run over his body later. 	One scene in particular that showed the devastation of the war was one in which Szpilman walks down a deserted city street in the later part of the film. The landscape sent chills down my spine as the street stretched for miles and there was nothing but charred remains of buildings blown out by the onslaught of the war. All that could be heard was artillery fire in the far distance. On this street is where Szpilman spent the last weeks of the Nazi occupation, living in the attic of war-torn house.",

Why is the dilemma they themselves were in not shown? Okay, you can give Polanski credit for showing only one perspective here, and that is not really to show compassion and understanding for the German soldiers. Adrian Brody's Wladyslaw Szpilman is an introverted person who lives for art and cannot understand what is happening around him. When his family is deported, he shows little emotion, he is more concerned with survival. All of this could have been shown better, instead of always focusing on firing squads. We quickly understood what the Warsaw Ghetto was all about, so why the confrontation with horror again and again? What Polanski does not offer is a study of the character of Szpilman and Brody's game, which I always appreciate, remains rather vague here. Does he deserve the Oscar? I do not know. Is ""The Pianist"" a good film? Maybe. A masterpiece it is definitely not.",

It tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, Poland's most accomplished pianist, who escaped the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.  This is not the assault on your emotions that ""Schindler's List"" was.  Rather, it's pretty much a tale of survival, how one man plumbs the depths of humanity and survives to play his beloved music again.",

341,1 June 2019,schroederagustavo,9," Powerful Story, Could Have Been Longer","I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the film, in a sad, depressing kind of way. It's one of the best movies about the holocaust and although different than for example Schindler's List, The Pianist shifts the focus entirely to the lives of the Jews during WW2, instead of a say, the more broader scope that Schindler's List encompasses. Specifically, we follow Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous Jewish pianist played wonderfully by Adrien Brody. I think this movie does two things best: 1. Presenting the common stages of the holocaust victim: Denial, acceptance, survival. And 2. I think this movie did a great job in making the rhythm of the story feel natural, even though the time jumps are sometimes pretty large. Like, for example, there will be a scene of Wlad and his family being notified that they must all move to this area where all of the Jews in Krakow are going to live from now on, and how they must now wear a star of david (that they have to make themselves) to be branded. We are shown the family interactions and the emotions, then we move on to the next situation, perhaps a few weeks, months, or maybe even years later. It worked great in this film.",

I must admit Roman Polanski did a very good job showing us the misery and suffering of Poland during the days of Hitler, the holocaust and the horrible inhumane things they did to them, which could shock you and make you sympathize the people in it. Adrien plays a pianist who is very successful in Poland but during the outbreak of the Second World War, however, he becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the Nazis. By the start of the 1940s, he goes from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, then into a forced German Labor Compound. Overall, a true work of art, and a compelling movie which would make you cry and sympathize the people, seeing how they were killed, and you would enjoy it too, great work of Polanski despite his past, which I will not discuss.

Until now I'd only seen him in the odd mafia flick, but in this he was sublime. All the actors gave amazing portrayals, but for me Brody stands out perhaps because of the extremes he was required to go to in this role. I'm not sure if Brody is a piano player, if he's not, then he may be the best actor I've ever seen. The viewer becomes invested in the characters of this film, but Brody is our guide through it all, and his character is the most developed of them all in this film. Others were scant where they could have been more full, maybe. The production quality, the settings, dismal depressing & terrifying scenes, all seemed nearly too real, one can easily lose themselves in this movie, immersing so fully it is nearly a shock when the ending comes & one is thrust back into the modern time and body.

This movie is not only a work of art, it is an important movie. This movie is far superior to Schindler's list and has deeper insights into the experience of human beings whose freedoms and dignity have been taken away. Whereas ""Schindler's List"" was a cold, impersonal film without a glimmer of humanity or clue as to what morality is, ""The Pianist"" is a film that real and genuine people can relate to and will treasure for the lessons that may be drawn from it.  This is a movie whose time has come!  Without being political or preachy, this film tells the story of a pianist in Poland and what happens to him and his family during the German occupation of Poland. This movie is seamless and you won't want to miss a moment of this masterpiece.  It has something to say about what is wrong in our world today.  When good people do nothing, evil triumphs.  This movie without a doubt should be seen by peace protesters and liberals everywhere who are indifferent to the suffering of people whose lives are tyrannized by a mad man like Hitler.  It's inhuman to ignore what's going on every day in the lives of oppressed peoples the world over.  The movie so subtly and yet powerfully drives home the truth that there is no peace except when good men stand up and fight the evil of dictatorships.  The actors are uniformly superb.  The story is riveting.  The cinematograpghy, the period sets, the directing and the editing are unbelievable!  Don't miss this important and enjoyable film!  I give this film a 10 out of 10!",

359,5 September 2004,CurtMan@LVCM.com,9," Powerful, Heartwrenching Tragic Drama","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""The Pianist"" succeeds frighteningly in examining the horror, tragedy, and despair of the Holocaust, as experienced by a personal witness. A story brilliantly told from the eyes of an aspiring musician torn apart from the events of the Holocaust is extremely effective in depicting what actually happened to ordinary, and in this case, successful people, many of whom went from riches to rags in a matter of months. Sad, honest, brutal, and timelessly compassionate, the story follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, in his quest for survival from the cruel horrors which have plunged him into despair. Brody is brilliant in this performance of a man once at the brink of fame, who is now tarnished into mere survival, who begins to see the horrors of the Nazis between his escapes and who soon becomes the subject of their potential extermination. One can feel the passionate, personal story of Roman Polanski, who apparently experienced much of the horrors in this story, and who puts his heart and soul into translating those experiences into a sad, potent, and important film which takes us into a world of despair as we earnestly hope for Szpilman's survival. This is a brilliant, devastating, and potent film, succeeding wonderfully in its difficult, harrowing message: Hope is the only inspiration for survival. Survival and passion are the resounding graces of this harrowing masterpiece, ""The Pianist"". **** out of ****",

I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged. There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky guy who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.",

It does so without relishing in unnecessary gore - don't get me wrong, the scenes depicted in the film are harrowing enough, but there are certainly much more graphical accounts of the holocaust and you never feel that the film ""indulges"" in those pictures for the sake of it.

It also brought to life a portion of history with which I thought I was familiar but whose horrors and day-to-day miseries have never been portrayed quite so clearly.

Universal did a great job of packaging this quality film; I have seen many memorable films about the WW II Jewish Holocaust but this ranks among the absolute top tier. The details about Szpilman's music and the corroboration about his eyewitness memoir written in the 1950's helps build the authenticity of this project.  The use of locations that were totally wrecked also helps the director's and screenwriter's visions to shine through.  I am impressed by this young actor's commitment and his implicit diligence at conveying the talent and intelligence of the Polish musician.  Brody illustrates how ""pretty faces"" are not the only men worth building cinematic casting lists around; I can't imagine Brad Pitt or Ben Affleck in such a role that requires intellect and solitary mundane discipline (his piano technique and artistry).  Kudos to Mr. Brody - - your Academy Award is a worthy one to a hard worker !  For those who with little awareness of the situation of the Polish people during the NAZI regime, this is a great ""intro"" and will display the many-sided nature of people during war time: the good and humane, the bad/sadistic/wickedly selfish, and the victimized people who were vulnerable and too trusting in a compromised ""modern civilization"" like Europe in the 1930's.

The performances are completely natural and no one goes overboard in portraying a particular role. Adrien Brody gives a subdued performance as a man whose only purpose is to survive against massive odds.

Why do they always have to see things black and white (good or bad) when war and life is not as simple as that. WW2 was awful, I agree, but give it a break and START living in the present! Some producers, IMHO, try to take advantage of WW2's ""success"" in Hollywood and the film's industry overall to build a name or to be liked by everyone. This sort of propaganda movies are the ones that brainwash people into thinking that some countries or people are evil and some are good without even thinking about the causes and consequences of the actions in the story (specially when is such a delicate subject as this one where the story is actually a part of history and something that affect us all). The film only drives you emotionally through it but it's just that and nothing else what makes it good.

From the visual effects, through the acting of the cast all the way to the emotions that we get to feel while watching this. It's an old movie that I just love going back to because of it's realness and emotions, all that just makes you think how lucky you actually are to live in a world where we don't get to see much of it with our own eyes. Sad truth is - humans do it to other humans and it makes you think - what exactly is our purpose on this planet? Do we even deserve to be here if we can't treat other human beings with respect and dignity and kindness....",

Nevertheless, not all of the stories from this era translate very well into film and this is no exception. Polanski is so full on with the horrors that many of them fall into cliché and the result is that there is no emotional response left from the viewer for the rest of the film. For example, there's a woman who's had to kill her baby (how on Earth would they know?), there's a man who eagerly scoffs food of the filthy ground..and so on.. It seemed Polanski felt the need to cram in far too much. For heaven's sake he even crow-barred in Shylock's line from Merchant of Venice about being Jewish AND being human at the same time; how 'convenient' that the pianist's brother had the play on him! Nevertheless, there were some painfully wonderful moments such as when the pianist is in hiding in a room with a piano which he isn't allowed, for obvious reasons, to play. You have to see the moment to appreciate it. Unfortunately it is a moment which is all too rare. The part at the end, where he is made to play by a German officer would have been much more emotionally charged if we felt that this officer was a genuine threat. In summary, this film is too crammed with misdirected emotion to be as tear-jerking as Schindler's list.",

This account of the suffering of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis in Warsaw is as emotionally hard-hitting as any you will ever see. Polanski doesn't hold any punches or try to sugar-coat the story as the scenes of execution, violence, and torture are overwhelmingly strong, and may upset many weak-stomached viewers. What's more is that Polanski does not even focus on Auschwitz, as he chooses to document the suffering that took place in Warsaw, through our protagonist Wladislaw Szpilman (who is the only character to get significant screen-time).",

I can say that Adrien Brody has a really great acting in the film. And I was really surprised to learn that Adrien Brody had moved away from his home, sold his car and never watched TV to feel like he had lost everything. In addition, I can say that the music in the film also impressed me very much. Because I enjoy classical music a lot, and I was much more impressed when I listened to it in such sad scenes in this film.

It treats the audience with respect. Brody's performance is great, mostly because of how much he is able to change throughout the film. I liked how (comparatively) lucky Brody's character kept getting throughout the movie because I thought it served as a commentary on how nearly-impossible it was for someone to survive in his shoes.

397,14 October 2005,bulleetz37235,8, Not the best but still damn good...,"If I was an inch more sensitive I would've cried my eyes out. This film is heart-wrenching, a real weepy about the true story of some polish pianist whose name I cannot spell nor pronounce, who was left all alone in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2. Adrien Brody is sublime as the pianist. A man inspired by music to survive, a man who hid and tried to live even though his family had been taken cruelly by the Nazis. The film is slow and some scene of the Nazi brutality is shocking and sad. One man, a disabled inferiority who tries to protest about what the Germans are doing as they storm his house is shocking, and the pianist sees it all. The poor man is lifted in his wheelchair and is thrown over the balcony of the high rise house he lived in. that is one of the more brutal scenes, and the film is well made as all the brutality is shown from the pianist's point of view, and to know that this guy witnessed all this is very disturbing. Roman Polanski shows flair in his fantastic directing and the overall film is well worth watching. The only problem is that the ending is rather ridiculous, whether it happened or not. The part where he emerges from the derelict house which one friendly German has helped him hide in in a German coat and is then promptly shot at (not hit) by a Russian liberation troop is made farcical when they say ""Why are you wearing that coat?"" and he replies ""I'm cold"" - that is quite ridiculous and this rather silly emphasis on the liberation isn't powerful enough. I think they should have left this out and had the scene fade to the scene where the pianist's German helper is being held in a POW camp thing. Another reason is that The Pianist is nowhere near as good as Schindler's List, no questions... It is good and deserves some good recognition and viewings from everyone. It is good and deserves an 8",

From personal experience he spins a yarn into a web of movie genius that is so objective and so awe inspiring that it rivets your attention without mercy. The cinematic climax is so surprising and unlikely and yet so to the truth. This climax is one of the greatest cinematic triumphs in movie history. This is an artist's film. A great work of cinematic brilliance. Brody's performance is stunning! This is without doubt one of the best movies I have ever witnessed and certainly the best modern one! Get it and cherish it!

I found ""The Pianist"", surprisingly, to be rather lacking in characterisation, and found the soundtrack in Spielberg's work, as well as juxtaposition of colours (with black/white), and use of motif, to be much more powerful and moving than Polanski's.

So much suffering, so many places to accuse, incite, and provoke, were all avoided by Polanski using the simplest means of classical narrative techniques. His first pursuit was to tell the story fluently, no matter how much he wanted to express emotions and ideas, he ultimately achieved it. This is something that I know many directors are becoming increasingly difficult to do. Before watching this movie, I was worried that I would leave midway, worried that it would be too dull, but in reality, it felt like I was admiring classical literature in one go. It is full and heavy, but as captivating as Hugo's' Les Miserables'.",
421,22 March 2003,maxmik,10, One for the Ages,Clearly a masterpiece of world cinema. Polanski has made good movies before most notably Chinatown but nothing he has done previously quite prepares you for this brilliant work. What could be a bleak unwatchable horror show instead becomes a universal story of survival thanks to the central performance of Adrien Brody who is in almost every scene. Everything comes together under Polanski's direction to produce a great motion picture that speaks directly to our present time of good versus evil. Yes there is evil in the world and this story from only a generation ago informs us that evil is still very much in the world. Evil takes its form in our fellow man.,

It depicted that we remain the same old good and bad humans and Germans were no different. Probably, it's an excellent way to let the society feel the pain that humans can bring to one another.

Adrian Brody is amazing in this film playing the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman. It reminded me very much like Schindlers List not only because it covers the same themes and time period but also because it really made me appreciate the time in which I live. The way people got treated during that time was horrific and heartbreaking. This movie in my opinion had some very confronting scenes such as Adrian Brody's character getting brutally whipped by a German soldier and also a man getting thrown off the balcony from his wheelchair. These scenes for me were quite hard to watch. Overall though this film was good to watch. I can't imagine it would be easy to act those parts and put yourself into those situations but it was acted very well and very genuine.

It's almost like when you become used to the chaos like the dead body on the side of the pavement and everyone just kind of weaves around without thinking too much about the fact that it's a dead body since they're so used to it. He does an amazing job at painting it like a living nightmare. One in which everyone has learned to live in.

And, how it challenges our limits, demonstrating everything a director can, murdering, humiliation, free labor/slavery, children starving.
Heavy elements in the movie. Hope and despair and survival.
Maybe more than anything else, I loved that it showed both good and bad actions of Jews and Nazis. Of course it's not even close to a competition when counted, but the fact that it was there cannot be denied. There were some people who abused their friends at some point, and there were people mistreating each other for a little bit more food, and a little bit more prosper in those desperate times.
On the contrary, as brutally displayed the Nazis' actions, I love to think that there is a little bit of humanity inside of everyone and this is shown more than one occasion.
On the same note, isn't wrath, greed, and genocide only observed in humans?
I mean, maybe it is human to kill other people, and it needs something more than that to stop it.
I loved the drama in this movie, many powerful phrases such ""Food is more important than time"" and the music. What a lucky life we have to experience the music in this movie.

All the humiliating decrees that were issues right from the Nazi invasion of Poland are brought through different characters and the general sufferings of the Jewish families are brought through Szpilman's family.

It's actually one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.  Adrien Brody was amazing and he deserved the oscar.  This is the first film I've seen of his and I'm telling you this, it won't be the last.  That man has got some amazing talent.

This movie really sticks with you too, hours after watching it I still can't imagine how terrified those poor people were.  I am thankful that I never have had to go through something like that myself and I think a lot of us should be more thankful for the lives that we have.  Movies like this should really be used to educate people on the consequences of one's hatred.  If you are a historical drama fan, a Roman Polanski fan, or just a movie fan in general see this movie.

468,1 April 2003,odor007,10," BEAUTIFUL, DISTURBING, FLAWLESS...A MASTERPIECE!","Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is an absolute masterpiece.  There's really no way to describe it without writing pages, but there's a reason it's currently at #45 on imdb's top 100 films ever (and climbing).  As a film student, I must say that this is probably the most brilliant direction job in the past two decades...Polanski's absolutely masterful sense of timing, his ingenious attention to detail, his passion, and his care for the actor's craft shines through to the end of this film--every color, every grain, every outfit, every face, every camera shot is an artwork, creating a film experience like few others.  This movie also has an incredible combination of joyous scenes, horridly disturbing scenes, and scenes that are so powerful and beautifully-realized that it's hard to take--I've seen many films in my days, and I've cried during about ten of them--usually just teary eyes though.  During this film tears were uncontrollably streaming down my face, and I sat in the theater, simply in shock at what an experience this film is.  Afterwards, on the trip home with a group of friends, none of us talked once for the mile walk.  Once getting home, I was so profoundly moved and had so many thoughts and feelings I couldn't read, watch TV, anything...it all seemed so unimportant and trivial.  I was rooting for Almodovar at the Academy Awards for his amazing job on ""Hable Con Ella,"" but I had not yet seen the Pianist--all I have to say is that it deserved to sweep every category of nomination.  Brody absolutely, without a doubt deserved his award (his performance was one of the best, most precise, most accurate, and most heart-felt I've ever had the pleasure of watching), and it also deserved the Best Screenplay award.  But I have a feeling that not even the Academy, notorious for it's payoffs and balanced out voting tactics, could let the show end without Polanski winning Best Director.  The fact that ""Chicago"" won for Best Picture is a travesty, and I really don't know how that cast got up there and accepted that award, knowing how ridiculous their victory was...but that's the multi-million dollar politics of the Academy Awards.  Anyway, I'm rambling, but EVERYONE must see this film--will go down in history as one of Polanski's best, Brody's best, and as one of the greatest cinema accomplishments of all time.",
469,25 October 2014,clearwinner,7, Unable to portray the point of the movie,"The movie opens up with the German attack, then there is some kind of love or whatever scene between the lead and some random girl (who appears next towards the end). Then it shows some family drama. Again here there is no much insight given to the lead so it becomes to rack what is being shown and why it is being shown. I was lost for most of the time during the first half. The events occur very quickly and the tension is slack. You would not fell any kind of tension during the first half because it just shows some random events occurring to their family members and some children. It seems more like a cliché. Well apart from this, the most irritating thing for me was the relation of the lead and his brother. The brother was not happy with the pianist , OK I accepted that fact but how did this contribute to the story. I felt these all scenes were just added for the sake of inclusion of drama in the movie. But it did not go well with the plot. ",

When it did I was elated, for I too was caught up in the 'Razzle Dazzle'. Then I watched 'The Pianist' and the movie just blew me away. I loved the subtle things, his day to day survival, even how the colour slowly drained from the screen until we were just left with muted grays. The scene in which the tank rolls down the street and matter-of-factly begins to shoot at passersby is delicately and simply executed. No blood, no special effects, no music, just a running lady stopped in mid-stride and slumped in the road. It really brought home to me that this was NOT just a movie, and it never sets out to be just a movie. It is truly a re-telling of the truth of Spilman's life. Brody truly shines in this role; he is neither too bland or too over-dramatic. It is truly difficult to carry a picture by oneself and remain compelling throughout. Polanski and the entire cast and crew truly deserved the Best Picture Oscar for 2003, and I am at least grateful that I had also rooted for Brody to take home the Best Actor statue.",

There was some major hype to it then, but that is understandable since Polanski is one of the most famous Polish directors along with Kieslowski and Wajda. I have watched several Polanski films over the last few months and I really appreciate what he has done over the years. The thing that I most like about him as a filmmaker is that he combines simple and intelligent storytelling with artistic craft that is easy to see. He always claims that he likes to make films that he would like to watch himself as a fan. Most of his films tell engaging stories that are accessible to anyone. At the same time, his techniques are very direct and provide additional enjoyment to those who have a deeper knowledge of film and its devices. I think his films would be good to study in an introductory film class. Enough about Polanski",

What if the guy who kidnapped Elizabeth Smart turned out to be this really cool dude with an artistic vision? Would Hollywood give either of these people a standing ovation at the Oscars? What if Polanski had violated one of their 13 year-old children? I think the outcome would have been a bit different. (For you kids who came along late in the game--The victim was 13 and Polanski raped her and fled to Europe to escape punishment. France would be the country that lets him live freely as a fugitive from justice, if you hadn't guessed that already.)",

I was shocked to see cities I know in a chronicle (at the beginning of he film you can see parts of original one from Warsaw) from before, towns in shape I did not recognize. Terrible and horrifying as the war is you see that not everybody on the wrong side is bad and not everybody on the side of oppressed is a good one. You also see  that in times when there is almost nothing that can keep you going that can give you hope there is something inside to which if we hold very tight it may just allow us to survive and if not that at least to die with dignity. And it is not only dignity given to the holder (the pianist) but also to people that moved by the power of his art are willing to risk their lives to help him survive. And this is real story.

I think the film more than adequately portrayed the protagonist's near-death experiences. It is dramatic and life-affirming. Many scenes are memorable. Also, as an amateur musician, I can attest to how music can provide purpose, sanity, and sustenance in times of deprivation, pain and fear. Wladyslaw Szpilman was a truly remarkable man whose story of survival was worthy of honoring. But he did little to help others. He observed and suffered from the horrors of the ghetto, but he did little to confront them. Polanski singularly exalted Szpilman's personal survival, when he could have explored other aspects of Szpilman's story. For example, Szpilman's conduct of protecting himself -- and not joining with others, assisting others, or joining the Warsaw ghetto resistance -- was similar to the conduct of the Polish Resistance groups who refused to help the Jews in the Ghetto in spite of the fact that the Warsaw Ghetto uprising was at the time the more successful anti-Nazi effort being waged in Europe.

511,22 February 2004,Sennin,5," Manipulative the first hour, lineal during the rest","In a general way, this movie can be divided into two parts, that differ in temporal terms, as well as in substance ones. The first part, shorter in time, seemed to me to be similar in content to those save the whales spots that Greenpeace makes you watch in school to generate environmental conscience. Not that I have a problem with Jewish folk, nor the whales, in fact I find extremely appalling both genocides, but the truth is that the victimist discourse that tries to bring the public into tears by making them feel impotent in front of the images is a very wasted one, particularly if the topic in discussion is the Jewish Holocaust (not to mention the whales). It would have been interesting to see Polanski driving the narration in a more objective way, showing the cause and the effect (in other words the reason why the Germans invaded Poland and persecuted the Jewish folk, as well as the persecution itself), and not only the effect, especially if proceeding that way the victimization of the Jewish is out of question (there's no way to be an apologist of the Holocaust, but there could have been a little sketch of the poor excuse for a twisted logic there was behind the invasion that would ""explain"" the behavior of the German soldiers in the movie), but would have avoided to fall into the coarse cliché it did. The second part, that entails a sudden twist in the narration, characterizes for being quite faster then the previous one (justifying its longer time), becoming a sort of adventure movie, well-driven most of the time, but that tended to be superfluous and implausible (fact that, by the way, has in this movie a wider tolerance rate: facts that in other movie would have tasted false or fictitious, in this movie were forgiven, due to the fat that it was ""based on a real story"") by times; in which the ups and downs of the pianist are told in a lineal way and without focusing that much on the external events, closing the public's perception: as opposite as in the first part, where one was witness of the ""pathos"" of the main character's family and the entire ghetto; in this one, one only gets to acknowledge only the facts concerning him. On the other hand, by the same time this perception is closing, one can feel a relief concerning the effectist discourse mentioned above. In deed, by this time they start to enter the scene the pro-Jewish characters, that seem to appear as life savers in this sea of anti-Semite people. But this relief comes a bit late into scene, as the public is already determinated by the previous scenes. From the technique aspect, we find the strong side of the movie: the photography is just splendid (keep an eye for the scene where the pianist finds himself before the destructed Warsaw); as well as the piano playing scenes, which are not only of a visual interest, but also provide us of an exquisite hearing pleasure (While many may complain about Chopin and say he is some sort of Gustavo Adolfo Béquer of the music, in the way that he didn't compose for art, but in order to get dates; they cannot deny that he is just more that a deployment of mere virtuosity à la Malmsteen, but that the music has a feeling and beauty that surround it). Regarding the acting, we must say it is well over the average but it isn't something out of this world, nor something like that. In the case of the secondary characters it's not that easy to tell, as there are so many and their performances are too little to define an opinion. Nevertheless, despite these last favorable points, I must continue to think that Polanski could have made a greater effort in this movie, since just by it self, or in comparison with his previous work, is quite unsatisfactory.",

521,14 June 2020,iccmulan,8, Excellent,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways! It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off. It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away. (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest 'safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head. Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)",

Amidst the absolute cruelty and despicable atrocities inflicted by Nazi Germany, this is the true account of what happened to a famous Jewish pianist from Warsaw who survived by hiding from these tyrannical oppressors in various locations around the Polish capital. And just as his hope of surviving is at its lowest ebb, a high-ranking Nazi officer provides food and shelter in the most unlikely of places. Although what this movie depicts deserves a rating of 1/10, the sheer willpower and goodness of a few to help him ranks it at 9/10.

532,11 January 2005,tuningcourse,10, absolutely stunning,"Polanski, unlike any other filmmaker, has a way of getting into your very core and evoking unconcsious emotions that seem to manifest themselves for days after. The Pianist is the type of film that initially strikes one as powerful, but perhaps so much so that its core essence requires time to settle and be processed. As several days have passed, I find my focus of attention ever more on the film and the ingenious manner in which it was designed. Really, few words will do the film justice but if I may say visually stunning and existentially powerful, perhaps that may be a meager start. The film is less a story of the main character's nightmarish struggle for survival during the unspeakable occupation of the Nazis in Warsaw; it is a pure visual study of hell observed primarily through the character. My God, how Polanski orchestrates this feat of cinematic power is hard to discern but his consistency in doing so is nothing less than pure genius. From the character's hideaway in an abandoned flat and the brutality of German soldiers always occurring at a distance as a panoramic backdrop to the character is an element I've never really seen done on this type of scale. If I may say Polanski has succeeded in creating a new cinematic dynamic, that wouldn't be an exaggeration. In the present climate of Hollywood silliness and superficiality, The Pianist is a rare achievement that rates it among the best films of all time, if not for its incredible usage of technique, but for its utter message of human evil and the struggle for survival against that evil which we, as the present generation, must always remember and never forget.

There are but very few movies which have been able to depict the atrocities faced by the Jewish community under the Nazi rule with a realistic portrayal of those times. ""The Pianist"" is certainly one among those. Even though this movie focuses on Szpilman's evasion from a otherwise certain holocaust with some luck and good helpful acquaintances, it skillfully shows some of the most moving scenes depicting human hunger, helplessness and hardships faced by the Polish Jews.
The acting performance is top-notch by the cast, especially Adrien Brody as Szpilman.

You don't ever feel sorry for any of the characters including Szpilman. It is extremely existentialist, with a eerie Beckett-esque feel to it through out. The scene of the soup-snatcher and of the old Jew man being thrown off his wheelchair from his balcony high above the pavement couldn't have been written better by Beckett himself. The whole idea of the music playing in your head is so enchanting, yet you don't ever feel depressed but instead smile and hear the music in your own head. The scene of Szpilman playing the piano yet not playing it, is something that will continue to haunt me for a long time. Brody is Szpilman, every character is their own person, no one could have replaced them and none could have done another role. The music pieces are brilliantly chosen from a wide collection of the work that Szpilman played, so is the cinematography. This film would have been so easily about Szpilman's heroic life, instead it's about his music, and his survival to play that music, nothing more, nothing less. It's not about the Jewish cause, it's not about the life of his family members, it's not even about his love story. It's a very rare film. And by the end of the film, you're left with a sense of incompleteness which must have been Szpilman's life but his music seems to fill that void for him and for us as well. I wouldn't say it's a must see, because that would be a term you'd associate with a Hollywood blockbuster, this is a must know.",

564,19 November 2002,mleach,10," Based on a true story, The Pianist recounts the experiences of Wladislaw Szpilman, a brilliant Jewish concert musician in Poland during World War II.","Based on a true story, The Pianist recounts the experiences of Wladislaw Szpilman, a brilliant Jewish concert musician in Poland during World War II. Szpilman's extraordinary story of persecution, family tragedy and, ultimately, survival is brilliantly rendered in what is arguably one of Roman Polanski's greatest achievements as a film-maker. The Pianist does not flinch from re-creating the appalling horror of what happened to Polish Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, or avoid their eventual fate in the Nazi concentration camps. Nevertheless, this is not a dramatised documentary or a grim history lesson, instead The Pianist focuses very much on Szpilman's personal journey and what we see and feel is through his eyes. More by luck than good judgement, he becomes a fugitive and escapee in occupied Warsaw, where his terror and isolation are only offset by the help of friends and his memory and belief in the music he has performed. Adrien Brody (Bread and Roses, Summer of Sam) has already received considerable critical acclaim for his mesmerising performance as Szpilman and he is ably abetted by an impressive ensemble cast. British writer, Ronald Harwood, provides a sensitive and measured script; Pawel Edelman's photography provides luminous, unsentimental images and, of course, there is the music which is a major character within the film, setting tones and atmosphere. Above all, though, this is a Roman Polanski film and, considering his own World War II experiences in the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos, this may be his most personal and heartfelt film. Certainly, The Pianist is one of Polanski's most perfectly realised movies and, deservedly, won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival.",
565,30 November 2022,business_kid,6, A tedious horror story,"IMHO, this was very unevenly paced. In early September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. In early November, there waws Krystallnacht, and the Jews were rounded up thereafter. As soon as they could be takes, Polish Jews also vanished. The film draws this out for two thirds of it's length. The rest can only be touched on. Polanski obviously had something to say on the Nazi treatment of Jews in WW2, which was horrible beyond belief. Who would blame him? I ask you, though: Do you want to be there when he says it? I for one, did not. I think I know that terrible story. It's not entertainment, it's depressing. The lead actor is excellent.

567,23 August 2020,chris12345678,9, Most personal movie for Roman Polanski,"This is the most insightful movie about WWII ever made. Germany, led by a demon-possessed madman Hitler and terrorized into submission by his minions, against better judgement of most of its military commanders started a war in Europe believing it could lash back against the Versailles treaty. Poland led by the worst politicians one could wish upon a country was the first victim. Polanski and Szpilman, a promising pianist, on whose story the movie is based (but some of the scenes come from Polanski's own past), weave a tale of survival in the madness that follow. Poland was mercilessly bombed by Nazi Germany and then invaded from the East by Soviets. It was occupied until the end of the war and since it was home to most of Europe's Jewish population it was picked by Nazi leaders to be the graveyard of Jews. Scenes from the Warsaw ghetto leading up to the transportation are a mix of Szpilman's and Polanski's experiences. After that it's mostly Szpilman. He was holed up in an abandoned apartment on the Aryan side of Warsaw just by the Jewish ghetto wall by members of Polish resistance (the largest resistance force in Europe counting over 1000,000 members, contrary to the lies spread by Hollywood who want it to be the French resistance which was a joke compared to Poland's) and he witnessed both the ghetto uprising of 1943 on the other side of the wall (watch the scene with the cannon) and then the Polish Warsaw uprising of 1944 which was a festival of bloodshed that cost the lives of 200,000 Poles.The blowing up of the military hospital with a panzerschreck and the destruction of the tank, and everything else belong to that bloody event. Without spoiling, what happens next, is the most human side of WWII ever put on screen. Spielberg, watch and learn. The drama of so many good human being caught up in all this madness. God bless you Roman Polanski for this movie, God didn't save you for nothing. God have mercy on all good people who perished during this madness, whichever country they may hail from. Never again.

After he gets bamboozled into writing(playing the piano) a movie for his friend, he is cast upon a ship writing(playing the piano) a movie as they approach the island(Germany) where they will shoot it.

It was good but, it could have been great (ie Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful) The reason it was not, I felt, was it was excessive. After seeing that many innocent jews executed, killed in battle, or beaten on the street, one just becomes desensitized to it. By the end of the film, I don't believe I felt, or was capable of feeling, anything. I guess the fault lies not entirely with the film. I suppose with the excess of violence this generation is exposed to everyday, Polanski probably felt he needed that much killing in plain sight to tap our emotions. Yet past movies depicting the holocaust have done a much finer job of imprinting how terrible a tragedy it was, and that's why they are great.",

Roman Polanksi did a superb job of directing this film and really getting the emotions out of the viewer.  The characters were all wonderfully acted and Adrien Brody did a top notch job.  Not a comedy to laugh at but rather a true story of never giving up.  I recommend this film to everyone because I think it gives a good idea of what the Jewish people faced in World War II.,

597,22 March 2003,wonderfulfable,10, Brilliant and yet sad......,"I went see The Pianist tonight feeling a bit curious and expecting the usual Saving Private Ryan spread. Man, I was wrong. This Roman Polanski directed film effectively conveys the horrors of The Holocaust that the Polish Jews have to endure during the German Occupation in Warsaw, Poland WW2. Jews; young and old, are shot for no reason, abused, and ridiculed. Caught in the middle of this nightmare was Wladyslaw Szpilman (brilliantly potrayed by Adrian Brody) a young and talented pianist and his Jewish family. They, like other Jews, were forced into small ghettoes and are sealed off from other parts of the city. There, they live their lives in poverty, waiting to be deported to concentration camps. In a heart wrenching scene, he was separated from his family and was forced to survive on his own in the ghettoes of Warsaw. From that point of the movie, it started to run a little slow. Even so, Adrian's performance shows him constantly hiding in the shadows, waiting, watching, fearing whether the next day would be his last. He doesn't talk much in this part of the film but the facial expression and body language tells it all. The other actors that supported Szpilman like his family also convey the sense of looming fear and dread that is also present in the other Jews in the film. This really and I mean realistically, gives us the impression that the Holocaust is much more than just the slaughtering of 3 million Jews (FACT;from the start and end of WW2).",
598,28 January 2003,zmarc,10, Is it possible to make a bad Holocaust film?,"Is it possible to make a bad Holocaust film? With such drama and history, it seems difficult. This one is certainly moving, and even shocking: you'd think we'd have seen everything by now, but some of what the Nazi's did is beyond comprehension. The story is the true story of Szpilman, Poland's greatest pianist. The Germans take over Poland, put him and his family into the newly established ""Jewish Sector,"" and eventually kill his family. It's a miracle he survived. What I liked about this film is the way it's so understated. Our protagonist isn't a hero: he just a guy. I compare him to a rat. I don't mean that in a negative sense, just that he's a rat scrounging for survival, and every time you think he's down, up he pops again. But it's not really a survival story either: mostly the guy survives via luck and friends. He doesn't particularly want to survive in some ways, he just does. It's like he's so overwhelmed by his circumstance he doesn't know how to do anything else. Adrian Brody gives a terrific performance as Szpilman, especially toward the end when things get desperate. Polanski is smart in his handling of the film: he just gets out of the way and lets the story tell itself. I didn't notice one superfluous camera movement or transition: you just forget you're watching a film and get wrapped up in the time period. It is a long film (over 2.5 hours) but every frame is important. One intriguing aspect that I felt was brilliant in retrospect (a bit of spoiler here) is that we don't get to really see Szpilman play the piano until late in the film. Sure there's a brief scene at the beginning, and a couple in the middle, but he's not really playing. That's wonderful, because part of Szpilman's pain is that throughout the war he has no piano to play, and we, the audience, glimpse that pain through the subtle absence of his playing during most of the film. When he does play at the end, it's a catharsis for both of us -- we've both been aching for that moment. We're overjoyed at his joy at being able to play again. Superb. All that said, where does this film rank in cinema history? That's difficult to say: it's tough to criticize a Holocaust film without coming across as a brute. This is an excellent film, and I liked that it tells a different story of the war and shows us new images and a new perspective, but ultimately it can't escape what it is: a Holocaust film. That tag carries a lot of baggage, and frankly, once you've seen once Holocaust film you've seen portion of all others. There's some new material here but it's definitely not as original as Life is Beautiful, a film I liked far more simply because it dared to be daring (a comedy about the Holocaust). This is a great film in the sense that it's well-done, emotionally moving, and has historical significance, but while I wouldn't have a problem watching Life is Beautiful over and over again, I can't say the same thing about The Pianist. I'm very glad I saw it, and I might watch it again on DVD, but like Schindler's List this is not a movie you want to watch over and over again. That diminishes it slightly in my book (for instance, it wouldn't be in my top ten favorite films).",

OK, Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a somewhat known pianist that was working at Warsaw radio station. But the war starts and everybody's life is about to change. Then the whole movie watches closely the main character during WW2. I have to say that the plot is practically inexistent in this movie. Szpilman never does something interesting, he doesn't try to help anyone, people are dying everywhere around him and he shows almost no emotion(he just watches). Fortunately there are several people who help him, otherwise he would have died too. You can't sympathize much with the character and there is no romance involved, no love story in this movie(though I think it's more real this way). Near the end Szpilman almost gets shot by russians that confused him with a german(because of the coat he was wearing).

613,13 May 2009,ineffectualpoet,10, Perfect,"I have not seen many films that centre on the events of the holocaust, but I did approach this movie with a sense that it will portray its Germans in a light too poor and its victims in a light too necessary. So I had no high, or even low expectations for this movie that differ from the norm.",
614,7 August 2004,azusofa,10, A rare masterpiece,"Even though it was way before my time, the hellish crimes and atrocities of the holocaust has always sickened and affected me very deeply. The war-torn realism and sheer horror re-created under the direction of Roman Polanski shook me to the core. I cried several times during the film, and it was difficult to make it though the end of the movie. I can easily understand now, why Polanski received an Academy award for best director, and Adrian Brody for Best Actor. The role of Wladyslaw Szpilman would've taxed and challenged the talents of any elite male actor in Hollywood, and yet Adrien Brody accomplished the task better than anyone I can imagine. He translated the character's hopes, loves, and especially his horror and despair in such a genuine fashion, that it's amazing that it comes from a 20-something year old actor. Makes me wonder how & where he was able to draw those intense emotions to make it seem so real. Anyway, this is a film that I think every person should see at least one time, for any number of reasons.",

618,16 July 2022,ToastyBeyond,10, Amazing and Tragic but mostly Amazing,"The Pianist directed by Roman Polanski, is a movie about Wladyslaw Spzilman, a Polish and Jewish pianist who has to survive through the horrifying Warsaw Ghetto throughout WWII. This movie is just a stunning masterpiece, Everything in this movie is near perfection, the cast, the music, the acting, the writing, everything is perfect. The most outstanding performance of course is Adrian Brody as Wladyslaw Spzilman, and he plays him fantastically. I love how when Wlady Spzilman is walking you can see his finger moving slightly, I think Adrian Brody did this so it shows how much Wlady Spzilman loves playing Piano and how pianos are always on his mind no matter how dire the situation is. You can tell that Adrian Brody is putting his heart out for this role and I can't see any other actor playing Wlady Spzilman, also Adrian Brodys are of Polish Jewish descent so that fits his character. My favorite part of the movie is when Wladyslaw Spzilman is playing the Piano for the German Captain played by Thomas Kretschmann, that scene has no words said but it conveys lots of emotion through the German Captain's face, it looks like he is regretting the past things he has done and is trying to do right by helping Wlady Spzilman. The story and the way it is told are well done, each time there is a jump in time like when Wlady Spzilman is fake playing the piano in the apartment so he hasn't heard it cuts to the snowy streets of Warsaw, transitions like that just seem right for this movie and it is executed perfectly. I think this movie is a very accurate representation of the horrors that happened during the holocaust, and what the Jewish people had to go through and this story makes their journey depressing but hopeful. I don't know what to say more about this movie I can't explain everything I like about this movie. You will have to watch the movie for yourself because it is too good of a movie just to talk about. The Pianist is 10/10 if there was a rating system that can give higher I would give it higher.",
619,13 April 2003,Laert,4, To show how it really was like doesn't mean to make a good movie.,"Spoiler!!!!!!!!! There are plenty of movies set in eastern Europe during the second World War. And I'm sure that ""The Pianist"" is not among the best of them. Certainly it is important for such a movie to create an adequate atmosphere, to let the audience feel the dimension of the brutality and inhumanity of the nazi regime. Yet I think that Polansky focused too much on it and the rest of the movie suffered from it.",
620,9 February 2003,TorpidOne,7," Good, Interesting, but not Great.","The first half hour or so of the Pianist really struggles.  It shows the same coming threat that we have seen in other movies, yet does not do as good of a job of making them as horrific or tragic.  Polanski tries his best, and certainly there are scenes that one would think would horrify. Yet knowing what would happen later, and having seen films such as Schindler's List, the early parts of the Pianist just don't have the same emotional impact that they might have in years past.",
621,15 June 2003,Eli_Cash,8, Jarring Holocaust Piece of a Man's Determined Survival,"This was improbably my first Polanski, not surprisingly my first Brody, but certainly not my first World War Two/Holocaust picture.  I have to admit I knew little going 'in' to this except holding foolish thoughts like 'how many more times are they going to make a movie on this topic?' ",
622,14 April 2003,TwistedIvory,9, A Terse Statement,"I did enjoy this movie and its depiction of semi-actual events.  However, the length and editing of this movie made me feel as if I'd actually been living for five years during WWII; normally, this immersion in the environment would be wonderful, but in this bleak, depressing scenario the effect was to make me exhausted.  The editing depended heavily on close attention to detail and scene, as Polanski is certainly not given to fast editing (thankfully); however, the presence of several spurious scenes ultimately led me to feel tired upon completion of the film. A great movie -- I give it a 9 -- but it could have been better had the movie not felt like an epic crossed with an opus.",
623,5 August 2011,lancerocks1234,3, not as good as i thought,"Honestly, I read all the reviews and thought i had to watch this movie. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The movie was good at first but then got very slow. The only thing that made me like it was the fact it was based on a true story. I have seen other holocaust movies that were ten times better than this. I do not see how anyone thought this movie was so great. It was so boring towards the end i would have turned it off if other people weren't watching it with me. I am a huge holocaust nut and this movie did not do it justice. It did not even show any other of the important concentration camps. Do not read the other reviews like i did and get excited. The beginning is good but then it gets long and horrible. People need to be warned!! This movie is not good!",
624,4 June 2003,Weathership,10, Brilliant film making. Brilliant performance.,"See the Holocaust through the eyes of a musician and be prepared to be awed. You can not watch Brody's performance without being moved to tears. Watch the scene where he plays for the Nazi officer. Be moved by Polanski's understated direction that will have that image burned in your memory for quite sometime. This film takes a single view of a monstrous event. And it is a view that has never been seen before. Yes there are some action moments, but it is how we see Brody deal with all that is happening around him. Including extraordinary moments of non-dialogue that will have you trying to catch your breath. Please see this film. 5 out of 5",
625,15 August 2003,sashastrike25,9, A moving film that shocks and disturbs,"I was not keen on watching this film, but after turning it on I could not switch off.  This film makes you feel sick, shame, despair, but it also shows you hope in the face of everything.  This film based on a true story, made things that I heard in history lessons real it helped me to understand the pain and the suffering that the Jews suffered at the hands of the Nazis and any film that evokes strong emotions has done its job.  I was appalled at some of the comments I have read suggesting that the main character was selfish HOW? he did not ask to be rescued from going on the train that led to his familys death, he survived as anyone would as best as he could yes he was fortunate because he knew people who would help him.  The acting in this film was superb and Adrien Brody truly deserved the recognition he got for this part.  I would recommend this film to those who do not want to rely on emotionless documentries but want something with real feeling.",
626,6 March 2003,marshmallow_pies,10," Beautiful, heartfelt film.","This movie was absolutley stunning. And I find it very depressing that it will be, no doubt, completely overlooked in the Oscars. In many ways, it reminds me of another overlooked film (which also starred Brody) The Thin Red Line. However, both these films were made to make impacts on people; not win awards. That is what The Hours and Gangs Of New York are for.",

The funny thing is that i have to write 10 lines of text to be published, and i have'n got that much to say about the movie.

It was been a really long time since a movie has touched me like this movie. It was so full of Inspiration and Passion. It's amazing that his will to live and his passion for music kept him alive. I just can't imagine the horror and pain he and so many of my relative had to endure. Most of my relatives were Polish Jews as well. I honestly think this is one of the best  (If not the best) Holocaust movie out there. Adrien Brody deserved the Oscar as well as Polanski for Best Director.,
