0,4 July 2020,ferguson-6,9, just superb,"Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it's like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best 'steamed broccoli' (ok, insert your favorite entrée) I've ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that's been me with ""Hamilton."" For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn't all that. So, now I'm here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.",/
1,4 July 2020,rebekahrox,8," Grateful for the captions, the pause button, and Wikipedia.","I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again.",r
2,3 July 2020,guapo_andres,10, BEAUTIFUL,"I'm a mexican boy who has never got the chance to go to Broadway, all I've seen are bootlegs, and they're fine but not like this. This is a beautiful shot of the great spectacle Hamilton is, the flawless music of Lin Manuel Miranda, the production, the photography, costumes. And the acting, Leslie Odom Jr., Renneè, Miranda and Daveed Diggs shine on their roles, I don't know is this can be nominated for any award, but damn it deserves it",e
3,13 July 2020,TheLittleSongbird,10, Musical history,"'Hamilton' was a major surprise for me when seeing and hearing it. Music is such a big part of my life, being now a semi-professional singer and raised into a musical family, and am a fan of musicals, especially the golden age ones. History was also one of my favourite and best subjects in most of my up and down school life, until it didn't work out in sixth form when my confidence went and my comprehension and drive worsened. So having a musical to combine the two immediately intrigued me, despite not being the biggest fan of the dominant styles here (was raised on classical music and opera personally).",v

8,13 July 2020,cricketbat,9," Complex, emotional, and lives up to the hype","There was so much hype surrounding Hamilton that I thought there was no way it could live up to expectations-and yet it does. The songs in this musical production are complex and emotional, and the story explains the history of our founding fathers in an engaging way. Yes, it would probably be better to see it on stage and no, it's not perfect, but I'm glad I was finally able to see Hamilton performed instead of just listening to the soundtrack.",r
9,7 July 2020,southdavid,8, All Rise.,"Like the rest of the world, I watched ""Hamilton"" on Disney Plus this weekend. Though I have seen a number of stage musicals, I haven't seen ""Hamilton"" yet, so this was my first opportunity to see the highly regarded show and I have to say that it didn't disappoint.",w
10,3 July 2020,sebastianbrown-00139,10, This is how musicals should be done for screen,Although many musical adaptations have flopped this may have proved that best way to do it is simply film the play. What you get is one of the best musicals available to watch whenever you like at an affordable price. Great work by everyone involved especially Lin Manuel Miranda.,7
11,4 July 2020,planktonrules,8, How much you enjoy this is highly dependent on your age.,"Yesterday, a bazillion folks tuned in to Disney+ to see the debut of ""Hamilton""...a recording of the Broadway show back in 2016. Because it's not a traditional movie-style musical, it's pretty difficult to compare it to a typical film in the genre. It's also a film whose enjoyment definitely depends on your age. I am in my mid-50s....hardly the age to like hip-hop style music in a musical. But, despite this, I did respect what the show was trying to accomplish--to bring America history to the masses AND to make it more accessible to minorities as most of the parts were played by Black and Hispanic actors and actresses. So, while having the likes of George Washington and Aaron Burr played by black actors isn't historically accurate, it does help make history more inclusive....as did the very modern music. And, as an ex-history teacher, I am thrilled about these things even if I wasn't all that fond of the singing. Well worth seeing....and a nice chance to publicize a few nearly forgotten great Americans.",8
12,4 July 2020,Hitchcoc,10, A Great Representation,"Having seen the play and loving it, I was set for a disappointment. No chance. With the one limitation of being confined to a screen, the portraya was extremely well done. With a minimum of close-ups, the filming of the staging worked well. The sound was very good, few words lost. Since this was the original cast, we got to see the thing at its best. I will leave it to others to get into the plot details. I was intrigued from beginning to end.",4
13,4 July 2020,cliftonofun,8, Not better than the real thing...but close,"I was fortunate enough to see Hamilton 3 times in Chicago, including once from the second row thanks to a friend winning the lottery. How did this compare? WAY better than I expected, honestly. I noticed new moments. I saw the original cast in a new light. I experienced the story like I was onstage. There's nothing quite like being in the theater, but this may be the closest a film crew ever got to capturing theater magic. (I wish the RENT movie had been a recording of a 1996 production...) Hamilton represents a unique moment in American theatre, and I'm grateful someone captured it.",6
14,19 July 2020,garethcrook,10, Blimey!!,"I know a little bit about America's founding fathers. Not a lot, it's not really taught in the UK. That's not important though. Knowing any history to enjoy this I mean, not America's independence. Musicals aren't my thing either and certainly not musical theatre, which this is with several exclamation points. What we have here is the theatre production, filmed, fairly simply. A few camera angles covering the stage, mostly wide to show off a lovely set, occasional close up to, well to provide some variation in the edit, nothing more. This is the thing, it's a show designed to be enjoyed in the room. There's no set camera positions. The camera is normally your eye from your seat. That's not possible right now though, which is why this exists. So it's not a film. It works though and it's undeniably a spectacle. If you don't like singing and dancing, you might think you're buggered. Honestly though, this is pretty top quality singing and dancing, you're in safe hands. It's fast and fun, the energy dialled all the way up. The mix of humour, hip hop and show tunes will make even the most hardened cynic smile. Alright it's gimmicky, actors spitting bars wearing frock-coats, declaring war, but I guess the rules are different in theatre and it's very effective. In film it's often said that if the actors look like they're having too much fun, the audience aren't. I don't think that applies here either, everybody looks to be having the time of their lives and the live audience, that we hear but don't see, seem to be too. It's pretty lengthy, but there's a lot in there, not least a pretty eventful life story. Alexander Hamilton. Rags to revolutionary. A social climbing agitator, with a love of writing and setting up financial institutions. Weddings, duals, adultery, bribery, a bloody big war and a lot of political manoeuvring. The historical content is top line stuff, covering the basics. They're touch points really, never allowing the story to get too dry, but it manages this without dumbing it down too much and the razor sharp humour helps, ""Immigrants we get the job done"". The cast are wonderful. Daveed Diggs as both Lafayette and Jefferson is the standout for me. There are quieter moments, but there's sequences where it's one bombastic banger after another. Canon fire and scratching, the score gets pretty raucous. I went it with a little trepidation, but Lin-Manuel Miranda has indeed created something marvellous. It. Is. Spine-tinglingly brilliant. I might have to stop saying I don't like musicals.",0

18,8 July 2020,questl-18592,9, Alexander Hamil-WIN!,"This was an exciting thing for me. I, like most people, had heard of Hamilton. It was/is a HUGE phenomenon on Broadway and launched the careers of some incredible people. Miranda is always the fun, quirky, goofy musical wizard that pops up in shows now and then. Leslie Odom Jr. has always had this impishly wicked energy to him. Oh, and lets not forget Daveed Diggs, the up and comer who, after Blindspotting and a couple other things, I would watch in just about anything. Unfortunately, I live light years away from any decent stage so the odds of me seeing this in real life seemed like something that may just never happen. Enter the magical world of Disney and I am given the opportunity to finally experience the phenomenon myself, albeit not in the original form. Of course, with all the build up and all the hype, I was worried it couldn't possibly measure up.",?

23,3 July 2020,Thekeybaldemasterrises,10," ""The Story of America Then, Told by America Now""","The time has come. The lights go down. King George III welcomes us to the show. Hamilton has finally arrived in a beautiful HD presentation! You've heard of it, you've listened to it more times than you can count, you've bopped to it and belted the words on your friend's aux to their absolute shock/confusion. Now we can FINALLY enjoy it on loop over and over again on a non bootleg copy, that's right NO MORE SLIME
TUTORIALS! Considering it's called a ""Hamilton film I would say it's right in my ballpark don't you?? First of all, the show is amazing. It's among the best the stage has to offer in the modern age. The music, the performances, the writing, the production, it's all BEAUTIFUL, if you haven't seen it yet WATCH IT NOW, but what truly makes it SO good? In the words of Lin Manuel Miranda, ""It's a story about America then, as told by America now."" The Founding Fathers are played by actors of color, among other characters featured in the story. The show is having us leave whatever cultural baggage we have about these historical figures at the door, and embracing this story through the eyes of America NOW. Yes it does leave some factors out, yes it's not all historically accurate, but people need to realize the point isn't to tell an IN DEPTH biographical story of Hamilton, but rather show us how his life and the events that he took part in helped form the foundations and ideals of what this country was built upon. This show is very Patriotic but it reminds me of what America is SUPPOSE TO BE. WHAT IT COULD BE. Much like the young people of my generation going out and marching for the racial injustices in this country, Hamilton was a 20 year old immigrant that fought for the freedom of this land and helped shaped the principles in which we aspire to uphold. This show isn't going to acknowledge our systemic racism roots with people like Washington and Jefferson who factually owned slaves, but it challenges us to contemplate our OWN feelings about this country and where we came from. How far have we come? What has changed and what could WE do better? Could our founding fathers have done more to abolish slavery? Absolutely, but think about what they did try to create and lay the foundations for. Who knows what they could've done if they had more time? It's not meant to idolize these people, it's a piece about the birth of America, and what people like Hamilton did to help a struggling new country find its own identity. When I watch/listen to this show, I believe in that. I believe that America WAS already great, we just lost sight of it and let the wrong people get in charge. If you want to know why, watch Hamilton. The story of an immigrant that fought in a war, and made a name for himself in a ludicrous political game, is a story that will be remembered for generations. Miranda and his team found an incredible medium to tell these people's stories, and that's what it's all about, who tells our story? How will we be remembered? Hamilton's now available on Disney+, I highly suggest you watch it for your 4th of July this weekend and many days after... But as a final reminder don't forget, this is at its heart, live theatre. Hopefully when Covid ends we can actually experience it all together the way we're suppose to, in front of the stage, LIVE. But for now, this will of course do! 10/10.",=
24,10 July 2020,SofiaHedge,10, Satisfying!,I love this movie. I saw this recently and I liked everything about it. It really was a good idea to film the musical into a movie. The songs are great. The choreography is amazing. The acting is spectacular. I'm so glad that this splendid classic musical was brought to our Televisions by Disney! Alexander Hamilton himself would be satisfied at last.,t
25,7 July 2020,RhapsodyReviews,10, Brilliant Broadway Show.,"Review:
'Hamilton' is a Broadway musical filmed for TV with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It tells the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. The show's music draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes.
I've heard about the Broadway musical for years now but being located in a small town there was no way I would be able to see the show. When I heard it was coming to Disney+ I was both excited and nervous due to the fact I wasn't sure if it would be a victim of overhype. I'm am happy to be able to say this is a true masterpiece of a show that will make you want to revisit it again and again,
The show casts non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures and it is truly brilliant. It showcases the actor's talents and makes a stand against racial stereotypes and Xenophobia. It is both amazing and heartbreaking watching these actors on the big stage. They are brilliant in the way the move and remember their lines during this three-hour long event. Stage shows and their actors are an underappreciated form of art and storytelling. Everybody in this show did a perfect job, but there was one actor who seemed to be having a blast in his role and played two completely different character perfectly, Daveed Diggs.
Aside from having an incredible story of the 'lost' Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton, the show has a brilliant soundtrack that has seamless transitions between scenes. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen and you don't want the show the end. With having super limited space and production design, they were able to showcase different parts of the world and the United States just by having different dress codes and props, and it is done with ease.
Overall, I am urging everybody to watch this amazing piece of art. If you are a fan of musicals you will love this, and if you aren't the biggest fan of musicals I truly believe that the music in this show alone will keep you engage and intrigued to what the story is telling.
5/5",t
26,22 July 2020,awsafzidane,9, And that's how musicals should be made!,"If you're not a fan of musicals and can't bear listening to songs for more than 150 minutes without any dialogues, then this film isn't for you. Everything is expressed through songs and you won't listen them talking without being in rhythm. It has 50+ songs (yes, you read that right) in its 2 hour 40 mins runtime. Like other musicals, it does not have songs of a definite genre, but it comprises jazz, rap, hip-hop, acapella, soft songs and many more. Since musicals have a limited audience, it won't gain much popularity. It's a pity that films like Extraction and 365 Days get so much hype whereas a great work like this goes unnoticed.",_

28,6 July 2020,SnobReviews,10, A groundbreaking phenomenon.,"""Hamilton"" takes a giant leap from stage to screen and couldn't be more sensational, outstanding and groundbreaking.
.
In this broadway musical, it tells the life story of one of America's founding fathers and first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. Captured live on Broadway from the Richard Rodgers Theater with the original Broadway cast.
.
Having never seen the broadway production, this screen adaptation made me feel like I was right there. Lin-Manuel Miranda is the definition of creative genius. The book, the music, the rhymes and a great story; how does he do it all? Everyone in the supporting cast is exceptional as well and the screen direction from Thomas Kail is jaw dropping. When speaking about how ""Hamilton"" is a pop-culture phenomenon; how can it not be? The hype is real, people. Here are actors of colour playing the white-ass founding fathers. Right there, ballsy. The music is whole other thing that I'll be listening to for the next six months. The entire ""Hamilton"" experience is a must-see - it left me floored and I would love to see it live eventually.

30,7 July 2020,maanikroda,10, SPECTACULARY PERFECT!,"I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed, I loved! This musical hit me deeply. I can't say enough what an amazing job the cast and crew did. Through a lot of it, my family and I questioned how you could create something so beautiful, something so unimaginably amazing that made an impact on people, we questioned how you could take a founding father's life and make it into this. Our answer? A Latino that sure knows how to represent us. His name is Lin-Manuel Miranda. I couldn't be more proud of my heritage, even though I've always been proud of it. Long story short, I MOST CERTAINLY recommend watching ""Hamilton"", or if not, listen to the soundtrack!",
31,17 July 2020,eddie_baggins,9, An original musical delight,"Setting the stage world ablaze when it premiered and continuing to do so in years since its initial release, Lin-Manuel Miranda's passion project Hamilton has finally been made accessible to all thanks to Disney+, who have released a filmed version of the musical production onto their streaming service in light of their planned cinematic runs being cancelled due to the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic.",
32,12 July 2020,hughjman,10," Sooooo Good - and if you don't like Act 1, stay for Act 2!!!","I've loved ""Hamilton"" since the music first became available on iTunes. I must have listened to almost every song a thousand times. Getting to watch the impeccable, exquisite awesome original cast for $6??? Wow! To the people who gave it low ratings because they only made it through part of the first act and didn't like it, I suggest: Stay for Act 2. (Wait for it.) The first act is all youthful, explosive, revolutionary energy. The second act has a lot more variety to the songs - and some of them may make you cry. Plus, if you don't see Act 2, you totally miss Daveed Diggs' hilarious, winning performance as Jefferson. (I love him. Daveed Diggs, that is.) And I look at the historical inaccuracies this way: Yes, the F Fathers had terrible s--t about them ), but the musical is perhaps largely about ideals - and also maybe how those get turned into back-room deals (The Room Where It Happens). I don't mistake the characters as written as exacting portrayals of the actual men, who were by and large awful men - but I wish the cast WERE the F Fathers. :)
So I let the musical be what it is, and what it is musically, lyrically, and acting-wise, is breathtaking. And it's just one (wonderful) show. I enjoy it by not asking it to be more than that. And I can see it as many times as I want for just $6!!!!",

James Madison was our shortest president at 5'4''. The actor they chose to play him is easily 6 ft. That took me out of it a bit. But this is a very emotionally powerful film that makes you appreciate this country and how much the Founding Fathers sacrificed to give us our freedom

40,13 July 2020,IamROCKAS,9," America then, as told by America now, is a memorable performance that left me in awe","Hamilton is a musical that never left me bored throughout it's almost three hour runtime. For years I thought this musical was kind of on a meme level because it's a musical mixing hip hop music, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes, with history of the birth of United States of American and it's been parodied mercilessly, mostly by Jack Douglass, better known as jacksfilms, who created multiple videos of that sort and probably is one of the reasons why it's a common belief now that Alexander Hamilton was a president of the United States of America. In reality, the musical was really good and I enjoyed it. It's really memorable and I felt happy, motivated, proud, anxious, and sad - that's a lot of different emotion that I've felt for a representation of one the american founding fathers.",

43,4 July 2020,DGMcCready,9, I can't believe it's this good,Never believe the hype. I didn't believe it. For years I had heard so much about a play about of all people Alexander Hamilton-but done to rap or something similar? Can't be good and maybe offensive. But then the noise of its greatness never quieted. So when it finally came to my town I had to see it. But first I listened to the soundtrack. I was hooked. Despite mezzanine seating I was floored how good the play was. I repeated the soundtrack. Day after day and the message became clearer. News of a movie but then a live taping with the original cast. I couldn't wait. Up close made all the lyrics more amazing. The story was better than I recalled. Outstanding performances. I truly loved it.,

46,4 July 2020,jennfinn,10, Love It !!,I fell in love with Hamilton a few years ago when my daughter was obsessed with the soundtrack and played it all the time in the car. Unfortunately I never got to see it on Broadway and by the time it came to Philadelphia the original cast was long gone. Instead of making big elaborate movie versions of musicals that usually suck they should take a page from Hamilton. I have a huge crush on Daveed Diggs and he owned the stage when he was both Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson. Jonathan Groff is unforgettable as the evil King George of England. I also love Chris Jackson as General George Washington.,
47,5 July 2020,darrenbjones,10," Powerful, brilliant, inspiring, essential viewing.","It's been said that nothing kills the experience of live theatre like filming it; indeed many of Andrew Lloyd Webber's filmed stage productions can be held up as testament to this. Lin Manuel Miranda's Hamilton however bucks that trend. Filmed over three nights with additional close ups filmed without an audience, this feels like perfect blend of movie and stage performance.
Based on Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton, you don't have to be a history buff to enjoy the story. Hamilton is an idealist who was also his own worst enemy, yet despite this, his ideals helped shape the United States of America. The music tells his story and the performances sparkle.
When you look at the cost of great seats to see this live, coupled with the knowledge that you're unlikely to ever see the original cast again, this alone is worth an annual subscription to Disney +.
It's powerful, fun, entertaining, thought provoking and moving all at the same time. Essential viewing.",

I had seen Hamilton in the theatre twice previous to watching the professional shot, and let me tell you, it is truly the next best thing.

His insecurity was always there as many other Americans who are questioned and judged. The actors were so talented. I had chills while watching this and cried.

Now I know! It is an amazing production so very cleverly done. It brings history to life and makes it interesting and appealing to a younger audience which I greatly applaud. However, I can't help but think this is the American attempt at their version of Les Mis. I'll forgive them for that, nothing comes close to Les Mis but it's certainly a story to behold told in the most fabulous way. I couldn't get it out of my head and that speaks volumes so I set to researching Hamilton and his family afterwards. What a remarkable man he was.

83,3 July 2020,downthehobbitholeblog,10, Amazing- Parents Should Know...,"The most in demand musical is now streaming on demand. Hamilton follows the founding of the United States through the War of Independence and foundational historical events up to 1804 through the perspective of Alexander Hamilton. The musical really packs a musical punch, there's really no dialogue outside of the songs and they combine your typical broadway music with rap, hip-hop, and jazz. Although the musical is about events that are centuries old, it's incredibly relevant to today. Lin-Manuel Miranda says ""This is a story about America then, told by America now."" An engaging powerhouse of a musical that really dives in to the human experience in an incredible and educational way.
Like many other broadway musicals, it deals with hard life issues and is not appropriate for younger viewers. Parents should be aware that the film earns the PG-13 rating mostly through cursing and sexual innuendo.

The cast is phenomenal, Diggs, Soo and Groff especially. It makes capturing a complex stage musical look simple when it's anything but - I've never seen a filmed staging done so well, it genuinely captures the feel of attending a live performance but supplemented with just the right amount of close ups and aerial shots.

The live show provides you with a lot more in terms of viewing, as the cast are constantly performing during the set which you don't get to see on Disney+ version (Camera focus on main characters within scene). I have to admit, when I was 1st introduced to Ham, I was not sure but I am now true fan.

About a quarter into watching my husband came home and I looked at him and said this is special you gotta see this, he said he wasn't interested but sat down to play on his phone, read emails, etc but when I looked up at him several minutes later he was transfixed watching it, so even the most cynical musical hating dude couldn't keep from watching and enjoying it.

Or even to anyone that needs to escape from their own reality and be immersed in a world of pure brilliance.

132,11 July 2020,canonica-rocky,10, There should be an 11th star for this musical,I can't even begin to describe how good this is. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius and every cast member chosen couldn't have done a better job. My family and I have watched this non stop since July 3rd. Thank you Disney + this has been much needed,
133,13 July 2020,chrisst-33817,10," A Nonstop Display of Awe, Wonder, Theater Magic, and History!","Hamilton is a wonderful modern telling of an important historical figure. What makes the film incredible is the jaw-dropping performances, the incredibly entertaining set design and costumes, the impecable story-telling through rap, and the addicting music. I had listened to the album WAY before I was able to see the musical, so I had an idea of what to expect. However, the musical was nothing like what I expected. It exceeded all my preconceived notions about the film. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a master at his craft and I hope that his future films are at least as good as Hamilton. Please watch this film to be entertained and to learn some history! HIGHLY recommend.",
134,3 July 2020,larshoeijmans,10, Great musical for people who don't like musicals,"I have a love/hate relationship with musicals. I absolutely love The Lion King, Les Mis and Hamilton, and absolutely hate everything else. I know, it's weird. My sister is a theater kid, and used to blast Hamilton back in 2016. This is how I was introduced to Hamilton. At first I was annoyed, but the hiphop influences interested me in so I started to listen Hamilton by myself. Back then the only musical that I even tolerated was The Lion King. I fell in love with the music and the story. It made me want to visit the show. I have been to The Lion King multiple times and loved it each time, it's actually a huge part of my youth. But living in Europe, I couldn't just go out and buy a ticket for Hamilton. Instead I waited. And after 4 years of waiting, I was finally able to experience Hamilton in full. And let me tell you: it was worth it.",

Being on the other side of the world it never cross my mind i will be watching it. And this things barely make it out to where i am, specially not unless is dubbed... which probably will be a Catastrophe.
So when i heard Lin-Manuel Miranda saying it will be released on Disney+ I couldn't believe it. Thank you for that.",
136,18 September 2020,Dannov747,4," Watching Hamilton, I felt like a millionaire","... But I'm not. So maybe thats why I didn't get what was so special about this. I mean, unlike a lot of people who didn't like Hamilton, I was not turned off by the diversity or rap music in this musical. This is obviously a modern take on Hamilton, and for the most part that works quite well. However, I'm not going to declare Hamilton as perfection purely due to the diversity of its cast and music. It seems like coastal elitists have promoted this movie so much in part because of that - due to their virtue signalling and white guilt. Well, I've never used any of that as a basis to evaluate the quality of a musical. Rather, I consider the acting, the writing, the music, the production values, and the message.",
137,6 July 2020,gdhiskes,10, A omanticization of America's Founding Fathers or a message from Miranda?,A common critique of Hamilton has been that it's a disgraceful attempt to rewrite our history and romanticize our founding fathers as many of them were slaveowners. This article seeks to address this critique. Did Disney release this movie ahead of its original release date to address the divides in our country? Could Miranda actually be illustrating that America and our country is an unfinished symphony?,
138,6 July 2020,pedrometzker,10," Powerful, unique.","Broadway is a very exclusive place. There, acclaimed and historic plays are interpreted for some weeks and, most of the times, stay there. Rarely, they are filmed and distributed or interpreted to other publics. Hamilton came to change this, selling not the same experience of watching in the theater, but a very similar one. In the first minute, I was hypnotized. Since then, I didn't take my eyes from the screen. Is a charming film with two acts, one better than the other. The twist of the play is on the songs from GENIUS Lin Manuel Miranda, who wrote the lyrics and composed the melody. The score is a delicious blend of Hip-Hop, R&B and Jazz. Not happy with telling a story and creating songs that have a connection with which other, Miranda added a precise humor in the lyrics, in the right moments, that made me laugh a lot. Besides that, which is too much already, I will summarise other achievements: the costumes are out of this world; the lighting is accurate; the set, although simple and relatively small, is used with intelligence and creativity; the choreographies are fluid; is well filmed, capturing all the emotion and action; directed with a smart eye and performed by a great cast, flexible and competent. After using every adjective that I know, what I can say about Hamilton is that it is a valuable production. You can be sure that this movie is the start of a new trend in the cinema industry. Is a reason to congratulate the ones involved.",
139,4 July 2020,reidandphyl,10, Wow,Could never justify the price of the tickets. Can't imagine how incredible it would have been to see the original cast live. What an incredible production. Highly recommend everything about this. The music is incredible- just watch it.,

I see why now many have bought the album.....new timeless treasure! Singing and hip hop...not sure those who are not fans would be open to listen to the spoken words but, truly listen as poetic verses...writing is awesome!",
147,4 July 2020,fefeeley412,10, Profound in it's humanity.,"Hamilton - last night, I settled in to watch Hamilton and within moments, I was nodding my head along with the hip-hop-inspired musical.
I wasn't raised on Broadway. I am not familiar with a lot of musicals besides Phantom (which I've seen a million times) and Les Mis (about the same).
So that's my limited experience.
But this was mindblowing.
The complex lyrics - forcing me to pay attention to everything that was spoken or sung, held me breathless for the almost three-hour set.
The cast of characters from Alexander Hamilton to Aaron Burr, from Lafayette to George Washington was incredible.
Throughout the story you see the growing animosity between Hamilton and Burr fester.
Meanwhile, you see a very complicated man in Alexander Hamilton - you see his humanity.
You see him rise and you see his fall and everything in between.
From awe-inspiring moments to portions that made me laugh out loud, (Mrs. Washington naming her Tom Cat after Alexander Hamilton), and portions that made me weep (It's quiet uptown) I did not walk away from this unmoved.
""Forgiveness, can you imagine?"" was probably the holiest thing I've heard uttered in my entire 39 years of life. There was mercy, there that took my breath away.
Dealing with issues of war, slavery, immigration, and loyalty - this show was captivating.
Most of all - Lin Manuel Miranda drove home the point that historical figures such as Hamilton and others were very much human. In exposing their flaws, their great deeds shine ever more the brighter.
Gods' profundity is mundane. Human being's moments of profundity are sublime.
A true Tour De Force that was unique in its storytelling ability that kept me on the edge of my seat.",
148,4 July 2020,Walt48,10, Outstanding filming of an outstanding show.,"I saw this show on Broadway about 2 and a half years ago. This film version of the play is just the right combination of close and distant shots, capturing the feel of theater and combining it with the intimacy of film. I have been attending Broadway for a bit over 50 years now and this show is certainly in my top three. The material is outstanding, dancing, singing, history lesson. I know a film can never totally capture the experience of seeing a show live, but I have to say, this one comes as close as I think anyone is ever going to get.",

152,10 July 2020,khaycock,9, Something truly original & entertaining with the WOW factor,"Hamilton is a fantastic modern musical of which there was no hype about it in the UK - not that I noticed anyway.
It was something advertised on Disney + that I just decided to watch due to having time to kill because of the COVID-19 quarantine! ...but WOW. I was blown away, I'm English & knew nothing of American history (I do now).
I never knew who Hamilton was, so I went into this rather blindly and naively. This show somehow manages to do what other stage productions have not successfully achieved; make that leap to a film and be incredible, breathtaking and executed impeccably.
I was delighted by the modern rap, the casting, the jazz, the virtuosity of the actors, the rap battle (what a giggle in itself) the close up expressions (which you miss in a theatre & greatly enhanced by the expertise of the performers), the stage choreography & the humour. American humour doesn't usually bring a smile to my face, let alone make me laugh. Hamilton however, managed to break this pattern and had me giggling out loud all by myself.
Being English I had to write a review to let other Brits know how fantastic this film/show is & how it will entertain them too. Don't pass this up just cause you think it's going to be some boring US history stage show that won't quite make it, cause this is anything but that!
I never rate anything 10. Although I rated this 9/10, I must admit, I did deliberate scoring my first 10 over this show.
I recommend you watch this, you won't be disappointed. It's quite unlike anything I've seen before. Thoroughly entertained from start to finish. In fact it was so splendid, nothing I watch in the near future will come close to satisfying me half as much as Hamilton managed to achieve. Plus I learnt something through osmosis- :-)",

Patriotism is sacrifice. What we are asked to do today for our nation (wear a mask, social distance) pales in comparison to what our forefathers & foremothers sacrificed.

I was kind of nervous going into watching it because I was worried it might not live up to expectations but I had nothing to fear. The live vocals of most of the performers were somehow even better than they were on the cast recording, and seeing the staging made me appreciate certain songs more than I ever had in the past.

Honestly I just watched it for the sole reason of proving that theory. It's not so foreign to me that Americans usually magnify things that are made about their history to huge proportions for no apparent reasons. All that said though, I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS WAS! The story itself is very interesting, and I'm saying this as a person who has almost no knowledge about that period of American history. I believe a runtime of 2 hours and 40 minutes is long for anything, but certainly not this. Entertaining, witty, weirdly romantic, sad, not shy, impressive and most importantly refreshing!

There are no non-musical moments here, all the scenes are songs. I believe it was extremely difficult to write the screenplay and even harder to perform to such perfection, but wouldn't it been more interesting if it was a historical film instead?
I'll admit that there's tons of risky stunts here, which I wonder how many times they had to practice before doing them live. The songs are pretty fun and cachy, there's also decent humor added in.
Still it's just another musical. Other musicals like Baby Driver, The Sound of Music and Dancer in the Dark are superior on almost everything, they manage to tell amazing story and use music and songs as plot element, not just singing and dancing at random moments, that's why ""generic"" musicals like Hamilton will never be as fun and interesting for me.",

I never understood how people could say something like a movie or musical could change their life but I have to admit this is life-changing. When I first started listening to the soundtrack in late 2016, it was after Prince, David Bowie, Glenn Frey and others passed away. Hamilton was the bright spot in an otherwise yuck year. Then this movie comes out- oh my God. To see the original Broadway cast and such an amazing production- it's beyond anything I've ever seen before. It's not perfect, but that's what makes it great. If you're a fan of '90s rap, broadway show tunes, or history, then this is for you. If I could give it a higher rating than 10 I would. Awesome in the true sense of the word!",
232,5 July 2020,JackRJosie,5, Forgive Me...,"Ah I'm sorry... I don't think this project deserves a 5. It is clearly a brilliant work of broadway... the amount of work and dedication that goes into a project like this blows my mind. Like seriously, the writing is brilliant, all the performers KILL it, and it's all great American History.
My problem is that I just don't love the music... it's a a musical, and for me to rate it high I would have to love the music. It isn't music that I could listen to. I liked probably a fourth of the music. Also, when your medium for telling a story is SOLELY music, it is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING to be able to understand the words, but many of the raps are nearly impossible to follow along with because they talk to so fast. This being said, some parts (mostly the beginning) were very hard to follow along with.
Great rapping though.
This just wasn't really my thing, if I saw it on stage I may feel differently towards it but... just not feeling it. Sorry.
But this is my dads second time seeing it... and he felt this way the first time and loved it the second time. So i may revisit in a few years.",
233,8 July 2020,kasey-albayati,10, Everything I wanted and more,"I want to start this review by letting everyone know I have seen this show twice in person and it never ceases to blow me away. I was unable to watch this original cast live and in person, but thank you Disney for giving us this gorgeous piece of theater.",
234,16 June 2021,ironhorse_iv,9, I was mostly satisfied with this musical that turn the world upside down. It was a good watch.,"From its 2015 opening at off Broadway. The interesting new take musical by Lin Manuel Miranda about American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton received grand acclaim from both critics and audiences. The historical hip hop sung and rapped through show became so popular that for its several month-engagement, the event was always sold out. Because of that, those like myself whom were unlucky to find tickets had to wait years to witness that story. In 2020 that day finally arrived as Disney gain a live stage recording of the show. Rather than put that copy in theaters during the pandemic, they wisely put the viewing through their video on demand streaming service. It was an instant success as it became one of the most watched straight to streaming title of that year. While I was somewhat disappointing that it was just a three normal stage recording that happens to be stitch up together by editor Jonah Moran and director Thomas Kail rather than a sweeping new epic film full of extravagant real-life locations, expansive special effects and a large ensemble cast. The piece is certainly no cheaply done camcorder recording of a bare stage community theatre production. In the course of over three days of shooting, the movie captured the visual lighting and choreography very well. To add onto that, it was very well edited. The only clue that the movie was filmed from multiple shows was how Eliza Hamilton (Phillipa Soo) hair look between certain scenes. Yet it's really not that noticeable. I also dig that the movie more perspective. The overhead bird eye shot is one of them. It really works to show the out of body's experience of key moments in the play. 'Hamilton' as well feature some impressive turntables that rotate the stage floor that cleverly function to give a deeper meaning to the historical musical. It allows two scenes to play out at the same time symbolize the literally and mentally duel oppositive nature of the characters on stage; while the camera and the performers mostly remain stationary. If there was movement, the turntables gave a very surrealism visual moment of fate. One such example is the eye of the hurricane and the rewind sequence of the wedding told in the point of view of supporting character Angelica Schuyler (Renee Elise Goldsberry). Choreographer Andy Blankenbueller deserves a lot of credit for these amazing footwork movement on these turntables. Another cool thing that I notice after rewatching was how the stage's scaffolding represented the building of America. The brick work gets taller and larger as the play goes on. The background ensembles were also clever easter eggs. I like how one of them Ariana DeBose plays a key symbolism figure that always foreshadow death without once having an official title. Nonetheless, perhaps the greatest thing about this show is the theme of dual acting! The fact that nearly all of 'Hamilton' supporting performers plays multiply roles is awesome. It adds so much depth to the production. Especially full of energy and natural charismatic Daveed Diggs taking the role of friend and foe Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de La Fayette. Although some of the dual acting can be a bit awkward such in the case as actor Anthony Ramos performing as a small child after a good showing as John Laurens. The way he acts as Phillip, kinda makes it look the son was mentally challenged. To add onto that, the actual homosexuality rumors about Hamilton and Laurens being lovers also kinda hurts Ramos performance as Phillip, as viewers might forget that he's playing a new character. The relationship could come across as incest. As for the performers playing one title character. I have to say Leslie Odom Jr (Aaron Burr), Christopher Jackson as George Washington, Lin Manuel Miranda (Alexander Hamilton) and a cameo of Jonathan Groff returning as King George III really made this show worth a watch. As for the fact that a multiracial cast are playing the mostly white forefathers. I found the few mocking moments of outdated white stereotypical mostly harmless. It's certainly not as bad as the majority of whitewashing practices happening throughout the history of Hollywood. Yet I do get why some people think of the choice as racebending. It does seem like a gimmick. Still in the end although the play was based on historical events and people, using some dramatic license to rewrite history like that to hook modern audiences in was truly unique. Miranda did a good job making it entertaining. He adapted out certain key characters that would overtake the spotlight or hurt the pacing. Another thing Miranda did is make those who surround Hamilton's ideas a lot clearer; which in real life are a lot more questionable such in the case toward slavery and war, but perhaps the biggest historical inaccurate has to be the events that leading up to the famous duels. In real life, there was a lot more hesitation. Regardless I did like the uses of foreshadowing as counting to ten is the same melody used in previous songs. Talking about music. I love the different styles from 1960s British Invasion pop, standard epic rap battles of history to slam poetry. Too bad George Clinton's like funk wouldn't be incorporate into the play without disrupting the narrative. The break the fourth wall moments were also clever like Jefferson handing out a pamphlet even if it was future president James Monroe that led the investigation that almost cause a duel with Hamilton. A duel that was only prevented by of all people, a little more ambitious and less villainous Burr. Indeed ""Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story"". It really shows in the portrayals of characters regardless of history. Nevertheless, this play is lot better than '1776' and 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson' big time. Overall: Don't throw away your shot! Go see this musical. It's really good. If you had. You'll be back for sure! It's worth a rewatch.",

It's 2hrs40mins long with intermission but, I gave up after 40 minutes! The staging and choreography resemble a high school production; it's relentlessly busy and completely empty. It's a filmed record of an over-hyped, over-priced Broadway musical featuring an undistinguished score in which all the songs sound alike and are equally trite. Hamilton played to sold out audiences and garnered a lot of a media attention yet it didn't produce a single notable song. The costumes are authentic enough and some of the voices are good but, posturing replaces acting and the result is instantly forgettable. As Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda is just adequate; he is weak in both voice and stage presence. Hamilton is not worth your time. Time will be kinder to our founding fathers than to Hamilton, which will not be revived decade after decade like West Side Story, Chicago, Cabaret, The Sound of Music and Gypsy. The streamed version which has sparked outrage is a recording of 3 stage performances edited together and is only nominally a movie.",

Some of the songs sound exactly the same as others in the show and the main character, Hamilton, does not have a great voice. I've heard worse voices, but his voice is not one I would pay $200 to see. I found all the females in the show to be great singers and have very distinct personalities, while the show made the male characters all seem evil and bad.

Here is a summary of 3 reasons why Hamilton was a bad musical:
1. The Plot: there is no plot
2. The raps/songs: the raps & songs are the entire script! It works if there are a couple songs here and there in a musical such as in Jersey Boys. What does not work is when there is dialogue here and there and the entire script is rapping and singing.
3. The timeline in this musical does not exist: I spent the entire movie trying to figure out what the heck I was watching, and what was happening!",

His voice was one of the worst voices I have heard from a musical. However, Leslie Odom, Burr, has one of the best voices I have heard from a musical. My second problem with the production is how historically liberal they were with the story of Hamilton's life. It really made me mad how John Adams was barely mentioned and only mentioned negatively. Adams and Hamilton were 2 of the leaders of the Federalist Party. It wasn't until Adams became President that the 2 separated and tore the party in 2 factions.
King George was the best part of the play. In a play portraying so many founding fathers, it is sad that a British monarch was the best part.",
297,26 May 2022,bnewman-81938,2, NOT AT ALL WORTH THE HYPE!,"As with most folks submitting their opinions here in IMDB, I'm not an expert nor professional in any phase or area of moviemaking or play production, with the exception of one critical area...I am a consumer of the product...a member of the audience! With my fellow members, I pay to be entertained, and sometimes we pay a lot in money and time. We audience members are the ONLY folks qualified to pass judgement on a movie or, as in this case, a ""play-movie."" Along with fellow members, I know what I like and what I don't I know when I'm being entertained, and when I'm not. And, I know when the product lives up to my expectations and when it doesn't. I assume the movie ""Hamilton"" is an accurate representation of the play as presented on the stage in NYC, and what I see in the movie is what I would see if I attend the play. I'm glad I didn't spend the money nor the time to see the play, so it follows that I didn't like the movie, either. It's difficult, and just a little unfair, to critique the movie without critiquing the play. Movie-wise, I found myself working hard to keep pace with the movements of the characters and understand the meanings of their movements, individually and in groups. Harder still was the effort needed to understand the dialogue between characters due to the rapid-fire style of speaking. I noticed the focus of my attention was often pulled away from key performers, due to other uninvolved performers milling about in the shadows. Lighting, in the movie anyway, was nothing to write home about, and scenes often appeared dark and murky. The entire movie lacked the energy and ""spark"" I expected to see, given the subject matter. Overall, the production seemed draggy and sluggish, at times, in spite of ""fast talk."" The music was a disappointment, at best, for the subject! And, dance segments often lacked the snap and crisp synchronized movements expected of a musical on a NYC stage! Once I worked my way around the tremendous hype created by talented promoters, I found the play fell far short of expectations. Therefore, the movie also fell short of what was expected and anticipated. I felt that, in the end, the ""play-movie,"" ""Hamilton"" failed to properly tell the story it set out to tell. If you compare the STYLE of the musical ""Hamilton"" with the STYLE of a musical such as ""The Greatest Showman,"" it's very easy to see that the style of ""Greatest Showman"" does a much better job of telling a story and relating to the audience than ""Hamilton"" could ever hope to do. And, the style of storytelling used in ""Greatest Showman"" is far more entertaining and engaging than the style attempted in ""Hamilton"".",

While there were some contemporary nods to contemporaneous injustices such as slavery, the film was more of a lively history lesson than the politically-correct revisionist iconoclasty that I half-expected. The music is fast-paced, driving, wittily rhymed, and memorable (although no instant earwigs like 'A Spoon Full of Sugar' - hear once, whistle for the rest of your life).

The first surprise from this showing, Lin-Manuel Miranda was the worst one on the stage. The cast was awesome, except for him. He was the creator but should've put somebody else in the lead. The other thing that turned me off was the not so subtle jabs at the political party that Lin-Manuel Miranda doesn't like. There were plenty. The final thing that turned me off was the revisionist history in this show. I don't want to say none of it was true, but it was definitely someone's version of what they thought. Kind of like Jerry Krause taking credit for the Bulls winning 6 titles. Sorry Michael Jordan in hoops, and George Washington(and even Aaron Burr) in history would disagree. The US history classes I took barely mentioned Hamilton. He was definitely there. As were countless others than formed our country.

354,23 July 2020,censorshipbites,3," For all the hype and fanfare, you'd think this musical was actually good","First off, I can go either way on musicals. I love Les Miz and Sound of Music but have absolutely no interest in seeing LaLa Land. With that in mind, Hamilton was mediocre at best. The best songs were those by King George, decent work was done by George Washington; many lines by Hercules Mulligan were entirely unintelligible. Audience clapping between each musical number was also unsettling.
As for historical accuracy, let's take one scene:
Lafayette and Hamilton: ""Immigrants, we get the job done!"" [Crowd: woohoo!]
The annoying crowd cheer might be attributed to political sentiments (the musical was filmed in 2016). Regardless, the line is historically ignorant since neither was an immigrant. Even though several US states granted Lafayette honorary citizenship, he returned home to France after the Revolutionary War and remained an officer in the French military (when captured fleeing the French Revolution by Austria, he tried using his US ""citizenship"" but given his French rank no one bought it). Hamilton was a British subject who simply moved from one British colony to another (just as someone moving from NY to NJ isn't an immigrant).
King George's songs and the love songs were traditional musical fare; many of the rap/spoken word numbers were undecipherable. You can learn as much about the American revolution while watching this musical as you can WWII while watching Inglorious Bastards.",

I wish they played around with the beats given, added some variation to it. Im loving the diversity, but I did find it odd when some historically white characters had black actors. The historical inaccuratcy of the play gave me a unsettling and confused feeling. For a fanfiction, it's really great and unique with a new spin on history.

So on one side, there's no denying the amount of work and effort that went into this picture. The energy level, costuming and lively presentation all make for a richly entertaining experience for those who enjoy this type of spectacle. On the other hand, retooling history with an agenda of diversity doesn't sit well with this viewer, so it was difficult to maintain any semblance of an attention span.

The closest I can think of is maybe Stomp? In its unique expression of music and theatre. But it doesn't even come close. I love so much that all the characters are played by people of colour, when you see a black George Washington come out, you know things are going to be different. The music and rap itself combined with something so distant and different from that style in the founding history of America just mind boggles me. It reminds me of other creative combinations people try with food, in your head you think, naaaah that will never work, then you try it and you know what.... that is actually really good. Not only has the Hamilton team pulled off something completely unprecedented, but they've put near on ten or so songs into my wife's and I's head for the last few days. These songs are literally so catchy, how does Lin-Manuel come up with such catchy tunes? It's amazing when you realise the other work he has also done across movies like Moana. This man is so talented and he picked a very talented team. All the main cast are such great singers and dancers, there is no weak point. Almost all the cast are extremely funny and able to draw you in with such great emotion. I never thought I would get so much enjoyment out of learning about the early beginnings of America and how they came to form their government. I would recommend watching this with subtitles as its very hard to follow all the words without it. Its hard to know if going to the theatre to see this would be any better - I really appreciated being able to watch it up close, great sound, with the original cast, with subtitles, that compared to watching it in London or New York with a different cast, no subtitles, potentially making it harder to hear would've actually been any better.

For starters, I'm not a big fan of rap or hip-hop, and I'm pretty sure at some point in my life I made some old man statement about that stuff ""not being real music."" Since I heard that most of the music in Hamilton was inspired by those genres, I was fairly confident this wouldn't be for me, despite the fact that I typically love musicals. Then there's the over-abundance of gushing that people have done about the show and its music for 5 years, including a huge uptick in conversation months before this release. I heard stories of people willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for tickets, and still struggling to get a seat. With that kind of hype it's inevitable that the actual production can't possibly live up to expectations. Friends of mine had even found their way to a touring version of the show, and told me they felt ripped off for having paid that kind of money for the show they got. At this point, I had pre-determined in my head that this movie would be overrated, and I was loading up both barrels to unleash a storm of hate on it.

It's the reimagined story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton. This became a Broadway hit, a cultural sensation, a signpost of racial diversity, and makes Lin-Manuel an overnight sensation. It's the launching pad for his rise to fame. It's a concert film. At a minimum, it is an important time capsule of Broadway during this time. Concert films often spice things up with behind-the-scenes stuff and audience reactions. This film doesn't do that.

With that said, I'm very conflicted about this. Maybe it was because I don't know a lot about American History but none of it really stuck with me. The problem with non-stop music is you never have a chance to sit for 10 seconds and think about what the entire last song was talking about because you're already onto the next song. I can see how people love this and I can see how it has created such a fanbase around it. Partially because the music is good and partially because it is almost a satirical take on America's Founding fathers. Casting them all as non-white people while keeping much of their ideologies. Still... it just didn't stick with me in the way I was hoping it would. I absolutely adored the music but 160 minutes of non-stop singing... for me it just eventually became all the same. The dance choreography was done very well and it's acted pretty well. Although the lead actor does drop the ball at times, and some of the rapping fell flat. I like how they broke the 180-degree line of film a couple of of times and I loved all the technical aspects of it but that was about it. I didn't get what was happening most of the time and I was bored by about an hour in and only got back into it in the last 30 minutes. Do I feel like I wasted my time? No. Would I watch it again? Also probably not. If nothing else though I hope this spawns more theatre productions being filmed and put on the big screen. I'm leaving this at a 6 right now.",

Lin-Manuel Miranda seems to have used Les Miserables as a template. Changing the music to rap works and allows for much more exposition but the melodies are pretty weak, so the use of musical themes to bring the audience quickly into a scene don't work as well as it does in Les Mis.
The story is the tale of an ambitious, vain, loudmouthed and unpleasant man. Hamilton does not seem likeable, so I don't care about him at all.

This extraordinary cinematic work is now steaming on the Disney Plus channel, and is without a doubt the greatest preservation of a Broadway show ever made, filmed at the Richard Rogers Theater in New York City in 2016 with the entire 26 member original cast. Creator, writer, and star Lin-Manuel Miranda delivers an absolutely brilliant and charismatic performance as Alexander Hamilton one of America's foremost founding fathers and it's first Secretary of the Treasury. This energetic musical details Hamilton's life and how various historical characters influenced his life such as president George Washington, sensationally played by Chris Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, astonishingly played by Daveed Diggs who also plays Marquis de Lafayette, and holds the record for the fastest rap on Broadway, for rapping 19 words in three seconds, and of course Hamilton's arch-rival Aaron Burr, magnificently played by Leslie Odom, Jr. who won the Tony Award for Leading Actor in Musical for his show-stopping performance. Other noteworthy turns includes the lovely Phillipa Soo who delivers a heartfelt performance as Hamilton's beloved wife Eliza, Renee Elise Goldsberry as her sister Angelica Schuyler in an impressive performance that won her the Tony Award for Featured Actress in a Musical, and in an terrific performance the vastly talented Anthony Ramos in the dual role of John Laurens and Hamilton's son Philip Hamilton. Special kudos to Jonathan Groff for his hilarious scene-stealing performance as King George which is a laugh riot.

Hamilton was a musical that started in 2015 and was a huge critical and financial success and in 2020 was given a film release (basically a live performance) on Disney+. I have never been to a viewing of Hamilton or really even expressed any real desire to watch Hamilton until I watched it in a History class. Hamilton is based off of a 2004 biography titled Alexander Hamilton. Of course, I have not read the biography. The musical most notably stars Lin Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton (I personally don't think it would be fair to refer to him as the title character) and also wrote the music, wrote the play, and produced the play.",

Now having seen Hamilton for the first time I have one flaw that keeps it from being perfect. The GD sound mixing. There were multiple instances where the sound was muffled and I could barely hear what was being said. This happens a good bit mostly in the first act. I will definitely watch it again, but whoever mixed the sound was either working with what he was given or really didn't care. Maybe the early release put him on a time crunch.

And that is also one of the main reasons why this is such an entertaining musical to watch: everything is balanced. As a language enthousiast and English major, I also admired the mastery of the English language that is carried out here, and especially the playfulness with which this is done. On top of that: the acting is marvelous, the actors all have an amazing voice, and they do some interesting things with the lights. It just works. For me. I can understand it is not everyone's cup of tea. Musicals might not be everyone's thing, and the almost non-stop singing/rapping might not resonate with everyone's interests.

There is absolutely no character development. The story is boring, too long, and too verbose, the rapping makes it extremely difficult to follow and the beats are terrible. The people rapping aren't very good, Miranda being the worst of them. His rapping and singing are god-awful and he ruined character by casting himself instead of putting in a performer who was on par with the rest of the cast. The all minority cast is purely a gimmick for attention and ticket sales to distract the audience from how monotonous the show actually is. This story is boring, no matter what race the cast is. If I'm going to see an all-minority cast, I want to see a true minority story. That would've been much more earnest and compelling, in my opinion. The women in the show have absolutely no identity beyond how much they all love Hamilton, even though I feel they were the best part of the show, performance-wise. Their songs are some of the few redeemable points of the show. I also liked Washington and King George's performances, but even King George got boring after a while because there was literally no variation in his song each time he came out. If this is supposed to be a Les Mis-inspired show, I'd say it's garbage comparatively since Les Mis is my favorite musical of all time.

508,4 September 2020,xiaoli7377,9, Hip-Hop and Dead Presidents,"Who would have thought that a hip-hop musical about a nearly forgotten founding father would grow to become such a pop culture phenomenon?

We are lead through his life through the exposition of different famous historical figures and through different genres of song and dance. It's very unique and it's quite a spectacle to behold.",
509,23 July 2020,martinblancoireneimb,1," Innacurate, disrespectful and anti-black","Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote a story about himself, only replacing his figure with that of Hamilton. The only problem as that if he included slavery or the massacre of indigenous people, well, it wouldn't exactly be as palatable, right? At least not to white people.
The music is good, really good if you can look past some of the lyrics, and the choreography is excellent, but that's kind of what we expect from a Broadway show, and those two things definitely can not be used to counter all of its flaws.
At its core, having idealising the founding fathers is anti-black. Having a cast that is not white perform does not change the fact that they are still portraying these historical figures. It's not fiction, its a historical show. It does not even present itself as a retelling of the story, but as the story, as it happened.
Slavery is mentioned only a few times, and it is used only to remind the audience that Hamilton was totally opposed to it, even though it is a lie. The only real abolitionist mentioned in the whole show is John Laurens. When I first heard it, I, too, fell for it. I was obsessed, the only thing that annoyed me was the whole Angelica Schuyler unreciprocated love thing Lin decided to add for some reason. I was annoyed that John Laurens was dismissed as a gay man and only mentioned as Hamilton's dear friend who died. But besides that? I would sing it at the top of my lungs. Jefferson's songs were my favourite and I legitimately did not see a problem with the lyrics ""Sally be a lamb, darlin', won'tcha open it?"" when Jefferson receives a letter. This was Sally Hemings, an enslaved teenager. The girl picked after his wife died. The girl he raped, who was forced to bear his children time after time. That might be the most extreme instance of Lin's lyrics being disrespectful (to put it lightly), but in general, everything Jefferson says that is supposed to be 'hypocritical' (e.g.: ""I can't believe that we are free"", after defeating the British but while still relying on slavery to sustain their economy and lifestyle) is not presented as such, or when it is (Hamilton calling Jefferson out during the first Cabinet Battle) is, once again, used to point out how good Hamilton was, even though he married into one of the wealthies slave-owning families and he himself traded slaves. This is a man who documented everything, who wrote and wrote and wrote until every single idea in his mind was also printed on paper. If he had been an abolitionist, we would know. If he had been an abolitionist, he would have made sure the three thousand enslaved men who fought alongside his friend would have been freed, as it had been promised, instead of being returned to their masters. There are many more problems with this show, of course, but the idealisation of these historical figures (Washington is literally just the great general, an even greater father figure to both Hamilton and the nation, such a nice guy, 10/10) is immoral.
Another, lesser problem, for me would be the fact that it also presents and reinforces the idea that anyone who works hard, no matter their situation, will rise to the top. That's why Lin wrote it, that's why Obama and many others relate to it. Hamilton was intelligent and lucky. His ability to learn languages and improve his writing was that of a genius. People paid for him to get to the continent and he quickly gained fame because he was smart and had a silver tongue. While he worked his ass off for the things he got, a fact that no one can deny, so did those around him. He was loud and confrontational and openly against the revolution, little fact that simply inst mentioned in the musical. He was basically that Samuel Seabury figure that is later relentlessly mocked and didn't change his mind until meeting Laurens and other revolutionists. Back to Washington. Charles Lee was a good general and in the position to make calls such as 'hey there's a bazillion British troops let's maybe not die', he might have made mistakes in battle but in this musical, he is framed as a lousy general, a villain used, once again, to highlight just how good Hamilton and Washinton are.
I'll stop here, but I hope more people, especially those in positions of power, understand how this show is problematic and harmful.
The ensemble are great actors and I would totally recommend checking out their musical and acting careers ('Blindspotting' and 'Monsters and Men' are great movies), but this musical is simply unsalvageable. I understand that, for a story to be compelling, you cant include crude facts such as massacres and injustice on such a scale, but since it is how things were, Lin should have known that, rather than erasing and omitting so much pain and suffering and altering facts as he pleased, he should have simply not made this musical. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.",
510,4 July 2020,poleypup,2, Easily the second best musical about the founding fathers,"Overall it is not very impressive, and way overhyped. The writer feels a need to denigrate other more well known founding fathers in order to prop up his guy. It mocks John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, without whom there wouldn't have been a Declaration of Independence to begin with. Even Washington seemed to be clueless unless the great Alexander Hamilton was advising him. It's very New York centric which probably explains why it's so popular on Broadway.
Musically, I guess it was ok but not really anything I would normally listen to.

513,12 December 2022,cortlynbrown-09242,7, Interesting but Inaccurate,"I am usually uninterested in most early American history due to it being regurgitated regularly throughout my school years. However, Lin Manuel Miranda knows how to write very interesting and inviting songs that captivate attention well. They share an emotional story of a protagonist that is neither wholly good or wholly bad. It is an accurate representation of all founding fathers, they make human mistakes (sometimes larger atrocities) and its important we recognize them for everything they are. I do dislike the historical inaccuracy in some parts of the story. I think that if a young person were to learn American history from the musical Hamilton, they would essentially have a bias, since the whole thing is written through a perspective of the protagonist. It is not a good or accurate way to learn about how our founding fathers set up our country. Still, tracks are fire.",

548,3 December 2021,ronin-88,7, Historical accuracy meets fine drama in this filmed play.,"This is actually a filmed stage play and not a movie. The beginning is filled with tedious exposition. I have studied that era of American history and this was more dull than some of my textbooks. But, the play becomes more riveting as it goes on. The powerful musicality and lyrical finesse are evident from the beginning and as the play gets more into the human nature and depth of the chracters, it becomes very entertaining and moving. The only problem I had was that while Manuel Lin Miranda's talent and artistry are unmatched, he is not as charismatic and handsome as Alexander Hamilton is supposed to be. It is pointed out in the story many times how attractive he is and yet he seems less attractive than Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson, and even King George III. This distracts from my suspension of disbelief in an otherwise compelling story.",
549,26 July 2020,keithbolton,7, Falls between film and theatre.,"Regardless of the quality or nature of the play itself, as a movie this sucks.
One of the joys of live performance is seeing the wide view as well as focussing in on an individual. Attending Opera and musical theatre is all about feeling the energy of the live performance. Its not about perfect notes and multiple takes to splice together to get the definitive take. Movies allow a director to do just that - take multiple views/play/mix/merge and create something that you cant do in a single take on a single set.
This release manages to take miss the important parts of both genres and create a simplistic reproduction of live event. A bit like that poster of a famous painting you had in your student dorm.
When the director moves in for a close up, you find you lose view of what's happening in the background. The crowd obviously enjoy it, but as a viewer a further step removed, that live electricity is lost. If you cant see it live, then this is as decent substitute. If youve seen it and want to relive it - fine.It does the job well.",

So the first time I went in blind and during the first couple of songs I was a bit confused and amused. But then I was completely drawn in by the great story, characters, songs and incredible choreography. It has emotion, references, fight, tenderness, unfairness, politics, madness, death and revenge.

This production isn't for the pearl-clutchers, nor the traditional hoity toity art snobs who don't see this as ""real"" art. It's also not for people who don't like hip hop.

Good art needs to provoke thought and emotion, for you to really care about it. I felt bored outside some of the better numbers.The novelty of the the racially prejudiced cast will surely wear off over time, so I'm not exactly sure what Hamilton will hang it's hat on in the coming years.

I am not a fan rap at all however, and wouldn't have minded if there had been less...it's hard to keep up with all of it without subtitles when they are rapping so much throughout. Also, there is a LOT of profanity...strong profanity and way more than I would have anticipated and this isn't something my kids could watch based on that alone. It just seems so pointless to me...and the scene where Hamilton cheats on his wife has some pretty suggestive lyrics and dancing. I'm not a prude, but this could have been a little more family friendly and still been just fine. Also, I know the show wants to be as inclusive as possible, but it's hard to imagine 99% of these these historical characters as being African American etc when we know that wasn't the case...maybe that's what they were going for, but I would prefer it to be at least a little more historically accurate on that part. I applaud the inclusiveness, but they could have mixed it up a bit more. Worth a watch once...maybe again a few years down the road, but it's not at the top of my favorites list.

On the other hand, it is just a stage show filmed and put together with closeups to gain a little more out of the performances and add something extra. No matter what you'd like to call it, you cannot disagree that the show is one heck of a ride.
""Hamilton"" is a musical about Alexander Hamilton, one of the United States founding fathers, but also one who's legacy was once forgotten. Lin-Manuel Miranda turned the true story into a stage musical, where he is playing the title character. I heard about the show when I was studying drama at a school back in 2016, which was there I truly fell in love with the music. I didn't know so much about the story nor any of the characters, but I found myself listening happily to the songs and tried to figure out how it looked with people. Yesterday, my friend and I decided to see the ""film"" and I was blown away. I finally had images to the endearing songs. I was sucked into it, and before I knew it was over. Three hours had past and I was emotionally touched and excited about it.
First of all, the performances are just truly amazing. Miranda is far from the strongest, however, he still embodies the character with a lot of souls. Though he mostly shines through in the second act, whereas in the first he felt a little stiff. Leslie Odom Jr. plays the other lead, Aaron Burr, and he's fairly better and gives such a heartbreaking performance. Jonathan Groff is probably the best it can get. His performance as King George is somewhat outstanding. Those moments he's on stage he just owns the whole god-damn show. His mimic and body movements are perfect and match his character greatly. Also, everybody's singing is right on key. No one in the entire show does a bad job at singing.
Phillipa Soo is incredible. I will not spoil anything, but if you haven't heard nor seen this thing already you should. It's the obvious one of the greatest theatrical performances by anyone I've ever seen (and I am a theatre kid, I've done acting for more than a decade). It is so heartbroken, words can't describe the talent she has.
I think it's really hard to talk about ""Hamilton"" as a film because it isn't. The stage production is great, it has very excellent choreography and performances as I mentioned. The whole show flows with a nice pace and creative and cool transitions. I wish I someday can see a production of ""Hamilton"" with this amount of talent.",

I was intrigued from beginning to end.",

Don't throw away your shot at seeing this epic musical!!",

She chose not to tell me it was both. During the live show, my jaw rarely left the floor. I knew the general Hamilton story but the depth in the story here was immense. In the film version it was all that and more - close ups! Home sound system! Pause and rewind options! Ability to finely define the lyrics! I am obsessed and can't get enough.

630,15 December 2020,poliwhirl-213-266201,10," Superb, lives up to the hype","Funny, clever, catchy, quotable, highly watchable...
I originally watched the bootleg that a friend had lent me. Even though the sound and image were bad I was completely drawn in right from the first song. My TV viewing attention span is generally around half an hour max, but I watched the first part in one go.
After familiarising myself with the soundtrack, watching any stray videos on YouTube and downloading the Hamilton app in the hope of winning one of the free tickets, I started hearing the rumours about the movie version on Disney of all places.
The very morning it was released on Disney I was up practically at the crack of dawn subscribing, and the next thing, watching the whole thing in bed. Finally proper visuals and sounds, and close ups! Leslie Odom Jr's expression at the end of the first song is amazing: ""I'm the damn fool that shot him"".
And it just gets better from then on.
I'm not a great musical or history fan but this musical is a cultural landmark and the movie not only does it complete justice but also consoles all of us who never got to see the real thing. Superb.",

It made me feel like a member of an audience seeing it live, expect seeing it far more accessibly in terms of money and locations.

As with everything, from human to human, we all hear different music. America, in it's likeness to music itself, has no official language, no official key, tempo, timescale, and, most importantly, we all experience it differently. What Lin-Manuel Miranda has done with ""Hamilton"" is capture a story seldom told, and told it with a passion that can be applied to all facets of life, in a language few give due credit to. Hamilton, himself, is a concrete example of how to determine exactly what is worth fighting for; be it his future, his family, his friends, his life, or his country, he's always making that decision.",
646,9 September 2020,duffasaurus,8, Surprisingly Fun,"I had heard of this musical for years and even though I like musicals I just thought it would be super boring. I'm not a fan of historical fiction and assumed this would be awful. Surprisingly it's a lot a lot of fun, the songs are really catchy and I found that I was really enjoying myself. As a movie it isn't incredible, but there are plenty of films that get high ratings just because of special effects, plot or acting so I guess I can rate this highly based on really enjoying the music. The acting is okay, nothing special. The story is good, mostly accurate but obviously taking some artistic license. The lighting and cinematography are mostly great but there's some times I wondered why the camera was so close to a person's face and wished I could see the other actors. The singing is phenomenal. Overall I really enjoyed watching it and l listen to the soundtrack when I cut the grass now. That being said I think this is one musical that would benefit a lot by being translated into an actual movie with proper sets and locations.",

The pacing in it is very good, with equal amount of lighthearted story telling as there is sadness but theres also the sometimes much needed comic relief of George III. Lin did a phenomenal job with the script of the movie (which happens to all be songs) which in and of itself is an oscar worthy achievement, but then partnered eith the precise production effect of the movie of furniture, the set and people just makes it even better.

NO, cinema don't work like that, thinking in giving it 10 or 1 stars is just be part of the problem, this video (because I don't consider this a movie, maybe the most this can hope for is a TV representation) is just garbage like cinema, 4/10 only because is not a steady cam in the place of the audience (all the time, because IT IS A STEADY CAM in the place of the audience most of the time, like a thrash bootleg).

I enjoyed it like I enjoy jam scones. Problem is I was expecting some flaming bombe alaska; not because of all the hype though that surely played a part; but because that's what listening to Hip Hop normally feels like for me. Flaming Bombe Alaska, not jam scones.
I love the lyricism. It's clever, slick, powerful. Props to Miranda for writing some sweet bars to spit. Also, the use of leitmotif was well executed, if not subtle. And some of the choreography was pretty brilliant, especially the use of the 'turntable ring stage'. Awesome.
The music itself though. If you know someone who can't get over how great the Hamilton soundtrack is, who can rap every line of 'Alexander Hamilton'... I mean this in the nicest possible way but just picture that person in your mind for a while and ask this: on a scale of 1 to Dababy, how black are they?
I get that the founding fathers were in fact, white guys, and that hip hop in broadway is novel. But I think the musical arrangement seriously sounds like a white theatre geek tried to write hip hop and forgot to add any gangsta cause he was too busy eating jam scones. Where are the fat 808s that make my car seat vibrate? The trap runs that slap fire? The syncopated stabs/plucks coined in the 2000s that scream 'badass', or the repeated piano riff ala Eminem et al brimming with down-to-earth raw emotion? Nowhere.
Instead we get almost classical vocals from the main love interest; who did have a wonderful voice (perfect for the Sound of Music or Elsa from Frozen) but sounds so cringe when toplining over a pseudo-rap beat just 1 minute 30 into the first number.
Then there's the titular character himself. Why, Lin Manuel Miranda, did you think it was a good idea to cast yourself as the centrepiece of your own musical... did you seriously think your lack of vocal training wouldn't blatantly show amidst a FULL CAST OF BROADWAY SINGERS? 😭
Look, jam scones are nice. I really do enjoy them still. Hamilton is worth a watch. If you love it, props to you. Now go get some actual hip hop into your system!",

It's not just a film, but more than 2 hours and 30 minutes of a rich and diverse story about one of the founding fathers of America. A very important masterpiece in terms of American culture, this film is definitely worth a watch.
And like I said, it's the only film I feel bad about downloading off from a torrent because you'll never see, ever, any troupe of actors putting in that much an effort as Lin-Manuel Miranda and his team did in a span of more than 2 and a half hours of this film.",

703,19 January 2022,kefak-64879,7, 7\10,"Yesterday, a billion viewers tuned into the Disney+ channel to see the debut screening of Hamilton... the 2016 Broadway recording. Because it is not a traditional film-style musical, it is quite difficult to compare it to a regular film in this genre. It's also a movie whose enjoyment definitely depends on your age. I'm in my 50s, and I'm hardly at the age where I like hip-hop music in a musical. But despite this, I respect what the show was trying to achieve - bring American history to the masses and make it more accessible to minorities, since most of the roles were played by black and Hispanic actors and actresses. So while it's not historically accurate that George Washington and Aaron Burr are being played by black actors, it helps make the story more accessible, just like modern music does. And as a former history teacher, I'm in awe of these things, even if I didn't really like the singing. The film is worth seeing....and it's a good chance to celebrate some of the almost forgotten great Americans.",
704,18 January 2022,diannechosokabe,10, About the movie.,The songs are quite relatable. The story was quite interesting and fascinating.,
705,13 March 2022,kamilla-56559,10, Great way to represent the history,"I saw Hamilton both live in Richard Rodgers Theatre and recorded versions of it and definitely the live musical was more impressive. It is my favorite musical so far. I love all catchy music pieces, great stage choreography and creative ways to teach and present history to all of us that make us relive the lives of these characters.",
706,14 December 2022,imdadhussain-93387,10, Worthy to watch,"I would recommend to everyone to watch this movie on time in your life. If you are conscious about your life. What life teaches us is that no one in this world is perfect and if your are ashamed because you could not do any particular thing in your life. You must watch this movie at one time then you will feel that life is about consistency, it is not about your perfectness in everything. You just need to be good enough to courage yourself and more likely to continue your consistency and best part is you are struggling to get any goal in your life you dont need to be perfect. Be courage enough to reward yourself.",
707,19 January 2023,avabur,10, Best musical ever,"This musical is well written, fun, and historical. I am a huge fan of Lin Manuel-Marinda and regard him as one of the best musics artists ever. I have memorized every word to every song. I highly recommend this for your watching.",
708,21 January 2023,moniquedegreef,8, Very good musical film with great historical meaning,"I am not from America,but the Netherlands and I really loved this movie about Hamilton. Well I know it's a musical in the USA and in the UK and even in Germany, I have never seen it but if it comes I will go to this musical. It's about the finding fathers of USA, and the man Alexander Hamilton is serving in the army under general George Washington. That's how we get to know him at first and the musical is a real history lesson (for me at least). The musical is full of rap and hiphop songs and dance and well it's refreshing to see that there Lin Miranda made all this into a musical. Great job of him. I loved it and I have watched it twice. It's a musical I want to see live one day...For now I can see it on Disney+ with this film.",
709,10 May 2023,bamagirl-95288,10, Great Movie!!!,"I honest never knew about Alexander Hamilton until I watched this movie. For it to be a musical, it is very informative and almost matches the same thing I have had to learn in school. The story line of this movie was fantastic along with the acting. The chemistry among the characters were amazing, and you could feel the emotions being presented. The stage set up was great too as I noticed it turning, and objects moving with little human manipulation. Overall I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. Whether they are a history buff, musical lover, or just need something to throw on. The songs are catchy, and the movie is addicting to watch.",
710,9 November 2020,Kimelena2001,9, A Most Dynamic Innovation,"The telling of a life story is a hard task but this particular portrayal was truly bombastic in delivery, diverse in presentation and engaging throughout. The lyrics, music and the true power of this Founding Father's story has been so under-recognized in American history that it would take an innovation of blended talents best represented in this musical. The angles were amazing, the lighting was good and both aptly assisted with this portrayal. A truly dynamic achievement for all involved!",
711,17 September 2020,deanmcgee,10, Thank you Lin Manuel,"I've heard the soundtrack. I've never been able to see it live. This is the theatre experience, with close ups close enough to see King George foam at the mouth, and background business that you'd never guess was happening from just hearing the soundtrack.",
712,12 August 2021,rosannevandernagel,10, I simply get this out of my mind.,"Amazing musical, beautifully written lyrics and... Damn this is just so damn catchy! I watched tjis multiple times in a week when I watched it.",
713,16 September 2020,Bronxdiva007,10, Amazing cast and performance,I have seen it live twice and too many times on screen to count. Everytime I watch it I see something else I didnt notice beforehand. Can't wait to see it live again next year,
714,4 January 2023,theironsmasher,10," Great cast, great, songs and great film",I got into hamilton 2021 listening to the soundtrack wasn't until a few months later that I actually watched it and omg it was amazing better than soundtrack hearing the songs and seeing the movement of the cast was thenomenal and the choreo so many complex blink and you miss it details and the cast like Lin Manuel Miranda as Hamilton actually works really well i also love Leslie Odom Junior as Arron Burr and finally my favourite Daveed Diggs as Laffyette/Thomas Jefferson the man can wrap but overall just everything about this show is amazing if you haven't seen it I say it's worth a watch on Disney+,
715,14 October 2020,Pamela_Riquelme,8, AMAZING,It was incredible to finally watched this incredible musical.,
716,8 July 2020,alla-90916,7," Love the musical, recording left me wanting","The music and story of Hamilton is AMAZING, sadly i felt the recording left much to desire. Don't get me wrong i loved it but i do recommend everyone to listen to the soundtrack on its own.",
717,24 November 2020,EliseHeaney,10, Inspiring title with modern views,"Despite Hamilton being around for a few years now, it has become more popular this year. This is all for good reason. It tells the story of Alexander Hamilton in such a beautiful and artistic way that captures and engages the audience with a variety of different numbers. The change in tempo between various songs and all of the incredible and moving dance sections enhances the audience's attention meaning that everyone is hanging onto every last word being sung.",
718,1 November 2020,alexxx_s-91764,10, Amazing,Mind blowing! Everything about this musical is superb! One of the most exciting shows I've seen!!!!,
