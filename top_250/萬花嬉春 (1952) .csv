0,2 January 2011,AlsExGal,10, Now that's entertainment!,"Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of ""An American in Paris"", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.",/
1,1 May 2005,BrandtSponseller,10, A fabulous musical romance about film technology,"Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song & dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in ""The Nanny"" (1993).",r

All without foul language, extravagant pyrotechnics, mass brawls and bullets ricocheting all over the place, just immensely talented people doing what they do best - keeping you entertained and allowing you to escape for a while and live with the dreams of others.

6,21 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Just amazing! One of the best musicals ever made!,"This absolutely delightful film has everything I love in a musical, and is definitely one of the greatest musicals ever made.(I love them) I personally think the film's main merit is the electrifying choreography, evident in the songs, Make Em Laugh, Roses, Good Morning and especially Broadway Melody.As for the songs, they are superb, and quite rightly some of the finest in the history of musicals, and somehow they remind me of Easter Parade. The performances give a rare sense of energy and charm, particularly Gene Kelly as Donald Lockwood, also co-director. His rendition of the title is possibly the most famous scene in the movie, and is pretty extraordinary. Donald O'Connor is hilarious as Cosmo and Debbie Reynolds, with her lovely appearance and fabulous voice is perfectly appealing. Jean Hagen is quite hysterical as Lina, the source of the film's ongoing joke, that her character can't act, dance or sing, and her acting in the talkie was intentionally laughable. Also nice to see the beautiful long-legged Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno. (best known for Anita in West Side Story)The plot mayn't be the best merit of the film, but with everything else so good, it is such a minor criticism. All in all, a wonderful film, that is well worth watching for the song and dance numbers alone. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",w
7,24 May 1999,ToldYaSo,9, The title alone will have you humming the song,"I don't like musicals. They never made any sense to me. Don't get me wrong, I love music; it's an important part of my life. I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I'm repelled. It's probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, ""Please don't take us seriously, we like to sing and dance."" Or even more ridiculous, ""Let's not fight, let's settle this dispute with a song and dance."" Forget about suspension of disbelief.",/

The musical sequence has yet to be surpassed by any film -- even my all-time-favorite musical, ""Grease"" (1978), doesn't stand a chance. In fact, there's another great musical number in ""Singin' in the Rain,"" with Donald O'Connor throwing his body around like a rag doll. Even though the singin' in the rain number is the infamous trademark of the film and musicals everywhere, my personal favorite is ""Make 'em Laugh.""",w

I had read and heard so much about it over the years that I knew I was going to be disappointed. As a musical I've never seen anything so perfectly ""in tune"" I can see how many directors have been influenced by the soul of this gorgeous movie. I've seen even Federico Fellini here. The tap routine with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor is so energizing that I wanted to see it again and again. The fantasy number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse is breathtaking, breathtaking! How extraordinary to see Debiee Reynolds going through the contagious (Good morning!Good morning!) I had seen her a few nights before as Grace's mother in ""Will and Grace"" She hasn't lost her zest. I'm sure I'll be seeing this movie many times and I intend to show it to very young people from the post MTV generation and I'm betting with myself that they're going to love it. Greatness is timeless.",3
11,28 June 2006,evanston_dad,8, MGM Near the Top of Its Musical Game,"The heaps of scholarly criticism heaped on ""Singing' in the Rain"" have done it a disservice by giving it the ball and chain reputation of an IMPORTANT picture in cinema history. Let's not forget why ""Singin' in the Rain"" was made, which was to provide a form of escapist entertainment, nor why it's still so loved now, which is because it's great fun and everything clicks. It's not homework, and it's not medicine.",0
12,25 January 1999,cinemel,10," The dancingest, funniest musical of Hollywood's golden age.","Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have produced the best musical written directly for the screen. They have used the period in film history during the transition to sound movies and embroidered it with the wonderful songbook of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The icing on the cake, of course is the choreography of Kelly and Donen. From the first moment, the movie takes flight as Kelly relates the tale of his rise as a silent film star with his sidekick, the incomparable Donald O'Connor. Watch the flying feet of O'Connor and Kelly in the ""Fit as a Fiddle"" number. It doesn't get much better than this. Everyone is familiar with the classic ""Singin' in the Rain"" sequence. Donald O'Connor's hysterical ""Make 'em Laugh"" number is probably the funniest musical three minutes on film. Even the Broadway Ballet is a kaleidoscope of color and movement, with a minimum of the highbrow balletic choreography found in the later ""An American in Paris.""",0

In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.",4

Lina has troubles with the sharp tune of her voice, and Cosmo and Don decides to dub her, using Kathy's voice, to save their movie. When the jealous Lina finds the strategy of the studio, she does not want to share the credits with Kathy and tries to force the studio to use Kathy in the shadow to dub her in other productions. But when Lina decides to speech and sing to the audience, the truth arises.",r
20,14 November 2005,silverscreen888,7," Genial, Strongly-Made Satire With Music About the Early Days of Talkies","""Singin' In the Rain"" I find to be a relaxed musical, one whose subject is the traumatic changeover that was faced by Hollywood producers, actors and directors when sound was introduced into film circa 1928. Many fans and critics believe the musical is one of the best ever; I disagree. But it is quite unusual in several respects, I suggest: first because its background is so realistic as a milieu from which to draw appealing characters and opportunities to introduce songs; and second because the film is played on the edge of parody without ever really falling into that error. The three characters at the center of the film are a love triangle. Don Lockwood, played amiably by Gene Kelly, is the on-screen partner of Lina Lamont (Oscar-worthy Jean Hagen); she has mistaken his sincere performance for real interest; he is in love with Kathy Selden, played by too-young but plucky nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds, about whom Lina knows nothing. The professional duo are completing one more romantic adventure film as a silent when suddenly sound is introduced into movies. The studio executives panic; and Don and his partner, played by Donald O'Connor, convince the director, craggy-faced and very realistic Douglas Fowley, to get the studio to let them remake the film as a musical--completing the unfinished portion, etc. The problem turns out not to be Don's transition to talkies but Lina's; she has the voice of a screech owl. Coaching becomes necessary; sensational dance numbers are introduced, including Kelly's solo ""Singin' in the Rain"", motivated by his falling in love with Kathy; Donald O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" acrobatic classic; and the unnecessary but very-well-done ""Gotta Dance"" showcase ballet with Cyd Charisse as a gangster's moll, and Kelly as a Broadway hopeful. Then, the film is completed and debuted; of course Lina has found out about Kathy. And of course this intelligent satire works out well for all concerned, after some trials and tribulations. Great fun is gotten I suggest from the actors having to learn to ""talk into the flowers"", where early microphones had to be hidden, etc. Harold Rosson provided the cinematography, with art direction by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons. Nacio Herb Brown's songs were intelligently recycled for the film. Arthur Freed, MGM's master musical specialist, had the use of the talents of Betty Comden and Adolph Green for the screenplay and one song, ""Moses Supposes""; he also had then-28- year-old nice guy Stanley Donen as director, soon to add ""On The Town"" and ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" to this triumph. Walter Plunkett did the period costumes, with complex set decorations being done by Jacques Mapes and Edwin B. Willis. The studio's boss was played by Millard Mitchell, with Rita Moreno and a dozen familiar faces in smaller parts and uncredited appearances such as Joi Lansing, Paul Maxey, Sylvia Lewis, Kathleen freeman, King Donovan, Dawn Addams, Elaine Edwards, Mae Clarke and Snub Pollard. The film was influential, I assert, my criterion for including it among these reviews, because, immediately afterward, other 1920s and period projects were inspired by its success; these included, ""Has Anybody Seen My Gal"", the TV show ""So This is Hollytwood"", and ultimately ""The Great Race"", ""The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond Story"" and a hundred others, including a few musicals. I consider it to be genial, a clever period evocation, lightweight, exuberant, youthful, and a very seminal work with a strong central character and unusually-interesting reality background.",e
21,12 December 2005,Lady_Targaryen,9, What a Glorious Feeling !,"I was decided to watch this movie, because I knew and already watched the famous sequence of Gene Kelly singing in the rain .(what makes the movie very famous and also gives the name of it). After watching it, I can say that it is a delightful movie with also a pleasant story: They are in 1927, and Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are famous actors in Hollywood, who always make a couple in their movies,making many rumors emerge about their real relationship. The problem is that the movies now are not mute as a year ago, and they couple of actors have difficulties, since both need to take new acting and speech lessons. Lina, however has a horrible voice, needing to be dubbed by Kathy Selden, a young actress who has a beautiful voice, and makes Don fall in love. It's very funny to see the difficulties of the producers of that time, like when they put the microphone in Lina's chest to record her voice, but they also record Lina's heart beats.",f

It has a sense of humor with a terrific cast like Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly. It's become a timeless classic. Now I know why Debbie sang ""Good Mornin"" on Will & Grace upon arrival. She broke out as Cathy Selden, an aspiring actress who can sing, dance and act. The film is colorful, musical and full of beauty. Less than two hours long, the film did a terrific job in the editing room. My biggest upset was how the film turned out for Lina. I felt her humiliation was uncalled for at the end by exposing that Cathy was the voice behind the squeaky actress. Apart from that moment, the film is perfection.",_

But here I am reviewing what is quite possibly the most famous 50s musicals to ever come out of Hollywood. And I'm going to start this review with a bold statement. I've had some time to contemplate and arrange my thoughts before confirming my opinion. Not only is this the best musical I have ever seen, but actually one of the best films these eyes have watched.

Gene Kelly's performance of 'Singin' in the Rain' has to be the greatest dance numbers ever performed on film, and I could watch it over and over again. He's a genius throughout this movie as both actor and director. It's just one fantastic number after another, including Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh', the two gentlemen and a 19-year- old Debbie Reynolds performing 'Good Morning' which includes that beautiful sofa sequence at the end, and Kelly dancing with Cyd Charisse in a stunning ""imagined sequence within an imagined sequence"", with beautiful modern art touches – and many others. This film works on all levels – a musical, of course, but also a romantic-comedy, and an ode to Hollywood's past. It makes you feel good not just because of the story, but because of the irrepressible joy in the performances, and because of you know you're seeing real artistry in the choreography and execution.

Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a city hoofer who enjoys being a popular and noted 'silent' celebrity by everyone except Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) who rebuffs him by saying about movies, 'if you've seen one, you've seen them all.' His life long friend Cosmo Brown, played by (Donald O'Connor) is magically talented both singing and dancing which is nearly impossible for the obstacle in the picture, one Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When the studio discovers that silent pictures are obsolete, the director R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) launches a new course for his cast, one which does not include Lamont.

48,9 December 2002,ferguson-6,10, Top Song & Dance,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Classic musical making its way through art houses with a remastered format that causes the colors to jump off the screen.  Never a much of a Gene Kelly fan, however, his pompous persona lends itself very well to screen star Don Lockwood.  Tremendous performances by Kelly, O'Connor, Reynolds, Hagen and Charisse drive this spectacle to heights no other song & dance film has ever reached.  I do not rate it as the best musical of all-time, because I think ""Sound of Music"" and ""Music Man"" are both slightly better, but only ""West Side Story"" even comes close on the dancing.  O'Connor is nothing short of physically amazing on his ""Make 'em laugh"" and the trio's performance during ""Good Mornin'"" will leave you wanting more.  Jean Hagen is perfectly excrusciating as the screech-voiced Lina.  Truly, I think Reynolds and O'Connor should receive more credit for the success of the film.  Both are in supporting roles that nearly steal the film.  If you have never seen this on the big screen, hunt this down in your town - and take your friends and kids and parents!!",

The story is really just a musical about a musical, going into various dream-like sequences embodied in the twelve minute ""Broadway Ballet"". The songs are cleverly intertwined with the acting so there's none of that phoniness one is used to seeing in some musical pictures. To watch the choreography is to watch pure genius. Gene Kelly is so talented it should be outlawed. (It's downright sacrilegious he wasn't nominated for the Academy Award®!)  I mean - DAMN!

If the title dance sequence doesn't get you moving, then there's no hope for you.

It's knowing so well of everything that made up the Hollywood musical- and the bumpy transition from silent film to sound- and always gives a wink and a nod while retaining as a form of pure cinema, in a sense, by giving into its gleeful archetypes. It's also, surprisingly, very smart and witty for a comedy, with its goofy and cornball moments well earned thanks to the earnest effort put into looking so effortless and totally fantastical. It's a fantastical sensibility that can only come out of the movies, the escapism of smitten romances, eccentric characters, and a more contemporary spirit than one might expect (one ends up laughing at how risqué the humor can get, and how guiltlessly silly). And ultimately, it breaks ground, like Citizen Kane, using all of the songs, tricks and superlative technical additives at the disposal of the artists to make a film/amalgam a marvel on all fronts.

Redeemed by several outstanding song and dance routines, the film is a fun and fast way to spend 90 minutes or so. However, at the risk of sounding jaded, much of the film is corny and borderline mawkish.  It has not aged well.  I recently saw ""Singin' in the Rain"" at Oakland's Paramount Theatre, a refurbished '20s movie house that can accommodate huge crowds in its big-screen auditorium.  (Those that can should attend - tickets are generally $5, and while food and drink are not allowed in the movie, they have a full bar and beverage service before the show.  Films selected are usually ""classics"" like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Casablanca"", and they have live organ music and Deco Win before each film.) I was amused by both Donald O'Connor, who is great, and the film's dated sensibilities.  Many people were humming to Gene Kelly's famous solo, however, and that's what counts.  That particular scene must be among the ten greatest or most memorable in film history, and it never disappoints.  I rated the film a ""7"" just for that scene alone.",

I've always found Gene Kelly too arrogant and annoying to want to watch him as a romantic lead, a bit too uptight to be comic and his dancing's better in An American in Paris. Debbie Reynolds is cute but not earth-shattering. Donald O'Connor is fabulous- he's the reason to watch this film. His talent, particularly for comedy, exceeds Kelly's talents. He's definitely underrated.",

I know that the An American in Paris songs were just adaptations of Gershwin songs, but they're great, and they work. That rendition of ""I Got Music"" is wonderful, and the 20 minute ballet at the end is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in a film. There are several songs from Singing in the Rain which were a little weak, and the ""New York Ballet"" doesn't feel right at all in this film. It's obviously a grab for the success of An American in Paris and its amazing finale. That one made a lot of sense in that film (and was itself inspired by the even more amazing ballet sequence from The Red Shoes). That ballet sequence had much more substance, and didn't seem excessive. The New York Ballet did seem a bit excessive, although nice to watch.",
65,7 December 2005,jboothmillard,10, Singin' in the Rain,"One of the greatest classic musicals of all time, and one of my favourites, from directors Stanley Donen (Charade), and the star of the picture. Oh before I start, its not just the film that is a homage to past musicals, but the song (along with many of the others in the film) is popular in two other films. Anyway, basically it is 1927, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, starring, directing and staging the musical numbers) is one of Hollywood's biggest stars, along with his annoying voiced co-star of his new picture, Lina Lamont (Oscar nominated Jean Hagen). Warner Bros. have created the first talking motion picture, or ""talkie"", and all other studios are joining in, including Don's current studio, who have decided to turn his new upcoming silent film, The Duelling Cavalier, into the first talking musical, The Dancing Cavalier. Don has the perfect voice, where as Lina obviously ruins it, so they get a new star to replace her voice, who Don has already met and become very close to, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Cosmo Brown (Golden Globe winning Donald O'Connor, kind of like another Sir Norman Wisdom or Lee Evans) is also a part of the act, not just as Don's best friend and help in production, but at showing him and others his great, and often hilarious abilities. In the end, the film, after all its trouble in production, is a success, Kathy is revealed as the true great singing voice of Lina, and she stars with Don in a new motion picture (shown on poster). The story has taken great songs from other musicals, there are great colours and staged dances, including that one where Kelly is imagining a part of his new film where he wants to be a dancer, and eventually runs into Cyd Charisse. The cheerful ""Good Morning"" was number 72, the hilarious ""Make 'Em Laugh"" was number 49, and of the course, the key sequence of the film, Kelly's solo dance routine showing a character's true love and expression of this, ""Singin' in the Rain"" was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. I can believe the rumour that because of An American in Paris a year before took over the Oscars, and this as a result did not win any, which it should of, it only received two (pretty lousy) nominations, but I would say that this certainly much more admired. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Lennie Hayton, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Gene Kelly was number 66 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 1 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Films.

It opens within the birth of sound within motion pictures and Gene Kelly plays a celebrated actor in early cinema who falls in love with Debbie Reynolds. Donald O'Connor plays his life long friend who does a back-breaking number called ""Make 'em Laugh."" Jean Hagen is hilarious as Kelly's co-star whose high pitched voice becomes a technical problem for the talkies. Millard Mitchell plays the studio head who reluctantly embraces the idea of talking pictures due to the success of The Jazz Singer, so he decides that Kelly and Hagen's current film be a talking picture. Reynolds will factor in at the encouragement of Kelly to lend her voice over top of Hagen's. With inventive and glorious dance numbers including Kelly's wondrous title number where the storms of life fail to penetrate the expression or discovery of love at its most finest. This is a total celebration and expression of music and emotion. It also presents historical cinema shifting from one medium to another.

72,17 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, An enduring and memorable movie musical.,"'Singin' In The Rain (1952)' is one of the most memorable and enduring movie musicals of all time, remaining a classic even after all these years. It is also, despite my well-documented reservations with the genre, one of the best of its kind, especially when it comes to handling its sing-song scenes. All of its song-and-dance numbers are diegetic, or otherwise make total narrative sense, and only a couple seem to slightly break from the presented world-space, with the occasional abandonment of actual scenes to long tap routines feeling like there'd be at least some objection from those being fobbed off in favour of dance - or those wandering why on earth the characters are dancing like madmen at these occasionally inappropriate times - and the players sometimes making eyes at the 'camera' as opposed to anyone within their vicinity. There's also one number in which three people simultaneously know choreography to a dance they're making up on the spot, though this isn't a massive issue as they're all professional dancers and doing fairly standard tap for most of the piece - plus, the song in question is pre-existing and so the dance could be inspired by it. Indeed, only two songs were actually written for this flick, despite the fact that most have become synonymous with it. Even the title song was already around, which has certainly been tied to its segment in the film but is actually supposedly the inspiration for the entire picture (somehow). What's most striking about the flick, for me, is its story. Sure, the musical aspects are wonderfully done and certainly some of the best of their kind. I can't express how impressed I was when Donald O'Connor ran up a straight wall and back-flipped off it. Sometimes, these dance-numbers go on for too long, though, especially towards the latter half once the choreography starts to repeat. They actually begin to detract from the narrative slightly. While the 'Broadway Ballet' sequence is a visual treat and a remarkable achievement, it is totally superfluous and kills the pacing. It takes away from the most important aspect, which is - and always should be - the story. Still, we're back on track before long. The tale is an interesting and rather well-told one, despite some unfortunate signs of its age. The silent star pulled into the sound era has been used in a number of films since this, though this puts its focus more on creating the first movie musical and therefore becomes a slightly meta experience. It is also nicely satirical, too, a self-aware look at cinema history seen from fairly fresh eyes (the fifties weren't far off from the late twenties, after all). It's this light-tone and moments of genuine humour that keep the piece afloat, with an endearing cast caught in an entertaining quest to keep their careers afloat. It's an enjoyable experience that provides all the spectacle you'd expect but does sometimes get a little too caught up in it. 7/10",

Whilst I'm fond of most cinematic genres, the musical has been one to which I have been rather averse. Perhaps it is the sheer absurdity of a character suddenly breaking into song at the most inopportune moment, or maybe it is the films' tendencies to have a flimsy story connecting the numerous song-and-dance numbers. In any case, it is the mark of a truly great musical when it makes me completely forget that I don't really like musicals, and 'Singin' in the Rain' is certainly one example. It must also be telling that, after seeing the film, I spent the rest of the day treading down the rain-soaked paths and singing the title song to myself, and I continued to do this for at least the next three days, even after any traces of precipitation had long-since cleared.",

86,2 November 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Better than classic,"That film is one of these classics we all know about but we most of us have never seen, in full or in parts. And that was my case. That film of 1952 looks back at the great shift in the cinema from silent movies to talkies and the drama it may have represented for some artists who could not adapt. This film adds to that some nasty aspects of that change, of silent films (and that has not really changed), how everything is artificial and nothing but a glossy appearance. Those actors and actresses love one another in so bizarre ways at times, and they have to cope with producers and directors. But the film is funny because so many elements are shown as ironical, humorous or just plain hilarious, not to mention some cruelty here and there. Then the plot is sentimental and even romantic with a complete rift between a fake mediatic love affair and another secret and deep love that is no affair at all but a passion. The film amplifies that rift by giving to the mediatic mistress the voice of a goat and her impossibility or rather unwillingness to train herself into some kind of drinkable vocal sound, drinkable for the audience. So the studio invents dubbing and the actress is dumb enough to want to speak to her audience who liked the voice on the screen so much. The shock is so hard that they require a song and then the dubbing has to be revealed and that is the end of a career that gets silent and mute because it should have stayed silent and mute, but vanity requires adulation and worship and then a voice has to be put on the nice face and it is the discovery of the lie, of the illusion and the public never takes it with a grain of salt when they discover they have been fooled. That film is famous for one song though it is a singing and dancing treat from beginning to end, an allusion to the career of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and some others, but with a touch of realism in the behavior of these Hollywood people. And that touch is the best fun of the film: vanity has no limits and vainer than I you die. A real treat of entertainment and an important page in the huge history book of the cinema.",

Its originality is all the more startling if you reflect that only one of its songs was written new for the film, that the producers plundered MGM's storage vaults for sets and props, and that the movie was originally ranked below ""An American in Paris,"" which won a best picture Oscar. The verdict of the years knows better than Oscar: ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a transcendent experience, and no one who loves movies can afford to miss it. The film is above all lighthearted and happy. The three stars--Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and 19-year-old Debbie Reynolds--must have rehearsed endlessly for their dance numbers, which involve alarming acrobatics, but in performance they're giddy with joy. Kelly's soaking-wet ""Singin' in the Rain"" dance number is ""the single most memorable dance number on film,"" Peter Wollen wrote in a British Film Institute monograph. I'd call it a tie with Donald O'Connor's breathtaking ""Make 'em Laugh"" number, in which he manhandles himself like a cartoon character. Kelly and O'Connor were established stars when the film was made in 1952. Debbie Reynolds was a newcomer with five previous smaller roles, and this was her big break. She has to keep up with two veteran hoofers, and does; note the determination on her pert little face as she takes giant strides when they all march toward a couch in the ""Good Morning"" number. Kelly and O'Connor had dancing styles that were more robust and acrobatic than the grandmaster, Fred Astaire. O'Connor's ""Make 'em Laugh"" number remains one of the most amazing dance sequences ever filmed -- a lot of it in longer takes. ""Good Morning"" uses the kitchen and living areas of Lockwood's house (ironically, a set built for a John Gilbert movie). Early in the film, Kelly climbs a trolley and leaps into Kathy's convertible. Outtakes of the leap show Kelly missing the car on one attempt and landing in the street.",

Then you illustrated it with songs, dance, a love story crossing different eras, you offered parallels in the business and personal world, and then underlined it all with a dig at a society that takes itself too seriously? Would it come become widely acknowledged as the finest musical of all time? Singin' in the Rain takes a lost art form, travelling back to the days of silent pictures. A matinée idol (played by Gene Kelly) is caught up in the transition, together with his buddy (Donald O'Connor), a co-star with a grating voice (Jean Hagen) and the girl of his dreams (Debbie Reynolds). Just as is often the case in real life, the lovers bond by accepting each other's worst side. She can't stand his pompousness but her image is shattered when she takes a lowly job and jumps out of a birthday cake.

Glorious musical-comedy is savvy (if a little soft-hearted) about show business, and truly first-rate as a visual feast (with colors that saturate the screen like a painter's dream palette). Though he deserves most of the credit for his co-direction, singing, dancing and choreography, I'm not sure how convincing Gene Kelly is as a love-interest for Debbie Reynolds (they seem more along the lines of close pals, or perhaps brother and sister). Kelly, a real showboater who constantly plays to the camera, knows his strengths like no other musical star, yet his penchant for playing to the audience can either be deemed cute or simply unctuous. Still, the man is a human dynamo, and he cuts quite a presence on the screen; though his elaborate ""Broadway Melody"" number really belongs in a different picture altogether, Kelly is ingratiating calling out ""Gotta Dance!"" to a stage full of arms-flailing teens--he's the bedrock of the movie, as well as its heart and soul. Debbie seems rather young for him, but she's full of joshing good cheer, like a great buddy. Donald O'Connor has energy to spare as a pianist, and his exhausting showpiece ""Make 'em Laugh"" (though prolonged) is one of the few times when Kelly doesn't steal the spotlight. ***1/2 from ****",

When Gene Kelly stepped outside, oblivious to the rain, to joyfully declare his love for a gal, a big smile arose on my face. This lamppost scene is an iconic scene that every movie lover knows about. I have no idea why it took me so long to see the movie, but better late than never! For one hour and forty-three minutes, I was in a state of joy watching Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds work their magic. Considering this an Arthur Freed production, you are pretty much guaranteed that there will be great music, lavish sets/costumes, and pitch-perfect dance choreography. The music certainly wasn't new (as most of them were older Freed songs), but the song versions from this movie are certainly the most memorable. When I think about the title song, ""Singin' in the Rain,"" I think about Gene Kelly singing it. The successful usage of the songs is impressive in my eyes because they were written two decades earlier, so they were not related to the actual story. Freed just wanted to make a movie that connected the backlog of songs he created. He hired Betty Comden and Adolph Green to be the connective tissue (writing the script) for the songs.",

But this is a movie which is so much more than that one legendary musical number. For starters there are plenty of other musical numbers which are just as good as, or perhaps depending on your tastes, even better than Kelly's famous nighttime twirl through the rainy streets. But what makes the movie truly great is that it does not have to rely solely on the big song-and-dance numbers. This is a movie with a great story.

Definitely a great dancer of his time. It was also the first film I saw of Debbie Reynolds' earlier work. It is very clear why it's considered one of the best films of all time.

117,28 February 2020,jayjaycee,9, The titular song is still stuck in my head,"""Singin' In The Rain"" is a 1952 musical romance directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly starring him and Debbie Reynolds. I think I speak in the name of countless when I say that two of the most important factors in my life are my passion for movies and my love for music. Not only do I happen to be a passionate stage actor and musician myself, both have played a major role since I was a kid and there's nothing more moving for me than the rawest and purest output of emotions. That's why I think that I was literally born for the genre musical - in both watching and performing. In any way, having witnessed this classic was a revelation for me. From the first minute on, it grabbed me on a deep emotional level. There's no actor or actress in this feature whose ability to act, dance or sing isn't absolutely masterful. Kelly and Reynolds pretty much dominated the screen with their absolutely heartwarming chemistry. It's a colourful piece or art that perfectly manages to amaze the audience with it's uplifting story that realistically depicts a time in the history of cinema when talking films were said to never make it in Hollywood - and at the same time subliminally criticises it. It's a touching story that perfectly balances well written and crafted scenes or dialogue and drama with ingenious and non-repetitive musical numbers. They all fit so well in the atmosphere of their respective scenes and (except for one in the end) had me on the edge of my seat and in a form of indescribable ecstasy. What I experienced there was classic acting at it's finest. The songs and musical score are absolutely loveable and unforgettable and the titular number has been stuck in my head for hours since I watched it. The magnificent camera work enables the viewer to literally live every scene on such a close level that everyone who feels in a bad mood before watching it will feel immensely better afterwards. It's the sheer amount of talent and the perfectionist directorial style of the director duo that make this film almost reach perfection and so much inspiring in so many ways. All in all, it's outstanding as it is iconic, still untouchable and the forerunner for every musical that comes after. Even in modern standards this one still beats every film in direct competition. I'm pretty sure that when you look up the term ""musical"" in a lexicon you will find an image of Gene Kelly dancing around a streetlight pool and singing one of the most famous numbers of all time. No matter how I felt today, I can't help but repeat what he's singing over and over again. It cheered me up and made me see rain in a way more positive way. ""I'm dancing ... and singing in the rain."" - and literally feel this. Thank Hollywood this films exists!",

Watching the three main stars (Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds) sing ""Good Morning"" is one of my favorite moments of the film, not to mention Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" scene being one of the most famous moments on film. Donald O'Conner's ""Make 'em Laugh"" is one of the most unforgettable musical numbers anyone will ever see. No other musical in history has a great a combination of comedy and great songs as this one, in my own opinion. Considered one of the top ten films ever made, it's a personal favorite to me as well.

And, we have the introduction of dancing and musical numbers, which are always a great thing to throw in. Keeping in the trend of having the viewer feel like the people they are viewing, everything was lit very well, which is reminiscent of the stage lights that they had to stand under.

It's also difficult for me to think of anyone more overrated than Comden and Green, who are right up there with Hitchcock as far as misplaced plaudits are concerned. Their schtick was New York and the bulk of the Books and lyrics they wrote seldom ventured West of Central Park, this Hollywood-spoof being one exception.

The songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, who's also the producer, are entertainingly performed. And the direction by Kelly and Stanley Donen is just perfect not to mention the original screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green! Nothing more to say except, Singin' in the Rain is indeed perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made! P.S. Great commentary on the track of the DVD in which Ms. Reynolds intros various members of cast and crew and others making their comments. Oh, and it's a shame it was only nominated for two Oscars-none for Best Picture: Ms. Hagen for Best Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton for Scoring of a Musical Picture. At least Donald O'Connor got a Golden Globe (as Best Actor-Musical or Comedy) for it.

Just like Wizard of Oz, this movie is so full of life, so colorful, so upbeat, so happy, what's not to like? The songs are great, the characters are great, the art direction is great, everything is just great. This movie brings such a big smile to my face that I have to go to a surgeon to fix it. If you're ever feeling down, Singin' in the Rain is the perfect movie to watch. I love the story, and how it tells of the tragic time when movies went to sound and a lot of actors couldn't make the transition. It's like The Artist, but much happier. The acting is typical 1950s musical acting, and there's a lot of corniness to the whole thing, but that's what makes it hold up so well today. Just like Wizard of Oz, this is a movie most people see at a young age, and grow up loving it. It doesn't seem realistic, but this is classic Hollywood. We don't watch movies to see our own lives, we watch movies because they're the opposite of our terrible reality, and they allow us to escape for a short time. It may be a little silly at times, but it just shows how much fun making movies can be. Singin' in the Rain is a classic, and one of the greatest films of all time. It really is one of the most lovable classics in American cinema.",

168,21 September 2020,aidanratesmovies,10, An Incredibly Delightful Classic,"Often whimsical, witty, and smart- Singin' in the Rain has some structural flaws, but ultimately proves to be quite a delightful time at the movies, that is bound to put a smile on your face. The acting is as good as ever, especially for the time. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen all provide terrific performances throughout- which can at times seem goofy, and even exaggerated, but the direction largely makes the performances work, and does so in a way that feels the film could have only ever been done. The film is largely entertaining through and through, as well as full of catchy tunes and daring musical numbers that are bound to grab your attention. It can also be quite funny at times, and awfully sweet, as the film develps its romance story in such a way that never seems forced- which feels very rare for the time. As for the flaws of the film, towards the end, things begin to becom a bit strucucarlly unsound- as transitions become less clear, and the plot falls to a bit of a cliche with Hagen's character. Luckily, however, the film is able to wrap things up quite nicely, if not perfectly, and proves to be an sbolutely delightful dream that is not only classsic but has largely stood the test of time.

The female dancing resembled that of the flapper styles from a few decades before the movie was made. The film was comedic and clever, with a balanced mix of impressive music and dance. When the song ""Beautiful Girls"" was performed, it reminded me of Buzby Berkely style of filming, with all the colors and patterns of the female background dancers.

They shot each individual dancing scene in a unique way, in a one of the scenes that they had a montage of scenes in a quick moment. One particular scene with Kathy and Don dancing on stage, the perspective and angle isn't consistent, it switches up from close up shots to scenes that are farther away. In the Singing in the Rain scene, the do a pan shot of him walking along sidewalk. The use of the Technicolor was very cool, and it worked for the movie and I think if certain scenes were not in color it would not show the same effects.",
197,30 December 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," Pretty funny, but with the status of this being a classic I would not (yet?) agree","""Singin' in the Rain"" is an American English-language movie from 1952, so this one is almost 70 years old now. It is a color film, which should be said because it really wasn't too common for the early 50s although I believe for non-dramas it was probably more often the case than for drama films. It runs for little over 100 minutes and the director here as well as the lead actor is Gene Kelly, well co-director. It was not his first directorial effort, but still an early project as the man in charge behind the camera. As for acting, he was pretty established already, an Oscar nominee. His film here managed two Oscar nominations and looking at how popular musicals were back then and how people still love this film considerably over half a century later, it is a bit surprising it is ""only"" two I'd say. One is for the score (expected sort of), the other is for actress Jean Hagen. And deservedly so I'd say. She was really the comedic highlight of the film and it is unusual to say something like that about what maybe can be best described as the main antagonist. I will talk a bit about her in detail later on. The Golden Globes gave a prestigious award to Donald O'Connor and I really like that because he gave my favorite male performance in this film (come on, it is clear he is much younger than Kelly's character, don't tell us early on before the flashback they are the same age) and his marvellous qualities as an entertainer really made the film so much better at times. The best example is relatively early still when we see all he can do with his face. Great expressions! Sadly the Oscars did not nominated him, maybe because his turn is more supporting really although he has a lot of screen time. And it was a bit of a category conflict. Still nice to see these two getting the biggest awards recognition because character-wise they are a key reason to watch this film. As for Gene Kelly, I have not seen too much from him really, but in this movie here he did not impress me too much. I rarely felt the sympathy for him where I really would have cheered him on, but then again maybe this is not even what the character was made for. It was more about cheering for Reynolds' to get the recognition she deserves. She was cute as a button no denying and the two I just mentioned also had a romance story in this film. But it is not a romance movie. It is not at the center of the film at all. They quickly get together without us seeing it, but I must say it felt not too credible with how much she apparently despises him (and his profession) early on. Reynolds died a little over three years ago (maybe you remember the tragedy that she died just one day after her daughter), but there is still one cast member alive and that is Rita Moreno, even if she really just plays a minor character who doesn't even have any lines I think. She was roughly 20 back then and now she is almost 90. But looks still really good for that.",

Now everybody knows the songs aren't original but the dance numbers are great, even the ones that you would think were less prominent (i.e. Make 'em Laugh) are better than most musical's best numbers and Donald O'Connor really steals the show with this one in my opinion. The dance number that immediately comes to mind when you think of this film is Singin' In the Rain and it definitely doesn't disappoint.

The actors all do a really great job throughout all of the musicals shown in the movie, especially Gene Kelly as he was the one of the people that Choreographed a lot of the musical scenes.

Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.",

Donald O'Connor's character, Cosmo Brown, is the absolutely hilarious best friend of Lockwood, who sings his famous ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number and cracks jokes from beginning to end.  Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) enters the plot as Lockwood's love interest and Lena Lamont gets jealous.

I put it up there with ""Easter Parade"", ""Bandwagon"", and ""Finian's Rainbow"" as the most boring musicals. Even though all of them have some wonderful tunes, none of them really do anything. Though I fully understood the weak excuse of a plot dealing with the transition from Vaudville, silent movies, then to talkies, I found that the actual plot was so thin it left me wanting, and it became nothing more than an excuse on which to hang some songs (albeit some really catchy and lively ones).",

Lockwood then glibly fabricates a make-believe story, devoid of crushing reality, while contradictory events play on screen. The reality of the couple too is quite different. Lamont is an egocentric, deluded, diva with a screechy voice and uncultured manners, reviled by much of the crew, who now face the brunt when both have to star in a talkie. To Lockwood's side are his comical yet versatile partner Cosmo and his love Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), chirpy, sprightly lass.

As a genre, the musical film genre has faded away from contemporary popularity in the later part of the 1900's in favour of grittier and more action filled films. At one time however, musicals where all the rage. It is nice to see that this genre is slowly having a mini resurgence since 2000 with films like; ""Chicago"" (2002), ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (2004), ""Rent"" (2005), ""Hairspray"" (2007), ""Mama Mia"" (2008), ""Burlesque"" (2010), ""Les Misérables"" (2012), ""Jersey Boys"" (2014), ""La La Land"" (2016), ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017), ""Cats"" (2019) - a hit at least every couple of years. I will be honest with you before carrying on further; I am not the Worlds biggest fan of musicals, some of them I absolutely cannot stomach, but I do have an appreciation of the genre still. I was brought up with my mum and my grandmother loving the genre and regularly watching Judy Garland or Fred and Ginger. To that point, while not the biggest fan, I have had a lot of exposure to musicals, so they are not a complete unknown to me. Heck, in comparison to friends in film circles I follow I might even be considered knowledgeable in them. To be a fan of cinema, you must have a broad spectrum of appreciation, and as a fan of cinema, despite it not being in my top 5 genres of film, musicals still have a place on my spectrum, so I do not feel like a massive hypocrite writing about them.",

Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.",

Just as silent screen stars Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are about to make a new film ""The Cavalier"", Don - who with each passing film is growing ever more weary of the ego-maniacal and delusional Lina - meets sweet virginal ingénue Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds, AKA: Princess Leia's Mom), who aspires to be an actress in her own right. Don meets Kathy while running away from his adoring fans and hitches a ride with her en route to a post-party premiere while she's en route to work. Secretly a fan of his films but wishing not to appear to be a gushing fan girl, Kathy claims to be a stage actress and comments that she doesn't find film work to be all that professional or dignified as there is no sound or words, merely melodramatic gestures, which Don, who worked his way up long and hard from humble beginnings with his sardonic childhood piano playing friend Cosmo (Don O'Connor), finds insulting. Kathy is later humiliated when Don finds out that she's actually working as a song & dance girl at the very Grove where his party is being held, where she makes her grand entrance from a giant fake cake, her embarrassment fueling Don's smug amusement. When Don starts grilling Kathy about her ""profession"", she tries to hit him with a pie, but ends up hitting his obnoxious screen partner Lina instead, which costs Kathy her job when Lina complains about it to the management. Don's frustration is pushed to critical mass by this, and finds he can't stop thinking about Kathy, feeling both guilty about her misfortune and his own confidence undermined by her words. Don later finds Kathy working as an extra for a musical number for another project at the studio where he works, Kathy's true fan girl colors are exposed, but in old school Hollywood fashion, Don & Kathy fall in love.",

Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a silent film star who has made several films with the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), both of whom are thrown for a loop when ""The Jazz Singer"" is released and is a smash hit. The studio then decides to turn their latest silent feature, ""The Dueling Cavalier"" into a musical but there is one huge problem: Lina has a speaking and singing voice like nails on a chalkboard. Enter Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), a young chorus girl with lofty theatrical ambitions who agrees to dub Lina's vocals for the film and falls for Don in the process, much to the chagrin of Lina, who believes the fan magazine stories that Don is in love with her. This simple yet clever story provides the backdrop for MGM's greatest triumph which became an instant classic upon release. Kelly is charming and charismatic as Lockwood and works well with Donald O'Connor, who plays his best friend Cosmo Brown. Debbie Reynolds, 18 years old at the time, is completely winning as Kathy and Jean Hagen earned the film's only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her brilliant comic turn as Lina Lamont, the glamorous, vein glamour queen whose ego far outweighs her talent. Musical highlights include two dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor, ""Fit as a Fiddle"" and ""Moses"" which allow the viewer to compare and contrast the different but equally dazzling dance styles of these two artists; O'Connor's hysterical solo, ""Make Em Laugh"", Kelly and Reynolds' lovely pas de deux, ""You were Meant for Me"", and of course, Kelly's title tune, which is practically Hollywood folklore now. And notice must also be taken of ""Broadway Ballet"" a 20-minute fantasy/production number which features a special appearance by the divinely long-legged Cyd Charisse.

In reality, Don barely tolerates her, while Lina, despite finding Don below her, simply believes what she sees on screen to bolster her own fame and self-esteem. RF Simpson, the head of Monumental, dismisses what he thinks is a flash in the pan: talking images. Not until The Jazz Singer (1927) becomes a bona fide hit, causing all cinemas to install sound equipment that R. F. knows that Monumental, most specifically in the form of Don and Lina, has to jump on the talking picture cart, despite no one in the studio knowing anything about the technology. Musician Cosmo Brown, Don's best friend, is hired as Monumental's ideas man and musical director. And by that time, Don has started secretly dating Kathy Selden, a chorus girl who is trying to go big in pictures herself. Don and Kathy's relationship is less than friendly despite their first meeting. Cosmo and Kathy help Don, who had worked his way through the movie ranks to stardom, try to make the leap to talking picture stardom, with Kathy following her. However, they have to overcome the technological difficulties. But the bigger problem is Lina, who will do anything to make sure she makes the successful jump to talking photos too, despite her own inability and at the expense of anyone and everyone if they get in her way, especially Kathy as Don's off-screen girlfriend and possibly his new talking picture lead actress.",

Gene Kelly's exquisite tap dancing to the song Singin' in the Rain, like the lyrics, actually brings ""a smile to my face.""
Kelly and O'Connor's opening dance sequence possibly rivals any other duo in musical history. Debbie Reynolds shines as the aspiring actress new to Hollywood. Meanwhile Hagen gives a hilarious and compelling performance as the antagonist in the story, which takes places in the 1920s as the movie industry is changing from silent to talking pictures.

304,29 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Some thoughts,"Admittedly, for someone who has little contact with song and dance films, ""Singing in the rai"" is still amazing to me. It is said that this film is a classic of song and dance films in film history.
From this film, you can also see the decline of silent films. The film is set in the background of Hollywood's transition from the silent film era to the sound film era. In 1927, Tang and Linna were a famous screen couple in the silent film era. With the rise of sound movies, Linna fell into a huge dilemma. Although she has a beautiful face and a plump posture, but she does not have a good voice, she is very different when making sound movies. In order to give Linna a good voice, Tang introduced Cathy to the production team and asked Cathy to voice Linna. Cathy's voice and Lina's beautiful appearance made Linna's popularity soaring; however, Linna, who was blinded, did not recognize Cathy's credit. Linna's approach caused dissatisfaction from other production staff. In a performance on the stage with the film, everyone designed Linna to be a big ugly.
I actually do n't really like singing and dancing movies. In the plot, singing and dancing always seem very lengthy, but when watching this movie, I can watch this movie peacefully with a smile, but the song and dance movie is always a decline Genre, pure song and dance films have already entered the current film in other forms and with another element. Perhaps song and dance films are no longer suitable for today's era, just like the era of Chaplin's silent films is incompatible with the current sound era. In the film, when the sound film appeared, everyone can't wait to cast into the embrace of the sound era.
However, what I want to say more is that this is Hollywood's self-deprecating work. In a fundamental sense, this is to put a movie in a movie, make a movie in a movie, and in the movie, it clearly shows us the Hollywood at that time. The way of filming can even be said to show us without scruples, the gossip and inside story of the star's life.
Of course, the classic dialogue in the film can touch my heart all the time, maybe in our fashionable words, Tang He is too provocative. In the film, although it is raining heavily, the mood is not wet, because of her, so You can sing and wander in the rain wantonly. Even though there is heavy downpour, you can gently put down the umbrella in your hand and sing in the rain wantonly!
When it comes to this, I have to talk about a personal rainy complex. Whenever it rains, I can't help but put away the umbrella in my hand and hum gently: ""I am singing in the rain""",

I readily admit that I am not a lover of musicals, but this simply works as a celebration of life. Hidden amid the technicolor hues and radiance are a wide assortment of life affirming truths: love the art in yourself, not yourself in the art (Stanislavski), remain loyal and work hard. This is just to list a precious few lessons to be learned. This is also one of the few films that everyone, no matter what age or religious orientation can enjoy, despite a large number of suggestive puns and jokes.

It's beautifully shot, the songs are memorable and the dance choreography is fantastic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds have perfect chemistry together and are all terrific physical and comedic performers. It's really amazing to see them singing and dancing together and because the film maker knew how talented these people were, the editing during these scenes is sparse, allowing you to really admire everything with few cuts. I had seen the titular segment where Gene Kelly is ""singin' in the rain"" and still it contained so much joy that it felt fresh to me. That's an iconic moment that makes the movie worth seeing all by itself there are many other great segments, like the ""Make 'em Laugh"" sequence, where Donald O'Connor does an impromptu number, all on his own without a stunt double and ""Good Morning"" where we get to see the three leads together celebrating a breakthrough. You really get to see that these people were amazing physical performers and it makes you want to get up and practice their moves in the hopes that you could be as good. There's so much energy in the film that it's a real delight to see. It's sure to please you and make you smile, it's laugh-out-loud funny and I also enjoyed seeing the lighthearted insight on the world of filmmaking as the talkies started replacing the silent films.

The acting performances are great. Characters meant to be loved are lovable and those meant to be hated are despicable. The musical talent these actors possess is impressive as well. The choreography is wonderful and the singing is amazing. However some songs do go on too long and lose some of their splendor. This does not happen often though.

The acting from Gene Kelly (Don Lockwood) and Donald O'Connor (Cosmo Brown) made acting for what it is now and I am proud to say that. They both were amazing and funny, especially Donald O'Connnor. Debbie Reynolds (Kathy Seldon)was the best female actress in the film. Jean Hagen (Lina Lamont) was terrible because her voice is too scream-like and her acting is dumb even though it's meant to be like that. It is very hard to like her! There was one problem which stopped me from giving this film a perfect ten and that is that the film does not have as much singing as I would have liked. There was too less music but the songs were beautifully written and sung. Since the film did not have too much music it did make way for more non-music time and that's is a great combination of skill.",

I'm not very fan of musical movies but this one was marvelous and I enjoyed that I do believe a movie with sound and voices of it's actors and actors could be more and more beautiful that the silent ones and Singin' in the Rain just showed us how a movie could be better with that. this isn't just about film technology but about actual love and as conclusion I should say What astonishing ending.,

346,24 April 1999,cutter-12,8, Not the greatest musical,"The dance numbers in this picture are terrific, charged with energy and performed to near perfection by all involved. I can't help but say however, that although the film is good and well worth seeing, it is vastly, vastly overrated as far as the praise and notoriety it has received down through the years. The satire on old time Hollywood is not fully realized, leaving us with what is essentially a thinly strung together collection of set pieces, one of which really comes out of left field and has not a whole lot to do with the main plot . Just like he did in ""An American In Paris, another vastly overrated classic, Gene Kelly's dynamic Broadway sequence is a long detour from what we are expecting as far as a cohesive and flowing storyline. It is this kind of dance sequence that prompted his ""invitation to the dance"" some years after, a film that didn't allow plot and dialogue to get in the way of artistic dancing. Another flaw in Singin' in the Rain is the unauthenticity of some of the musical numbers as far as what the standard was in 1930. As good and as entertaining as the film is, flaws aside, in no way does it hold a candle to the REAL greatest musical ever made, ""Kiss me Kate.""",

Sure, it was an idealized version, but I'll take an idealized 30s/50s over an idealized 90s/00s any day!  The characters were great, the singing and dancing were superb, and the sets were gorgeous.

Singin' in the Rain is essentially about the history-changing transition from silent movies to sound - something the movie bosses said wouldn't last! Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a very popular silent actor. He has a fake relationship with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) for publicity purposes. When the Hollywood is struck with sound, there is a problem.... and Don puts his career on the rocks when he falls in love with Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).

I just thought that musicals were bland stories where the characters would just go and start singing terrible songs every five minutes. But with Singin' in The Rain there was something different about it. The songs that were sung in this film were enjoyable to listen to. Each one had a certain characteristic to it that fit each scene well. And the colors in this film all look amazing. They're so vivid that your eyes will always be focused on the scene. And I must say the one scene where they are thinking of ideas with the studio president is without a doubt the best part of the movie.

The only saving grace for this film was that the characters were moderately funny which made it relatively enjoyable and kept my interest until then end. The cinematic elements of this film were very strong but I think the most effective was the light and obviously, since this is a musical, the sound. The light really gave the film that movie studio look that the production staff was looking for.

As for Singin' in the Rain, It's okay. I expected more from such a highly revered film. It is about 30 minutes of plot (an extremely weak one, at that) stretched out far past it's limits. It seems as though the plot was just a feeble device to string together a bunch of dance sequences - dance sequences that repeat the same moves over and over. Impressive, but repetitive. This movie is all show. I think Hollywood overestimates how interested people are in movies about music, or even movies about Hollywood. Maybe it was wrong for me to hope for anything deeper than surface-level gloss. But I did. And I was pretty disappointed.",

Why she didn't become a bigger star than she was, I'll never understand. Nothing against the also-talented and versatile Debbie Reynolds, but I would like to have seen less of Debbie and a lot more of Cyd. Maybe this is just a movie that hasn't worn well over the years, but to me, it's greatly overrated.

I do not think there exist another movie musical as much more fun than ""Singin' in the Rain,"" this movie to me was an epic! It putted me in an amazing mood.

374,18 May 2011,sushifish55,6, Hooray a musical about a Musical =/,"In my own opinion if you want to make a musical about a musical you better be Mel Brooks. ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) is by no means a bad movie and the dancing and comedic feats of Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown are sure to delight anyone, but the this musical movie is about the making of musical movies and at times seems to trade of substance to add an extra dance number. If you love Musicals by all means this is the film for you, but if your like me and your indifferent about them I'd steer clear of this one. To me a good musical will incorporate the song/dance number into the actually plot, ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) often fails to do this. Now the scene where Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden finally meet up again and have a romantic duet in a studio on a Hollywood lot the film does a great job of incorporating the song into the plot. An example of where the movie fails to do this is during the number ""Moses Supposes"" where Don and Cosmo are at a professor of linguistics office and break out into this goofy little number for pure entertainment. Now I don't mind a funny goofy musical scene but at least make it matter!!! If you love musicals and have some time to waste then by all means enjoy the film; if not please look elsewhere because ""Singin' in the Rain"" is not for you.",

It was executed extremely well that everything just flowed in a way that pulled the viewer in and made them want to see what happened next. Another thing that really helped make the movie was the chemistry between all of the characters. It was very believable how feelings were betrayed between each of the characters and how it changed through out the movie.

The spectacle of the Hollywood of the 20's is in every single object and room within the movie. The acting is very upbeat and colorful throughout the film. The musical bits are beautifully sung by each and every actor with smooth voices and have flawlessly choreographed dance sequences with some of the creative movements in dance musicals I have seen, although I have a minor complaint of them going on for too long.

384,12 October 2006,snowy_paws,9, A musical about two lovers and their struggle through show business,"Singing in the Rain is an amazing movie that i recommend to everyone! Singing in the rain is about two actors who fall in love with each other. The main character, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), is already a big celebrity and he encounters a lady by landing in her car after an escape from a mob of fans. The lady driving the car is an aspiring actress named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Don falls for her at first sight, but Kathy argues with him and doesn't think he's all that great. She says that he isn't a true actor. She drops him off and he goes to an after party of his latest movie. Kathy ends up being one of the surprise dancers, and he tries to get her again, but it ends up Kathy throwing a cake into Lina Lamont's (Jean Hagen)face. Lina Lamont works with Don in all their movies. Lina despises Kathy after that moment. After quite some time, the studio is making another movie for Don and Lina. The movies they've made have all been in the silent era. The studio already starts filming their next movie, until the R.F. Simpson, the studio owner/producer says that they must either change the movie to a sound movie or just shut the whole thing down. The studio decides to jump on the bandwagon and make a sound movie, because of the success of the Jazz Singer, and the demand for more talkies. The studio starts filming the movie into a talkie. The biggest problem with the talkie is that Lina's voice is absolutely terrible for the job, but they still film the movie. When the first screening is showed, everyone thinks the movie is a joke and is terrible. After the screening, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), and Kathy are at Don's house. The two friends are trying to cheer up Don, and then they ponder about ways to fix the movie. Cosmo comes up with a brilliant plan to make the movie into a musical. Don and Kathy thinks it's a brilliant idea, until they remember that Lina can't sing or speak for that matter. After some thought, Cosmo has a revelation and comes up with the idea that Kathy sings for Lina. The studio thinks it's a great idea and keeps it a secret. The plan is going well until Zelda Zanders (Rita Moreno) tattles on the plan, and Lina demands that the credits say it is her voice and give no credit to Kathy. The studio and Kathy agree but to just this film. After the premiere of the movie, (which is a success), Lina shocks everyone by saying that Kathy must dub in for Lina in all her movies. Everyone is furious and tells her it's not going to happen. The audience then asks for a speech and Lina irrationally decides to go out and present a speech. When she starts speaking people realize that it wasn't her voice in the movie and demand her to sing. Lina realizes the mistake she made and runs off stage and Simpson comes up with a plan, whispers it to Don and Cosmo, and tells Kathy to sing behind the second curtain for Lina. Kathy refuses until Don begs her to. Kathy agrees but never wants to see Don again. Lina goes back on stage. The conductor asks her which song to sing and in which key. Kathy whispers to Lina to tell the conductor ""Singing in the Rain"" in A-Flat. Kathy starts singing and Lina starts dubbing. Offstage Don, Cosmo, and Simpson pull the curtain so Kathy is revealed. Lina doesn't know this until Cosmo goes to where Kathy is and starts singing. Lina is humiliated and runs off.

The movie is so visually mesmerizing, outstanding mise- en-scene along with superb choreography and singing. A true musical sensation. Also the visual illusions of the movie are not only imaginative but also very creative. The film also had an excellent sound track to mix with the singing of the film. By far the best musical ever made because it's more than just a musical, it's a story as well. This film combines excellent direction and story progression along with astonishing camera and lighting techniques, great acting and dancing, choreography and music to combine and create an outstanding musical film.",

A musical over ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Star Wars"", and ""Psycho""? I was not convinced. Then i SAW the film, and I realized why it places so high. Movies are made to entertain and make the viewer feel good, and ""Singin'"" might do this better than any movie ever made. It's not the great songs, the dances that accompany them, or even the gloriously positive ending (""She's the star of the picture!"") that makes the viewer feel so good when watching this film. There seems to be a certain something, a certain, well, happiness, to the whole film. Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen definitely did what they set out to do when they made this. Filled with bright colors, unforgettable moments, and utterly touching, human characters, ""Singin'"" is the perfect antidote for films like ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""Rollerball""-films which make the viewer feel upset upon finishing them. The feel-good movie of the year in 1952, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is now considered the feel-good film of the century.",

The reason why is because I had to keep on rewinding to listen to the songs and the hilarious banter over and over again. It took me about 5 hours to watch the first time I saw it. Thank god for rewindable video tapes. Singing in the rain is definitely not the movie that you plan a Friday night around. No, Singing in the rain is the movie that you find in the bottom your movie chest and say ""hey, I have not seen this in a long time."" Then you look at the clock and the next thing you know it is 2 in the morning and you still don't feel tired at all. It is without a doubt the most fun and the best musical ever made, bar none.

The dancing always fits the mood, which was great for there were SO many different moods, for example when you had slow droopy dances for sad moments and then up to beat almost silly dances for happy moments. I loved the dance that Donald O'Connor did in the beginning, it was an awesome stunt piece dance that had a very Charlie Chaplin style to it. The chemistry between Kelly and O'Connor was awesome, I was very convinced and amused the whole time. I thought that Reynolds and Kelly had a lot of good chemistry even though they didn't have much of a good relationship off set. I thought also for not being a dancer Reynolds was awesome!",

It's almost as though the scenes were done in one take, as you would expect for a life-stage production of a musical! The acting by Jean Hagen (Lina) and Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) are my favorite parts of the film, however. They play such contrasting characters and each made their part so their own it's really something to see. Then you throw in the famous songs, ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Moses Supposes"" and ""Good Morning"", this musical is just fun waiting to be watched.",

This movie is more than a singing and dancing sensation however as it is the story of two silent film stars who must transition into the world of talking pictures. The transition is hilarious as the female lead, the glamorous Lina Lamont has a voice that could easily be compared to nails on a chalkboard. Gene Kelly, portraying the male lead Don Lockwood and his brilliant childhood friend Cosmo, played by the wonderful Donald O'Connor, come up with the brilliant idea to use the voice of the beautiful Kathy Selden, played by Debbie Reynolds, for Lina's in the movie. Of course Lina has been jealous of Kathy's involvement from the start and that's when the real fun begins. In addition to the hilarious storyline this picture includes some of the best dance moves I've ever seen and the singing talent is legendary. Shot is beautiful Technicolor this movie is not to be missed.",

I thought everything was great from the editing, lighting, sound, camera-work, acting, just everything about it was perfect! The movie is about a famous ""power couple"" Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont who are known for their great chemistry in movies and people think it is in real life also but the real life romance between the two was just for publicity. Well Lina likes Don but Don doesn't like Lina. Don's best friend Cosmo and him have come along way in their success and they don't want Lina to ruin it with her high pitched voice and dumb comments. Don and Lina were known for their silent films but when sound began to make its way into films, Lina's annoying voice would be heard and they wanted to make a musical but Lina could not sing very well at all. Don's new love interest Kathy sings for Lina and they put her voice and singing over Lina's so it sounds good. But when Lina found out it wasn't her voice she was furious. She threatened to sue the company if they took her out of the movie because she signed a contract so they kept her in it just not her voice. After the successful premiere of their musical, Lina went out to sing to the crowd with Kathy singing behind the curtain however, the curtain fell and everyone found out that Lina wasn't the real one singing. Both girls ran away in embarrassment but Don stopped Kathy and told the crowd she was the one with the beautiful voice not Lina. The movie ended with Don and Kathy kissing in front of the poster for their new movie called Singin' in the rain. I loved this movie from start to finish.",

He ends up falling in love with Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), who at first didn't like Gene. throughout the movie there are many terrific dance sequences such as, Make 'em Laugh, performed by Donald O'Conner, who played Don's best friend, Cosmo Brown. Also, Kelly's performance of ""Singin' in the rain"" which is known as one of the greatest scenes of all time. When they get to the talking point in movie history they run into a problem. Lina Lamont can't talk, sing or dance. The studio decides to use Debbie Reynold's voice to voice of Hagen's. This movie was produced and choreographed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen.

413,13 May 2015,codymontanye,8, Classic Musical,"I had always heard about the film Singin' in the Rain and had always heard about how it is a classic. So finally I sat down to watch it and I really enjoyed the film. I got very drawn in at the beginning of the movie because I thought it was a cool concept having a film about actors, especially during such a time a crisis as the period where silent films were switching to sound. I found the humor of the film to be very enjoyable and constant throughout, along with the very entertaining and catchy song queues with a matching amount of entertaining dances. I wasn't very surprised that I enjoyed the film because I do enjoy the occasional musical from time to time, but this has definitely become one of my favorites. I found the movie to be very good and entertaining from beginning to end. My only problem with the movie, which probably isn't a surprise, is about the one musical and dance number towards the end of the movie that just goes on longer than it should have. It was a cool scene with lots of interesting things going on; I just believe it wasn't very necessary and could have been much shorter. Overall though, I do agree that this movie is a classic and I would recommend it to anyone who's ever enjoyed a musical.",

I can honestly say I've never heard the entire title track ""Singing in the Rain"" until watching the whole film and it was stuck in my head for weeks. All of the musical scenes were well choreographed, looked great in color, and were extremely well voiced by the actors and actresses. The cast was largely multi talented and created a great musical in the process of making fun of a bad one.",

The shot composition is artistic, as well as the rich, colorful costumes and backgrounds. This film is shot with technicolor, and it is clear.

It is such a delightfully hilarious film. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you absolutely no time to be bored. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem, the leading lady can't sing and she can't act. Jean Hagen provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended ""Broadway Melody"" number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story. All and all this film was great and is a must for any fan of musicals, or movies period!",

I enjoyed the meta aspect of the film; a movie within a movie, actors acting as actors, etc. It made things interesting and gave us a good look into the technology of the time. The acting was fantastic, and Jean Hagen's shrill voice was especially entertaining, as was Donald O'Connor's comic relief. The musical numbers were very catchy and engaging, and I found myself recognizing most of the songs without having seen the movie prior. The story kept me engaged, as there was never a dull moment between all the singing, humor, and romance.

This is Gene Kelly at his very best and was his best by far but his other films are still good to watch. But let's not forget Donald O'Connor's performance he was just as good but like many others will never be as good as the great Gene Kelly. The songs were catchy and is something that would suck in the audience and make them sing along. Gene Kelly's dance when he sings singin in the rain is just fantastic and leaving me wondering how on earth he can dance like that. Even though Goodfellas is my most favourite movie of all time, i would still have to put singin in the rain up there on my list, but would definitely be my favourite musical as nothing compares to this. It is authentic and has some funny moments in it too but anyone who has not seen this PRETTY PLEASE i beg you to watch this movie.",

Gene Kelly kills as Don and his teeth are so white! The romance in the film feels natural and real, and gives me plenty of warm-fuzzy feelings. Jean Hagen shines as a would-be antagonist, hilarious and beautiful and infuriating all at once. Together they form a colorful cast of characters, made for the big screen. The Technicolor of the film is stunning and brilliant. Despite some plot loopholes (Couldn't Lina still sue at the end?) I still thoroughly enjoyed this production.

It was extremely funny while visually entertaining and show cases how acrobatic he is. I noticed that a lot of his comedic dance moves are quite similar to moves in modern break dancing. At one point he runs up a wall about six feet and back flips off, it was insane. I also of course enjoyed the famous singin' in the rain solo song and dance by Don Lockwood. I actually want to go jump in puddles this summer because of that scene. Great movie and i plan on watching it again sometime.",

The acting, singing and dancing is superb and unforgettable. I mean, How many people haven't seen Gene Kelly's most well known scene where he actually is ""Singin' In The Rain""? Donald O'Connor is excellent as Kelly's best Friend Cosmo, as id Debbie Reynolds as the star struck fan who falls in love with Kelly. Great performances are also given by Jean Hagen as the ditzy blonde and Cyd Charise as the mysterious dancer in the fabulous 13 minute Broadway Melody Ballet. There is no point during this film where you feel like you want to skip to the next chapter on your DVD, every moment is brilliant, and it is a shame that it is not in top 10 of the Imdb's list.

This movie wasn't like that all, it was full of vibrant colors, great comedy, and bold characters; which whom had versatile acts. I enjoyed every bit of it from the beginning to the very end. Everything just fell in place; I wasn't confused or stuck on what was happening. Like most musicals I watch, I become confuse and lost into what I'm watching.

Its about a how a studio deals with the new switch to sound movies, in 1927. I used to watch this film with my great grandfather all the time. I don really like musicals, especially modern ones (like the TV show glee), but Singin' in the Rain is different and I don't really think of it as musical (yes I know it is).

But that doesn't mean i didn't think it was a good movie (if that makes any sense.) Like while i was watching i didn't like it but i could still see why people like it.

It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film.

It was actually a lot more interesting. In Disney or Universal when I was probably 5, I have a picture of me taken under an umbrella next to a streetlight, with a background like in this movie. So I've always known that the movie contained a scene like that were they sang a song called, ""Singin' In The Rain"". I figured that would be the most memorable scene, but actually for me, it was the ""Make Them Laugh"" sequence performed by Donald O'Connor. I really liked how it was choreographed. Donald and Jean Hagen were my favorite actors in this film. The only part of this movie that confused me and I think it could have done without was the whole ""Gotta Dance"" sequence. It was really out of place and unnecessary. Or at the very least, too long. Maybe if they shortened it by like 5 minutes it would have been better. But that's the only thing I didn't like about it.",

Singin' in the Rain was a high-water mark for musicals, and after 1952 there would be few true classics of the genre (just The Band Wagon, Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story and a couple of others). What a pity, especially since Kelly had only been in Hollywood ten years when this was released.",

From the beginning I thought it was so funny and that was consistent all throughout the movie. Not only was the singing fun to watch but the dancing with also great. The movie looked so uniformed that it looked like a few long takes, and some dolly shots.There are so many scene where even the background adds to the visual performance. One of the most important things in this movie was bright colors. Prior to this movie color film wasn't around for that long, and too see how colorful the movie was and nice lite there is no wonder why this is one of the best visually looking films.",

The dancing is rather tepid, the songs are fair, and Donald O'Connor must be an acquired taste. Gene Kelly's dancing with Cyd Charisse is great, but I would rank On the Town, It's Always Fair Weather, An American in Paris, and Brigadoon as far, far superior to this movie.  Check them out - if you loved Singin' in the Rain, these other movies will completely blow you away.",

I find it the best musical feature since ""The Wizard of Oz"", and I have been hoping that I would see it again. This was well written, very musical, and very funny. I also love the way the actors did their characters, especially when it comes down to the last scenes of the movie. When I see the film, I really believe that I would want to get into the beat and sing my heart out. I also like the way the actors did the dances, because they had to be choreographed nicely, and that was exactly what happened. The best part about the movie was when it was near the end. I love the way Don and Kathy did the last song of the film. Also, the last scene with the poster was very nice. I love the way the poster was done, and when I saw Don and Kathy kissing in the end, I loved it so much. Overall, this film is one of the best movies that I have ever seen!",
435,2 November 2014,gcappadona,9, Singin' In the Rain,"I absolutely loved the musical Singin' In The Rain (1952). It was fantastic!!! This film was originally a MGM film produced by Arthur Freed. Freed was also an uncredited produced on The Wizard of Oz. I LOVED the color in this film. It was bright and vibrant. Singin' In The Rain was done in a 3 part Technicolor; shot in three strip black and white printed, printed with dye and then transferred onto a single strip of film. This film was truly amazing and is what I consider to be a classic. It was ranked number 5 on the list of greatest American films in 2007. The only part of the film that I truly didn't appreciate was the end when he was trying to explain his vision of the end of his musical to the producer. I feel like we could have still gotten the point of it if it were a whole lot shorter. Another aspect that I loved, besides the color, was the use of all the difference dances throughout the film. I notice that they used ballroom, tap, ballet, line and whole bunch more. Watching them dance was more entertaining than the actual plot at times! Overall, I think this is the best musical I have watched.",

It was great to find that the actors and actresses used their own voices while singing. I thought this movie was cute, cheesy word but there's no other way for me to describe it. It had to take so much work and time to get all of the dances down for this film. And not to mention COLOR! The film was so clear, it made me feel as if I was in the Pop Art era. All of the strong vibrant colors towards the end of the film was incredible. Though I did feel like the ending dance number was a bit too long, it had great scenes within a scene and I loved how it was a thought that the main character had. It goes to show you have wild ones imagination is. In all I just thought this film was great. Definitely recommended to anyone who's interested.",

If you watch it on a decent sized screen it only compliments what I said. I find it personally interesting to see Hollywood portraying and actually making fun of Hollywood. These things you see in this movie like Don and Lina being a couple for publicity. Is something that goes on in Hollywood pop culture today the movie practically predicts future Hollywood. I love how this movie doesn't take itself to seriously its just a good time from beginning to end. The dancing in this movie is awesome Gene Kelly really seems like a maverick when it comes to dancing. The camera is also cool I like how it shows how grotesque close up shots can be.,

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. For being a person who doesn't normally like musicals I wasn't overwhelmed by the amount of singing that they placed throughout the movie. It was elegantly placed in the movie and was strategically placed so it flowed beautifully into the scene. Scenes with the music were also very dramatic and well thought out, such as the well known ""rain scene"". The only complaint that I would have about this movie is that the end scene tends to drag out a lot longer than it needed to. It felt like it took forever for them to get to the main point for the ending.",

And yet still you can't tell. I have to tell you that if I was that sick I would have tried to do it some other time. The fact that he did feeling that bad and did it that well makes me in awe of him. I have more respect of him and like him even more. Now that is true talent for him to be able to do that. I know that he was a perfectionist but even then people know what they can and can't do. I think that it's great that he fought through the fever and the skriking clothes and he did a wonderful job.

This film is full of classic tunes that they will have stuck in your head for the rest of the week. However some songs and dance sequences can drag on and seem a bit dramatic.Speaking of dragging out I feel that is all the ending was , a big drawn out symphony of dance and song that didn't seem to fit or really feel necessary. The title song is popularized in a more recent film a Clock Work Orange(1971), and having seen that film first i think gave me the wrong preconceived feeling about the song maybe causing me to enjoy it less in this film. However this film definitely leaves your foot tapping and has its own type of hilarity in its dance routines.",

Even if you aren't a fan of these types of movies it is still possible to gather entertainment from this quirky flick. The songs aren't particularly memorable in any sense, besides for maybe two of them, ""Good Morning"" and ""Singin' in the Rain,"" (of course). While it does nothing different from musicals in our generation of films, it was underrated at the time of its release and harbored an aspect that similar musicals had lacked, a plot! Oh yes, a plot to glue everything together, while collective yet overdone, it operated efficiently and did its job of keeping the audiences attention. Looking back upon this movie retrospectively, it might be labeled as a classic, but it is nothing special.",

The first enjoyable piece of this film is without a doubt the music itself. There were several songs such as ""Good Morning"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" that were catchy and are well known even today. I thought the acting was great with every character. I was especially impressed with Donald O'Connor's role of Cosmo. He was a phenomenal supporting actor and was extremely talented dancing, singing, and playing various instruments. This film also features basic elements such as a simple love story between Don and Kathy that evolves throughout the film. I also thought this film was pretty funny overall, especially the ending scene at the theater. Although the character Lina had an annoying voice, I thought she served well as the films main antagonist and provided a humorous role as well. Overall, I can clearly see why ""Singin' in the Rain"" is highly regarded as the greatest American musical. I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.",

The passion for movie making and affection for silent film can be seen in the funny film clips within the film. The transition from silent to talking film was tough. It's sad, real, and funny when the director (film within the film) tries to get the performer to talk into the microphone. Best scene was seeing and hearing the film from the director's point of view; he struggled with new technology and we all can relate to that. Perhaps an editing weakness is that some dancing shots are too long and a few too short. Finally, with awe, wow, that's dancing at its very best, and they make it look fun.",

The film is very upbeat, and it is easy to get into. Something other musicals struggle to do. There is no doubt that the actors in this were extremely talented, that is showed by some of the complex choreography, such as ""make em laugh"". The story itself was about a successful silent movie duo making the transition into the world of sound films. Jealously and desire play a pretty big part in this film, which make it entertaining to watch also. However, some of the dance routines were a bit too long for me. I am not questioning the skill of the actors and dancers, but at some points it became slightly difficult to just stare at people dancing for what seemed like forever, such as the Broadway Meleody Ballet. That was much too long for my taste. Other than that, I did enjoy this film, and I would consider it the trailblazer for musicals.",

It was humorous but still felt real, and I loved that the whole plot was centered around movie making and actors acting as actors in the film. Don was such a likable character, and Lina made for a very humorous addition to the cast. Cathy was likable from the beginning, and audiences could see the chemistry between Kathy and Don. It was nice to finally see them together, not only romantically, but in their careers as well. I also loved that it was a musical, but it felt like it could happen in every day life, just with a few songs and dance numbers thrown in. I love Gene Kelly as an actor, he's handsome and such a lovable guy it's hard not to like a film he has been in, at least for me.",

Unless you live under a rock, you may be familiar with the song, Sinin' in the Rain, which of course comes from this movie. The on- screen romantic duo, Don and Lina try to pursue a romantic to their fans while behind screen, their relationship isn't what it seems to be. When movies start coming out in sound after the debut of The Jazz Singer, Don realizes that he can't have Lina speaking or singing in any of her films. He uses the beautiful voice of a musical singer named Kathy to cover up Lina's nasal sounding voice. Lina soon discovers what is going on and does anything to try to keep her face in film because she wants to be as successful as anyone else.

The singing spans across many genres and styles, and the title song...there's no question as to why it's become common knowledge ""Singing in the rain, and we're happy again!"" and ""Good Mornin' "" (another song in the film). Because even if one hasn't heard or seen the film, they know the musical phrase. This film is beautifully shot, and with it's tracking shots, keeps us, the audience at just enough of a distance that we are engaged yet not dragged into the story. The goal of a musical wasn't to achieve realism, it is meant as a pleasantry to be enjoyed for it's artistic quality. While watching Singin In the Rain, I felt as though I was watching a Broadway show. The camera editing, keeping the audience at just the right angle at all points. Mainly, the music, all of the sound, the facial expressions, and the brilliant use of color. All of those factors contribute to make Singin In the Rain one of the great musicals of all time on film. At the time, the public had had enough after many terrible, poorly though out musicals had been released. Singin in the Rain helped save the genre from dying out entirely. In my opinion. Wonderful film!",

The balance between singing and general conversation/acting in the movie was good, and the songs themselves were not entirely obnoxious. I thoroughly enjoyed the embellishment of Don's past and the simple comic routines in the 'Make Them Laugh"" number, but everyone seemed animated and their emotions were overexaggerated. This was the most obvious in Lina. I found her insufferable. Not just because of her voice but because of her overall attitude. I don't understand why the studio owner didn't just fire her but instead put up with her antics and threats. No sensible person would do such a thing, especially someone who is that persons superior.",

I hadn't heard much about the movie, but the name was very familiar and anything I had heard about the movie was very positive. In the beginning it was a little slow, but as soon as the singing and the dancing started I couldn't not stop smiling, I enjoyed every moment of it. The color of course was amazing, especially compared to all the black and white movies I have been seeing. But the talent of the actors is what makes this movie. Gene Lockwood and Donald O'Connor are a great pair together as they dance many duets, never missing a beat and always staying on key. I found their tap dancing to be amazing. The singing also blew me away; Gene Lockwood Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds are triple threats as the acted, sung, and danced their hearts out. I never thought I would enjoy a musical and was kind of nervous to have to review this movie, but I must say this has to be one of the best movies I have ever see, it really blows me away.

Both immortalize public perceptions if only to delight their fans and bring people to the cinema. In reality, Don barely tolerates it, while Lina, despite thinking of Don beneath her, modestly believes what she sees on screen to enhance her own personality and sense of importance. R. F. Simpson, head of Monumental, dismisses what he thinks is lightning in the pan: a talking picture. It wasn't until The Jazz Singer (1927) became a bona fide hit that resulted in all movie theaters installing sound equipment that R.

Musician Cosmo Brown, Don's best friend, was hired as Monumental's idea director and music director. And during this time, Don secretly starts dating Kathy Selden, a choir girl who tries to make him big in his own picture. Don and Kathy's relationship despite their initial meeting was less than friendly. Cosmo and Kathy help Don, who has made his way through the movie stage to star, try to step into the picture talk stage, with Kathy following his path. However, they have to address technology issues. But the bigger problem is Lina, who will do anything to make sure she also manages to browse the pictures, despite her own incapacity and at the expense of others and others if they stop her, especially Kathy as an off -screen girlfriend and perhaps her famous new picture as a leading woman. 1950s Are My Favorite Decades Since My Brother Was A Kid.",

This movie also gave you a better understanding of how silent films were starting to become outdated compared to the new talk films and problems it caused for actors and film directors. The plot of the film centered around that theme. I also like the sense of realism that they included with Gene Kelly performance when he was walking and singing in the rain and then the cop showed up.

One of my favorite moments from the film is when Don Lockwood is talking about his past in show business, and he always says something that directly contradicts whatever comes up on the screen. There were plenty of other funny moments in the film that I enjoyed as well.

It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way. The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners.

""Good Morning"" is a song we hear a lot these days and I had no idea that this where it came from. It was also a good feeling at the end of the movie to see Lena be embarrassed by everyone at the show. She had the snobby attitude and I just didn't like her at all.

But in Singin' in the Rain the dancing and music goes well with the story line and progression of the movie. The comedy that also is included helps to lighting the movie up and gives it a second side that I enjoy other than just music and dancing. It also helps that Gene Kelly can actually sings the songs well. Another aspect of the movie that I enjoyed is the love triangle between Don, Lina, and Kathy. At first Don acts like he is together with Lina to just keep his fans happy but by the end of the movie he ends up with his true love Kathy.",

The use of tracking shots, and low key lighting create a calm relaxed feel as well. Many classic songs are born from this film and leaves a legacy on each of these actors. The use of different types of lighting is important in the scene where he tells the woman that she's meant for him as one by one he turns on different types of lights creative different lighting effects.

Being that I am a big musical fan I thought this movie was amazing and fun. Some people may find that when characters break out in song in the middle of a conversation it is unrealistic and weird, but that's exactly it! It is unrealistic and that is what makes it so much fun, it takes you into another world, one not like our own. It isn't real life and you can get lost in this world on the screen. Singin in the Rain is no different, while watching this movie it is hard not to get absorbed in the story, and you find yourself smiling and tapping your foot along to the music. A lot of the musical numbers are up beat and playful like ""Make them Laugh"" ""Good Morning"" and of course the famous ""Singin in the Rain"" Not only were the musical numbers great to listen to but they were amazing to watch, the color really popped off the screen. This movie was made with Technicolor and this was still new to the audience because a lot of movies were still being made in black and white at this time. So Singin in the Rain really took advantage of filming in color by making the sets full of color, and having very vibrant costumes. Singin in the Rain is a fun movie to watch and I recommend it to musical lovers and haters alike! This may be the musical to change your mind!",

What shines the most through this film has to be the song and dance numbers. Most people may know about Kelly's ""Singing in the Rain"" number, which is no doubt dreamy with Kelly dancing through the streets after a passion kiss from Reynolds. But the most mesmerizing sequence to me, anyways, has to be the one where Gene Kelly is pitching part of the movie to his director, in which the character he plays is within a dream state. The use of wind and the actresses flowing draped dress to show the two characters entwined with one another is nothing short of incredible. I also found it particularly interesting that many things that were deemed off limits in the Censorship Code (end 1968) were very much present in this film, such as lustful kissing while unmarried and swearing.

The cinematography is great and the color is crisp. I like how they added in the first sound film, ""The Jazz Singer"", saying it was a hit and having some of the actors/actresses doubt how sound films were going to be since they've only done silent films up until then.

She performs at a Party Don's at and he mocks her for her involvement in the performance. She accidentally assaults Ms. Lamont and she's fired. While filming Don finds out and is irate. Soon after the switch to sound film Kathy is found and hired by R. F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell). Kathy then started to dub Lina for a while. Lina still gets all the credit.

The pacing of the film is absolutely spot on with jokes, emotional moments, entertaining musical numbers, impressive achievements in dance that all combine to create perhaps the greatest ""feel-good"" film ever made. I hate to focus on the negative as there are so many positives but I feel that the only thing keeping it from being a perfect film was the extended sequence of the musical within the musical with the ""Gotta Dance"" routine. The interactions between Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor absolutely made the picture and as Kelly goes off on his own the film loses it's plot and it's heart. As an audience member I had fallen in love with Reynolds' and O'Connor's characters and being without them for such a lengthy period just felt wrong. Despite the departure, the film stands as one of the most enjoyable and entertaining works of all-time, I'll just have fast forward through that sequence in the future.",

It was cute though, especially with how colorful and animated the cast was (you have to be, but these people were touching in a way). Everything was bright and cheerful. The sound was very clear, so some of the songs were able to get stuck in my head after a while, and I have no complaints about it.

The use of Lina Lamont to show the negatives of Hollywood, between her diva attitude and the belief that because they are famous anyone and everything belongs to them. The use of Kathy Selden to show the innocence in Hollywood, she was the want to be actress who sees the good in everyone and has a love for the art before knowing the darkness behind the work. Lastly Don Lockwood, he and his friend Cosmo Brown are the good within the industry. Beneath the amazing singing and fantastic choreography is a main message which is not to believe everything you see.

Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) was my favorite of the characters. Hit witty comments and hilarious performance of ""Make Them Laugh"" made him standout although he technically wasn't a main character. The budding romance of Don and Kathy can be seen from the very beginning as a sort of Screwball Comedy way of making them poke fun of each other at first but slowly put aside their differences and fall in love. I loved how, especially in the beginning, they sort of make fun of the materialistic norms of Hollywood. The public's obsession with ""power couples"" and the idea of Lockwood and Lamont as a household name.

I definitely found myself humming some of these tunes later through the week. The story was perfect for a musical, it was lighthearted and fun and you still had a bit of a problem to resolve, but nothing that couldn't be solved with music. The characters were all likable except for the really annoying Lina, played by Jean Hagen, who did a great job. The friendship between Cosmo and Don is palpable and the romance between Don and Kathy is sweet and both of these relationships add to the feel-good feel of the movie as a whole.

It wasn't just one type of, say, a sad musical song. There were funny ones, romantic ones, and sad ones. The sound effects were great, too, they really gave the scenes more humor and drama. The acting was pretty good, too. They all did a fantastic job with showing the different personalities of the characters. Lastly, the camera. This was this movie's flaw. There were long random scenes that were boring and irrelevant. Not only that but there were a lot of shots that were either too close up or too far back.

Enough has been said about all of great scenes and song and dance numbers, but what about the Gene Kelly / Cyd Charisse scene? I never liked the piece and thought it totally stopped the pace of the film. The scene itself seems to have nothing to do with the picture and just drags on and on. I left the movie for many years and in watching it again my opinion of that scene only gets worse. I turned on many people to the film over the years, including my family. The first thing they said when the movie was over was, ""what was with that dream scene? Is just dragged on and on!"" I can only guess the director, Stanley Donnen either thought that somehow presented another view of the toughness of making it in Hollywood, or Gene Kelly used his star power to make sure that number stayed in the film as an ego trip. I would have much rather seen the deleted number with Debbie Reynolds singing to the billboard. Oh well, it's still a great movie. Though it meant something different to audiences who saw this picture only 20-30 years after the advent of talking pictures and who heard these songs in other movies, it still is good family entertainment.",

It incorporates many various types of dance such as jazz, tap, ballet and even a bit of ballroom, swing and salsa. There was also a mini section of African dance.

The musical acts and accompanying dance routines were so well thought out and deeply intricate, being unimpressed is an apparent impossibility.

I defy anyone to watch him in full flow and not be in awe. The title song will lift your heart on the lowest of days and I personally, will never tire of it. A great cast supports Kelly and should be given credit. I remember the first time I heard Lena say ""What do they think we are, dumb or something!"". Sheer joy!

I honestly can't say that I have been as mesmerized by on screen song & dance, like I was during this musical, since I was a child. Genuinely fantastic acting, singing, and dancing, just pure performances. ""Singin'"" reminded me of how much I appreciated actors/actresses who can really just do it all. The songs here are wonderful on their own, really well written lyrics, but their execution is near flawless. This film was so much fun in part due to there always being something going on, each act presented you with something that was aesthetically pleasing or hilarious, to go along with the music. Often scenes delivered all of these elements simultaneously and in impressive fashion. Gene Kelly shows the utmost showmanship as Don Lockwood and knocks every performance out of the park with a smile. Lockwood falls for a charming woman with the voice of an angel, Kathy Selden, played perfectly by Debbie Reynolds. Lockwood's right hand man Mr. Cosmo Brown, played by Donald O'Connor, delivers one of the funniest scenes of the film and shows off real acting chops while doing it.

However, I was greatly surprised by the depth of this film and overall production quality. From the beginning of the movie to the end, it is filled with vivid colors and attractive actors in exotic costumes. But the true message lies in the relationship between Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden. It is not flashy, or glamorous. However it had something that the fan-manifested relationship between Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont did not; it was real. And if I have learned anything in my life it is that ""What is real will prosper."" I heard this from artist XXXTentacion. I believe that Lina's greed lead to her demise. Kathy was not one to follow the public's opinion and liked to be an individual and was individually talented. Don loved this about her and fell in love with her. Lina, out of jealousy of course, wanted to take advantage of Kathy by using her voice to further her success.

It shows this generation changing in different ways. The first one is this changing offers more chance for those new movie actors who has an attractive voice. The second one is the changing on the movie editing. Because the editing for a sound movie is different from a silent movie. editor can use a lot of fantastic edit ways to shape a silent movie, such as thematic montage and classical cutting. But when they edit a sound movie, they have to pay attention to the sound track with the actions. It is a challenge that editing those shots in previous editing ways and also keeping the continuity of the sound track. So in this movie, I see a lot of long shot or so called ""sequence shot"". The third changing is the dialog. In the silent movie, this almost no dialog. That's why in this movie, when the actor said:"" I love you, I love you, I love you"", the audiences didn't like it.

559,16 November 2020,pietoso,9, Moïse Suppose,"Still the best of its kind, Singin' in the Rain is a brilliant example of the innate potential of musical films. Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds, it combines these highly talented artists with a smart, creative script and eternally charming showtunes to produce an often euphoric energy. Kelly and Reynolds make a strong pairing and have more than a few opportunities to display their capacity for dynamic performances both during and between musical sequences. O'Connor, though, hold his own despite a comparatively minor role as Kelly's friend and sidekick; his feature act, ""Make 'Em Laugh"", manages to demonstrate in a nutshell the qualities that make this film so remarkable. Filmed on a set made up like a classic Hollywood studio, O'Connor moves wildly, leaping and pratfalling as he works his way through the piece until he collapses with genuine exhaustion. The actor's interaction with the set around him, as seen also in a number of other scenes throughought the film, lends an additional sensation of presence and texture to the performance; even more impressively this sequence, again like many others, was filmed in nearly a single take. Although this effort apparently left him hospitalized for days afterward, it hopefully isn't too callous to say that it pays off in spades for the viewer. Singin' is also fortunate to have, unlike some musicals of its time, a strong and relatively taut overall plot that not only justifies but also heightens nearly every performance in their context. Even simpler elements such as the sets' background and foreground objects are included with similar competence and attention to detail, playing into a number of scenes in minor but subtly impactful ways, such as when Kelly genteelly bows to a cutout model in a shop window during the title number. Not every piece is as strong as the rest, and later numbers can seem a bit lost and lengthy in the face of earlier inspirations; the ""Beautiful Girl"" sequence in particular seems completely misplaced. Nevertheless, Singin' is otherwise consistently strong throughout, and few moments in any film can match the sheer joy of experiencing its principal actors as they skillfully command the stage.",

Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie.",
568,15 April 2014,ewright228,10, The Best,Singin in the Rain was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am 100% a musical person and they started the first ever musical out with a bang. Not only were the songs excellent but the acting was that much better. Obviously Don and Kathy's characters were portrayed excellently but I thought the actor that portrayed Cosmo Brown absolutely stole the entire movie. Him singing Make Em Laugh was the best part of the entire movie. I also thought that the actress that portrayed Lina did a great job or portraying a ditzy Hollywood lady (and I hope she isn't like that in real life!) Overall I thought this movie was fantastic and I can't wait to watch it again.,
569,8 May 2014,v-doody,10, Singin' in the Rain (1952),"Easily one of my favorite musicals, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is fun, witty, and entertaining throughout the entire film. As far as musicals go, it is difficult to find one more entertaining than ""Singin' in the Rain"". Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds, this musical focuses around a Hollywood studio during their transition from silent films to ""talkies"". ",
570,1 April 2015,Dimitrios0415,9, Musicals made Magical,"An incredibly impressive film, everything about is incredibly fleshed out and well thought out with it. The casting was spot on, creating one of the most believable set of characters in what many would call a ""caricature"" of life. A very energetic film, always keeping the audience engrossed by any means. The comedy is phenomenal, keeping the characters lively, and making the movie a pleasure to the eyes to see. The cinematography is wonderful, set design, hell everything is pot on. The musical numbers are on point, all of them being rather well fit in, it's never ""forced"" and just kind of happens naturally, it keeps the movie flowing, and never breaks the sense of motion the picture has. This is a must watch.",
571,7 May 2014,rivardoman,8, Fabulous Musical,Singin' in the Rain provides a host of lovable characters. It is also a cool history lesson about the birth of talking pictures. The film is shot in brilliant Technicolor so there is a grand variety of color to take in. The story is heart warming and noble. With the integration of dance and music this is an instant classic. The song Singin' in the Rain is Gene Kelley's performance of a lifetime. It is so iconic that people who have never seen the film know the song. The cast is electric and they give every moment everything they've got. The film within the film is entertaining as well. Perfect for all ages this film has something for everyone.Every bit and piece of this film is entertaining.,
572,23 July 2021,nikoplpsk-71753,10, Best musical of all time!,"Singin' in the Rain has everything I want in a musical, good music, an intriguing story, and likeable characters. Currently I have this sitting with Sound of Music as the best musical of all time. The film is charming, and that charm makes it endlessly rewatchable.",

574,27 April 2016,hazelpicture,9, A musical that almost put a bullet into my head.,"I am a sucker for romance, and with this movie, it had one of the best romances I have ever seen. I am not much of a fan for corny songs in between scenes, but I loved the chemistry that was going on between these characters, I loved how they were so different but so similar and how the directer pieced these amazing scenes together, some cheesy, but some so beautifully scaled and woven together. The music was also great, I cannot lie. I am not a fan of choreography and other cheesy things of that nature, but for being a fan of music, I loved the score and the soundtrack for this film. This would be a movie I would have loved to see produced back in the old days",

It was nearing midnight, but finals were over so I thought heck I'll give it a shot even though it's from 1952 and the TV quality was pretty bad.",
576,13 November 2012,alejandrothedirector,10, One of my favorite movie musicals!,"I was never a big fan of musicals as a kid. They often lagged forever and I never really listened to the lyrics. I got very bored, very fast. Then in my junior year of high school, my friends pushed me at the last minute to audition for my school's production of Cabaret and I ended up getting a small role. I started to fall in love with the genre and the following year, I landed the male lead (Professor Henry Higgins) in their production of a show that's considered to be one of the greatest musicals of all time, My Fair Lady. The experience changed me and really made me appreciate the process that goes into making one.",
577,10 May 2013,OrangeLightning,10, Singin' In the Rain,"What a treat to finally be able to see the movie where the famous song comes from, and an excellent film this is. It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once.",
578,10 December 2015,antidepresiv,10, Masterpiece of the classical Hollywood musical,"Marvellous, wonderful, and awe-inspiring, this film does absolutely everything right. The characters are some of the most memorable in film history and the musical numbers will have you standing up, tapping your feet, and singing along to the amazing lyrics. The story revolves around a popular Hollywood actor who is falling in love with an up-and-coming star, during the era when sound was being introduced into film, and might I say, it is shown with brilliance and hilarity. The script for this film had me smiling the whole way through and the multiple camera angles that it pulls off is very surprising for it's time, and makes me appreciate it that much more! ""Singing In The Rain"" is a timeless classic that has now become one of my favorite films of all time.",
579,9 December 2015,ny_willbaker,6, Musicals Aren't For Everyone,"Listen, I am not a fan of musicals. It just isn't my thing. However, due to a film class we were forced to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952). I'm not going to say it was great or even good, but I could tell why it was a classic. It has the great actors, great voices, and a pretty good story line. I went into the film not expecting much comedy but came out laughing at certain scenes. Jean Hagen's character is funny the entire length of the movie and is a really underrated piece I believe. You can say that she is the center of the movie and what the plot centers on. The singing is okay, typical 1940s/50s corny stuff. This movie is certainly a pioneer for the musical genre but not something everyone will get on board with.",
580,6 August 2018,mahimaryal,6, You can watch it once,"I enjoyed it watching the great dance moves and the songs were good. One dance was very funny. This movie for me is to know how people enjoys old movies. Well, this movie will not fulfill your expectation people living in 2018 but it certainly is worth to watch.",
581,25 December 1998,Jade-16,10, The greatest musical with some of the greatest performers ever!,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of, if not the greatest movie musical ever made. With the combined talents of co-director, Stanley Donen, co-stars Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'connor, great ballet dancer Cyd Charisse, and the star, co-director, and co-director of musical staging of the movie, Gene Kelly, came the production of a movie that took the world by ""storm""! No matter how rainy ""Singin' in the Rain"" gets, it outshines some of the greatest movies still today. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a TIMELESS classic!",

583,25 October 2019,kaleidoscope_eyess,8, the last great american musical,"Singin' in the Rain achieved only moderate success after its initial release. Though it was the tenth highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S., it did not show up in any ""10 Best Pictures of the Year"" list, and did not win any Academy Award. It achieved its current legendary success not through its box office or reviews, but through later critics that occupied university classrooms who acclaimed it as the ""best Hollywood musical of all time."" But while classics were often memorized along with their derivatives and influences, Singin' in the Rain, despite paid tribute by numerous later directors, was followed by the demise of classical era of musicals in Hollywood. Singin' in the Rain became not only the apogee of American musicals, but also one of the last great American musicals.",

I am a very big Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor fan and I watch my video of this movie over and over every chance I get.  I am going to end up buying a back up copy for when I wear this one completely out!  The whole story is brilliant, the dance numbers are brilliant and the romance is wonderful.  The only complaint I have is that the broadway number is a bit too long.  I love the part with Cyd Charisse though.  What a great dancer.",
585,15 May 2020,Samya-0618,9, WATCH THIS MUSICAL,"This musical film was so good and I most definitely advice everyone to watch it especially cause there's not really anything to do nowadays and who doesn't love a good musical. I always wanted to watch this movie ever since one of my favorite actors Tom Holland did a scene from this movie in his performance on the show Lip Sync battle. But, I most definitely advice everyone to sit down and watch this good movie.",
586,13 December 2014,ClairePusatere,9, Unparalleled musical,"It is really hard for a musical to grab my attention. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy Singin' in the Rain, my favourite parts of it were the musical numbers. Admittedly, I'm a sucker for tap-dancing, and Donald O'Connor & Gene Kelly are magnificent dancers. Make 'em laugh is simultaneously a jaw-dropping routine, and a work of absolute comedy, and their duo dance scene in the voice training studio is unbelievably well done. The one routine that, while also very well made, didn't really fit in, was the one towards the end. Not only did it feel way too long, it was also out of step with the rest of the film. ",
587,4 April 2011,j-maxon1,7, Singin' in the Rain (1952),I'll be the first to admit that I've never been a fan of musicals and probably never will be but I have to give a lot of respect to this film. The main reason I respect this film so much is because along with all of the singing and dancing there was a story line I could follow and stay interested in. A big reason I don't like musicals is because nobody runs through the streets singing and dancing in real life without being committed to a mental institution. The best part of the movie was when Cosmo was doing his comical routine on the movie set. In my opinion Donald O'Conner stole the show with that performance but he was my favorite character through out the movie. Another thing I liked about the movie was how they showed how the industry worked and the difficulties of bring sound into movies.,
588,3 May 2013,bigcahs93,8, What a glorious feeling,"Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 Arthur Freed Musical directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly. Staring Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood and Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden. I'm not a big musical person, but even i found myself enjoying this movie, of course i prefer the version of the title song used in A Clockwork Orange. It's a very fun movie to watch, even though it's incredibly corny and campy. Like most films of the time, there isn't a lot of camera work that stands out. There are a few shots that stuck with me, like the dream sequence of Don Lockwood's fantasy musical, and some of the early back story scenes, but all-in-all i won't look back on this movie for the camera angles. This movie brings its A- game in its music. The score for the movie is near perfect, with varying genres and perfectly executed choreography. I almost broke my foot trying to tap dance like Gene Kelly. Unfortunately, the quality of the dancing didn't transfer to the story. The story wasn't bad, i liked it, in fact i thought it had a pretty creative concept, but i was expecting a whole lot more coming from a movie which placed 5th on AFI's top 100 movies list. Still though, the movie succeeds, and not even all these flaws can stop the sun in my heart, cause i'm ready for love! 8/10",
589,8 March 2019,chubbygirl-06930,10," Magic, Spice and Everything Nice","The best way to describe this movie is a musical, vibrant Charlie Chaplin styled movie. It truly is. It is impossible to watch it without smiling to yourself and rhyming to the songs. Sarcasm is so on point in this movie that I didn't know I could find such kind of humor from a movie made in 1952. It's wonderful in every sense and is full of energy and positivity that you would desperately want to bathe in the rain one more time.",
590,6 September 2004,desprimadonna,9," facts about actors and actresses behind scenes, how that affected movie","It's raining outside. Every time it rains, i start singing ""with a happy refrain"". Rain takes on a whole new meaning after you have seen this unique and wonderful movie. Whenever I see someone walking down the street in an umbrella, I can't help but envision Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor singing and dancing together. My favorite song from the musical is ""Good Morning"". It is hard to believe that Debbie Reynolds couldn't dance before this movie. I guess that you can't help but dance well when you are taught by someone as good as Fred Astaire. This movie became even more magical to me after I learned about the characters. Debbie Reynolds was only nineteen during the filming of this movie, Gene Kelly was somewhat of a tyrant, and Jean Hagen dubbed herself. If you can see this musical and not like it, then you should examine yourself as a human being. I would have to say that this is one of the greatest musicals of all time.",
591,28 April 2020,Storm3p,8, A Musical for the Ages,"Classic musical with amazing choreography and many well known songs. The movie tells the story of love blooming in the movie industry in 1927 and the aftermath that The Jazz Singer (the first ""talkie"") had on the industry as a whole. The cast is incredible and the chemistry feels as real as if the actors were standing next to you. Combine that with a great story and you have a wonderful movie on your hands that can be watched again and again.",

Theme of love is so far away from Hollywood stereotypes and customary bad-good girl image is not reflected. I believe some movies like A Clockwork Orange, La La Land etc. are inspired by this movie. To sum it up in one word, it's a pure masterpiece.",
593,19 September 2015,doreen-vanhorn,10, All Time Favorite,"Even though this movie was filmed long before my time, it was and always will be one of my favorite movies. The music and dance scenes are spectacular and done in style. It has just the right amount of everything including romance and comedy. Once you listen to the Lena La Mont character's voice and exaggerated New York accent, you can't help but laugh. One of the best scene's (aside from the dance scenes of course) is dictation classes ""I caaaant stan em""). A must see for any generation. Growing up watching old movies with my mother on TV we must have watched this movie a dozen or more times. Once I began working I purchased the VHS of this movie, replaced it with CD and now with my blue ray I need to locate it yet again! Absolutely Worth It!",

This was the first comedy musical I ever watched. And I loved it. The use of dancing, singing and comedy is very entertaining. All the actors are professional and exhibit their skills very well. I like how this film was made and incorporates lots of different scenarios and scenes. The use of cameras at pre-determined locations makes for a steady flow and up close and personal feel. It's very connecting and inspiring to watch. In my eyes it's a hands down American classic and all around great movie.",
