0,5 September 2020,hwm-05554,9," Great movie, I hated every minute of it",This movie is about how drugs can affect your life. Watching this movie really hurts. If you want to convince someone to stop doing drugs / live more healthy this is the movie to do it. Great acting (especially by Ellen Burstyn) and a realistic / convincing story but man is it painful to watch. This is the kind of movie you are happy to have watched at some point but you don't want to rewatch it because it is a real mood killer.,/
1,23 August 2016,planktonrules,10, A visual assault on the senses about the hellishness of addiction.,"Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all star in this incredibly painful film about four people who are chemically dependent. When the film begins, the first three folks are all using heroin yet seem to be reasonably functional. Over the course of the film, their lives begin to disintegrate badly. At the same time, Burstyn plays an older woman who becomes addicted to amphetamines because of an irresponsible doctor who tosses out pills like candy...and she goes from a relatively normal lady to someone who seems like she's crossed over the line from sanity to oblivion.",r

3,30 January 2002,Danfish,10, Like being repeatedly punched in the back of the head by Mike Tyson,"It's difficult to know what to say about Requiem For A Dream. I first saw it in the cinema when it was released in England and I have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. As it was ending I heard a few people crying. My girlfriend and I didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.",v
4,5 April 2017,Horst_In_Translation,8, The ultimate addiction movie,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is an American 100-minute film from 2000 and probably still the most known work by director Darren Aronofsky, who also worked on adapting Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel for the screen here, actually with the late Selby himself. The cast includes Ellen Burstyn, already an Oscar winner at that point, the super stunning Jennifer Connelly, briefly before her Oscar win, and Jared Leto, a recent Oscar winner, so acting talent is certainly enough in here. Still this is a film that is really a lot more about the story and the overall picture than about individual performances, even if Burstyn managed to get nominated again, which was her most recent nomination at the Oscars, maybe even her final. I find it pretty shocking though that the movie did not get any nominations for other cast members (Leto and Connelly would not have been undeserving), for the direction, for the script, also for the make-up and for the truly memorable soundtrack. It is without a doubt one of the very best films from the first year of the new millennium and besides Gladiator it is also probably the most known from that year.",i
5,12 February 2001,Brian Scott Mednick,9," ""Requiem"" Is a Heavyweight","You will not so much as want to take a sip of wine after watching this mesmerizing film about the horrors of drug addiction.  I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film ""Pi,"" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style.  Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia.  Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role, one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in ""The Exorcist.""",e
6,27 February 2011,Leofwine_draca,10, Harrowing,"A tremendous movie, one of those ones that couldn't be improved in any way, shape or form. The script explores the nature of drug addiction on four different characters, showing how it grips and degrades them in different ways.",w
7,30 July 2001,tdao360,10," Brutal, honest, and a must see movie","This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two).  This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.",/

9,8 November 2000,Drakkhen,10, Absolutely Heartbreaking,"I had been looking forward to Aronofsky's follow-up to his critically acclaimed art-house film, Pi, of a few years back and when it did finally open in 1 theatre in Toronto, I gathered a bunch of friends to go down and see it.  Some have never even heard of Pi before.  For others, this would be their first Independent film experience.  However, coming out of the movie, we all agreed that it was one of most powerful piece of contemporary cinema that anyone has seen.",w

11,25 July 2001,Funk Doctor,9, Suicidal,"Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise.",6

14,18 March 2014,powell-yendi,9, Message Received!,"No one can deny that the message in this movie was powerful. It reveals consequences to drug addiction that are unfamiliar to the general public. One consequence that I overlooked until now is that society would rather punish drug addicts than help them. It was interesting to watch those in positions of power as they abused addicts, took advantage of them, and showed utter indifference towards human life and dignity. I would have rated this movie with a 10/10, but one essential element was missing, backgrounds. Out of the four main characters, the movie only delved into the addiction history of one. It would have been nice to learn about the introduction and descent into drug dependence among the other main characters. They all seemed so beautiful and loving, but viewers would be more sympathetic if traumatic events were used to explain how life can take a turn for the worst.",3
15,5 May 2005,nycritic,10, Descending Into Junkie Hell.,"One of the anti-drug slogans in the 80s was ""Just say no,"" and it was given to us by not just the then First Lady, but by a slew of actors, many of them neck-deep into their own drug-induced binges fueled by too much money and a total lack of advice. If this movie had only come out then. Darren Aronofsky's powerful film REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that ultimate slogan who never preaches its message: it just allows its presence to slowly filter itself into the images as the four people at the core of this story slowly begin to rot from the inside out as their ""dreams"" ultimately become replaced by the need to get high.",6

It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.",9
17,29 March 2001,murkyfish,10, Downer Picturesque.,"I just saw Requiem For A Dream and I have to say, I was blown away. Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries, has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction. It is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork, intricately presented on a silver platter. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions.",/
18,22 December 2001,Quinoa1984,10, A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made),"Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance.

19,27 October 2009,Theo Robertson,10, Simply Put This Is A Masterwork,I vaguely heard a few years ago that the director of PI followed it up by making a film based on a novel featuring drug addicts called REQUIEM FOR A DREAM . It got a couple of good reviews but I couldn't help noticing it took another six years for Darren Aronofsky to make another movie entitled THE FOUNTAIN which was one of the worst pieces of pretentious nonsense I ever watched . Still however the cult of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM grew and grew over the years . It is highly rated amongst the prolific voters on this website and has received almost aggressive praise from some quarters . And yet I had serious doubts to its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies and only received a very limited release in cinemas . Certainly I had no real intention of watching it until it appeared on a Sky movie channel . How good was it ? Let me put it like this - 72 hours after seeing it I still can't get it out of my mind ,r

The music score adds to the dark, psychedelic filming. It's the same repeated music but done so perfect it makes you anxious and depressed... just what this movie is trying to do. It does it so well. If you are an addict or know one, it may trigger some unwanted feelings.
Just be prepared to feel like crap after the movie ends.",=
24,13 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9, Powerful,"I like Darren Aronofsky, and Requiem for a Dream is one of his better and I think his most powerful film. I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox",t
25,5 May 2010,bkoganbing,8, No Future At All,Requiem For A Dream is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen in my life. These poor people from two generations are a lot like Anthony Quinn in Requiem For A Heavyweight. As a boxer Quinn in that film saw his career at an end and faced a very unpromising future. These people have no future at all. ,t
26,5 June 2014,SnoopyStyle,8, Disturbing unique vision,Four lives are disintegrating. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother (Ellen Burstyn)'s TV. He and his druggie friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) wants to start selling drugs on their own. She is obsessed with TV infomercial personality Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). She gets a call about her winning a TV contest and she's so excited that she goes on a crash diet. Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend and she's pulled into his scheme.,_
27,27 August 2001,j_mrf,10, Killer Performances by Ellen Burstyn...Darren Aronofsky: Stanley Kubrik has called for you to pull up a chair!,"Oh my, where shall I begin? Experimental film making bursts into mainstream in this dramatic tail of 4 people who find themselves spiraling down the abyss, after experiencing a rendez-vous with the inevitable consequences attributed to drug use and the ill effect it has on its addicts. This one has no happy ending. There's no sugar coating here. Albeit this film packs a harsh, blunt, and sometimes overwhelmingly genuine depiction of the havoc drug addiction can reap on its victims. Despite the disturbing message of the film, I never the less couldn't help but remain fascinated with it's experimental/avant-guard visual style: A smooth, elaborate and languid progression of cinematic eye candy orchestrated to almost resemble a shockumentary, complemented by an impressive and well composed soundtrack. Some of the visual techniques were similar to the ones Aronofsky used in his directorial debut ""Pi"", such as split-screen shots and the use of body cameras filmed at varying speeds. At times, the film seemed more like an acid trip than a feature film. A cry for help is clearly felt throughout the film, from its innocent and promising start, to its hauntingly chilling conclusion. The one scene that really blew me away was the scene where Marion (played by Jennifer Connelley) had just sold her body off for a bag of heroin...As she walks out the door of the apartment, along the corridor, into the elevator, down to the street: one can't help but feel the characters disgust with herself, filthy to the core, what it must feel like at...""ZERO"". The acting performances, especially by both Ellyn Burstyn and Marlon Wayans are simply breakthrough performances that earned critical acclaim across the board. Enough said. If this review alone does not compel you to experience the Film, I will just have to spell it out: PLEASE EXPERIENCE THIS FILM - it may cause an uneasy stomach, but is well worth it - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! 11 out of 10.",u

Both by the critics and by the reviews posted here on IMDB. It is a spectacular film, depressing and very difficult to watch. End of conversation. But after watching the movie again, I have to express my indignation at the injustice committed by the Academy when it gave the Oscar Award to Julia Roberts and did not award the fantastic performance of Ellen Burstyn. In yet another of those historic Hollywood episodes that can never be repaired. Similar to the injustice of 1976, when Rocky was given the Oscar for Best Picture and overlooked the superb Network. Well, that's it. It is my record of indignation that I'm not satisfied with today, 20 years later.",r
29,13 June 2015,hitchcockthelegend,9, Shattering expose of the fallible human condition.,"What to say about Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream that hasn't been said already? Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.",v

Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.",

37,9 September 2002,halfcolombian,1, Pretentious and overrated,"I really can't see what's so great about this movie. It was a big disappointment to me. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't. I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring, I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. (somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie) It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie, they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying ""hey look at me, have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool camera-angles and these amazing close-ups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too."" Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show close-ups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch ""panic in needle park"" or the german movie ""christiane f"" both those movies are far better than this one (and rated lower). I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here. If I see it again I sure hope I discover something new since it feels like I'm the only one in the world who's not impressed with this. Over 40% voted a 10 for this.",
38,31 July 2013,Phillip-Riback,10, A different face of the fear,"Connectivity and complexity of the characters are forcing us to really care (and be shocked) how will this movie end. The culmination of events is fantastic, achieving a phenomenal emphasis on loneliness and decadence of the characters. Innovation in framing the act of drugging leaves a remarkable impression on the viewer. If you ask me, this movie should be played to children in schools. In that way there would definitely be fewer drug addicts, because I do not know a better way of showing how these drugs can destroy someone's life. The music is also phenomenal, and also is the very end of the movie. This is one of those movies that will not leave you indifferent and for sure it is going to reflect on you long after seeing it. That's why this movie might not be everyone's cup of tea.",
39,31 January 2021,Abdulxoxo,7," Bleak, depressing but","Requiem for a dream follows three different story lines that are connected to each other with four different characters; Harry, his mother Sara, his girlfriend Marion and his best friend Tyrone. The movie vividly shows the sensation of what drugs actually do to your body and your life in generally. The four characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, disgusting addictions. The film touches on themes like racism, family conflicts, trust issues, extreme self confidence, neglecting the surroundings and more. The film, however, fails at creating unique and original characters with even the slightest amount of depth. I get that the bleak lighting and dark subject matter is meant to amplify the effect of the film's portrayal of drug addiction, but it left me feeling detached most of the time. It's a series of events within these characters lives that we're watching unfold, but the characters don't have any real goals they're working towards. Any obstacles they face are induced by themselves due to their poor decision making which I guess is the point. At the end of day, this movie tells us nothing we don't already know. However the technical elements were really something else; the cinematography is slick but with odd camera shots/angles; the editing is also great albeit it's gets too comfortable with the use fancy effects; the MVP of the film for me is the music, It is very charmingly and hauntingly scored, having a real presence while also allowing the atmosphere to speak, which it wouldn't have done as effectively if the scoring was louder, brasher and more constant. Requiem for a Dream definitely benefitted from having a more melancholic, lilting and sometimes sparse approach to the music. The main theme is very memorable too.",

This ultra-gritty look at several people's lives degenerating due to drug usage is like nothing that you've ever seen. It's more polished than ""Pi"", but no less eye-popping. As mentally decaying retiree Sara Goldfarb, Ellen Burstyn makes your blood freeze the same way that she did in ""The Exorcist"". Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans also bring to their roles an intensity rarely seen on screen. And let me tell you, I never could have predicted what would happen during those last few minutes! In conclusion, see this movie if you dare. I should warn you that it may knock your breath out.

It will get under your skin, and make you think for days. Nothing is predictable or derivative. Rather, it is just mind blowing creativity. I watch most movies and can think of at least 10 ways they could have been better. When I watched this one, I realized this guy was a master, there was nothing I could have done to improve this. It was very humbling in that regard. It really takes you deep into the mind of an addict in a manner that changed film making for eternity. Standing ovations for this one.

42,12 June 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Divisive,"I have not read the novel upon that this is based upon. This has gotten very mixed reactions... is it almost criminally engaging and effective, or is it MTV-type manipulative drivel? I have to admit, I can't ignore the craftsmanship of this movie, so if you must place me in a booth, I'd be in the former of those two. The stylization is incredible and fitting. Editing and cinematography are accused of being gimmicky, with jump-cuts and this utilizing quite a few different angles and the Snorricam, but I disagree... they're part of Aronofsky's cinematic language. Whether he is a genius or a madman is open to debate. This is not easy to watch. It is rather cruel to the audience, and entirely uncompromising. It deals with addiction, in general, not only to drugs. The writing is impeccable, script, plot and dialog alike. All the characters are credible. The acting is amazing, yes, including Marlon Wayans, and Burstyn is, simply put, excellent, and utterly devastating in her performance. This has masterful music, the score is perfect and beautifully done. The one complaint that I particularly have is that, for three of the four leads, there is little to no explanation in this for how they came to use narcotics. I can imagine many viewers being deeply emotionally affected by this. The language is strong as it gets, and plentiful. While there is not a lot of violence in this, it's filled with disturbing content. There is also graphic sexuality. This is not something to watch if you aren't already relatively hardened. The DVD comes with trailers and TV spots, two of each, deleted scenes with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them, during them, a couple of featurettes, and lastly, a commentary track with the director, and one with Matthew Libatique. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the medium, provided they feel they have the nerves for it. 10/10",

Parallel with this narrative is the narrative about the one addict's mother who is basically a recluse who watches television whole day, everyday. She falls into total derangement which portrays how easily people can be brainwashed by popular media. The musical score is excellent and drenched in strong emotion.",

In fact there is one scene that I simply cannot get out of my head, and that is the one where one of the characters shows his arm, and you discover that there is this huge scar that runs down it from where he has been injecting heroin. In fact there is so much about this film that it is difficult to know where to start. While the film was released in 2000, it was based on a book from the 70s, and I sort of get the impression that the setting of the film was in the 70s, which is probably why Ty and Harry were treated so badly when they ended up in hospital.",

Honestly, I don't think I'll ever see it again--it's that graphic! Still, see the film. Leto is OK; Wayans is (surprisingly) pretty good; Connolly is excellent--I've never liked her until now; and Burstyn is simply superb--a sure Oscar winner if I ever saw one.

Marion Silver surrounds her clothes-designing talent with heroin until only heroin is left. Her descent is painted on her face as her make up becomes more garish with each scene. Tyrone C.

I nonetheless, am convinced a 7 is the highest the film deserves. Aronofsky creates a unique film about the horrors of four characters spiraling into a chaotic conclusion due drug addiction. However, his reliance on creating an extreme, hyperbolic film undermines the movie's appeal. The film seems to be an example of pushing the boundaries simply for the sake of pushing boundaries, as no real message. It would be similar to calling a horror movie a 'classic' because the director showed a bloody decapitation after bloody decapitation or a romance movie being considered a 'classic' because it has 1/2 hour of real sex. Nonsense. The best films are the ones that leave the gory or gruesome details to the imagination yet leave you with an extraordinary impact and a message. I really got no message from the film which is heavily focused on torturing four miserable characters again and again....and again and again. What's the point? The four main actors in the film are phenomenal. Marlon Wayans surprisingly gives a stunning break out performance for someone known for starring trivial and mediocre pop culture comedies. He may have given the best or second best performance of the four. Jennifer Connelly gives a credible performance as a desperate and loyal girlfriend forced to do unthinkable sex acts. The actors strengths are their modesty and ability to succumb themselves to the most demeaning things possible.",

66,31 December 2013,neppie,8, Not much glamorous here,"Too many films dealing with alcohol and addiction are in the ""28 Days"" camp. They glamorize use and recovery rather than take on the reality. ""Requiem"" does not fall into that trap. It accurately portrays what it is like from the perspective of the addict and from the outside. ",
67,8 November 2020,andrewroy-04316,9, A devastating film with exceptional editing and score to drive its impact home,"Requiem for a Dream is the first movie I've ever watched that truly felt like it took a toll on me - that it was truly a hard watch. It is a sad movie, and one that is heavily stylized, which normally I dislike. Here, I think the style amplifies the substance of the film, as Aronofsky uses aggressive editing, warped perspectives, and a propulsive score to highlight the way addiction and desperation accelerate for all the characters throughout the film. This is a narrowly focused film with a clear idea and direction. Each of the four main characters feels they have to get ahead, each for their own reasons, and in their desperation they turn to things they don't truly understand. In this case, drugs are what end up bringing them down, but the film is focused on a much broader idea of consumerism and the constant pressure people feel to be succeeding, to mean something. Harry didn't have to be so aggressive in securing drug suppliers, but he pushed and put them all at jeopardy and coped by becoming addicted. Ellen Burstyn is exceptional as the lead, especially in her monologue about how she feels she has nothing to live for and is yearning for her younger days when she felt a sense of purpose. When she gets a glimmer of hope, that she could be on TV and wear the red dress of her youth, she turns to pills she doesn't understand. The story is nothing remarkable, but it is an unflinching look at people falling deep into a rabbit hole, looking for a quick solution to get them out of it, and falling even deeper. What makes Requiem an exceptional movie is its technical elements. Requiem is a showcase of the power of cinema. The score is fantastic and has a manic energy balancing the hope and desperation the characters feel. The directing and editing is brilliant in showing how the four characters each have their own unique troubles and reasons, but all fall prey to the same general problem. We've seen spirals into drug addiction and losing control before, but it's well done in showing what each character is dreaming of and how they fall, and I haven't seen such a stylistically apt rendering of the phenomenon. Hats off to Aronofsky, because the technical elements accentuate the film's themes perfectly.",

I absolutely loved Requiem for a Dream. I think Darren Aronofsky had a lot of balls to portray such a difficult subject matter, and to do so in such a relentless way. I think Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans were absolutely brilliant in this film, all of them playing roles that are a difficult emotional roller coaster to watch, but that you can't ever really take your eyes off of. The score for this film perfectly compliments the tone and gravity of its subject matter, the creative decisions were perfect at every step along the way, and the film always stays true to its intentions, never deviating to shock or surprise its audience.",

Especially Jared Letos work is stunning although other main characters perform excellently as well.

73,23 September 2001,MiloMindbender,1, Don't believe the tripe!,"While the trailer for this movie was seductive, most notably for its MTV-style quick shots from the film & music, actually watching it was an experience in torture.  This film is one big cliche. Perhaps US raver kids (born after 1980) who have never seen a good film might find this to be ""different"" & ""unusual"", but for anyone that's seen non-US or pre-1980 films, this film is one big bore. It's presentation of drug use is no more complex or realistic than the ""This is your brain on drugs"" PSAs that graced US television sets more than a decade ago. If you're into stream-of-consciousness & lots of style in your drug film check out  ""Naked Lunch"", If you're into the drama & humor of it all then check out ""Trainspotting"", or if you need a dose of pessimism & reality then check out ""Drugstore Cowboy"". Hell, even ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" is better than this mess. The acting is awful, especially Ellen Burstyn.  I was never convinced that her over-the-top performance was anything but acting....if you really want to see a food performance from her check out ""The Last Picture Show"".   What irks me most about the film is that its MTV-style quick cuts & soundtrack really mask the fact that there is really nothing to it.

The film tends to fall into either the 9-10 or 1-2 range based on the reviewer. It's clearly controversial, though I think the high scores make a better case and aligned more closely with my experience. (Many of the low reviews chastise the movie for being apparently unfairly harsh on hard drug use, like a Hollywood version of a D.A.R.E. film, without presenting a more nuanced view of why people begin using drugs in the first place. I think that's an unfair criticism, as the film starts well after most of the characters began using, meaning those reviews are complaining about something that isn't the focus of the movie, at least with respect to most of the characters.)",
86,7 September 2010,Willie-12,9, Powerful And Heartbreaking,"I just finished watching Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream. I don't know why it has taken this long for me to see it. It just has. And now that's it's over, I feel like I just got punched in the face. Maybe even kicked there too. Now I'll admit it. I like the Academy Awards. I do. They may get things wrong often. But if I'm being honest, they get many things right too. However, every now and then they make a mistake that is so egregious, there's no justification for it. And not, at the very least, nominating Requiem for best picture is one of those inexcusable mistakes. Don't get me wrong. I liked Gladiator. In fact, Gladiator (which won best picture for 2000) is a film that exceeded my expectations. There was far more depth found within it than I could have imagined. But when we're talking about the realm of overall societal and cultural relevance and importance, Gladiator does not hold a candle to Requiem...plain and simple. All too often, films get labeled ""important"" just for being edgy and willing to test the boundaries of a difficult subject matter. Well Requiem doesn't just test the boundaries when it comes to portraying the destructiveness of drug addiction, it obliterates them. This really is one of the most important films ever made. Aronofsky pulls no punches here. He is determined, with this film, to lay bare any and all deceptions that are attached to drugs. And he exposes them for what they really are. Slow, painful, and methodical killers. The downward spiral that is exhibited by the characters is both heartbreaking and disturbing. And the acting is phenomenal. There's no doubt that Ellen Burstyn deserved her Oscar nomination. Her performance was just about as realistic as it gets. But I think other nods could have been given as well, especially in regards to Jennifer Connelly. I really don't even have words to describe her performance except to say that it was mesmerizing. I can't imagine how difficult it had to have been for her to prepare for this role. The content is raw and uncompromising. And to be completely honest, some of the scenes are difficult to watch. However, in the end it is the message that rings loud and clear. It is the message that trumps everything else. And it's the message that maybe, just maybe will make someone who is thinking about dabbling in drugs change his or her mind.",

But this is, in my eyes, exactly what this film should be like! It shows every little piece of destruction in the lives of the protagonist, until the final end.

I rate pictures by directors who think they can speak for people they clearly know nothing about much further down the scale than someone that might humbly try in earnest to tackle something more subtle and fail. Films like 'Crash', 'Fight Club', 'Traffic', 'Babel', 'Hotel Rwanda' all have that in common. I can see through the sleek, transparent surface right through to the disingenuous, morally righteous and self-espousing garbage at it's core. The film tells many stories, with one message: Drugs are bad. Stay away. Bad. All it does is serve as a reminder just how Harvard educated Darren Aronofsky is and how little he knows about the real world and / or drug abuse to craft this fantasy and pass it off as an educational lesson. The film is powdered donut disguised as art. It is a void. There is nothing. Nada at it's center. Just a man, the director, using cinema (the ultimate weapon) as a mouthpiece for a sheltered and one dimensional world view. Having rested on his laurels for years after making this film, grinning with pride at his achievement.. I wonder whether.. he ever.. thinks.. about.. what it is.. he... actually.. made... The characters are non existent, except as purely functional devices to propel Aronofsky's 'cool' vision to his target audience, and boy did it hit the target audience all right, this film was lapped up by every film major east and west, degrading a generation of potential artists into thinking this was how it was done. Sad, sad, sad, sad, and not in the way the director intended..",

This is how it should be done. You got characters to care for, relate to, and feel horrible for. Every single character here has it's own tragic story, and it makes your heartbroken. The acting is amazing, the story is perfect, and hands down one of the best films out there to check out. This film is a masterpiece, and it deserves all the love and respect it has. It would be a pity for me to spoil what happens, but this is the kind of content schools should provide kids to watch, instead of a stupid system that we willingly accept. Imagine a child watching this film when they are 12, 13, they most likely never will try drugs, prostitution or robbery. Instead in a corrupted system, you got children watching stuff like Lil Pump, 6ix9ine that straight up promote all of the content that this movie is fighting against!

I stumbled upon it at FYE, watched it, and never wanted to see it again in my life. I wanted the DVD in the trash because it was that powerful and moving.

After all, Darren Aranofski's film based on the novel by Herbert Selby is only stating the obvious Drugs are bad and they will, eventually, lead you into a downward spiral of madness and destroy your life. When talking about the screenplay, Requiem for a Dream has nothing new or extraordinary to offer. We follow the unhealthy actions of 4 people. Jarred Leto and Marlon Wayans star as two Coney Island junkies who want to get rich fast and easy by dealing drugs. Leto's character Harry is doing it all for his beautiful girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) so she can open her very own fashion store, selling her proper designs. Ellen Burstyn puts down an amazing performance as Leto's TV-addicted mother who gets hooked on diet pills after she's made believe to appear on her favorite show. ",

With help from one of the most unsettling scores ever created, this movie should be seen. Like going to an HIV ward at a hospital. Or visiting a homeless shelter and speaking with people. So you know it exists. This movie is straight up hard to watch. But do it for yourself. If anything, to remind yourself how good you really have it.

133,8 November 2019,michaelholland-81075,8, A Deeply Emotional Story About Addiction,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about addiction and the capacity it has to destroy lives. The film explores this idea through the following of four different characters, addiction all gripping them and acting out its malice in distinct ways. Aronofsky produces a highly emotional snapshot into the lives of these characters, and masterful camera work and creative shots display it in full. Aronofsky's use of timelapse, close-ups, and various other imaginative tricks allow the viewer to enter the perception of a drug-fueled mind; which in turn produces greater empathy for the characters as they embark on their downfall. The world Aronofsky creates is deprived and suffocating, prompting the viewer to understand or perhaps reconcile the characters' desire to escape. The acting by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are true and imbued with vehemence. ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is a difficult movie to watch, but is worth viewing on the basis of the quality of the storytelling.",

It's a tear jerker, a stomach churning drama, and an exciting thrill ride. Words can not describe how good this movie is. Saying it's a great movie that is up there as one of the best movies of all time, Goes against the saddening subject that the movie is really about. The movie centers on the life of drug addiction. And there is nothing good let alone great about drug addiction. Addiction is a very complicated and challenging situation for those who are addicted to a substance and those affected by the ones they love who are addicted to a substance. But Darren aronofskys ""requiem for a dream"" shows what the most brutal, maniacal, deprived, and sadistic look at drug addiction can be like. And again to say this movie is great is very contradictory to how it feels to watch this movie. It is very horrifying and sickening to watch at times but the overall movie is great. Those who appreciate film and can understand and appreciate the quality of a story no matter how vile the story may be, will truly love this movie.

If you are bad, you eat vomit. OK? 4. A middle class chick will end up on the other end of a black dildo in order to feed her drug habit. Yawn... I mean, this film says more about what kind of overblown morality Americans are willing to accept in films than anything about drug abuse or its consequences. The anti-drug message descends into hyperbole and farce and I found myself laughing hysterically where I was supposed to be shocked and repulsed. Give me a break. These sanitised stories are just too ridiculous.  As well as this, we are offered the same old, same old routine of white-powder-imagery and colourful-pill-popping. These guys injected something and were bopping around the place, next minute they snort something and they are all on the nod...go figure? And please, the heavy handedness of the junkie losing an arm...spare me, I am not that easily shocked or unaware of symbolism-overkill.",

I'm not as squeamish as I used to be over the sight of physical damage to the human body, but Harry (Jared Leto) sticking that needle into his already severely abused arm caused me to turn my head more than once. I'm reading what an impact this film had on other reviewers here and I'm pretty convinced this is as powerful an anti-drug message as one could find anywhere. ""Trainspotting"" made it's point just as well on the other side of the pond some years earlier, but this one brings it closer to home. Aronofsky's style is manipulative in a way and tended to grate on me after a while, but when you think about it, that's the way it is with addiction. It requires users to use a split screen personality to hide their dependency while engaging in hyper-kinetic repetition to maintain a high. Ellen Burstyn's performance was magnificent and to my thinking, deserved the Oscar that went to Julia Roberts for ""Erin Brokovich"". Leto and Connelly were convincing in their portrayals, though comparing their roles today to a decade ago shows how much they've grown as actors. I haven't seen Wayans as much so I don't want to short change him, but he did a fine job here as well.

175,17 September 2006,moonspinner55,6, Jagged little pills,"Anti-drug drama from director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Hubert Selby, Jr. was no doubt designed to make an impact on (one assumes) young people--what with reckless lovers Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly and drug buddy Marlon Wayans at the forefront--though it's Ellen Burstyn's performance as an elderly pill-popper trying to lose weight that makes the film worthwhile. One can see right away Aronofsky's attraction to this material: told from each of the four addicts' perspectives, it's one long, brutal spiral downward, climaxing in a fury of sucker-punch editing. Burstyn received the film's only Oscar nomination for her bravura portrayal of Leto's television and weight-obsessed mother from Brooklyn who slowly starts to crack apart from uppers (Leto says to her, ""I can hear you grinding your teeth from over here!""). Not a pleasant experience, but full of showmanship. Aronofsky seems to have learned from the best, pulling a Kubrick-esque barrage of tricks from his cinematic manual to create both a narcotizing and a nervy effect. The lulling, deluded daze these characters fall into isn't romanticized--it's seen as a trap; soon, they're just rats in a maze, filmed by Aronofsky through a fish-eye lens. We get insight into the sickness of drug addiction, but little sympathy--perhaps that's why the film isn't moving on a gut level (Burstyn, for instance, already lives in what looks like lower-middle class hell, and the kids have no direction right from the start). As a case study, the movie does falter due to the content of style over substance; however, as a visceral experience, it's a flamboyant triumph. **1/2 from ****",

It also reveals the dark side of the human condition who prefers a drug induced utopia than to do something meaningful to change their lives.

But ultimately, I like movies that force you to either look away or hold on, squirm in your seat and continue absorbing the visual imagery, no matter how beautiful or disturbing. There is rarely a point in this movie when the viewer does not realize that the main characters, although battling different demons are all entering individual downward spirals. Although the uninformed may label this a ""drug"" movie, drugs are only the catalysts which propel the characters into much deeper and interesting battles with their own souls.

185,5 November 2020,briancham1994,9, Brutal and depressing,"This film is an incredible and impactful portrayal of the lives of addicts living in Brooklyn, starting out already tragic and then sliding downwards into something much worse. Of note is the directing. Aronofsky uses many experimental cinematographic and editing techniques borrowed from music videos to put the audience through a distorted and fast-paced experience similar to the drug users. The title is very apt as the addictions are not in isolation but triggered by the pursuing of false hopes and false dreams by the protagonists. The plight of Harry's mother is the most tragic as it is a rather relatable drive for connection, satisfaction and recognition that leads to exploitation and disaster. Ultimately, I would have given this a ten if not for some unfortunate glaring inaccuracies of the medical and legal system that were inserted more for shock value.

192,26 August 2011,johnnyboyz,7, Brash and up-front depiction of an array of people and their connecting with varying forms of drugs; an ambitious piece which works really well.,"One of the more terrifying things about Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is how numerous extras appear to just 'exist' amidst proceedings and merely get on with their own lives, fleetingly mentioning the odd happening from recent times, as they intermingle with the film's core characters whom are witnessing their own existences fall apart at their very seams. Watching these people going about their business on screen reminds us of the same way those figures, or people, in our nightmares mingle around in the background as we dream on; we're aware of them, much like the central characters are aware of them here, but we cannot really make them out nor indeed really work out what it is they're saying or plotting. Often, we feel at the mercy of them; we pray that they're not speaking or plotting against us. Such are the situations the numerous leads, in this rather eye-opening urban drama that does carry an hallucinogenic, nightmarish quality, eventually come to bury themselves in; a sad, sorrowful film depicting the gradual falling away from reality of a number of people because of drugs or drug addiction in varying forms as well as falsified dream chasing.",

The rampant use of split screen very effectively, quickly, and cleverly underscores the selfishness of characters.  They are literally separated from one another within the film frame.  The repetition of certain elements--the rapid fire images that accompany every hit of heroin taken by the characters--is cool.  Less cool are these crazy point of view shots, lots of odd angles.

It is a very controversial movie which deals with drug addiction in a very crude and realistic manner. The director was not afraid of tackling the issue of drug addiction and presenting it in a raw manner. The different kinds of addictions are addressed as you have a lot of sniffing, injecting, and coke dealing on the one hand, and medical prescript weight pills on the other hand so the different kind of addictions are addressed here and yes the medical drug pills are considered as equally addictive and harmful as the rest. At the end they both can have devastating results and the director tackles these issues. The film is very original and has several interesting filming sequences which just add to the overall mood of the movie giving it a more realistic and crude vision as do the dream sequences and hallucinations. At first it might seem as the movie is going nowhere if not paid attention too but at the end every sequence adds up to the mood of the film creating a crude and real film sending out a mirror message of the effects that drug addiction has.

207,30 September 2020,TheFilmWook,10, Captivating Horror,"Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies that I can clearly look back upon, and remember the first time I watched it. It was with my roommates in college (Go Sun Devils) and once the end credits rolled, the room was completely silent. No one said a thing for a good five minutes. The images going through my head was similar to Jay Rabinowitz' editing in the film. Having gone through a battle with drug addiction myself, this one hit home pretty damn hard. That was six years ago. Now when I watch Requiem for a Dream, I admire it for what it is. A brilliantly told story about four Coney Islanders whose lives spiral out of control over the course of a single year. Addiction slowly breaks them down and we, the audience, have front row seats to the horror show that slowly develops. The camera angles and quick cuts practically teleport us into their dark, drug fueled world and the music in the background makes every shot eerie. Clint Mansell provides that score which intensifies every scene by 100. There are no winners in this film. If you think you will find redemption in these characters, stop looking, because you will find none. The phenomenal acting alone will make you cringe in your chair for each character makes you believe that they are truly suffering horribly. Ellen Burstyn provides the performance of a lifetime. One of the best acting performances I have ever seen in a movie. Leto, Connelly and Wayans are brilliant as well, but Burstyn takes the cake in this one. If you are in a good mood and watch this, it will be gone by the time this is over. If you watch in a bad mood, it will only get worse. I know I am not making the film seem enticing, but if you have not seen it, I suggest you do. Like it or not you will come away with something. It is the way in which the story is told, the editing, score and acting that come together to create the masterpiece that is Requiem for a Dream.",

Jared Leto stars as Harry Goldfarb who along with his girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) go into the drug-selling gig. At first it was intended to make a quick buck so that they could open up a new business because like life itself you have to spend money in order to make money. While this is happening, Harry's mother Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) becomes addicted to television and sweets, she becomes fixated on losing weight so that she can get into her little red dress so that she could become famous and become a national star on television. This leads her to an unhealthy addiction to diet pills.

211,8 March 2019,robertemerald,9, Powerful anti-drug movie is a masterpiece,"Many of the techniques used in this movie (a lot!) would now be very familiar to watchers of music videos and horror, whilst others would be similarly familiar from other sources. However given this movie is now over 17 years old one has to wonder at the genius who created it. The techniques never throw the overall continuity or conformity to style out of whack, and strangely, despite the radical nature of the techniques, the movie never really descends into farce or comedy, attaining a satirical line above that perhaps, especially because we sympathise with the lead characters all of whom are basically good, but more than that, telling its story with heart, sincerity and determination. It's almost operatic toward the superb end. The important message comes across thanks to the casting characters and their very honest performances, from normal to disintegration. It's an eccentric movie, a joy to be swept away in. It's also seriously disturbing by its end and not suitable for children of any age. It's a timely swipe at the times it represents as well, the dangers of suburban isolation and loneliness in New York in 2000, and has a profound cultural importance.

To throw the viewer off from this we have a bunch of fun and new camera tricks, some of which are also heavily borrowed from other films(Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction for example), but these eventually seem to get boring and repetitive, how many times do we have to watch a closeup of drug preparation, method of ingestion, dialated pupil. As for the performances Jared Leto can't compare to the better written and more likeable characters that are presented by Ewen McGreggor in Trainspotting and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Basketball Diaries.  The other characters are convincing enough but that really doesn't matter because by the end of the film I wanted all of them to put a gun in their mouth and end their wasted lives, especially during the way to long climactic montage of them all hitting rock bottom.

221,6 September 2016,miguelneto-74936,9," harrowing , heavy , incredible.","Anguished, was What do I feel watching Requiem for a Dream is one of the heavy and troublesome movies I watched, the film tells the story of Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are a couple in love, whose dream set up a small business and live happily ever after. But both are addicted to heroin, which makes Harry repeatedly pawn the television of his mother (Ellen Burstyn), to get money. the film is heavy, whenever they inject drugs, shows his eyes dilating, and it bothered me a lot, the way that Darren Aronofsky films is very good, he does great things with the camera, there are times when it leaves the film with fast camera, especially when they use drugs, the cast is excellent, Jared Leto this great, one of his best performances in his career, Jennifer Connelly this excellent, Marlon Wayans this great also, more emphasis is Ellen Burstyn this impeccable, you WHAT feel her character feels, especially when he shows his hallucinations, such as refrigerator moving, she saw the favorite program, he is amazing, the cast still has Christopher McDonald, Louisse Lasser, Sean Gullete and etc, the soundtrack is simply incredible, the theme music is expectable, it thee pursues the whole movie, and this track feeling of end of the world is something inexplicable, because I feel that one of the best film music theme, the film has good dialogues plus some are half boring, I found some affected performances, and some unnecessary moments, the more it does not draw the incredible quality of the film, the final scene we see in the character of Jared Leto armless is very strong, I too bother the scene he injects heroin in his wound in the arm, and when he shows the damage is agonizing, Requiem for a Dream is one of the best in Seculo 21 films, has disturbing moments, and very heavy scenes, plus has a great direction, a cast excellent, impeccable performance of Ellen Burstyn who deserved to win the Oscar for best actress (in my opinion it was better than Julia Roberts).

226,16 June 2010,jacklmauro,2, Sadism as Film Genre,"You don't need to pine for nothing but old MGM musicals to be disgusted by the blatant sadism fueling movies like this. That is to say, I fully accept the tragic decline of characters in keeping with a story, nor do I object to miserable endings when the course dictates that. I'm a grown-up. But. There is something nasty going on with films like this, wherein increasingly grotesque displays of characters undergoing horror are presented as 'reality', or, God help us, art. No good storyteller in any medium actually needs to show us, inch by inch, how low his characters are going. As in this dreadful, pretentious movie. Reviews here sensibly bring out the absurd mistakes, like Burstyn's Etc without anaesthesia or the drug dealer's ridiculous giving away of heroin for a little sex, yet seem to miss that these absurdities are there to serve the director's sadistic purpose: to make everyone suffer really badly, and right in front of us. That is not film-making. That is an adolescent's idea of being shocking and gritty, and it's insulting all around. Give me a story that realistically portrays these very dreams falling apart, with some humanity and not as an exercise in visual cruelty, and I'm on board. This? It's prurient garbage under the guise of serious movie-making.",

231,8 September 2017,mshavzin,1," When I first saw this, I thought it was deep. Then I turned twenty.","This film reminds me of ""Catcher in the Rye"" being one of those things that seem incredibly important and original when you are fifteen or so, and then totally silly as soon as you grow up. Yes, big, Big, BIG tragedy. OOOOH...the drug world. Yes, drugs are bad. Well, for the most part drugs are bad. So is unprocessed sugar. Judging by the size of the average buttock in America and the UK, people need to worry a whole lot more about how much they eat then drugs as far as health is concerned. I wonder if in its time people saw ""reefer madness"" a film where a gifted young man with a dream ends up in jail, and his girlfriend in a mental ward, all because they smoked a joint, and reacted just like people did to this film. Lets look at this thing objectively; Point 1)This movie seems to miss is the purpose of bail. You do not actually need to post the entire amount. Also, you get all of that money BACK as soon as the person in question appears at the trial date. The state doesn't KEEP bail money. Its not a fine. Its collateral. Point 2) And possibly the DUMBEST thing in the film is how Harry and Tyrone are arrested because a doctor saw the signs of drug use. What exactly are they arrested for? It is NOT illegal to be a drug user. Its only illegal to possess drugs. It doesn't matter if you use them or not. What are they charged with? Track marks? Possessing money? Driving? I mean honestly. The message of the film is if you use drugs you will fail at everything you try to accomplish, loose your limbs and your mind. OK, I applaud the attempt to keep people away from dangerous substances, but making up nonsense scenarios to do it is just lame.",

234,19 August 2011,asda-man,10, We've got a winner!,"Like ""Black Swan"", another compelling masterpiece by Darren, ""Requiem For A Dream"" is a descent into madness. Only this is even more depressing, as the characters begin on a high (no pun intended) with there dreams seemingly close to their grasp and feeling great but end up plummeting down to the bottom thanks to addiction, with their dreams coming right down with them. ""Requiem For A Dream"" is a masterpiece by Darren Aronofsky, it combines everything often overlooked by other film-makers (visuals, sound etc.) to make an unforgettable film that punches you right in the stomach and eventually pushes through right after the credits roll.",

236,12 November 2004,PyrolyticCarbon,6," Overly stylised, but a much cleaner second half with a harrowing ending.","For the most part this movie ambles along, caught up in a few stylistic touches that it doesn't quite manage to deliver.

237,13 June 2015,brianberta,8, A horrifying but honest look at drug use,"I found Requiem For a Dream to be much more scarier than most modern horror movies nowadays. It is probably one of the most horrifying horror movies created. This movie details how 4 people have their lives ruined as a result of repeated drug use. The film shows how their actions affect their lives. This is a movie where you can't watch it a second time. It has nothing to do with its quality but the reason is because you don't know if you can put yourself through another viewing of it. What makes this film so horrifying is that the events that are detailed can actually happen and they have happened before. The first 2/3 of this are bearable but near the end, it gets highly frightening as it shows how their actions effected them. The acting is magnificent. All main characters give strong performances which allow us to get more immersed in certain parts of it. Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely did amazing performances and Marlon Waynes was a shocker in such a serious role. Sara (played by Ellyn Burnstyn) is the saddest character who we feel sorry for the most. She plays someone who gets addicted to diet pills her doctor prescribes. I felt sorry for the rest of the characters but I felt sorry for Sara much more. This film must be watched by everyone. Not just for its frightening imagery but for its educational value. In school, we've been told ""don't do drugs"" several times in but in order to know how truly frightening the consequences of drug use can be, you need to watch this film. It's hard to watch but it will stick with you long after viewing it. This is by far the most powerful anti-drug film ever made.",
238,5 August 2001,Spleen,2," Well, THAT was a waste of a good title.","You need a strong stomach for this film, just as you need a strong stomach to drink seawater.  In both cases, what's the point?  Watching Aronofsky's film isn't so much like drinking seawater as being rubbed all over with sandpaper - a treatment painful beyond belief, yet superficial.  No doubt Aronofsky STARTED with the intention of saying something about the Oprah Winfrey ""follow your dream"" mentality, but that idea was lost or buried in the early planning stages; all that he successfully demonstrates is how bad heroin and those colourful little weight loss tablets are.  For most people it's not worth finding out.  We already knew THAT they were bad.  If a few souls are dissuaded from taking these substances I suppose that will justify the film, more than compensating for my suffering and for the fact that it's a rotten work of art.",

You know how sometimes you like a film, but if someone asks you why, you just can't seem to give a straight answer? Well this film was that for me. I can't even begin to explain why I liked this film. I just do. The whole movie just felt like a psychedelic art film about drugs. Seeing as how drugs put all of them towards a path of death and destruction of their lives, it really leaves you with the bad feeling at the pit of your stomach. And thus I say this: just watch it.

247,5 February 2008,richard_sleboe,10, Florida Oranges,"Like all good trips, ""Requiem for a Dream"" takes us to another world. As Harry, Marion, and Sara are devoured by their addiction, they trade the bright Coney Island light for the gloom of their dusty apartments and the shady side streets of Mermaid Avenue. I rarely ache for a happy end, but in this case I did. ""Requiem"" is no less than a masterpiece, but it's painted in the darkest colors in the palette. Maverick director Darren Aronofsky finds new and compelling images for what drugs can do to you. He makes wide use of visual gimmicks including split screen, keyhole frames, cash-register style cross-fading, god's-eye crane shots, and image overlay. But while such gadgets often come across as strained and showy, he uses them to great advantage. Among his most haunting feats is having the actors run around with the camera strapped to their bodies, yielding a head shot that makes the characters appear strangely lifeless, like puppets on invisible strings. Shattering performances by Jared Leto and Jennifer Conelly. They make a ravishing, if ghostly couple indeed. Outstanding appearances by Ellen Burstyn and Christopher MacDonald in supporting roles. The Kronos Quartet provides a piercing score. Movies as profound and inventive as this one are hard to find.",

252,27 April 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Personal perception,"To the extreme, it is the most direct feeling after watching the movie. The twigs and branches of loneliness and desire closely intertwined the characters in the play. In addition to eating, her mother only had to chat on TV to comfort her. The sudden notice became a ray of light in her darkness, which pushed her deep into her heart and revealed her morbidity. After taking drugs, the mother wore a fisheye lens in a red dress and lipstick, shaking the magic, like a poppy flower swaying before the audience years ago. The real magic may be the refrigerator that was always thought to be blown, and it will only be destroyed by a sound.
Throwing away the coat of funeral, the film gave me a new ""experience"" of drugs. I do n't think depression or nausea are enough to accurately explain the ""chic"" of the film. It is more like a natural disgust and rejection after investigation. A series of shots such as drug powder, injection, pupil dilation, etc., the corresponding blood veins, manic anxiety and even unscrupulous means allow viewers to experience the dizziness, despair and hysteria directly through rapid editing and soundtrack. Behind the unusual editing and dazed soundtrack seems to be the manipulator of the puppet, making you struggle and nervous in front of the screen. Finally, there is a kind of ""see through"" and resolute resistance. Such a rich level of editing and equipment compulsively makes this ""anti-drug movie"" artistically unparalleled!
After watching the movie, I have been immersed in the depression of the characters in the play. They all have good wishes, the mother's arms, their own clothing store, and their family lovers, but they all embarked on the path of destruction. Is it the necessity of drugs? I do n't think so. I think the director wanted to insinuate a whole morbidity and frustration. After drug use, they started to have a bit of ""enjoyment"" and ""satisfaction"", which was beyond ordinary feelings, because maybe they had Happy satiety and sense of attainment. Mental barrenness and lesions are silent but pervasive in every cubic air of breath. As the medical staff at the end feeds the mother but discusses the winning or losing of gambling, perhaps the overall morbidity is more terrifying than the actual flu and the machine is lethal.",

Ellen Burtsyn's thick slice of ham cut close to the bone was embarrassing, and her New York ""Jewish"" accent coming in a film released in the year 2000 struck me as outrageous!

Stuff like this happens everyday to people and they hardly ever recover. While no one dies in the film, that almost makes it worse considering the hell and terror all of the characters have been through. While it's considered a drama, Requiem has horror touches that are executed in the way you would see in real life: psychological horror (the hallucinations and paranoia), physical torture (electroshock therapy, amputation, sodomy), and even hauntings (more hallucinations).

And yet it also became more apparent to me how poorly Requiem compares to the British masterpiece, particularly in the method of direction by Darren Aronofsky.

Sad endings sometimes make the viewer cry, but the viewer can always assume that either the story is over or that there's still the possibility of light at the end of the tunnel. With this movie those are not options. The viewer knows that the hole in which the characters got themselves in just keeps getting infinitely bigger, and that the possibility of getting out of that hole became inexistent a long time ago. What makes this feeling so peculiar is that this movie is real. Addiction is real and Aronofsky did an incredible job portraying how it snatches away the dignity of human beings. Watching someone become a slave of their own mind and knowing that hoping is futile is why this film breaks the viewer's heart in such a peculiar way.",

265,27 August 2018,Gresh854,10, The Most Traumatizing A Movie Can Possibly Get,"Requiem for a Dream is the most psychologically brain-damaging drama of all-time. The finale of this film is like watching your soul get squeezed, as your heart slowly shatters, and once it's all finally stopped, you're left only with a gutless and empty feeling inside. Now this is why Aronofsky wins. Say whatever you want about the guy glorifying everything in his films, but at least he does it with a passion that can not be matched by any other director. He will get his message out no matter the odds-in this case, the odds being his choice to insert some of the most stressful sequences ever put to film. The first time I saw this film was somewhere around my mid-High-School experience, and it's frightened me away from ever even remotely thinking about doing hardcore drugs, ever since. FYI, to teachers who are trying to teach kids not to do drugs, don't show your lame-ass, cheesy, cheaply made, 90s-released, ""Drugs Aren't Cool!"" documentary videos, just show them Requiem for a Dream, and I guarantee every single human being who sees it will be scared of doing drugs for a solid and long amount of time. The fact that this movie didn't even get nominated at the Academy Awards for best editing is an absolute sin, cause the editing in this is some of the most effectively creative but also stressfully poignant, quick-cut mastery ever achieved. And when you add the impeccably dreamy cinematography and EPIC original score by Clint Mansell with the editing, voilà, you have yourself a technical masterpiece. It's no surprise that Ellen Burstyn got nominated for an Oscar for this movie, she brings home a marvelous performance, and so does Leto, Connelly, and quite surprisingly Wayans. Whenever someone asks me-and this is rhetorical, nobody really has asked me this-""What's the most screwed up, repulsive, nerve-racking, and unorthodox movie you've ever seen?"" Typically I answer with Requiem for a Dream (or mother!, but that's for a whole other review/discussion). But trust me, when I say this, I mean that as the upmost apical, and positive compliment. If there was such thing as an A double or even triple plus, I'd reward this movie with it, but since that doesn't exist, I guess we're going to have to rate this the proper way: (Verdict: A+)",

It takes four relatively happy and balanced individuals and it watches almost clinically as each one messes up his existence through addiction.,

Camera angles are distorted, as are the images, to create a sense of the disorientation that comes with drug use. Edits are used to show the repetition of the drug taking itself, as well as the various arrests. And the various stories, none of which end well, are convincingly told, so that the downward spiral they all take - some due to choices to get high, some due to bad choices over dieting pills, are all convincing, if neccesarily going to the worst extreme. The soundtrack also adds to the disjointed ness and disorientation of the film.

As long as we let ourselves be defined by television, Madison Avenue, Ms. Spears, and Ms. Hilton, we'll always look for something that at least makes us feel better about ourselves for awhile. Depending on your experience, this movie is either a warning or biography. I give the producers and director all the credit in the world for going ahead with this film. It couldn't have been easy. The criminal world of Hip Hop alone and the Mafiosa record moguls could've done a lot to stop it. I'm surprised it got made. The actors are flawless.

The plot has been summarized enough here, but suffice it to say that it's one of the grimmest, heaviest films I've seen  and I've seen a fair amount. Requiem plays as an agonizing train wreck that ends without any hope whatsoever for our main characters.

I watched Requiem For a Dream after watching Black Swan, also directed by Darren Aronofsky. I must say that this is one of the best psychological movies you will ever see. An elderly woman receives an opportunity to appear on television due to which she decides to lose some weight in order to appear beautiful on air. As dieting fails to deliver results, she decides to go to a ""doctor"" who gives her pills that will magically reduce her weight. What she doesn't realize is that the pills are probably drugs that will not benefit her in the long run. Although the movie is filmed on a meagre budget, it has a brilliant cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Ellen Burstyn gives a truly mesmerizing performance which probably deserved an Oscar. The soundtrack is spectacular and the main theme is one of the most widely used tunes in sports videos.

Each one of them is on a dangerous free-fall but none of the stubborn addicts can change their habits. Shot in Coney Island, Brooklyn with a unique style and flair, Darren Aronofsky directs a very effective film. Although lead actors Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are good in the movie, it is Ellen Burstyn as the widowed mother who steals the show with a powerful performance.

316,12 February 2009,peterkowalski,10, Because we all are addicted to something,"I watched this movie after 9 years and it has in deed been overdue. I've heard many amazing things about it and perhaps this is partly why I enjoyed it that much; or maybe it's because it's really, really good. The plot is based on 4 lives of 4 people, lives that amalgamate with each other and complete each other. Harry and his friend Tyrone are drug addicts and basically best friends: Marion is Harry's girlfriend. Her family is wealthy, but her ambitions are much bigger: she doesn't want to lead the life she is supposed to lead. Sara is Harry's single mother, and her story is exactly the same, it ends the same, and the reasons behind her addiction are exactly the same as in her son's case. Sara is addicted to the past: when she is given a chance to be in a TV show, which has been her dream, she puts herself through hell and ultimately looses her own identity along with her mind. Even though she always has a smile on her face, she is alone and unhappy; and she sees a chance to change her life, and tell millions of viewers how proud she is of her own son - which seems to be the only thing she wants in life. And that longing is her true addiction: pills she begins taking are nothing but one step closer to achieving relief. Harry, on the other hand, carries a lot of guilt from the past he is unable to cope with: and even though he finds true love, he turns his back on it as soon as the option of his girlfriend sleeping with another man for money emerges. Ty is also addicted to the past: he cannot shake off the memories of his long-gone mother and the promises he had made still haunt him. Marion is addicted to her own independence, but when Harry disappears, the physical side of heroin addiction finds her and she is forced to do things she wouldn't think of doing 3 seasons before. The movie begins in summer, goes through fall and finally winter; spring never comes. There is no happy end of any kind: Sara seems to lost her mind and the only thing she remembers are the happy visions of her on stage with her beloved son, basking in the fake lights of reflectors. Ty gets into jail. Harry looses his hand and, even worse, Marion. She is shown literally clinging to the pack of drugs, falling asleep with a smile on her face. Disturbing images, shocking plot and depressing twists contrast with amazingly shot scenery: it is one of those movies you can freeze at any given time, print the scene and hang it on the wall. I believe this movie is an absolute must for anybody: especially for the young ones. Don't make no mistake. This movie WILL shock you. It will make you cry. It will make you discover feelings you never thought you had. It will make you feel alive.",

Not only are the cast amazing the sheer brilliance of storytelling is pure class. Everyone has an addiction to something and this just hits that home it doesn't necessarily mean it's completely as bad as others. People deal with it differently. The music for me is what makes this a powerhouse - The Kronos Quartet drives the emotional impact of this film with each season that it descends on.

339,5 July 2001,mil ceulemans,3, un-believable,"first off, this movie is a bit repetitive, which is of course on par with the idea of showing people being addicted. (mother likes her chocolates a bit too much first (later on she turns to diet pills), her son and his friends are into harddrugs of various kinds) and all are constantly on the outlook for more of the same kind. the problem with movies about drug-addicts is that however alien their situation may be to a person watching it, the person still needs to feel compassion or have similar feelings towards them in order for the movie to 'succeed'. alas, no such thing here. the main characters (apart from the great acting mother) all look like the lousy but oh so trendy 'actors' you see in commercials or videoclips (there are plenty of references to both, but i can't think of a single one right now that wasn't a cliché or that wouldn't be beaten senselessly by the overall sublimeness of 'magnolia' or the freshness 'trainspotting' had at the time). so, the movie's protagonists are mostly 20+ year olds with nothing on their hands but trying to score and use drugs (and screwing even that simple given up). the characters just don't come alive for me and the obligatory postmodernistic/ nihilistic/ apocalyptic downward spiral which sets in is boring as hell to watch through even though (or just because) the whole thing is cut up much like a flashy videoclip. obviously so to hide the lack of insight on behalf of the makers (though i have to say here i absolutely loved 'Pi', aranofsky's debut which i rate very highly). the crappy finale was partly stolen from kubrick's overrated 'eyes wide shut' and it almost made me laugh because it was so unbelievably unbelievable to see the various plots develop as they did. on a more positive note, the soundtrack is great though, as was Pi's (nevertheless aphex twin would eat mansell any day of the week, kronos quartet or no, but the soundtrack is without a doubt the most intriguing facet to this otherwise one-dimensional fiasco) - go see terry gilliam's 'fear and loathing in las vegas' instead if you want a 'bad trip'. at least gilliam doesn't solely rely on clichés or gimmickry and even when he does, it always shows somehow that he doesn't take himself too seriously or that he uses the right amount of irony / cynicism, something mr aranofsky obviously has yet to master).",

The story is a quite simple that two stories are running parallel to go for drug and become addicted. Main characters are four actors: Harry (Jared Leto) & his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone earn their living on the drug and theft and Harry is getting to become addicted to drugs with his girlfriend Marion. I like a scene that Harry and Marion are laying down talking their love, which is a very fantastic scene in this film. Although they are talking drugs, there exists something true and pure sense of love between them; he loves his girlfriend the best in the world and make the most of every minutes with their love. This scene would emphasize the last half that drugs break up their relationship.",

358,12 October 2020,maryam-sohrab,9, A great movie,Ive watched some of Aronofsky's films and see some similarities between this and other movies. First one is the use of music to have deeper influence on the audience. The Requirem of a deeam music which is one of the best can really make you feel sadness and anxiety felt by chatacters in the movie. Second one is showing charactors' psycological problems and disease in which aronofsky is the best to do so. At the end of all his movies plus this one you find yourself stuck in the plot and charactors even see yourself as part of the film and feel the sorrow and anxiety as if you were part of the film. I liked the movie and how it showed people's life changing as a result of drug addiction. Good job Mr. ARONOFSKY!,

It also does a really good job of bringing you into the world of the characters so you feel like your with them in every moment seeing what they're seeing and feeling what they're feeling. It's so heartbreaking in what I think Aronofsky intended. The music is also so haunting that theme song almost made me cry at the end. This movie is beautiful big and epic.

I found the idea of making a parallel between street drugs and controlled drugs a very smart base for this story - In one hand, Harry goes down a trail of addiction, business from drug then go onto a swirl down to hell ... while Sara on weight loss pills become addicted and end up hallucinating and being hospitalized.

A simple tale of spiraling addiction told with absolute devastating honesty. A warning to all human beings. The music reverberates with that Lux Aeterna strings riff that eventually feels like a terrible line of poetry as the story spirals down into a very dark place indeed. Aronofsky is one of the must interesting directors in the world today. He obviously cares only about making pieces of art and this time he has made one so dark and powerful that it should come with a warning label. I was expecting something along the lines of Drugstore cowboy - but this is much much more powerful stuff and much darker. Just wow.,

As another person has commented I felt I was being bluntly manipulated into a situation where I would feel 'devastated' by the whole experience.

377,8 July 2007,jboothmillard,9, Requiem for a Dream,"Trainspotting showed the pleasure of them, Blow showed the selling of them, and this clever drama shows the effects of addiction to drugs, from director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler). Basically the story revolves around the lives of four individual characters, and what they experience as they take their quantities of drugs. These are Sara Goldfarb (The Exorcist's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Burstyn) who is hooked on game shows and sweet foods, desperate to lose weight with diet pills, that she gets addicted to and overdoses, causing hallucinations, increased loneliness, and eventually she goes to hospital, after going to the game show studio and looking a drugged up wreck. Then her heroin addict son Harry (American Psycho's Jared Leto), along with his friend Tyrone C. Love (Scary Movie's Marlon Wayans) who both pawn a TV for a new one, and for drugs money, and Harry unfortunately is victim to overdose, but Tyrone pays the price being put in prison for possession. Finally, Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (A Beautiful Mind's Jennifer Connelly) is helping with their drug dealing and profit, but is degrading herself by spending time at stag parties with other men. Also starring Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Tappy Tibbons, Happiness's Louise Lasser as Ada and Volcano's Keith David as Little John. This film uses clever split-screen technique, fast paced montage-like moments, especially when characters take their drugs, huge close-ups and exaggerated sound effects, all creating convincing highs and lows of drug taking. The cast is very good, the film is almost all disturbing, the music by Clint Mansell throughout is great, and the theme is very powerful, it has been called one of the most depressing films ever made, but it is an essential drama to see.

Aronofsky uses every trick he learned in film school: split screens, fast motion, slow motion, extreme closeups, trick photography, repetitive shots, etc. While he no doubt thinks he is being innovative, his repeated attempts to call attention to himself is simply annoying and distracting.

Ellen Burstyn's performance is absolutely mind-boggling. The scene where she dances around in the clown makeup and the red dress is chilling. I can't imagine the depths of her soul that she had to reach to get this performance, and it is an absolute travesty that she didn't win the Best Actress for it. Jennifer Connolley does a great job as well- this woman is seriously underrated. The scene where she tears apart the apartment looking for a fix conveys desperation like you rarely see on screen. I love how Aronofsky makes you get close to the characters, but not *too* close...and how his directing and editing mimics the descent into hell.

The only two that top it are the first two Godfather movies, which I see as classics in the overall genre of film. But, for those who only see Requiem for a Dream as a drug related movie, I say ""Wake up!"" The movie focuses on four main characters: Sara Goldfarb, an aging elderly woman who has no one special in her life but her son, and is a widow, and tries to fill the void in her life by watching television. After receiving a phone call (most likely a hoax) from a television company which 'discovers' (ha yeah right....just like i win a free laptop by picking out a picture of Paris hilton) stars and talents for television stars...finally finds some meaning in her life aside from her only son, Harry (Jared Leto). Meanwhile, three drug junkies....Harry Goldfarb, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wyans, in my opinion, the only worthwhile performance he's ever given) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) each face different dreams: Harrry's dreams of making it big, to not have to haul off his mother's TV every week to make bread to deal with his increasing drug addiction and to put it in his own words, to just make his mother happy.....Tryone's dream of becoming something more than just a street peddler, and Marion's dream of being loved by her parents', to replace her parents love of money with something tangible...like their daughter. Each dream is shattered by a complex unraveling of the said dreams....ruined and drowned by their own addictions. The cinematography is the best I have ever seen...and the acting is by far, superior.

I had heard good things about this, but I was not too impressed with Pi, so overall I was expecting it to be ""good"" at best. But, seeing this movie was an experience unlike ""seeing a movie"" had ever been before in my life. Seeing this movie is more an experience that rivals losing your virginity, attending a parent's funeral, or getting in a car accident. I almost left the theater to throw up not out of disgust (although there were a few disgusting images), but out of anxiety. I've never walked out of a movie, and almost had to leave my first one not because of how bad it was, but because of how good it was. I was sitting there thinking ""please be over.. please be over.."", so that I could leave. Now that I've had a day to recover, I am going to go see it again, I should be detached just barely enough to appreciate the technique this time.

It's hard to watch when things escalate in the end of the film but you don't even want to blink your eyes because you're so enamored and not able to escape the pure horror when the lives of the four protagonists go with increasing spead down the drain. The music gets faster, the narrating gets faster, the cuts get faster, the reality and sound blur faster but never too much to let zhe viewer get lost in the story. The downfall can't be stopped anymore. In the end the protagonists are just helpless and so is the audience. It's a knightmare that became a movie and has the same effect too.

417,14 November 2018,hashishtripathi-76937,9, Requiem For a Dream - A Review,"It takes a considerable degree of cinematic madness to venture to make a movie like Requiem for a Dream. The reckless psychological thriller by Darren Aronofsky stands tall and bold in its title of the 9th most disturbing movie of all time according to esteemed sources. Only having been the director of Pi before Requiem, it seems to have been a leap for Aronofsky to take up a project about dark subjects like those the movie reeks of.
Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) receives a crank call about having won a spot on one of the electrifying commercials and lucky draw shows she obsesses over out of fascination. Being the spick-and-span old lady she is, she unknowingly begins speed pills to lose weight and struggle into her favourite red dress. Meanwhile her son, a spoiled junkie called Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), opens a drug business with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) to help his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) set up her own boutique. The three miserable youngsters and Sara slip into grave miseries and ricochet into the darkest mirage of their dreams in a requiem that plays its purpose effectively.
There is not one performance in the movie that fails to compete with the other three. Leto and Connelly are perfectly successful in their chemistry and tragedy. Burstyn takes up a terrific makeover since her The Exorcist role years ago and her performance never lets you get comfortable in your seat.
Aronofsky and his hip-hop montage are amusing portrayals of the movie's disturbing theme. The exactitude of the pressure created by Hubert Selby Jr (also the author of the novel of that inspired the film) and Aronofsky's screenplay and Clint Mansell's music and Matthew Libatique's cinematography are what keep you interested enough till the movie takes a deep dark drift. A drift which will make every conversation about drug films excluding Requiem for a Dream incomplete.
Here is a movie so unabashed, so heavy, I say it should be a lesson to all those teenagers looking to experiment. Because it explores the dark side of the dark world. Because it tells you how you face the music after the fun. How letting lose into an addiction can cost you your freedom, body, mind and soul.",
418,5 November 2001,jonnyc621,2, The Most Over rated Art House Flick of 2000,"I had high hopes for this one.  I loved Aronofsky's debut, Pi.  I would consider it among the ten most original films ever made.  So, I went into this movie expecting a lot.  Maybe it was my own fault.  So I didn't like it.  No big deal.  Then everyone and their film school professor latches on to the film and is calling it one of the greatest films ever made.  What a load of bs!  Aronofsky just rehashes all of the camera techniques that made Pi so enjoyable to watch.  Sure, they were original in Pi and I love that movie, BUT if I wanted to see Pi again then I would have watched my DVD. And the story is ridiculous! SPOILER ALERT!  There's a drug shortage in New York!  A drug shortage!  How on Earth could their ever be a drug shortage in New York!  This comes a little past mid-way into the film and completely derails any kind of credibility the filmmakers were trying to establish. If you enjoyed those after-school, don't do drugs television programs, then you'll enjoy this one.  It will be the wildest one you've ever seen. However, when all is said and done, that's just what it is... an after school special.",

I know this has been said but the academy should be very ashamed for not awarding Ellen Burstyn HER Oscar. She was robbed. I only started watching them again this year to see Scorsese receive HIS statues (at last). Burstyns performance was just so heart wrenching I'm still amazed 7yrs later. Jared Leto showed us that he can really act, Jennifer Connelly (when she picks the right roles) can knocked you out and does so here and Marlon Wayons turns out a star making dramatic performance. Christopher Macdonald also deserves a big mention as Tappy Tibbons who i read that a lot of his lines were improvised. Nothing else to say but go watch it!",

Jared Leto plays her son and Jennifer Connelly his girlfriend with equal brilliance in this impressively well made film of stunning expressionism enhancing the impact of the brutal realism. The music adds to it, but it's the visualization of the drama, the dreams, the illusions and the hopelessness of the incompatibility of reality with your dreams that creates the lasting impression, finally suggesting that in spite of all the dreams will always get the better of you as after all a better reality than reality. A shockingly thought-provoking film with stunning performances.

Not only was Julia's role a sterotypical one (one woman against ""the world"") it also couldn't hold a candle to Ellen Burstyn's role as a diet pill addicted woman in Requiem.  Really, the only drug movie that has ever really disturbed me emotionally and scared me (and I saw the rated version).  However, the elements of fright are used well to weave a tale of four separate people dealing with their own drug problems. Much better than the overpolished, cliched ""Traffic"", ""Requiem for a Dream"" seems more realistic and really shows almost the worst case scenario among people using drugs for recreational use. A good movie for high schoolers and up to see who are contemplating using drugs because this shows what it can do to any person's life.

436,30 September 2009,ferbs54,7, The Dark Ladder,"Delineating a quadruple downhill spiral of escalating drug addiction and hallucinatory madness, Darren Aronofsky's 2000 offering, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is some pretty intense stuff indeed. In it, Oscar-nominated Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a sweet Jewish senior living in Brighton Beach who becomes devastatingly hooked on purple, blue, orange and green diet pills, while her son (Jared Leto), his pal (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) go down what Joni Mitchell has referred to as ""the dark ladder"" of heroin addiction. This interesting dual story line is made even more effective by the great acting jobs turned in by the film's four principals, and the very flashy, stylized direction that Aronofsky employs, utilizing split screens, slo- and fast-motion photography, rotating camera work, fish-eye lenses, strobe lights, etc. Burstyn surely did deserve her Oscar nomination in this role, and the film, I feel, should have been singled out for its direction, photography and editing, as well...not to mention the incredible makeup job that Judy Chin & Co. accomplished, turning the still-glamorous Burstyn of 2000 into an overweight senior, and then a gaunt and grizzled hag. So yes, the film IS intense, but ""not for the squeamish,"" as has been reported? With the exception of one fork shoved through a hand, and the quite unpleasant sight of Jared shooting up into a very messed-up (gangrenous?) arm, the picture is not at all quease inducing. By the film's end, the dreams of all four characters (the perfect dope score, a dress shop, to be on TV) lie crushed beneath a cold and miserable reality. This is a picture that transpires over the course of a summer, fall and winter; for its four main, pitiful characters, there is no spring....",
437,20 January 2005,nelliebell-1,1, The Plague of Blood,"This movie is as you might suspect given the many reviews which are before and after not quite what it appears to be and that is why whatever it looks or sounds like it is not what you get.The confusing premise is that there is virtually no ability to balance the tables.What does that mean?This movie is not honest,thats what it means.The horrible opening scene has this young white male attempting as we are to quickly learn, to virtually steal his mothers television set and sell it for a few bucks so he might buy drugs.His mother has the television chained to the radiator so as not to lose touch with whatever reality the television represents but passes the key to of all people her son the drug addict who is threatening her from behind a locked door.Here the author establishes a relationship that is in a nutshell what he is trying to figure out.Though this young person,her son is nothing but a liar and everyone associated with him share and provide impetus for his and there lying ways even unto the death of the other through lethal injection.That lethal injection is a main lining shot of Heroin which these characters are guilty of being part of which involves a loss of a limb as well as the death of the lie that they lived under.However the other end of this film is the relationship of the television to this kids mother which as it turns out is made to appear to be selling drugs of another sort.The weight reducing hysteria turns television and its programs into an accomplice to another kind of tragedy that involves the power of suggestion and the extremely cruel and aggressive nature of having influence over society by way of its programing and power as such.The film continues to show such grossly unjust and even indecent characterizations that we are really forced to look elsewhere for the answer as to the reason why this would exist at all,even if it is dishonest.This film is championing getting your way and believing it is indeed your way even as you are about to die of a overdose of heroin.The source then is not a reliable gauge as to value and contributes to the demise of society by providing a influence that is indecent.It is one thing in this world that we live in to be taken advantage of but it is another to be forced into an idealogical state that does not provide anything else but that.How can in all the world a system baring witness to undue influence,unfair power over and a lie to boot be looked at as the source of anything but an inhuman aggregate with gang like assumptions.It is not so smart to suggest that this film is providing the eclipse of life unto death even through its title,""Requiem for a Dream"".The Dream it seams is dead,however that may not be the worst thing because it hardly had a chance in this world of the power of suggestion and here we are touching upon reality and the effect it has had upon the human race.If you get put off by this well this is what this picture is about.It is symbolic of an intent to kill honesty it is also bears witness to a foreign power in the likes of the influence of the technology that bears malice for its victims and is of such a predatory nature as to be a threat to civilization and even world peace.This discourse is not for the benefit of the writer nor does it provide an answer to anything but getting ones way which is why I cannot give the writer credit but can suggest that the influence written of, got what it wanted, credit for getting its way.Everything in its wake is lessened by such an accomplishment and even more so we are provided with a lie.This film has all the earmarks of a spear aimed at the heart of the human race.Just so you will know with so much power you must be selling something?I do not recommend this film outside of its political importance and that I believe you should be warned as well because it is a living breathing reality that made for this film and it is a living breathing reality that made it possible.That is what this film did, it provided an ability to know reality and if your wise enough you will be forewarned of its coming.Don't sell the sell short it means what it suggests and it intends to convince you that it means to get its way.",

The film is so realistic, once it sucks you in you almost feel as the characters in the movie do and thats what a good movie should do. This movie should be shown to teens when they get in high school or maybe even 8th grade. Instead of d.a.r.e class or teachers and parents preaching to their students to not take drugs they should just show this film, if i would have seen this i probably would have never even touched pot, the movie frightened me and i was 23 when i first saw it.

449,8 July 2001,jhclues,9, Hard Look at Drug Addiction,"The devastating, downward spiral of four individuals addicted to drugs is examined in lurid detail in `Requiem for a Dream,' directed by Darren Aronofsky, who paints a vivid picture of the physical and psychological damage that can be incurred by unrestrained chemical abuse.  And it's not a pretty picture.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are young and in love, but they have a problem; their recreational drug use has long since passed the point of `recreation,' and the sad part is, they don't seem to realize it, or if they do, they're into big time denial.  Harry's friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is in the same situation, and together they spend most of their time and resources trying to score their next fix.  Even the fact that Harry has to repeatedly hock his own mother's television set for drug money doesn't clue them in to how deep their addiction runs; which is a truly sad state of affairs.",

The characters demanded no sympathy and deserved their respective fates. If the movie's aim was to show how bad drugs are, or can be, then it is stating the obvious. If meant as a lesson to prospective drug users, the wrong medium was chosen to send such a message. There was a hint of glamor and excitement when dealing with the decadence that was the characters. I am no sadist and in no way enjoyed watching imbicile youngsters destroy themselves in a movie that glamorizes the process. Utterly despicable.",

It is uncompromising in its telling of how drug addiction can creep into the lives of both the seemingly responsible and the irresponsible alike. Do not take the ""Bob Dole approach"" to this movie and dismiss it as a glorification of drug use,at face value. This movie is a warning! It says ""Yeah,drugs can be fun,or in Elen Burynst case,helpful...but before you realize what's happened,your lost down the rabbit hole!"" also the musical score that plays thru the movie is simplistic yet brilliant! Just like the movie,it starts out slow and meticulous,gradually becoming more and more louder and complicated leading into a symphonic cacophony. If you get this movie,it will disturb you as much as entertain!",
453,24 November 2008,mario_c,10," ""Feed me Sara, Feed me...""","It's a great drama about dreams, hopes, disillusions, loss of control, and self destruction. When you become a slave of your own dreams and are disposable to do everything to achieve them you will for sure do things you weren't expecting and you might lose control. If this single loss turns into a permanent loss of control you will not control your life anymore because those ""little things"" which were ""nothing special"" become into an addiction. Once addicted you will have this feeling always asking you to feed it... Like that scene where the TV show's host and the ""contestant SARA"" ask to the ""addicted SARA"": ""Feed me Sara, Feed me...""! I enjoyed that scene because I think it was great portraying her state of addiction. In the particular case of this character what turned her into this state was her obsession with the TV show and her loneliness. The other characters were drugs and their ambition to make money. Nevertheless in both cases there's a dream that becomes a nightmare because of their loss of control. ",

Requiem for a Dream is just as troubling and carries even more critical acclaim, with its powerhouse image of spiralling drug abuse. Commonly referred to as a ""drug film"", Requiem for a Dream does not take the same path as other drug films, instead it is an entirely different way of looking at a harrowing situation. Adapted from Hubert Selby's novel, Requiem for a Dream focuses on four drug abusers, who are all in some related to one-an-other.

But the depictions of head trips and hallucinations were perfect. Also the quality of acting was quite high. I think that the storyline was a bit too pessimistic though and I think that there were several glitches. The sexual humiliation of Marion was not too realistic looking at the size of the device and that game that the two girls including the first timer Marion were forced to perform.

Films such as these may tarnish my soul and forever render me socially dysfunctional.  Yet I cannot deny their scope and power. Requiem for a Dream is not about drugs, but the carnal distractions that prevent us from realizing our dreams.  It is a requiem because it is the soundtrack to a life unfulfilled.  This is a very musical film, from the rhythmic portrayals of habit to Clint Mansell's (Pop Will Eat Itself) fitting score, often nearly drowning out the film's dialogue.

A widowed TV-junkie, a sheltered young woman with over-bearing parents, the boyfriend who just wants to make his girlfriend happy and a man who dreams of making his mother proud -- these aren't junkies, but rather, victims of their addictions who, as much as they try to overcome it and make things better, only end up worsening their troubles, brilliantly illustrating the devastating effects of any addiction, be it narcotics or otherwise.",

The characters are about as fleshed out as your standard uninteresting junkie usually is and while Ellen Burstyn gives a decent performance with this material, her downward trajectory as a diet pill popping old lady who wants to be on television - is so over the top that it becomes almost comedic.

Oddly, I was painfully satisfied with the end--though I will not share the conclusion. The content is very explicit throughout, from sex scenes to brutality, but I didn't find any of it to be excessively unnecessary. Jared Leto does a fantastic job, along with Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, and Marlon Wayans. (It was really weird to see a Wayans brother in such a dramatic film! Nonetheless, he did very well.)

It reminded me of writings by Jerzy Kozinski who committed suicide at 57, understandably, because he clearly hated life as witnessed by the cr@p that HE wrote. (Hey, this is MY opinion, you can have a different opinion, that's fine with me.) Why Ellen Burstyn acted in this movie is beyond me, she must have needed the money. The portrayals of the drug addicts was a tad too 'black and white' and life is NEVER b/w. As for the portrayals of the medical staff and the police, I don't buy it. I notice they did the 'usual thang' and make the SOUTHERNER doctors/jailers/police the 'bad' ones. Typical. Are there bad doctors, medical staff, jailers and police? Sure, but not as often as 'movie/tv makers' would have you believe. Also, the drug addicts were portrayed more as 'victims' then as 'self annihilators'. The only character I felt sorry for was Ellen Burstyn's. I am thankful I was working on my website when this cr@p was on Amazon Instant Video or I wouldn't have watched it past the first five minutes. UGH is the 'key word' to describe this.

The movie takes you down into the lives of four differently motivated drug addicts, showing their experiences through their own eyes so that you would feel every moment of ecstasy and every pang of pain.

I think this film will always stick with me for one reason or another. The film is hardly pleasant, but in many ways it is about as perfect a modern film as I have seen. Yes, this is high praise, but it is well deserved. The acting especially by Ellen Burstyn as the ever hopeful Sara Goldfarb is amazing in its seductiveness and completeness. Burstyn was Sara Goldfarb, a lonely woman longing for past memories and future moments. The actors suck us right into the story and combined with Aronofsky's direction, Clint Mansell's haunting use of the Kronos Quartet, Jay Rabinowitz's editing and Matthew Libatique's camera-work the results are spell-bounding. The story about 4 people and their battles with addiction is heartbreaking, but it is the way it achieves this effect that sticks in my mind. The last 15 minutes are an exercise in editing, cinematography and craftsmanship by the cast and crew.

Ellen Burstyn is just incredible in her role as sarah and jared leto and jennyfer conelly are also very good. I think the clear message of this movie is anti-drugs but also found many elements important of this movie as how dreams can fall to pieces, people can be naive and loneliness can make you desperate and even can drive you to destruction in the case of sara. I felt also so depressed for the characters of conelly and leto that were in love in such a pure way and then became depraved and destructed by their addictions. Addictions destroy everything but not only addiction for drugs but also for people, for feeling right and loved or even happy. The last scene had me crying till the credits ended and i just couldn't stop. Its so heartbreaking to watch how this characters that seemed full of dreams, happiness and hopes at the beginning could end up becoming so pathetic and dark. When letos character lost his arm i was impressed and also when conelly was selling her body for drugs and sara was in the siquiatric hospital, those were painful scenes to watch. But i think one scene that also got me crumble was the part when conelly and leto talk on the phone and by then you just know nothing will be the same again for them. The photography and effects were just excellent and managed to drive you crazy but also to know what characters were feeling when they were high. This movie must be watched because as hard as it is important for everyone to realize how dangerous drugs really are and how addictions and extremes can destroy your life no matter how old or smart you think you are.",

531,7 October 2008,Tattedmex,10, Best of it's Kind,"In my opinion, the best movie that deals with the pain of drug addiction. Multiple aspects of drugs were covered, the dealer who isn't addicted, those addicted to illegal drugs, and the less emphasized in our society, addiction to prescription drugs. The 1st act introduces the characters, establishes what's going on, and introduces the conflict. Act 2 has the characters finding temporary solutions to their problems, until things get worse. Act 3 has the characters taking drastic measures to try and overcome but end up taking huge losses. The realism of the situations and excellent performances make this movie hit close to home whether you can relate or not. Having had friends who've spiraled out of control due to drug addiction, I know what can happen when people lose control to substance abuse. Ellen Burstyn's performance was was exceptional, you can feel her loneliness and angst right through the screen. The montage near the end depicting the descent to the very rock bottom for the characters was a thing of beauty. The camera work was excellent, POV shots, frame shots, hand-held, it all worked seamlessly to bring out the emotions. Definitely not a movie for the weak at heart, but a must see for anyone who likes movies that make you think and feel.",

We see ourselves standing over the lives of four people who plan to finally achieve their dreams, for three of them it's money, for one it is to finally have the spot light reflecting off of her decaying skin as she gets a phone call stating that she is going to be on television. The movie is beautifully shot in a bizarre but unique manner. The characters are very human in their reactions and remain unpredictable and, in some cases, repulsive.

533,14 February 2009,bbqballs,7, A Powerful tell-all film,"Well the title says it all doesn't it, this movie certainly was a Requiem for a Dream. What a brutal, tell-all film that does not hold back on anything. This film focuses on the issue of Drug addiction, and how something that started out as a small addiction can lead to catastrophic events beyond belief. Throughout the movie I was thinking: ""by the end of this film I am going to be in shock"", but to be honest I was not as shocked or in disbelief as much as I thought I would be. But I think this is due to the fact that these days we have been subjected to so much knowledge about drug addiction and we see so much of it that I guess we have become desensitized to the issue since the movie was made (2000). Overall it was a very well made film with some really interesting camera and editing techniques that you do not see used that much anymore. The acting was amazing; Ellen Burstyn who played Sara Goldfarb was absolutely brilliant. Jennifer Connelly was astonishing as Marion Silver, My god that would have been a hard role to play but wow did she pull it off, and quite fantastically I might add.

Drugs are bad m'kay, and they can destroy your life. Everyone knows that, there is nothing clever, deep or profound about this trash.

Julia Roberts could never, ever produce a performance as excoriatingly painful as this. I was totally and utterly blown away by Ellen Burstyn. The rest of the cast are just as good, with particular praise for Jennifer Connelly. She is a beautiful girl who goes to hell, a tragic waste so common in real life. And that's the point of this film. It's all too real for comfort. I don't know when I'll be able to watch this magnificent film again, but I know I will have to.

Jared Leto actually did a wonderful job as the lead, and of course Ellen Burstyn stole the show. As a first time viewer of the movie with a friend of mine, my friend commented that she thought it was such a great movie, but could never watch it again. It's understandable.

It's not great acting, classic cinematography or touch wood direction but shattering & shocking portrayal of chasing American Dream & its tragic reality which still lingers in memory when I first watched that Oscar winning gem of Sam Mendes. Now here Darren Aronofsky has done something which has done same impact on your mind. In a very poignant way he jumbled up sharp cutting images of various dreams about love, fame, money, beauty, and hope into the lives of four central characters of the film. How Drugs entered into each character's life & fulfill their escape route to their dream till they all reached doom is also something very original in theme as well as projection. Every actor has done nice justice to their complex roles but it's Ellen Burstyn as a lonely old age mother who breathes in the character of Mrs. Sara Goldfarb 7 it's really an Oscar worthy act. Film is technically appealing with cool visuals & sound adding substance to the film. Infect it is the execution of that visual style which has captured the essence of this brilliant script by Hubert Selby Jr. This is dark modern classic which may become another dark drug film if the viewer is not involved in itIts emotional & subjective involvement into this tragedy which makes it altogether different experience.",

Especially in the beginning it is very weird at times and one cannot really say that it is exciting or entertaining. What one can say with certainty though, is that it is at all times interesting and that it remains above mediocrity at all times. The sad thing about this film is, that the distortions our addict friends' go through, do not always work in the films pace and sometimes they do the film more wrong than right. What makes this otherwise only' OK movie, worth watching in the end though, is a great and disturbing finale, which will make you remember this film for a long time after you have seen it. In the case of Requiem for a Dream, the ending definitely made the film, which as a whole might be an interesting character study for some and possibly great prevention for anyone who thinks about taking drugs. If you like these kind of films I can recommend Bully and Irreversible to you, which I thought were both better than this one. But then again, you could also try Memento, which is even more over-rated on IMDB, than this film. Requiem for gets a Dream 8,5 out of 10 ranking at # 46 and Memento gets a 8,7 ranking at # 14 in the IMDB top 250. My guess is that these two films are that high in the top 250, because the ending of a film, is the last thing you see and the endings of those films really stick around in your head and in Requiem's case it is really a top notch ending.

558,25 October 2011,lleeric,10, A powerful masterpiece,"This movie was seriously so good. I never really liked any of Darren Aronofsky's movies but now i'm starting to rewatch them and i actually really like them. But this movie is the best of Darren Aronofsky. OK, first of all, this movie was so powerful and a perfect drama. this movie is about drug addiction and how these 4 people are addicted to them and their lives slowly turn pointless and worse. The reason this movie is so powerful is because it teaches people how drugs are bad and it gets you nowhere. This movie was also really really sad. The lives of these people were so good at the beginning but slowly turned worse and worse. Its sad how these people never really got what they wanted and their lives just got so pointless. I really recommend this movie to anyone and this might change your feeling about drugs. this movie is against drugs. The characters were also so well played and well acted and i think sarah's character was the best and she should've won an Oscar. Story: 10 character:10",

564,28 July 2005,Duzniak38,10, It will break your heart....,"Wow. This movie totally blew me away. I have to say it has been one of the most brutal, shocking yet refreshing films I have ever viewed. The film partly revolves around the life of Sara Goldfarb, a TV junkie who loves chocolate, who lives alone in her apartment. We witness various events in her life, such as how her son Harry steals her television set from her to pawn it for drug money, how much she loves her T.V. shows (JUICE) and her sugary junk foods, and how she really is a vulnerable, depressed and lonely woman. After winning an opportunity to appear on a television show, she posts her application form and then chooses a stunning red dress which she wore to Harry's graduation as the outfit which she will wear on television. Being a little overweight, the dress does not quite fit, so, determined to be able to wear the dress in time for her T.V. appearance, Sara decides to go on a diet. An eggs and grapefruit diet. The experience is gruelling for her, and we see how over the weeks she struggles over the temptation to indulge in doughnuts and chocolates. However when Sara's refrigerator starts jumping around and scaring her to death, she decides to do something. She decides to go to a doctor and start taking diet pills. Four pills which will be her meals for the day. Taking them seems not so bad at first. But what we discover over the days and weeks is that these pills are bad drugs. Drugs that are slowly ruining her life. It starts to come to the point of terrifying, when her fridge becomes alive and even more crazy as she starts to hallucinate. So she goes to the doctor. But the doctor doesn't seem to be interested in these weird events in the slightest, and instructs her to continue taking them. Still waiting for a reply from the T.V. studio, Sara takes the train to the studio. This scene really captures how these pills have affected her. She has changed from a moderately happy woman with good health to an unhappy, unhealthy, untidy, unstable, lonely and depressed lady, who only wants to star on television. After the studio calls the hospital, Sara is taken into care and is forced to eat some proper food in order for her to regain health and proper weight. In the end the doctors decide to treat her with ETC. At the very end of the film we can see how much Sara has been affected. The story of Sara Goldafrb is an unsettling and heartbreaking one ... the simple idea of how these pills ... these drugs have made this poor, vulnerable old woman's life spiral downward, making her a shaky, nervous lady, obsessed with her T.V. appearance. I was so sad by the end, crying to myself as my sympathy and sorrow for the character poured out of my heart, as I realised how devastating and upsetting her life turned out, after all of the terrible events. I was amazed by the absolutely stunning performance by Ellen Burstyn. It was truly dazzling and totally believable. I was affected greatly by the acting and the character in both a good and bad way. The film revolves around Sara Goldfarb's son, best friend and girlfriend too - Harry, Tyrone and Marion - three characters who deal and do drugs. The film follows them, and what they do in order to get drugs - for example, taking a trip to the supermarket. Marion, Harry's girlfriend (played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly) is a drug addict who sleeps with a couple of men to get money, but whose talent is sketching. When Harry decides to save up enough cash in order to buy a place so Marion can set up a store, it seems nothing will go wrong. But after Tyrone gets put in jail, Harry uses all the saved money to bail him out. When failing to find any drugs to buy, Harry and Tyrone go to California - or was that Florida (!) in order to buy. In the meanwhile we also see how Marion has degraded herself to stripping in front of crowds of men, using a dildo with another woman. It concludes with Harry being taken to hospital, after we see how injecting drugs has turned Harry's arm into a horrible sight... Tyrone is taken to jail and Marion loses all dignity. We witness the various drug-related outcomes in their lives. Marlon Wayans, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly ALL play amazingly well roles, with excellent, convincing performances. The stylish use of the split-screen technique, huge close-ups and exaggerated sound effects add to the glossiness and the soundtrack is haunting and unforgettable. I highly recommend this daring, brutal shock-fest for all of those with a strong stomach in search of a powerful and unnerving trip into the narcotics dependent darkness of modern America. A must-see ... cinematic history...",

Why is there unhappiness? Why is this only my second review in IMDb? Honestly, I don't know why postponed this movie this much. In a way, I believe there is a time for everything. May be everything happens for a reason and in the right moment. May be not. I'm curious what the opinion of this movie's protagonists would be on this matter. There are so many questions and so few answers. One of the reasons why I love Aronosfsky's films. After one and a half hours you are just left there ... speechless ... with tears in your eyes ... with questions without answer and with feelings so unbearable, you would like to scream in pain for eternity. Requiem for a Dream is something to make you feel and think. Do NOT watch this movie for entertainment. It is more of a spiritual experience. Become aware of yourself by doubting all there is. If you don't learn anything new about your existence, there was no point in losing 100 minutes of your life.",
567,27 May 2007,Percivalx,4, Dream Turns To Nightmare!,"Requiem for a Dream marks my first Darren Aronofsky film to date. In short, I am disappointed and has given me a bad first impression of the director. This overwrought public service announcement follows the lives of four people suffering the consequences of drug addiction. An interesting subject treated with the utmost superficiality. My major issue is with the script. It doesn't seem to be doing much except saying ""look how bad drugs are"". There's no deep or profound meaning on the subject matter and doesn't leave much for interpretation. Furthermore, I could not manage to muster an ounce of sympathy for any of the characters. The script simply lacked any real depth to make them remotely interesting or relatable. We basically just watch all of them crash and burn. It might be visually interesting but we never get to emotionally connect with any character. There's also Aronofsky's visual techniques which are quite striking at first, but after a while they get tiresome. The four principal actors do well enough given what they have to work with. Ellen Burstyn is most notable for her Oscar-nominated performance. But not even a good performance can redeem this relentlessly pretentious film. A Let Down!",

Aronofsky doesn't fear the ugly and cruel reality and through it he gives us a masterpiece. he makes us feel bad and think. think about his film and after a while think about what the film is trying to tell us. 4 people who end up really bad because of their addictions. 4 unforgettable performances from all the actors. Burstyn's monologues with her son and her lunatic acting at the end are going to stay in you for ever. they made me cry. but what makes this movie special is its ending. it's not a happy one. it shows the protagonists' decay. one ends up with a cut arm. one ends a lunatic. one ends in prison. only the girl is happy. but she's happy after she has participated in a private peep show with other addicted girls. with a huge bag full of her love. so this isn't really happy either, is it?... and there is more. Aronofsky did not stop at finding a touching and sad theme to make us cry. this movie is the experimentalism on its peak. he is using his techniques so beautifully like when he uses small cuts to show that the protagonists are taking drugs, because he doesn't want to stick to the process but to the conclusion. i absolutely loved it. it's my favorite film and I want to thank Aronofsky for his creative genius!",

I understand the message of showing the negative affects of drugs on the human body, but the film makes everything so extreme that it goes to the point of unrealism and almost humor about how graphic and morbid it has to make these people's lives in order to try to get it's message across. I would have understood that drugs are bad without seeing Leto's arm chopped off, Connelly made into a pathetic lowly whore getting screamed at by old men to shove a dildo in her ass while gyrating the other end with another young lady, Burstyn going clinically insane and being electroshocked (a technique that hasn't been used since the 80s) graphically and Wayans experiencing racism while stirring some potatoes. It just takes everything way too far into the extreme for me to appreciate it anymore. In terms of comparing it to the book, it suffers the same flaw that Fight Club does. It puts all of it's attention on one subject matter (the negative affects of drug use) and leaves the rest virtually nonexistent (the beautiful relationship between Harry and Marion turned into bitter hatred on the surface but remaining deep love internally, the strong connection of Harry and Tyrone turned into a distant mutual understanding of being around each other just so they can get another score, pretty much the entire story with Tyrone and his mother, etc. etc.) It puts little touches on these things, but brings them up and then jumps right back into the anti-drug message for 95% of the duration.",

Circumstances send her to an amphetamine pushing quack, and she eventually destroys her silly eccentric existence, trading it for a hyped up mess. The two boys are both interested in making a big profit in the drug trade and that leads to a lot of danger and near death experiences and great harm.

612,14 April 2011,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,10, The Downward Spiral of movies,"REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a rarity of a film. It's far too dark for mainstream cinema, hence the high ratings, it's inaccessibility will make it ignored by critics (although this is proved to be untrue) There is no romance, no laughter in this film- something that could be seen as a flaw. Although only 100 minutes in length, it feels longer, but not that it is triggered by boredom, but its triggered by the want to not see the grotesque imagery. The film finds its own happiness in the start by the character's ambitions, only to see them crumble as the film progresses. It's a film that will both depress and make you feel sick, due to the explicit depiction of drug addiction. It's greatness is gained by seeing the sickening truth of drug addiction, where such films have hindered away from. With a soundtrack of noisy violins that combine the harshness of noise music with the grand soundscapes of classical music, the film is going to depress, and make the characters (all actors, partically Jared Leto are to be commended) go through a downward spiral, where the light at the end of the tunnels can only be conjured by their imagination through the highs that are achieved through the drugs, but the truth in which the film gains most of its devastation from; the harshness of reality, something that is hard to escape. Thought provoking and a must see, but a warning must be made that this film isn't for those with weak stomachs. Although many people may view this as a bleak film, it could be said that it empowers the viewer to change their lives for the better. It's depressing, but the only visible light at the end of the tunnel will only be seen by the viewer. It's a see once movie, but it will not leave your mind for a very long time.",

624,23 January 2022,Uriah43,8, A Remarkable Film,"Having just been informed that she has just won a free appearance on a television game show, an elderly Brooklyn widow by the name of ""Sara Goldfarb"" (Ellen Burstyn) becomes determined to lose weight in order to fit into her favorite dress. At first, she tries a simple diet but when that doesn't work nearly as fast as she wants, she goes to a doctor who recklessly prescribes some diet pills to help her out. In the meantime, her son ""Harry Goldfarb"" (Jared Leto) has recently become addicted to heroin-as has his attractive girlfriend ""Marion Silver"" (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend ""Tyrone C. Love"" (Marlon Wayans). And although Marion comes from a wealthy family, she realizes that there is a limit to how much money she can get from her parents. So, since they have no jobs and they all need money, they eventually decide to use what knowledge they have and become pushers themselves. What they don't count on, however, is a drug war which effectively prevents them from acquiring enough heroin when they need it the most. Likewise, in her haste to lose weight, Sara has also become addicted and as a result her life is about to spiral out-of-control as well. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is an extremely powerful film which provides a glimpse into a nightmare that few films have been able to capture nearly as well. Sure, everybody knows about the dangers of drug addiction, but what makes this film somewhat unique is that it brings it to life through the characters involved. On that note, several people have expressed their admiration for Ellen Burstyn's performance. Rightly so. However, I was also impressed with the performances of Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans as they all played their parts incredibly well. Be that as it may, although there are some scenes which are not suitable for minors, I recommend this movie for those adult viewers who might be interested in a film of this sort and I have rated it accordingly.",

And I finally watched this classic cult gem ""Requiem for a Dream"" and this film is indeed gritty and dark as it shows how the themes and issues of media propaganda, culture, lust, and substance abuse can control and overtake life as we know it. Set in the depressed area along the abandoned beaches of the Coney Island in New York you have a lonely widow in the legendary Ellen Burstyn who all she lives for is to watch TV in her apartment as the info salesman is selling more and more on her as it will take her wallet and her soul. Along with that her son Harry(in one of Jared Leto's first roles)is a drug addict as he lives for a heroin needle to be stuck in his arm and his buddy Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) is the king street dealer who helps supply it all. To round out the trio is Harry's girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connelly)who will sell her body with lust for drugs, money or any favor she can get.

639,17 February 2023,arthur_tafero,4, Not Pi - Requiem for a Dream,"Very disappointed in this Aronofsky effort. A successful film usually requires a protagonist that arouses at least a minimum of audience sympathy. This film has no such protagonist. It is depressing from start to finish, as each of the prime suspects fall deeper into their drug stupors. And I thought Bergman films were depressing. This movie makes Bergman films seem like a day in Disneyland. Ellen Burstyn is a fine actress; it is a shame she got caught up in this mess. The rest of the acting corps is strictly amatuer hour. No one cares about these people, and the sooner they get to their final destinations (eventual slow suicide via drug use), the better everyone watching the film will feel. Are their situations tragic? No. No one is forcing them to take drugs. Are their situations hopeful? No. They have no hope, because they are all hopeless cases. And no one cares that they are hopeless cases, because there are millions of people who have far greater problems than these spoiled, entitled, egomaniacs. Feeding a family or finding shelter for them is far more important than these newts searching for meaning in life; and there are millions trying to do that, but that doesn't sell tickets and is not artsy enough, I guess. These people are better off dead; better to focus on the really needy of society. If that sounds cold and unfeeling, that is how the world works.

It's a disturbing film, there's no questioning that, as we follow four people struggling with a drug addiction, giving the audience, what I would believe to be, an accurate insight of the trauma it causes. The editing is the real star of this film, it is perfectly paced and perfected in a way that gives us a clear view of how these individuals feel as they are intoxicated, it is all thought out and developed with sincere detail. However, I thought it could have done with a bit of heart, a few lighter moments, I understand that it wanted to be an intense experience, which it achieved, but I would have liked a few more dialogue based moments to showcase these characters relationship with one another some more. The cast is terrific and all portray the decline of their character's mental health as their addiction develops brilliantly, with Jared Leto's unique style, Jennifer Connelly's personal engagement, Marlon Wayans surprisingly dramatic performance and the intense, pure delivery by Ellen Burstyn, who is the hardest to view as a result of how far she spirals.

Don't watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" thinking that everybody will live happily ever after.  No.  ""Requiem for a Dream"" shows us when there is no hope or a chance to start over.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans all give superb performances.  Ellen Burstyn's character, Sara Goldfarb, goes by just about everyday of her life watching Tabby Tibbons(Christopher McDonald) on her favorite television show and imagining herself as a contestant.  She sees that the only way she can do it by taking these dietary pills just so she can fit into her red dress.  It isn't long before the diet pills and television start to consume her life and she soon enough takes a hike down the road to addiction.  She has a slowly fading relationship with her son Harry Goldfarb(Jared Leto).  It seems to me that the only time they talk is when she is trying to convince him to not pawn the television so he can get drug money.  Harry's drug-induced fantasies on the boardwalk are some of the more disturbing parts of the film.  Harry's best friend Tyrone(Marlon Wayans), is trying to expand into the drug trade. This is probably the most disturbing part of the film for me because I have never seen Marlon Wayans(nor any of his brothers for that matter) in a really serious film role.  He plays Tyrone so convincingly, that you can pretty much forget about ""Scary Movie"".  The ending scene with Tyrone is probably one of the best parts about this movie.  Jennifer Connelly however, who plays Harry's girlfriend, Marion, is probably the shining light of this movie.  Her Golden Globe for best supporting actress and her Oscar-nomination for the same category in the much recent ""A Beautiful Mind"" prove she is a very good actress.  I will not forget the scene where she is at the party.",

I rented this movie with moderate interest in it and began to watch it while cleaning my room. Before long I had stopped cleaning and was completely transfixed on the TV. All I can say is this: You will hear from people that the film is terribly shot. The camera is shaky and the lighting isn't perfect. The story has its plot holes and the music has its moments where it simply doesn't fit. But this is my favorite movie. There is so much truth in it and the acting (especially Ellen Byrstyn) made it impossible to doubt. And with an amazing ending to finish it off I cannot say this movie was flawed.

But then, some mistakes get clearer. It was wrong to cast Jennifer Connelly for this movie. She will always be an upper class girl, also when she is on H. It was annoying to saw her trying to look like a junkie. I think she was casted because she was an uprising star in hollywood. And every director wanted her to play in their movies. Or it was the guilt of her agent. Jared Leto fits much better for his role. He was so nervous right from the beginning, that it felt right to see his demolition. The camera also get boring after a hour. They repeated some scenes to often. The message was already made clear, but they repeated again and again the scene how to cook up heroin. And then, the cuts, were sometimes to fast. I know that this was chic at this time. But not everything which is chic fits to a story. And not every actor has to be casted because he or she will be a star. 5/10",

All three are drug addicts and seek in her a perspective to change their lives by starting to deal, each with their own goal. Harry wants to set up a designer store for his girlfriend Marion, she in turn just wants to not depend on her rich parents for that. Tyrone wanted to be someone, not be discriminated against because of his color, and prove to his mother that he would be successful.

Her life changes when she receives a possible proposal to participate in this program, so she decides to see a doctor to prescribe something that would help her lose weight.

666,7 August 2005,Jonny_Numb,9," gives new meaning to ""a true cinematic experience""...","There are many fine montages in ""Requiem for a Dream,"" edited rapidly and done repetitiously in a way that conveys a point explicitly within a few seconds (whereas most movies would take the more conventional, straight exposition route); however, some of these montages whiz by to the point where they lack clarity. For instance, there is a scene early in the film where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto with a Brooklyn accent) and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans in a non-comedic role) are shown hanging around a closed carnival booth after dark--we see hands pull something from behind tires (and also what appear to be garbage cans) and then rip open clear plastic pouches of cocaine or heroin while car alarms blare over the soundtrack. Maybe I'm not astute enough to realize what is going on (are they stealing and selling car stereos to help finance Marion Silver's (Jennifer Connelly) break into the garment business? what?), but that leads to my overall impression of ""Requiem for a Dream"": the details of the plot are consistently choppy, but ultimately irrelevant. Like the drug-addled culture it at first panders to, then thunderously condemns, ""Requiem"" is more about the propulsive powers of addiction than a straightforward narrative--in essence, any narrative that emerges is an outgrowth of the characters' actions, and in the end, things are wrapped up in a bleak, downbeat way (really the only possible conclusion that can be reached). Co-writer/director Darren Aronofsky (who cut his teeth on the stylish but showy black-and-white psychodrama ""Pi"") uses every stylistic device imaginable to convey the escalating effects of addiction (passages of drug use are signaled by montages of prepping heroin works, rolling blunts, and excited cells in the bloodstream); anyone who has had even a passing infatuation with illegal substances will be surprised at the accuracy with which this is conveyed--Aronofsky's decision to speed up or slow down film, use a fisheye lens, steadicam shots, or even show waves of heat rising from a closed refrigerator, successfully hypnotizes the viewer in a manner as gripping as a dissolved drug. The characters, and the paths they have chosen (including Ellen Burstyn--who really WAS robbed of an Oscar--as a widower who becomes addicted to diet pills) are compelling, misguided, and all too human; their rationale for remaining hooked on the substances that ultimately determine their downfall is a fascinating mix of human loyalty, commitment, and betrayal. Aronofsky's visual attentiveness doesn't detract a bit from the finely-wrought performances on display, and rather complements the characters and heightens our own cinematic high. Its overriding theme aside, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is an artistic triumph and a masterpiece of cinema that is better experienced than described.",

After the credits rolled i sat on my couch for an hour contemplating the movie.  the next day i went to amazon and ordered the unrated version.  Since then i haven't gone a day without thinking about it. I would reccomend this to everyone not because it's a happy movie, but because you have to see it.  I don't know about showing it in school, it's a lot to handle especially unrated, but what a great message it has.  I don't know who wouldn't think twice before injecting heroin in there arm after watching this.  A great story with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Not only was the acting great, but the directing stood out especially when they take the drugs.  The music at the end also is very moving and powerful.

Its a bizarre and heavy movie that is quite different from any other stoner movie.The psychological thriller directed by Darren Aranofsky absolutely ripped us all throughout the film with its cutting edge sequences and a stunning climax.The movie goes complicatedly into the lives of four people who renders themselves into drugs.The director made it so simple a complicated movie that had one of the most ominous climax for such a type of movie. The movie goes up from a controllable normal situation into a rebellious second half with a great impact on its characters.The movie has some intense scenes sometimes disturbing but some of the shots were rapid and innovative for a film of this genre.The movie mixes up some contrasting situation of people that eventually comes together into the same path at end. The direction has been pure class. Aranofsky excelled in his work with his clear cut sequences and directing the movie at the right pace.The cast selection was apt and almost everyone showed top class acting especially Ellen Burstyn. Her character was one of the most intriguing and major in the movie.Jared Leto just showed how good an actor he is as well as Jennifer Connelly. The BGM throughout the film were cool and intense.All in all the movie looked tough and is one to watch if you are a movie fanatic.,

Sure it comes from a rarely used basic premise of addicts and junkies, but the story unfolds so very predictably. The thing that makes it special is the execution, of how all the technical stuff bind together to create a hallucinating movie experience. Moreover, I watched this movie right after I spent the night before in lacking sleep. It took me some minutes to clear things up and get back on stuff. The technical stuff and I mean all of them, the fast- forward style, the coloration selection, all the messed up camera angles, the irritating and ever-present music scoring, and of course, the gruesome scenes of the consequences make this movie strong in conveying the message of how messed up the life of a junkie is and will be even more. I praise the acting performance by the four main cast. It's clear then how Leto, Connelly and Wayans can gain the trust of some of the big production names to cast them on later works. But I especially salute Ellen Burstyn for her performance that is able to portray the most physically irritating changes of what will happen to a junkie's body. Yet again I give this movie a 6 out of 10 score because in my opinion it is not very suitable for an entertainment. It does help to convey the message of never touch addictive substance for good.",

I generally dislike movies about self-destructive people because I find them tedious, but the acting and directing were so good that I would recommend it. The script left something to be desired. I found certain parts of the film unrealistic -- at least two things come to mind. I don't recall exactly when the film was supposed to have taken place, but even if it was 20 years ago, electroshock therapy would never have been given to somebody when the staff knew for a fact that the patient's problem was pill addiction and not mental illness. The patient also would not be asked to sign a consent when she clearly was not able to consent. I know things like that happened in the 1930s, but not in recent years. The arrest of two of the main characters also did not ring true. Yes, they were in the south, with the stereotypical bunch of redneck cops, but last time I checked, you can't arrest someone for being a drug addict unless you actually find drugs on their person, and if the cops did find it, that scene was left on the cutting-room floor; it appeared from the script that the doctor saw the track marks and called the cops. I don't believe that would happen. It was as if the scriptwriter decided to purposefully exaggerate what would really happen just to punish these people. It would have been better if things evolved more naturally. The film did an excellent job with the special effects, which helped the viewer see the world through the eyes of drug addicts.",

680,31 July 2012,brando647,9, A Powerhouse Drama about Addiction,"Man, this movie is intense. I was introduced to the work of director Darren Aronofsky when I was in college. I'd never heard of him or his movies, but I had a friend that would rave about how excellent he was. Once I finally got around to checking out REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, my mind was blown. I couldn't even smoke a cigarette for the first three hours after the movie had ended. With this one movie, I was convinced that Aronofsky was a director to keep tabs on because this is a man who knows how to get under an audience's skin. The movie based on a novel from Hubert Selby, Jr. It follows four people caught in the throes of addiction: Harry Goldfarb (Leto), his mother Sara (Burstyn), his girlfriend Marion (Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone (Wayans). Each of them has their drug of choice, and each of them experiences the highs before the true danger behind the choices they've made becomes a reality. Harry and Tyrone are heroin junkies, content with pawning Sara's TV for a fix. Marion is a girl from a comfortable background with dreams of designing her own clothing and a love for cocaine. And Sara withers away in miserable retirement until she's presented with an opportunity to appear on her favorite infomercial/game show and her desperation to get in shape for her big appearance leads to a debilitating speed habit.

682,3 June 2018,RaulFerreiraZem,3, drugs are bad mmkay?,"Requiem for a dream stands as one of the most overrated films i've ever seen.
From the ridiculous over the top melodramatic one note plot to the awful uninspired dialogue to the characterless characters theres almost nothing reedeming about this film except maybe its original soundtrack.
The film tries to develop this idea that the 4 main characters have a dream and each one of them has their dream destroyed by addiction but if we have a closer look at it we can see that, for exemple, tyrese's dream has no substance at all to it, in fact we can only assume that his dream is to just be with his girlfriend since he never has time to develop as a character and the only thing the film gives us as a backstory for him is two flashbacks of him running to his mother. Tyrone is a majorly unexplored character as he has basicly no screen time at all,and when he does he is either dancing in fast forward or having sex.
Sarahs dream is to be on tv. And even though she was just fine before she got ""invited"" to be on television, once she does, she starts to obsess over losing weight to fit her dress to the point where she gets addicted to amphetamines.
Marion's dream is to be a fashion designer, but she ultimately has no idea whatsoever what that means since all she ever does is cut pictures off of magazines and all we're shown in terms of her chasing her dreams is a ""i worked some numbers out and this could really work"" by harry. 
Harry's dream is pretty much just be a boyfriend to marion and have enough money to get his fix.
Anyway all of this goes under when for some reason which the movie refuses to show us(instead he rather show us 5 different scenes of sarah allucinating) the gangs(which ones?the movie doesnt know either) go on war and the drug market is mostly emptied.
The sole fact that Aronofsky thought it would be better to water down the film with repetitive montages than actually showing the reasons behind the gang conflict is enought to label this as a bad movie but whatever.
The ending seems really rushed and forced. The police had no reason to arrest tyrone since driving a drug addict to the hospital is not a crime and they didnt have enought to get a mandate to search his car and find his drugs, and if staying in the hospital lobby was risky then why didnt tyrone just leave harry there and left?
its almost like aronofsky had this ending envisioned but didnt really bother to make it seem convincing
At the end of it not even the cool soundtrack can move me,not when i can see that anti drug moralism was the driving force behind this film. The characters are undeveloped, the photography is okay, the soundtrack is kind of cool but it is overused, the ending seems really forced and unrealistic and overall this film has a really moralistic exploitative feel to it.
not great, not good, its actually pretty bad

However, that said, it does exactly what it sets out to do--horrify audiences with scary and nightmarish visions of a culture mostly dependent on addiction in one form or another. If ever there was an anti-drug film or a film preaching against substance abuse, this is it, but it doesn't really limit iself to just one type of addiction is you pay attention.

The scene when Harry and Marion are talking on the phone knowing they will never see each other again just tears my heart out. The bittersweet music, the unspoken goodbye... it's so tragic.

Shrouded by denial and a longing for fulfillment, the characters in this story feed their vices and insecurities until they are consumed by them. Aronofsky fuses his creative genius (i.e. ""Hip-hop montages"") with Selbey's macabre and emotionally ravaging writing to produce a work of art that brands itself to the minds of its viewers. Augmented with a stunning soundtrack this is the complete package. Inducing empathy and sympathy for people you would usually scorn, this is a shining example of the modern anti-hero.

The night after I saw the film (election night, as it turned out), I woke up twice with nightmares directly relating to the film. While many critics have said that the film is powerful because it graphically depicts the horrors of drug dependency, I'm not convinced that Aronofsky isn't more interested in creating characters whose plummet into unspeakable degradation becomes an excuse for aestheticized gruesomeness, showy montage experimentation, and take-it-to-the-brink filmmaking for its own sake. The characters in REQUIEM never struck me as altogether real; rather, they are emblems of waste and desperation, put through their paces in order to provide grist for a callous, moralistic, and ultimately exploitive film. This is a shame, because my hopes were high. There is no denying that Aronofsky's images pack a brutal punch -- I still can't shake them. But I think a slower, less bravura execution of this set of stories might've conveyed human loss, instead of ""Look, Ma! Watch me cross-cut!""

The movie is truly breathtaking, and I mean that most literally - I was starting to run out of oxygen after the first thirty minutes. And I only saw it on VCR.

700,27 October 2018,garethcrook,6, I have a bit of a hot and cold thing with Aronofsky,"Pi remains one of my favourite films if not my favourite of all time, but then he's made plenty of rubbish too (The Fountain, Noah). Despite the acclaim that Requiem for a Dream gets, I always put it on the cold list, it quite literally left me cold. I thought it was time I gave it another chance though, maybe I'd just caught it at a bad time, perhaps I'd been unfair to it all these years. Mansell's score right away is something to enjoy, it's rich, immersive, ever present and it's superb. Picking right up from where he left Pi. The style that Pi had though is lost a little, but it does have something about it. Simple neatly composed shots, it flows like it's been storyboarded meticulously. The camera kept tight, often abstract. All that. I like. The jump cuts and split screens, spinning overhead shots get tiresome though, it's relentless. BUT that I think is the point, it's a war of attrition, beating the viewer down as the world of all the characters falls apart. There are several shared actors with Pi, in fact I think the entire cast is present, but here the characters portrayed, I simply didn't care about. It's heartless and distressing, packed with (now dated) 90s visual effects, fisheye lenses, speed ramping, audio distortions. If Lynch were in charge it may have worked, but where Lynch carefully crafts this stuff, Aronsofsky goes for the full kitchen sink. Ultimately it's just bleak without the artistry. A damning portrayal. Of drugs. Of society. Of America. Of celebrity. Of television. Of addiction to what people think they need in life. Slaves looking for the high, looking to be accepted. It is utterly depressing and for all its positives, that's the reason I don't like it. That all said I don't think I hate it as much as I once did.",

PLOT: *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* This film follows four residents of New York's Coney Island district as they all try to overcome their addictions to different types of drugs and maintain a life of happiness. But everything soon turns on them as their live plummet into a nightmarish, gut-wrenching free-fall. There is Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his mother (Ellen Burstyn). All four of these actors were great. I was very impressed with Marlon Wayans. I was pleased that he could actually do a serious role after portraying a delightfully silly character in SCARY MOVIE. This movie is a landmark in film making. Never before has there been such an intense film. I was blown away. Ellen Burstyn should have won some sort of Oscar here. Best Actress for sure. Jared Leto was also great as Harry who tries hard to make his relationship work out. This is one intense, !INTENSE! movie.

I sat through all the credits before I could actually stand up. I've seen it again since on DVD, and the power of the film was still there. Sure, it's a bit much in the end, with the scenes getting more and more gruesome, with the dramatic (brilliant!) music getting faster and faster. But it worked for me, Aronofsky, as you will, 'got away with it'. Great acting as well, Burstyn definately deserved a Academy Award (Julia Roberts... yuck!). And oh do I love split screens! So, basicly, my number 8 film: 10/10",
712,15 June 2005,ignatz928,4, Probably too effective,"This movie is probably the most effective anti-drug statement ever put on film. What watching it proved to me, less than that being a junkie isn't any fun, is that I don't have as strong a stomach as I thought. I've made it through some pretty rough movies, but even those were basically just entertainment. Requiem is a different matter, and is the first movie where I couldn't make it all the way through; after enduring the first hundred minutes,I fast-forwarded through the last twenty. The movie depicts the lives of four people living on Coney Island whose lives go awry due to drugs. Harry Goldfarb, his girlfriend Marion, and his friend Tyrone are already drug users, but as the movie begins seem to have their use pretty well under control. Marion dreams of opening up her own clothing store, while Harry and Tyrone are trying to set themselves up as drug dealers. The fourth character is Harry's mother, a widow who spends most of her time in a dreary apartment eating candy and watching a bad self-help show. So the movie isn't exactly a laugh-fest to begin with. But hold on, it's gets even grimmer from here. Stylistically, the movie is quite impressive. I had previously seen his debut film, Pi, which shares a similar, deliberately grungy look, as well as aggressive editing. I wasn't a huge fan of that film, which at least in my memory seems rather lacking in substance to match its style, but I do remember being impressed by its rapid montage, repeated multiple times, of the obsessed protagonist swallowing pills. For Requiem, Aronofsky elaborates on those sequences with montages of the addicts' drug taking, showing only small details, such as the needle being readied. Working with a bigger budget here, he's able to pull out all of the stops, including split-screen, speed-up motion, and micro-photography, in order to convey the highs and lows of a junkie's existence. But this movie isn't just a director's show; the actors are also very impressive, though largely because of their sheer willingness to pretty thoroughly abase themselves for their roles. This is particularly true of Ellen Burstyn as Sarah Goldfarb, who never flinches from her painful role. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans manage to make their junkie characters sympathetic enough to care about what happens to them. I never expected that there would be a movie sex scene involving Jennifer Connelly that I wouldn't want to see, but it's here, which may or may not be a somewhat dubious distinction (it was in fact at this point that I decided to skip all the way to the end). Despite its generally harrowing quality, there are points where Aronofsky's willingness to go to extremes starts to dip over into absurdity. A scene where Leto and Wayans encounter a cop and Leto imagines stealing the cop's gun plays more like a stand-alone commercial than a scene in a movie. Another fantasy sequence, this one belonging to Sarah as her mental breakdown begins, literally breaks down the wall between reality and the movie by having her imagine that the talk-show crew invades her apartment. The effect isn't disturbing so much as jarring, by reminding us that we're watching a movie- something that the rest of Requiem, for all of its overt stylishness, avoids to stunning effect. But while the acting and the technical aspects of this film were very good, why I thought it fails is because of the intent behind it. The movie amounts to little more than the world's most extended anti-drug commercial. At some level, I think that all movies should be entertaining; not necessarily fun, but involving and satisfying to the audience. Maybe it's that I'm just too conventional to accept Aronofsky's brutally honest vision, but I think that there's a problem with a film that wants to put the audience through as much discomfort as possible. Instead of telling a story or conveying a mood through the camera, Aronofsky seems to want to use it as a weapon for mounting a sensory assault on the viewer.",
713,23 June 2001,skyman45,10, Aronofsky's brilliant depiction of spiraling drug addiction,"There has been lots of buzz about this movie over the last few months, and I dismissed it all until I actually saw the film. Pure genius. We start with the characters which are real and easy to relate with, and move with them as they struggle to cope with their everyday lives, dreams, and addictions. We bond with them, and feel their pain as the go deeper and deeper into the abyss of drug abuse. Absolute brilliance. Dismiss everything you hear about this movie, and see it for yourself.",
714,7 May 2002,LebowskiT1000,5, Not very good.,"I just don't get this sort of movie.  I mean, I understood it fine, there really isn't anything to get, it's just about the lives of these 4 or 5 people and their drug habits and what not.  What I'm trying to say is: ""Why does a movie like this constitute a good movie?""  I just don't get it.  In all honesty, it's not a very interesting story and rather boring.  It's sad to think that a story about people ruining their lives is what is needed to be a good movie.  It also truly saddens me that a movie like this would make it into the top 250 on this site.  This movie would be lucky to make into my top 1000 favorite movies.  I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this movie unless you're dying to see it, or have nothing better to do.  Why do the actors in this film get such high praises about their acting?  I didn't see anything terribly great in their performances. Anyway, I'm not really sure how to review this film, I didn't think it was terrible, just boring and uninteresting.  Just because it's filmed in an odd way, doesn't make it an interesting movie.  I hope you like the movie more than I did.  Thanks for reading,",

Through separate experiences of addiction run amok, this movie ends with a crescendo of mind-racing, heart-popping intensity. I spent the vast majority of this movie seated on my preferred end of the couch and ended it pacing back and forth, clutching my chest, trying and failing to not watch the screen.

The movie was good. The character study was a high plus in the movie. How they all start out so happy and ending falling apart with sadness and out of control behaviors, was worth watching and very powerful. I thought the performances were all good especially Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. They did a great job and Connelly's performance pretty much led her to A Beautiful Mind and winning an Oscar, so she's done a good job. Keep it up. The movie is disturbing and all the drugs and stuff can give you a headache sometimes. The cinematography was excellent and is one of the best. I loved it how the director split the images up in some scenes or when some scenes can go fast forward or very fast. The movie was just truly original. I just haven't seen many filmmakers with ideas like this movie. Overall, a bizarre and disturbing film that made Aronfsky look like Kubrick. Requiem for a Dream isn't meant for many people and there are some really bizarre and some boring scenes but the movie was good and I enjoyed it, simple as that. I recommend it.",

The musical accompaniment of this film is on a separate level, there are no memorable tracks, but the sounds of anxiety, fear and many other emotions are transmitted as clearly as possible, without which the film would not have left such vivid impressions.

The acting is fantastic, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, who in my opinion gives the best performance of his young career, but at times, especially the end, this movie seems to get morbid just for shock value. I find myself not rooting for the character, but just waiting for it to end.

At the time of its release, I was fascinated by the fact that a movie could be unrated and released. Well, I'm 25 now, and I finally got it on Blu-Ray. To me, it was worth the 12 year wait. After seeing it, I saw a form of idiosyncrasy between that movie and my own life. The movie deals with four people spiraling in their own worlds of addiction. At the time of the film's release, I was witnessing my own mother's spiral across many addictions. So, maybe it was for the best that I wasn't able to see it in 2000. It likely would have been too much to bear. I digress, but for good reason. Anyway, I think that the passage of time lent to my appreciation of the movie. I knew I heard that soundtrack somewhere before I saw this movie, and it's always nice to know the source. The story is absolutely unrelenting, and I can say the same about Darren Aronofsky's directing. And there are the performances. Before this, I have never seen anything that contained either Jennifer Connolly (""A Beautiful Mind"" is not exactly one I'm hurrying to see) or Jared Leto (though I do listen to his music with 30 Seconds To Mars). I only knew of Marlon Wayans from ""The Wayans Bros."" and ""Scary Movie"" (I'm sorry to say), and was surprised with his performance here. Obviously, Ellen Burstyn gives the prime performance here, and it's easy to see why she was an Oscar nominee for this. This story did hit very close to the bone to me. My mother's fate was similar to that of the character of Marion, which is why she is is a non-factor to me except as a warning. However, I'm still glad I saw it. It is a well done character study and deserves some form of discovery.",

It follows the stories of 4 different people, each escaping reality and getting deteriorated by his own addictions: To drugs, to pills, to alcohol, to TV, to his dreams of a better life. I haven't seen in years such an amazing and effective combination of acting, photography, editing, lighting, music, writing, makeup and costume design.

Aronofsky and his cinematographer and editor (Matthew Libatique and Jay Rabinowitz, respectively) employ a series of cinematic tricks (split-screen, different aspects of motion and lighting) but somehow they don't seem gimmicky at all--everything is employed to tell a complex story about the plight of addiction in the most efficient way possible. The film centers on a bright, likable Coney Island junkie, Harry (Jared Leto) and his widowed mother (Ellen Burstyn, in a role she isn't quite able to pull off until midway through but who devastates thereafter) who becomes hooked on speed believing she will be on television. Also figuring prominently are two other junkies, Harry's girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly in a very brave performance) and best friend (Marlon Wayans, also very fine). Each character delves deeper and deeper into a shared hell and it's to the writers' credit (both novelist and director wrote the screenplay) that none are able to escape into death's forgiveness. Yet Aronofsky and Selby are not interested in providing a moralistic after-school special; there's a clear identification with each character and you come to understand the motivations even if the choices seem woeful. Despite its relentless grimness, the film leaves you satisfied: there's a lot of pleasure in Aronofsky's technique and a very real sense of being impressed as well as shaken.",

I have to say it's rather overrated, and that's putting it mildly. It reminded me of 'Traffic' or any other overblown TV-movie-esquire morality tale over which I've wasted my time in the past. Just because a film is photographed really well (this certainly is) does not make it worth all these 10/10 ratings. I've read in the discussion comments that some people have shown this film to 6-9 year olds - I hope some day they feel as ashamed as they should. Scaring kids with this kind of sub-'Reefer Madness' paranoia-fest is going to ultimately have precisely the opposite effect that you think it should.",

Other than that, I don't get it. It's a poor production in so many ways, carried only by virtue of the two younger principals.

From the cast and their performance to the way it was shoot, the cuts, the close-ups and of course, the soundtrack. Very, very intense movie and this is probably way I liked it so much. The degradation of the human being is so well portrayed with the help of the great performance of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. This is the story of Sara - the mother, Harry - the son, his girlfriend - Marion and their friend - Tyrone. All four of them have different dreams and hopes but all of them get destroyed by the same evil: the addiction to drugs whether they are pills or actual illicit substances. They choose the easy way to reach their dreams and that brings them to perdition. You can actually feel the desperation that every character reaches, the hole in which they sink deeper and deeper.

Meanwhile, we know the mother of one of them, who lives alone and has no More company than TV and auto-help preachers. We can see how they fell in the depht of addiction, how things seem good at first and, of course, then, the cruel reality of being addicted. With very good playing, it is the real than the actors seem, the greatest point of the film. A very good and touching story, full of feelings and moments of cruel and unholy reality. Brutal, conscious and explicit, a really good movie about drugs. Unluckily, the idea of the director of filming it like a music clip (rapid changes of camera and lots of turnings of the image, to represent that they are in the influence of drugs), mess a little the result, with a better image directing, it could have been better indeed.

Addiction drags their lives in different path then it was before. Those flashbacks or whatever they're called are not necessary. Four lives four different paths and endings. Movie was strong and put us directly in struggles of characters as they try to do their best to keep themselves sane and high. The thing about mother is on shaky road, doctor prescribes four different medications but they are probably the same only thing different is dosage as is written on them and he does that easily without thought some people might start to use them all at once as she did. After a while she got addicted and got crazy just like that but there is thing that she wanted to be famous so that destroyed her easily because she was not fit to take it just like that. Addiction that went towards sweet went on medications and it was worse then before. Movies shows us power, struggle, expectations, need and greed and it does it in unique way. 3.5/4",

772,18 May 2021,sudhakaranakhilan,8, Exquisite spirited song from Aronofsky,"As a 'disturbed' admirer of Aronofsky's films, this one slightly gave the show away. The scintillating piece of editing, close-up shots, and the reverberating requiem was the notable highlight in the movie. It dribbles along with four characters, through their minds, and through their exigencies. Sara besieges me more than anyone not least the other characters too. Consumption of drugs and their consequences are the main element that the movie forwards but there in Sara it is something peculiar than the ongoing drugs we were thought about. Sara is addicted to TV especially to the Tappy Tibbons program. Her son Harry, his friend Tyrone, and Harry's girlfriend Marion are the exact examples of actual drug addicts. They have dreams and passions but all are covered inside the spooky world of the drug. I'm addicted to the movie in a way about the editing. That was quirky, agile editing along with unconventional extreme close-up shots. We can see the use of snorricam in many of the scenes. It is a matter of complete fascination on Aronofsky for this eccentric kind of making while he went for an adaptation. I should mention the score also, which is like early said feels like a reverberating requiem. It is composed by Clint Mansell. All the actors did their part brilliantly especially for Jennifer Connelly because she was completely immersed in the role of Marion. Requiem for a Dream is an exquisite spirited song to bring back the soul inside us by breaking all the chains that drugs put on us.",

779,2 January 2023,liamscherdin,9, So close to reality it's almost scary,When making a movie about drugs and addiction it's quite easy as a director to slip and fall in the insubstantial trap. Meaning that everything that plays out is too far from reality. When you create a movie who's story is based on real life situations about drugs and addiction and make it too far from reality it just comes out as a big mess. Following that the viewers won't be able to feel and experience what the characters in the movie is feeling. Darren Aronofsky defenetly did'nt fall for this trap which led to him making in my opinion one of the best movies I've ever watched.,

It displays how desperate and hopeless addiction makes up. I love that it stayed gritty and unapologetic about the situations. There was no happy ending and I like that. There is no glorifying the addictions, it is real and haunting. The visuals were potent, the characters appearances deteriorated as the film progressed.

I was also really impressed with the representation of not only just illegal substances but also prescribed drugs. Also Incredible performances from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, and of course the always solid Ellen Burstyn. They portrait each path perfectly.

794,30 June 2002,space-13,6, The director works the audience as if he himself is a drug dealer supplying what they crave.,"It's surprising to see how many people are being duped by the director of this pretentiously and gratuitously violent film.  What the director offers are quick fixes of rapid fire imagery and viciously cut scenes without any need or opportunity for the audience to think hard or deeply about anything. Take,for example, his treatment of the character played by Jennifer Connelly. How is his degradation of that character any different than her debasement by the other men who exploit her for their cruel pleasure? The director consistently keeps his view of her ""objective"" in the literal sense of presenting her as an object -- upon which he projects his own fantasies of how an addicted woman would sell herself. Why doesn't he allow her to have any inner, believable life that could make her more real and make her conflicts more intense? (His objectification of her is so extensive that it feels at the end as if he is one of the men zeroing in on her pain to feed their horrifying pleasure.) Ellen B's character is more fully drawn, but even then, why does the director need multiple shots of electric shock treatment when one shot would show what she is feeling? The answer is that the director knows the fix his audience is seeking.  We say we're appalled, but we can't stop watching what the slick photography and postmodern soundtrack turn into the very kind of media-induced high that his movie supposedly is critiquing. Wake up, audiences, and try to think for yourselves. The best directors want us to do that; the worst are afraid of what will happen if we dare to do so.",

These addiction stories are really hard to watch because they rarely end well. To state the obvious. If you're looking for an entertaining movie pass on this. It's too hard and toooo sad. This is a very different role for Ellen Bursten. She's normally cast in a fairly sweet and passive character. She's pretty good in this. Again very hard to watch her descend into a ridiculously awful situation. Hers friends are one of the high spots of this film. They are adorable. This film needed more surrounding characters who weren't addicted and less tragic to make it bearable to watch. SAD.,

To make this even more effective, the score to the film, with those haunting strings, is so damn creepy, they alone would give me nightmares!  My only complaint about the direction and the story is that some scenes do go a little overboard, such as the scene where the room transcends into a game show.

808,4 February 2001,dclxvihell,10, Requiem For A Dream brings the statement 'The road to Hell is paved with the Best of Intentions' sharply into focus,"There are very few films that exist that leave the audience emotionally devastated as they leave the theatre.... Requiem For A Dream is a condensed reality brought alive throughout the medium of film via Hubert Selby's novel, Darren Aronovsky's exceptionally capable direction, the stunning performances by each of the characters and Clint Mansell's hypnotically beautiful yet sorrowful score. The film's incredible power comes from the sheer beauty and in some cases, naivety of the characters. Their choices, despite being filled with hopeful aspirations, lead each to their own personal hell and self-destruction. The tragic ironies that each character encountered in terms of their past and in terms of there present reality, left Me emotionally pummeled as a viewer. At some points, it was almost unbearable to watch (not that I looked away). If ever there were an anti-drug film to deter future users, this would be it. This film is a must see for every individual, no matter from what walk of life.... even if you are not a film goer. I will not call the film a piece of art outright (although it is certainly that) but rather a piece of brutal reality polished and mirrored in the art form of cinema. I extend My warmest thanks to the creators and distrubutors of this film. It is films like these that give Me the hope that even though the quality of films these days have degenerated somewhat, that something somewhere went right in creating and bringing this work to audiences worldwide.

Never had I been so impressed by the brilliant technical filmmaking on the harrowing and brutal subject of drug addiction. I hated Fight Club for reasons (self-conscious apathy and the ludicrous twist near the end single-handedly destroyed the whole film) but I absolutely loved Requiem for a Dream for good reasons. ,
812,26 December 2018,Mkaaff,7," Must watch, but only ONCE","From a viewer point of view, sometimes you like movies not to be so frank. Sometimes you prefer movies lie to you and let you get away from this ,somehow, ugly world. But if you are looking for this you should never watch this ""requiem for a dream"". This is a truely honest story of poor poeple engaging themselves with drugs and start destroying their not-so-beautiful life, second by second through the film. Like othe aronofsky films, the atmosphere is bothering in almost every scene, specially in the first 60 minutes. You might feel nothing about the film and want not to continue. But then the final 30-40 minutes arrives, everything changes, the atmosphere, the composition, the rhythm, everything, and it engages you with the story, with the characters, and then you can't move away. You want to find out where these people gonna reach. So you will stay with the film and you will follow it. To be honest the atmosphere remains bothering, torturing your mind and soul. But you are somehow surprised and you can't just let it go. So surely you will be more satisfied with yourself for choosing this film to watch when the final credits apear with that amaizing soundtrack in comparison to when you were watching the opening scenes with the same soundtrack.
Finally, perhaps this film is a little bit overrated with that 82 position among toprated 250 movies. But no doubt it is a very good, dark but honest movie you should watch. But only once because you can't and I think you don't want to watch it again. But you will always remember its amaizing brilliant soundtrack and you may want to listen to it again and again.",

818,9 November 2008,eric_creeden,8, Requiem for a Dream: more potential than recognized,With cinematography done by Matthew Libatique and soundtrack by Clint Mansell I feel as if this was a well composed depiction of downward spirals caused by intense drug abuse. The camera angles and editing techniques made this movie stand out in my mind. The original soundtrack adds an intensity that mirrors the events throughout the whole movie. I feel this movie had aspects that could have boosted its popularity among popular culture and increased ticket sales at the theaters. More advertisement prior to its release would have aided ticket sales in my mind. Over all this movie is one of my favorites for so many reasons that lie deeper than actor and actresses performances. The tone and demeanor of the movie captivates you in the spiral the actors endure and put themselves through in the Requiem for a Dream.,
819,3 May 2020,hamadmito,10, Not just a movie about drugs!,"The film is depressing , but it has a great meaning. The movie gives you a dose of hope, not a lot of movies did it bsfore . The movie deserves to be watched every time. The movie wants to tell you a great meaning, but in a harsh style. Everyone has a dream you have to make an effort to achieve it, but if you don't your dream will die. This fatigue literally means effort, hardship, and sweat. You have to be at the end to achieve your dream. This is the meaning of the movie. It warns you with the utmost directness, do not underestimate the stage of your trouble or wash your brain that you are passing this stage with minimal losses. All this will be understood if you see the movie through the characters and their dreams. The way of directing in this movie is fantastic , which you will not see in many movies, for example a film shot is that two characters are together at the same time and place, but the screen is divided, and this has a very great meaning, and that you are separated from your dream. Music is more famous than the movie itself, so I will not say anything about it. The performance of the actors: What was required of them is not very high performance, but they were required to perform a variety, beginning with a dream with joy, the period of drug use, loss and remorse. All of them performed well except for Sara Goldfarb . She performed above the splendid between the mother's tenderness in the beginning and then being happy in her dream, and in the end the case of madness that reached her at the end, and to any actress that could have come out of the tragic performance of the comic comedy. Simple hair and will separate the two performances, but she stood with all greatness on the edge of tragic performance. If the movie was bad in the beginning and the end is beautiful and great, the whole movie remains great. Imagine the whole movie is great and the end is greater than what you imagine. This is what Darren Aronofsky did when the events reached the end. All this in order to receive all suffering on your chest and feel it.
A rare, great, fantastic movie!",

It is about the empty spaces in our pointless and meaningless lives and the things that we use to fill them. You see, our minds do not like emptiness and we are desperately looking for something that might help us to get rid of that emptiness along with the guilt and pain associated with it. Something that gives us the right to say ""I know who I am. My life has a purpose. I am here for a reason"". Whether they realized it or not, the people in the movie chose something to fill those spaces. Something they needed. Something that for a short period of time made their pain go away. Something that gave a meaning to their existence. In the end, they paid a terrible price for it. Sooner or later, we all do. The difference between us and the characters of this movie is that unlike them, we understand the consequences of your actions. At least we convinced ourselves so.  Do you think that your way to achieve happiness (or chemical balance in your brain) is the right one? See this movie. You will regret it though because it will make you face the reality for a moment.

Everything about this movie is ingenious. From its heart wrenching original score to the brilliant acting jobs by the entire ensemble this move is a spellbinding work of art.  The subject matter is handled far better than any movie before it.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans emerged from their homes in the shallow end of the talent pool. Both gave amazing performances as junkies who will do anything for a fix. While I wasn't shocked by the display of talent by both Jennifer Connely and Ellen Burstyn (because I was already aware of the immense talent that each of these two women have),  I was equally pleased with their performances. The fact that this movie was not nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score is an outrage, but it is far too late to do anything about that.  It is also an outrage that someone as bland as Julia Roberts won the Oscar for best actress over the amazing performance of Burstyn in this film.",

This was ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. Requiem's ferocity is not due to explicit drug use, but to its intense depiction of the effects. The film follows the dark journey of a lonely widow named Sarah Goldfarb (Burstyn), her son Harry (Leto)and his two friends (Connelly and Wayans) as they struggle with drug addiction/ achieving their respective dream in a dismal Coney Island backdrop. The dismal tone of the opening scene with Harry and his mother set the stage for a film that, if anything, shows the devastating and indomitable control drugs can have on a person's life. Whether they are together or separate, Aronofsky intertwines the experiences of each character so brilliantly and artistically that I was almost unconscious in terms of the transition between scenes; they seem to bleed into each other.

However, in Aronofsky's frenetic, visionary, unique, and disturbing style lies the perfect setting for this story of four people whose intertwined lives are filled with eternally hopeful despair. This is a different sort of horror film. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are lovers in Brooklyn with dreams of setting up a small business and spending the rest of their lives in love--their version of the American dream. The two are also desperate heroin addicts, a compulsion that darkens their lives and leads Harry to repeatedly pawn his mother's television. His mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), is addicted to television, which is why she keeps replacing the stolen set. One day she receives a call from her favorite show, the surreal TAPPY TIBBONS SHOW, and learns that she has been selected to appear on an upcoming broadcast. When she can't fit into her best red dress, her doctor prescribes diet pills (uppers), to which she swiftly and painfully becomes addicted. Harry's cohort, an intelligent hustler named Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), completes the foursome. With its unflinching dissection of addiction, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a psychologically disturbing, visually captivating depiction of lost hope.

Showing the protagonists on a gradual downward spiral offers depressing viewing and general monotony through the film's progression but the anti-drugs message sure packs a punch as does the terrific acting, great music, brilliant camera-work and dynamic editing. Aronofsky uses a vast array of technical delights and lurid compositions to depict a drug-induced world inhabited by the characters. These include hectic low-angle close- ups, dizzying POV's and wide angle shots heightening the surreal cinematography. But what really makes the film is the awesome editing by Jay Rabinowitz, who uses some amazing visuals to heighten the drug induced state.

Not only the four main cast is ridiculously boring and cliched, but I also couldn't give a damn about any of them, therefore making the whole emotion exploitation of the movie meaningless. There wasn't a single point in the whole plot in which they tried to be better by pure sacrifice and effort, all of them took the easy way out and basically blamed it all in the rest.
The portrayal of both medical and security staff is laughable, those hospitals looked like they came from a horror movie (electroshocks without anesthetics? Sending away a patient with gangrene, and then arresting him without treatment first? Giving amphetamines to a person who wants to lose weight, just like that?).
Plenty of scenes were totally useless, just there for the shock factor, like frontal nudity, the guy inyecting himself in the wound for no reason, the whole orgy at the ending, and many more.
The editing made me dizzy, it felt like a neverending music video. The dialog is simply awful: a lot of phrases are not only bad, but also used more than once, and in some cases, by more than one character, as if we needed to hear it over and over because they were oh-so-deep.",

Although some bad artistic decisions *cough, split screen, cough* and the first 20 minutes of the movie is kinda monotone, the movie is still great and presents human characters, a realistic scenario and some good acting.

I had seen a few reviews of this movie beforehand and so was eager to see if this movie could possibly live up to those reviews. I'm not so pleased to say that it did. I say not pleased because this movie hit me hard. I was watching a film about addiction, both physical and emotional with characters I really should not care about, with maybe the exception of Sarah (Ellen Burnstein in excellent form). But we are slowly introduced into their seedy and needy lives but once we are pulled in we are not let go as slowly all the main characters' lives start to unravel before us and we feel everything. It's ugly, dirty, nasty and seedy and that's just how I felt as the credits rolled and it was all done without the need (in general anyway) for gratuitous scenes of drug taking, sex or violence (Okay there is a particularly graphic scene towards the end involving Jennifer Connelly but it is spliced between scenes of all the other there characters and so lessens the explicitness of it). This works more on an emotional level and it plays with your emotions so much you cannot help but be affected after. This is not a movie to sit with friends over a tub of popcorn. I would even go as far to say it is a movie better watched alone to feel it's full impact. Just don't expect not to be affected afterwards. Don't think my score of 8 out of 10 is not high. It is. 8 represents a great movie for me. A movie would have to be something extra special to get a 9 and total perfection to get a 10 and as far as I'm concerned that doesn't exist yet.

The direction and cinematography and editing are as look-at-me slick, stylish and gimmicky as the most 80's of music videos. But oh my goodness the plot. I came to this comments board after seeing the film hoping, once my laughter had subsided, to make the obvious ""drugs are bad m'kay"" jokes, mock the ludicrous plot, and point out that this film outdoes Reefer Madness for camp, self-parodying counterproductive hyperbole. But I see plenty of others have beaten me to the punch in stating the obvious. This film is the Monty Python ""Salad Days"" skit writ large. Try drugs, and you will end up getting your infected arm amputated, your game-show-addicted mother will get shock treatment in a loony bin after trying to slim down to fit into her red dress, and funniest of all, your white girlfriend will be forced to fellate over-endowed black men and have foreign objects inserted into her anus at orgies in exchange for drugs. I could almost visualise John Waters and Ed Wood and William S. Burroughs making up this plot over a few cones of wacky tabbacky as they laughed and masturbated themselves silly. Except that they would have cast Divine as both the mother and girlfriend if they had been directing, and they would have called it something like ""Naked Flamingoes from Outer Space"" rather than given it the pretentious title that it actually had. And they wouldn't have taken it all quite so seriously. Watching this film, I honestly expected a Ron Jeremy cameo at any minute. The whole plot sounds like one of his Catskills routines, complete with long-suffering Jewish mothers doting on their disappointing sons. How they managed to avoid having Ellen Burstyn say ""You coulda been a doctor like that nice Dr Spencer"" I'll never know.",

Aronofsky's examination of the dreadful and long-lasting effects that these can have on human beings is agonizingly thrilling- possibly unendurable for some. Still, the dramatic thriller was executed very well and the acting was efficacious. It's mind-boggling, tragic, graphic, absolutely shuttering, but above all, realistic.

I have no idea if that is what he was going after or not. All in all though it was very well put together and very well done. This movie would probably be catagorized as a drama.

OK, this is the scene where he shows us that he is caring son, this is the scene where...that's how the scenes ultimately come off; striped to the bone of most nuances of humanity and as a vehicle to move the story along. I don't like Leto's work much, but it is still difficult to blame his performance and not the script's abridgment in this movie. One could almost sense Aronovky struggling with the limits of the budget, but that's still not an excuse for the underwritten quality of the scenes in this film.

I was so profoundly affected by this movie that I doubt I will see a more important film to come out this year. I will not say much on the plot only because I think many of the user comments have already referred to it. Nevertheless, I think certain aspects of the plot in REQUIEM should be commented on. Primarily, I like how the movie speaks of a greater tragedy. Rather than limiting the movie's theme to an anti-drug message REQUIEM FOR A DREAM shows how addictions (be it drugs, television, etc...) shatter dreams and goals. The ability to create something good, anything good, is one of the greatest gifts a person can possess. When we reduce our lives to the rituals of addiction, and its destructive results, we destroy our capacity to create better lives for ourselves. In this film we see so much potential for these people to have something better. Their quick decline results in some of the best acting ever committed to celluloid. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly all give career-best performances. I have seen very few movies that have actually made me think seriously about my own life. I can honestly say that I think this film has made me a better person and I would like others to benefit from this movie as well. One of the best statements on the quick decline.",

896,26 December 2000,iaido,8," visceral, style and substance abuse","Its easy to understand why some people were left feeling cold by Darren Aronofsky's second feature. It is very bleak. In a loose sense Aronofsky's first two films are outright horror films, each one a throwback to an older horror genre- Pi is the classic paranoid, mad doctor syndrome, and Requiem is reminiscent of the doom and gloom, anti-drug propaganda films made in the 50's and 60's. It is Requiems decidedly downbeat, hopelessness that first turns off many viewers, but the second complaint I heard was for lack of character development. Well, the characters aren't really the issue. Its not a film about whom these addicts are, it's about what happens to them. Like a boxing movie that's not about the fighters, but about the combat itself. If one wants to damn Aronaofsky for that, fine; it is a legitimate gripe since he could have easily fit a few more scenes of development into it, but I don't really think that was his concern.

The rest of the cast is solid-excellent. Each character wants to live some type of decent life, but the drugs keep pulling them back.

However the film is badly directed: there are far too many camera tricks used and it feels like an exhibition of 'things I film school'. If it was just when the characters are tripping out on drugs, then the distorted camera views and use of fast-forward, slo-mo and fast editing of images would be effective.

He certainly had good intentions, ""drugs are bad"" and all that, but the way he did it kind of felt blunt and cold like a drugs class at school. I couldn't really relate personally with the sorrows of the main characters, and most of the arguments he presents seem to argue more for legalization of drugs than not doing them.  It seems that most of their problems would have been solved merely by a more accepting open-minded societal outlook towards drugs, and just not being stupid.  (trying not to point out any spoilers...) For example, the lady taking drugs to lose weight? was she out of her mind? not to mention her gradually stepping up the dosage.  As with what happens to her son, i knew what they problem was the minute i saw it, and knew the consequences if he soon didnt get it fixed from that point early in the movie.  The one good point I'd really like to point out is how they dont really distinguish between legal and illegal drugs, as with the lady popping pills that her doctor gave her, anything in moderation wont hurt you, and anything abused will, despite whether or not your doctor recommends it to you.  I've known some people in my time who have become pretty messed up on perfectly legal drugs, and they dont even really exceed the dosage (to my knowledge).  There's not a miracle pill cure for everything, but our society seems to think there is, so pop the pill and everything will be better...",
915,4 October 2003,jaesboxer,9," An earth shattering, gut wrenching masterwork","I have just watched 'Requiem for a Dream' and it is unlike no other film I have ever seen.  It is so savage, so unmitigated in its horrific images, so twisted and intense that it simply appeared to me as earth shattering. Ellen Burstyn's performance is the highlight of her career, as her portrayal of Sara Goldfarb is nothing short of brilliant.  Through haunting visuals, combining the surrealistic dreamworld of the addict with the horrifying nightmare that lies between highs, Aronosofsky moves beyond the enigmatic pretenses of his first work PI, and into a bold new world.  Nothing anyone said prepared me for this movie, with its utterly honest and terrifying depiction of addiction, it is so much more intriguing than anything else I have ever seen on the subject (the closest would be 'Trainspotting' and that is distant).  A word of advice to the viewer, however.  If you do not have a strong stomach this movie is not necessarily for you.  The entire movie is dizzying and nauseating, not because of any specific visuals but because of its astounding intensity.",

We do not have to be related with drugs, so people think about it, and drop it. my friend was depended from drugs 3 years, and we did know what to do, but now he is clear and he says that we feels like a real human, so i am sure that everybody has to say for drugs no. my friends was depended from drugs until he got into terrible accident. he was driving a car and suddenly he fall asleep, he hurt two people, thanks god they are OK today and he cut his ear! now he almost can't hear with one ear.

Here's your lesson,"Really good movies are hard to watch, this is one of them, the path to ruin of its characters is slowly drawn but unwaivering. These are not your stereotypical junkies, this are people that you would met on the street and give no second thought about what there true affliction is. It is a grim film, a bit slow, repetitious a some points, but it lets you experience total disaster in progress. Ellen Burstyn is outstanding as the lonely, apartment bounded New Yorker. This movie has as its central theme the destruction that drugs to individual and the people around them, but it is much, much more, it is about the frivolity of TV and the circus it has become, it is about the the social discarding of our senior citizens, about the insignificance of the individual (tinny figures filmed against big building).

All of the characters are finely acted, but Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly are stand outs.  Burstyn should have won the Oscar for Best Actress that year.  What Connelly's character does towards the end of the film to get drugs is frighteningly realistic. One of the finest achievements of the film is its ability to get under the viewer's skin and make you feel what the characters are going through, both physically and emotionally. And perhaps most scary is the reminder that drug addiction can happen with legal drugs, as Ellen Burstyn's character demonstrates. ",

Exaggerated situations -according to this story- happen to the heroes (madness etc,) and the point is, that -as for the drugs addiction we don't understand how occurred to the couple of the story, as for the girl, it is enough clear that she suffers from a sort of mental disease- but for the son, it is not clear how he got involved in drugs - the friendship with the other dealer, or money hunting is not enough explained how it becomes a good reason to get into drugs. Mother's madness to the end is the main reason of the exaggeration of the scenario. A point to mention is that from that point it is a good thing to accuse mental institutions and the methods they use to interfere in illness. Also before that atrocious end, it is well explained how bad thing are pills for loosing weight. Despite all that, acting from all four actors is superb, movie's rhythm also.",

What hits hardest in this film is the simple point missed by so many people I've talked to about this movie. The film's main message wasn't in my opinion about destructive drug behavior (that seems more like a frame or device) so much as a sad tale about the inability to relate and communicate with loved ones. Turning away from what could provide support into a family-like world of drug friends and drug fiends Leto's character continues his travels in what is alluded to in the movie having already been a long history of drug abuse and problems.",

OK, the message that drugs are bad may need to reach every generation in a new mantle, but it is not that revealing for most people that got out of their teens.  The fast cuts and comic-like style elements are not really new or original, ""run lola run"" used them more efficient and a few years earlier (and maybe some even older movies I don't know or cannot remember).  *minor spoiler*  The very elaborate images of the mother's drug induced psychosis are interesting, but not very realistic.

In fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction.",
934,23 December 2006,madricci,10," The value of life, packed in suffering and pain","I haven't read the somewhat 1400 comments on this movie,but I'm pretty sure that many of them tell the same. This is the only movie I've ever seen that I don't ever want to watch again, for no money in the world. But it's also one of the greatest I've ever seen.How do these things go with each other? Well, I'm a very empathic person with experience in acting, and no movie ever before could touch me so deeply and make me burst into tears. Why? It is so unbelievably cruel, honest,dark, hopeless and yet so revealing concerning the precious gift of life and the things that make it worth living. When I watched it about half a year ago, I had no idea what it would be like, I thought, well, maybe a pretty good movie about drugs, I also hadn't read the novel which I did now, it's almost as disturbing as the movie.Anyway, after about 45 minutes I had to fight to stay in front of the TV because I felt and experienced everything the characters did and I thought I couldn't stand it any longer, I thought I'd go insane. Especially the fast cut-scenes in the end and the unbelievably disturbing sound were almost more than I could sustain. I have some experience concerning drugs, and some shown feelings and situations were not new to me, but so was the brutality and honesty they were shown with, free from all disguises and useless package. When it was over I couldn't stand being alone and went to a friend, who used to live in the same house. When he opened the door he immediately asked what was going on with me, because I was so pale. I told him I'd seen the movie and he just smiled and said: ""Oh, alright, I understand, with me it was the same."" And then we talked about it, for more than five hours, and after a certain time I realized we weren't talking about the movie anymore but about life in general, about our hopes, dreams for the future and so on. At that point I understood the movie's value and also its beauty. It leaves you, as Frodo says in The Lord of the Rings, naked in the dark, and it's up to you to figure out whatever can help you get into the light, which means, what can make your life rich and fraught with love. And it shows that, no matter what hell we are going through, we need love to survive and we have to fight for it 'til our very last breath, like Harry Goldfarb does in the movie. If I ever gave a 10 here on IMDb for a movie without thinking, I do it for this one. Parents, if you want to prevent your kids from taking drugs, show them this movie and talk about it afterwards, believe me, they won't ever even touch a joint! After I've read some comments now that say those who like this movie don't live in reality, I have to update mine. I can give you guys only one answer: Sorry, but it's you, this movie is reality! I had a lot of friends who died from drugs and I saw them during their last time alive, two of them committed suicide. I know what they were going through and how they felt. And you want to tell me this is unreal and they just got what they deserved? You make me sick! Don't talk about anything you've no idea about just because you're afraid!",
935,9 January 2007,collingodofsex,10, Beautiful and Brutal,"This movie is an amazing movie. It is one of the most daring movies I have seen, aside from Broke Back Mountain. I'll start by saying that this movie is not for everyone. This movie is beautiful in its harsh brutality and realness. Most people who go to watch movies expect predictable plots and happy endings all of which are nice, but not in conformity with reality. Ellen Burstyn is phenomenal. The speech she gave to her son Harry about how lowliness was killing her was touching and hard to hear. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans surprised with the brilliance of their acting. Jennifer Connelly was equally great. The ending of this movie is one of the most brutal and sad endings I have seen and it helps to appreciate life that much more. Man can make himself great, but this movie shows you how he can be as destructive as the devil to himself. As I have said before, this movie is not a popular movie, not meant for simple people. It is a movie for intelligent people, spiritual people, philosophical people. In order to really appreciate your life, you must see how much other people have it worse than you. This movie will help you see that. I recommend this movie to any person who likes to meditate on his/her life, to any dreamer, to any intelligent being who will movies like The Transporter to those who cannot admire true beauty.",

I had to see for myself, to see if all of what i heard was for a good reason. And it was. I have never seen a film that was so relentless with it's attack on its audience. Darren Arnofsky(sp) is a brilliant director that doesn't pull a punch and won't let any members of his cast do so either.  Addiction has never been captured on film like this before, and even though many will try to, i doubt that it will be again. I Put this movie in the same catogory as Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This is the type of film that you can't let sink into the backround, you can't talk with your friends while you watch this movie.

Now I am no fan of Jared Leto's. I abhor his band and I only watched American Psycho because I heard that he died in it. And after watching Scary Movie, I could never imagine Marlon Wayans succeeding in a serious movie role. But both of them proved me 100% wrong. After watching Requiem... I barely even want to touch a glass of alcohol again let alone any type of drugs.

The plush 35mm colors featured here combined with the MTV-style skipping, looping, cut cut cut scenarios justifiably make this the first coffee table movie about junkies. I dare think that if Tobe Hooper, fresh from THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (you know, back when he had talent) had shot this story on grimy, grimy 16mm we would have achieved a truly lurid and disturbing portrait of junkiedom, instead of the pretentious gloss that is REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.",

985,20 August 2001,Manji,10, Proof there is life after Pi...,"Just finished watching Requiem again and i have to say one thing: Well Done. Arno did a great job, a truly spectacular film that just totally surprised. His earlier work, Pi, was completely his baby and totally under his control. With Requiem, he had to adapt someone elses work yet still maintain his artistic integrity. If there are any doubts whether or not indie filmmakers are truly talented, please lay it to rest. The content of the film (incl. EXCSESSIVE DRUG USE, betrayal, deceit, lust, family, hope, failure, and utter physical and mental anguish) were juxtaposed insanely with fast editing, sweet camera work, and a visual style that no mere human being could ever dream for in a film. But the performances in this film were truly, truly magnificent all across the board. Jared Leto - crazy! Jennifer Connoley - reached Julianne Moores exceptional talent, and may very well have exceeded it under the circumstances! Marlon Wayans - utterly stunning in his portrayal as the straight-man role, no jokes, no silly sight gags, just very awesome dramatic power! Ellen Burstyn - whatever pre-conceptions i had towards her performance (i think the academy awards are more corrupt than american politics) were washed away when i experienced first hand the true genius of a disciplined actress who was so utterly committed to her role that i had to constantly remind myself that this was Reagan's mother in excorcist so many years ago. SHE DIDN'T JUST INHABIT THE CHARACTER SHE IS SARA, ELLEN BURSTYN DID NOT EXIST AT ALL! Also, a much needed mention goes to Keith David, a wonderful surprise in the film and the cast of Pi popping up allllll over the place! It's been a long time since i was touched by a film in this way, it felt so deep and incredible that everyone should witness what happens when a studio backs one of the greatest films talents in the world.

This movie is disturbing and disgraceful in the way it seems to suggest to impressionable young minds that if you do drugs you will be cool.  The movie stars Judd Nelson as a young man who can't seem to get along with his mother. He begins shooting heroin and suddenly they have something in common vso she gives him her tv. When he watches tv he sees Patrick Dempsey and Lil' Bow Wow and wants to be just like them. Soon he is an actor and hollywood with a nice haircut, all thanks to heroin. The mother meanwhile has always been doing heroin, but decides that her life will be even better if she begins popping pills. She does, and soon she is young, think and sexy enough that she can go on a game show and win. The  message here is that: drugs make you smarter, sexier, more successful. Judd Nelson's girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, does less drugs then him, but she likes pot. So she leaves him to go get stoned with a mathematician. They smoke and then do important secret work for the government. Again we get the message: drugs make you smarter & more successful. Finally Judd's friend, played by Damon Wayans smokes cigarettes, then dresses up as a clown who is also a detective. He is really good at busting people by nocking them out with a sock and shouting ""homie don't play croquet!"" Again, same message: drugs make you successful!""",

The last part of the movie, when Ellen almost dominates the screen, is unforgettable. I wonder how an actress can accomplish what Ms. Burstyn did in this movie.

1000,23 January 2001,mrkramer,7," Stunning, overpowering visuals","One of the reasons I liked Pi so much was because of the hyperactive, hallucinatory quality of Aronofsky's cinematography. The visuals make this movie as well, along with Clint Mansell returning to do yet another great, haunting film score. Not only was the camerawork excellent, but all lead performances were great. As an original and hard-hitting film, it makes its mark. It very accurately and quickly portrayed taking a hit with a few quick shots. There's a stronger emphasis on visuals than coherent story, however--I found myself concentrating on the camerawork at the expense of other aspects of the movie. Also, I could not finish watching it--during a scene where (SPOILER) Ellen Burstyn is being fed, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are attending to his disgustingly infected arm and Jennifer Connelly is in some sort of group sex scenario, I had to get up and leave because I thought I was going to throw up in the theater. My nausea went away as soon as I was out. I've always had problems hearing people relate medical problems and been hyper-sensitive to portrayals of pain, so that might be why (or maybe the quick cutting did it). The last time I walked out of a movie was probably in the late 80s, however, so this was very unusual. It's especially unusual because I thought it was an interesting and original film. I'd warn anyone physically susceptible to portrayals like this to wait for video, although you might miss some of the visual effects.",
1001,2 December 2000,katiebabs,10, Movie should be shown in every school!!!!,"This year was such a so- so year for movies that this movie should win Best Movie Oscar, Best Actress Oscar, Best Actor Oscar...etc... This movie is simply powerful. If you ever wanted to do drugs or have done them, after you see this you will never look at a needle or a blunt or even a cigarette ever again!!! Every teenager should see this movie. After I left the movie I was shaking. The plot is simple. It takes place during a whole year, broke up season by season. It begins in the summer. There are 4 main characters- A mother (Ellen Burstyn) who loves her son and is still mourning her dead husband. She lives all alone in her apartment. Well, she gets a call to appear on tv and that's when it starts to go down hill for her. Wanting to lose 50 lbs and fit into an old red sexy dress, she goes to the doctor for diet pills.. aka- Speed. Then there is her son (Jared Leto) who is on his way to become a junkie with his friend (Marlon Wayans) who deals and also does drugs but not to the extent for his friend. Then there is Jared's girlfriend (Jennifer Connoly) who is the daughter of a rich fashion district mogel who is in love with jared and the same goes for him. She also does drugs for fun. They come up with the idea that if they start to sell drugs, they will be able to make money and become something. From here the story moves fast through each season to their final downfalls. NO matter what anyone says, this movie is incredibly real, almost like a documentary. The acting was incredible. They all did fantasic jobs but the most surprising of the bunch was Marlon Wayans. He really can act with being foolish or joking. Ellen Burstyn will be nominated for an oscar. All these 4 actors should. You must, MUST see this movie. It is very disturbing but so real and sad. You feel for the characters because they are all people you would like. They just want happiness in their lives and to live for something. Unfortunately they think drugs are the way.

You see the Euphoria and then you see the horror.  The performances are top rate especially Ellen Burstyn as the doomed Sarah GoldFarve.  Burstyn is fantastic and should have won the Oscar. I have not seen a more sad or haunting performance in years.  Jared Leto is terrific as Burstyn's never do well Heroine addict son Harry.  He gives the charecter a nuisance and a guiniune desire to do good though his life has gone bad. Marlon Wayans is shockingly good as Tai, he shocks us with the depth of what is an unheralded and overlooked performance. Jennifer Connolly is great too, she is the one that is placed in the most degrading and embarrassing situations of the four junkies and her performance is a revelation.  Requiem for a Dream is a spectacular nightmare of addiction, it is a horror show and it is a great one. This is the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years, this one is a mind blower.  The hardiest men will be tears by the end of this one. At the end of this movie your stomach will be in knots your heart will be broken, and you will want to watch this movie over again cause it affected you so deeply.

A question that this movie brings to mind is Why does one watch film? There isn't a real answer as it all depends on the viewer (its an art) .

Now that I've given props to my man Marlon, I would like to say that Requiem for a Dream is one of the best, if not the best movie I have ever seen and it is now one of my favorites.

He set tones very effectively, he built us up then watched us fall. The camera work is so entertaining as well, all the little drug taking sequences are quite nice.

1034,9 May 2006,LuckyGraveyardBoots,8, art film at its finest,"Unfortunately the only thing I'd heard previously about this film was that Jared Leto's eyes are dreamy, so I put off renting it for a bit. I have no idea how it got to be the success that it is - it's basically an art-house film with cutting-edge interpretive camera work and grueling to watch besides. The only big problem I saw was, why on earth is Jared Leto's character addicted to heroin? His girlfriend Marion is a jaded, little-girl-whore type, his best friend has mother issues, and his own mother, Sara Goldfarb (played by Ellen Burstyn) has probably the most convincing and affecting drug addiction ever - a lonely, old widow who gets a phone call saying she'll be on TV and consequently becomes addicted to diet pills. The uppers make her irrationally happy, and she keeps going on nothing more than a dream of recapturing her old self, her family, and her happiness. Ellen Burstyn is amazing (you may remember her from The Exorcist) and I have that much more respect for her when I found out she was the co-president of The Actor's Studio after Lee Strasberg died - along with Harvey Keitel and...and...Al Pacino! Returning to the topic - the camera work is the main thing here. In some parts it gives the impression of being on tranquillizers, diet pills, crack, what have you - also despair - and in the last scene, with cuts in between extremely traumatic experiences for each of the main characters, it literally gives you a headache, but you still can't look away. In that way, and also in its extremely sympathetic approach to drug addiction, it's fearless in a way you don't see much anymore. I shall end with the conclusion that Jennifer Connely is an execrable actress, and that Requiem for a Dream is a must-see.",

Allow me to be frank, this movie is one of the most f*cked up movie I have seen; and it it awesome. It comes up there with A Clockwork Orange and similar titles. David Arronofsky is a genius (and probably a little insane, like most geniuses). His use of quick cuts, upper shots, split screen, and time motion are absolutely awesome. That's what attracted me to this movie in the first place, stumbling upon it on the IFC, I realized that it looked like a masterpiece and so I did what any film critic would: I turned it off. I knew I could not watch it from the middle and love as much. So I went out and rented it and watched it from the very beginning to the very end and it was absolutely amazing. The repetitive violin music is chilling and stays with you for days. The plot is somewhat loose, still great, and the way the three stories are intertwined is amazing. It's pretty much the story of four different people and how they go through four different and personal hells and end up f*cked over in the end.

For those who love color, sound and sight; for those who love a some great edits that creates a montage unlike anything produced before will find a treat here.

1039,26 June 2010,boothstr96,10, An Essential Film,"Darren Aronofsky treads waters I believe no director has treaded before. His entire film depicts the theme of the nature of drug addiction. The four characters affected by it provide a stronghold for Aronofsky's point. Never have I seen a film that delves deep within the soul and changes a person. If you have any sort of addiction at all, watch this film, it will change you. I guarantee it. Many people hear and even comprehend the downside to every addiction. But until you see it in plain black and white you do not know what you are really going through. See, an addiction is able to continue its course of poisoning the soul because it masks the truth from the being it parasites from. That person believes they are in euphoria. Yet, to everyone else, they look utterly ridiculous. It takes watching addiction run its course to realize our own addictions and how to resolve them. Aronofsky realizes this and geniously uses cinematic techniques such as change in tone, setting, and trippy special effects to come across with his point. The tone of the film shifts as the addiction takes over. It becomes more grimy as the film progresses. The setting adds to the grimyness of the plot seeing as the main characters live in a less fortunate or ghetto neighborgood. Last of all the trippy special effects are straight disturbing and strike the soul within the human being watching the film. It makes one realize that they think they may have it so great. But anything you are addicted to it too good to be true. Overall, Aronofsky crafts a film that delves deep within the conscience of the human mind. It does more than any other film I have ever seen. Every thing in this film was perfect for the message Aronofsky was trying to accomplish. It takes seeing this movie to really understand the impact of the message portrayed. I can honestly say that I am a changed person after watching this film and I highly suggest you watch it, no matter who you are. No matter if you have an addiction, know someone who has an addiction, or have no addiction at all. This film will open your eyes to the reality of life and make you want to help those who succumb to their own minds and give into impulsive demands. Ten stars for this one. A truly perfect film.",

That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn't disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a long time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it's...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would've been a lousy compromise.",
1042,29 April 2023,mia-for,1, Pretentions,I was expecting much more from this film as it has reached cult status. It is a badly exectuted story with small snipets of three characters lives and everything is very stereotypical. Characters are shallow and superficial and we don't really know anything about them. The scene used as a metafor for using drugs is overused and already seen in Trainspoting (if I remember correctly).,
1043,4 March 2005,ascendant109,1, Not Another Darren Aronofsky Movie!,"Darren Darren Darren. When will you stop making movies!? Seriously, I am really starting to get tired of your ""style."" And you've only made two ""wide release"" films (sorry about all the quotes, if I don't put them there people who like the film will debase my review solely on the fact that the words in quotes aren't correct). While I do think that this film is better than his first opus, Pi, it was by no means whatsoever a great movie. Back are Aronofsky's clichés; the ""hip-hop"" shots (the various fast action sequences used every time the characters do drugs), the snorricam, his penchant for the artistic flair. Requiem also borrows Pi's offbeat soundtrack. While good if not great standing alone, the tunes are poorly matched to the scenes (ergo the beautifully slow title song for all the fast-forward sequences). Aronofsky also steals other director's trademark shots. Victims include David Fincher, a great director, among many others. However, the film is not without it's moments. The acting is all around solid, if not breakthrough in some cases. Ellen Burstyn was fantastic as the deluded mother and Jennifer Connelly was equally magnificent as Harry's beautiful girlfriend. Leto's performance is satisfying, if somewhat forgettable. Most people I talk to have never heard of Leto or can't name a movie he has been in. Wayans' does a terrific job of not hamming his role up. Where he easily could have been funny and over the top he restrains himself and accepts his quiet and intelligent rope. Kudos to you Marlon, and you Darren, for keeping the reigns on him. While I may not buy this movie for my personal collection I would recommend that ANYONE thinking about doing narcotics see this movie beforehand (or just don't even consider narcotics). Even Mr. Aronofsky can't ruin it entirely with his mishmash of artistic detritus.",

1047,15 April 2006,track8-1,10, Should have won an Oscar...,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is the follow up to Darren Aronofsky's highly acclaimed movie ""Pi"". Requiem was debuted in 2000 along with blockbuster hit ""Gladiator"", a Ridley Scott film that ,to me, falls short on the way of telling a ""Best Picture of the Year"" story. ""Requiem for a Dream"", sadly, didn't even get a nomination for best picture but the 2000 ballot was crowded by dreadful snoozers such as ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". ""Requiem"", on the other hand, is shocking, eye-opening, and demands to be seen. ""Requiem"" is the story of four individuals in Coney Island that are trying to make their dreams come true but are constantly consumed by their addiction to drugs.

All of them are good people and they have their light side, but the end for each of them is tragic. We have a young couple who love each other and a friend of the main character.

This was a beautiful horror film, but the characters didn't engage me. I knew that doom awaited all them, and I wanted them to find a way out, but I didn't really care. The visuals were shocking and provocative. A husband and wife sitting behind us left when they showed the arm. But they wouldn't have left if they had cared what happened. I understand that Aronofsky is showing the inevitable emptiness that results from long term drug addiction, but why make a movie that's only purpose is to show that drugs are bad? The first half of the film was much more playful, with the charcters imaginings, with Sara's hope of making it on TV, but as soon as I knew there was no hope, that nothing new and creative was going to happen, I lost interest. It creates martyrs out of its characters, which coupled with Jared Leto, Marlon Wayons, and Jennifer Connelly's aesthetic beauty - sensationalizes drug use.

But I just have to say that hand's down Ellen Burstyn is the greatest thing about this movie. There's an extremely hallucinatory scene that just blows your mind away.

This film is not for the weak at heart, it is real, gruesome and truthful. But, this film is important to understand and comprehend the power of these drugs. A great film that is produced, directed, and acted very well, i highly recommend. Just make sure you can handle the truth, This film expressed the true evil of addition, please be careful when watching this movie, it will move if your not ready, i cant stand this stupid review s**t limitation crap. etc. etc.",
1073,22 September 2011,pisarenco-a,2, One of the worst stories,"The good: Actors did a splendid job. So did the director. Scenes were wonderfully filmed. In fact, the whole movie is a masterpiece when it comes to visuals. It kind of reminded me movies by Guy Ritchie. It is filmed in a similar manner. Also, I think this movie is great for teenagers. It contains nudity in some scenes, but I think that in the context this movie is presenting it, the whole message would be a good one for the kids. After all, they've seen nudity all over the internet. One little movie won't hurt their innocence, however it will build up an emotion inside which I think will help them renounce the wish to try drugs.",
1074,15 November 2003,elusivedream78,10," The love scenes of this movie were great. And, I enjoyed the rest.","For some reason, I just thoroughly enjoyed the ""love scenes"" of this film, despite the fact that they were between two characters who were junkies. The laying on the couch facing each other, the thinking of each other, etc -- these were all done better (at least to me) in representing ""young love"" than any other film I've seen.  The rest of the movie is very dark (and great), but to me, these scenes are the ones that stick out.  One of my all time favorite movies.",

1076,27 November 2013,whuntva,5, The Ultimate in WTF,I have no idea what to say about this film. Is it good? Maybe. Is it bad? It shows shades but it is not terrible. I have never seen such a film which gets so much right yet at the same time so very much wrong. ,
1077,29 June 2001,rbalmf,1, Utterly uninvolving and stupifyingly predictable,I knew practically nothing about this film before I saw it and cared slightly less afterwards.,

1079,27 June 2001,cawooden,10, Ellen Burstyn deserved the Oscar...,"I am a bit late viewing this movie, as I live in a small town in Tennessee, one whose local cinema would never consider showing a film such as this...it wasn't until I purchased the DVD that I was able to see it.  I was anxious to see ""Requiem for a Dream"" because I had loved ""Pi"" so much...and I was in no way disappointed, even though the two films are vastly different. While ""Pi"" was stark (mainly because of the b&w cinematography), claustrophobic and had an overwhelming sense of the  main character's obsession and paranoia, ""Requiem"" is loving despite the cruelty, haunting, beautiful, and heartbreaking.  The cinematography is stunning; even when these characters begin to fall apart before our very eyes, the camera and the lighting still seem to capture a bit of beauty about them, finding a bit of hope, at least for a while.  The soundtrack is amazing, and a perfect compliment to the images and the story.  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly all give wonderful performances, but this film belongs to Ellen Burstyn.  She literally owns every scene she is in (and even a few she is not, because you are still thinking about her character, Sarah, even after the story has moved on). Burstyn deserved the Oscar for this film...to the devil with Erin Brockovich and her push-up bra. I am a high school English teacher, and I would love to be able to show this film to every student in my classes, for many different reasons, the first being to show what great characterization is all about; the second reason would be to show the dangers of addiction...but did I mention I live in a small town in Tennessee?",
1080,8 August 2005,comfortablynumb_1,10, The American equivalent to Trainspotting,"This film is flawless. A simple idea executed perfectly. Without subtlety, this is a truly intoxicating experience. The characters experience a transition from mundane, but happy lives to living nightmares, where death seems to be a better option. Drug addiction is a common theme in films but this film is limitless in the scope of the issue. From young people needing cash to the lonely and elderly. Their lives change in a way I could never imagine.",

1086,10 February 2007,HabaneroBuck,3, High on the incredulity scale.,"I echo most of the negative comments, but the main problem I had with the film was my continual questioning of events as the story progressed. Drugs are bad, and that is fine, but they are NOT that hard to find. In essence, the problems faced by half of the cast was a result of the scarcity of narcotics in NEW YORK CITY. Should I find this scenario credible? One can manage heroin addiction using prescription painkillers (which is what folks like this would have resorted to), rather than driving 600 miles away or engaging in an uncomfortable orgy. They could have scored some dilaudid, hydrocodone, oxycontin, or even methadone to get them through the dry streak. Two thousand dollars in hand, and not an idea about what to do? ",

It had been a while since the last time I woke up one morning and immediately thought of a movie. I just could not get it out of my head!The photography is incredible not to mention the music. This movie will leave you glued to your seat. Some gut wrenching scenes will turn away some viewers, but I could not look anywhere else. Aronofsky outdid himself on this one, hard to imagine himself toping this masterpiece. How about Marlon Wayans role? It had never occurred to me he was good for anything other than a silly comic role. Jared Leto, Ellen Burnstyn, and Conelley were all wonderful.

1100,9 October 2000,repulsion,10, A Dreamy Trip Through the Hell of Addiction,"One of my favorite moments in cinema occurred when Cocteau's hero in Blood of the Poet desperately tries to rub off a pair of lips from the palm of one of his hands. Having rubbed the lips from the a portrait he has painted, the artist is told by the living statue in his studio that a scar like that is not that easy to remove. From there, the hero is thrust into a Kafkaesque dreamscape where he realizes that `sleeping or dreaming, the dreamer must accept his dreams.' There is such a sensibility in the new Aronofsky film, as characters seem to float between a harsh realities and dreamscapes.",

It goes on, and on, and on and then it ends, with the characters suffering more and more disgraces. Is that really amusing? Is that really shocking? Is that really enlightening? Is this film really going to change somebody's thinking about drug addiction? What is this film for? To show that drugs can kill you and ruin your life? Sorry, I didn't know that... At last, I told myself: ""Well, I saw this terrible movie while I could be doing so much better things. The next time I wish to see boring and sad things, I might just watch the news...""",
1102,22 March 2004,dadie,10, The cruel life with dependency,"I think the destiny let me watch that movie. I have seen another movie of the same director, I was impressed of it, I saw also, here in Imdb, that Requiem for a dream was appreciated by users and somebody else told me many good things about it, so I wanted to watch it, but it was not easy to be found. Very strangely, once, I read the program of a satellite tv channel never watched and (surprise) Requiem for a dream was there that night. The expectations have not been disappointed, it is a great movie. At the beginning you don't feel too much, everything seems normal (to be a movie). Step by step it let you feel the same emotions of characters, every one, and unfortunately they are bad emotions. After having watched this movie you feel very bad, something remain in you stomach, it is incredible. The director is able to let you enter in the mentality of a disturbed mind, disturbed by drugs, but it could be anything else that give dependency. Everything is secondary, dignity, family, love and life as well, to find what they need is the priority. Wonderful use of music, it interpret the anguish of imagines. The director is incredible using imagines mixed quickly, to make credible the dream-reality mix created in character's minds. If you haven't watched it yet do it, but don't go to bed just after, it will be difficult to sleep, you should watch another movie or go outside thinking something else. It is a straordinary movie, It have to be seen, it is a good example of the art of cinema.",
1103,13 April 2003,adrnathms,6, Not worth the rating,"I rented Requiem because of its high rating on the indie list.  I agreed with most of the rankings so thought I should give Requiem a chance (have passed it up a number of times at the video store).  I have to say . . . I felt that it wasn't quite worth the rating that it received.  I do agree that the acting was good, but I think even Jennifer Connelly did better in Beautiful Mind.  Just my opinion.",
