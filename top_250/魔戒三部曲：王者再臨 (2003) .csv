1,22 November 2006,OttoVonB,10, All Good Things come to an End!,"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.",r
2,9 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Pretty much outstanding,"I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.",e

4,17 December 2003,GuyCC,10, Unprecedented.,"Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?",i
5,19 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Perfect way to finish the trilogy,"Finally, the last movie in the series. Finally, Peter Jackson makes his intentions clear. Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion.",e
6,16 March 2005,Derek237,10, They saved the best for last,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.",w
7,11 February 2022,terrylarosa,10, Still the greatest movie ever made,"Nothing even comes close and I may well not see it personally topped. Every single scene is magnificent. The acting is superb as is the direction, script, hauntingly beautiful music, cinematography and the incredible battles; especially the hour long battle on the Pellenor Fields and Minas Tirith. The characters
are some of the greatest ever created and to root for. The movie is simply perfection from beginning to end and the 4 hour version is just as majestic. There's not a single negative thing I can say about a movie that deserves all it's nominated Oscars. My family and I watched it 4 times in its first 12 days of release. A joyous experience every time. Magnificent!!!!!!",/
8,16 March 2006,Hitchcoc,10, I lived to see them all!,"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied ""The Lord of the Rings"" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.",r
9,4 February 2004,JamesHitchcock,10, The first great cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century.,"I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I  have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The  Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and  fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark  Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by  the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be  used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen,  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many  films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah  Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.",w
10,25 August 2008,fearfulofspiders,10, The Supreme Motion Picture of All Time...,"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is by far the most moving, inspirational and epic of the three parts in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece. After proving that this trilogy can carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film, and that fantasy can be surreal, but grounded to reality.",1
11,30 November 2007,mstomaso,10, Part 3: It's Not Really the Thought that Counts,"Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit ""Chronological"" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.",0
12,17 December 2003,Chris_Docker,9, A monumental film,"Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.",0
13,1 September 2005,kevin_crighton,10, Brilliant. Simply brilliant,"Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.",4
14,19 July 2009,Tweekums,10, A fantastic conclusion to a great trilogy,"After a brief prologue showing us how Sméagol came to get the ring and how he came to be the pitiful creature we know the film proper starts where The Two Towers left off; Sméagol is continuing with his plan to lure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelob's lair and Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard.",3

18,25 December 2005,classicsoncall,10," ""Put aside the Ranger, become who you were born to be.""","Weary beyond words, Hobbit companions Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring, with the sinister Gollum still their guide. The film opens interestingly with Gollum's origin story, capturing his descent into depravity and madness, finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect it's bearer, and not for good.",?

21,6 April 2014,Al_The_Strange,10, LOTR ROTK Review,"After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.",f
22,13 February 2004,Theo Robertson,10, A Breathtaking Conclusion To Cinema`s Greatest Fantasy Epic,It takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in cinema chains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker . How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled,_
23,11 March 2021,jrugg19,10, Quite Literally the Greatest Trilogy Ever Made,"I'm not sure what could be said about LOTR that hasn't already been said, other than that I personally think it's best trilogy ever put to screen, and I really can't think of anything close. Peter Jackson took on the most demanding project imaginable and created a series that will be remembered forever. He respected Tolkien's literature and stuck so incredibly close to the source material and translated it so effortlessly in such grand fashion. I highly recommend the extended editions, as they devote more time to building Middle Earth and developing their incredible characters ever further. 20 years later and the series still looks incredible, especially in 4K. What Jackson did here could never be replicated; he created the best trilogy ever made.",=
24,27 December 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, The journey and the destination are both well worth the investment of time,"I haven't read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10",t
25,24 October 2020,numenorsniper-66396,10, I cry buckets every time,"I'm writing this review as I watch Fellowship again right now. I was 12 when Fellowship first released in the cinema, and LOTR defined my life ever since for many years, and the trilogy has remained my favourite movies, with no others that come close. They made me cry in the cinema, and in every viewing since. I can put on even a brief portion of the films, and the feelings come rushing back. Everything about these three movies is perfect, in my opinion, especially the amazing music that is so perfectly crafted that I can't think of a better movie soundtrack. The only OST that matches it is the Halo game soundtrack. Both the Halo and LOTR franchise began in the same year (2001), and were the two major pillars of my life since childhood.",t
26,2 March 2021,view_and_review,9, Almost Perfect,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. This movie--this trilogy really--is in no need of my praise, so I'll say that there were just a couple of moments of exasperation for me (which I guess will happen over a three plus hour movie). Among the points of exasperation was a point when I wanted to slap Frodo. I'm sure that part needs no mention.",_
27,15 January 2020,bowmanblue,10, The conclusion of 'epic',"It's hard to imagine that anyone would join 'The Lord of the Rings' saga so late in its on-screen life, so if you've never heard of this tale (there must be at least one of you!) then I suggest you begin with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and take it from there. However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').",u
28,17 December 2003,eiratan,10, A Brilliant Conclusion,"As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.",r

31,19 February 2020,Keemshave,10, Perhaps the greatest film ever made.,"It is difficult to argue that many films should sit on top of the mountain of the greatest movies ever made, but one of those is The Return of the King.

32,13 March 2021,mrmocun,10, The only movie I don't want to finish,"If we consider The Fellowship of the Ring is a history, we could consider The Two Towers as a legend,and we could consider The Retern of the King as a myth.",
33,1 November 2019,acedj,10, The epic conclusion to the story,"Before I talk about this movie, I want to say that I got my aged grandmother hooked on the series. I would visit her every Saturday, and I brought the first two movies over on DVD and we watched them. She was hooked. Peter Jackson did such a good job bringing the books to life. Surely there was a lot left out, he would have needed six movies to fit in everything from these novels. I am happy to say that I brought my grandmother to the theater to see this when it came out, and for the entire run, she did not move an inch. To me that says all there can be said about this movie. To see a woman well in her 80, so transfixed was such a treat. This movie is sad and happy all at the same time and is wonderfully done.",
34,28 March 2012,carlos-grant,10, Perfect!,This movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received.,
35,4 February 2020,cricketbat,10, The epic conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time,"The Return of the King is an impressive film because it wraps up the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a way that is satisfying for both fans of the books and those who have only seen the movies. This finale is a rollercoaster of emotions, with impressive sets, elaborate costumes, and eye-popping visual effects. The Lord of the Rings was already a great novel, but it has now become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made.",

40,11 March 2015,fernandoschiavi,10," The film is transgressive, innovative, and not afraid to take over as the definitive work of recognized worldwide work of Tolkien","The Return of the King comes to the big screens worldwide in 2003 evoking the most diverse types of feelings: sadness, joy, delight and satisfaction are some of them. After two adaptations that have shocked the world with its grandeur, director Peter Jackson presents fans around the world with a performance worthy of applause and bows certainly will miss and leave an empty feeling in the mind of anyone who likes movies. Peter Jackson had the challenge of overcoming the stigma that the end of trilogies are always inferior and never meet the expectations of fans. Thus, citing some examples, The Matrix Revolutions, also released in 2003, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and Back to the Future 3. The fear of not overcome the previous growing further because The Two Towers have been a landmark in special effects and maintained the same level of quality The Fellowship of the Ring. Fortunately, Jackson has not only surpassed their predecessors, they created probably the greatest fantasy film in cinema history, an epic beyond compare proportions and practically unattainable.",

44,4 January 2012,nickmesafilms,10," The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) - My Precious, This is a Masterful Final Chapter!","Finally, after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema, ""The Lord of the Rings"" series finally comes to a close, with ""The Return of the King"". I'm so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series, but it's also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where ""The Two Towers"" left off, where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor, while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then, Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron, and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson, and thousands of artists and technicians, they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that, only at the movies, we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant, continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam, and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that, it's Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003, for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character, and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol (a.k.a. Gollum) that's super thrilling, to a final setback, Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time, I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer, that I didn't care about how long it was. It has everything you'd expect to see. It's got heartbreak, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and magic. The special effects are exhilarating, from beginning to end, and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection, and the original score is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects, and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching, the friendship scenes are heartwarming, the fight scenes are groundbreaking, and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. It's a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director, a brilliant cast, groundbreaking special effects, incredible art direction, amazing music, and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I'm glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003.

46,10 November 2008,g-bodyl,10, Breathtaking!,"The Return of the King is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. This movie deserved the eleven Oscars it got including the Editing. Without the editing, this movie would've been over four hours long. Even though this movie is about three and a half hours, it dies not feel like it. The scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. Gollum is the show-stealer again. As the ring is taking Frodo away from strength, Gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive Sam away. It was kind of sad to see Gollum die along with the Ring in the fires of Mt.Doom. Aragorn deserves to be king of Gondor. He was amazing in this movie(played by Viggo Mortensen). I am glad that Legolas and Gimli were used for comedy. With all the drama and action, there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. The acting is perfect. I liked most of the characters. It was sad when Theoden died. He was great in this series. The music by Howard Shore is even better. You can hear some Celtic tunes during some scenes. I loved the song, ""Into The West"" by Annie Lennox. The effects and the CGI is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. Peter Jackson really put his name into the record books. This is the best fantasy epic, in fact the best movie of all time. I rate this movie 15/10(if the rating system went any higher).",

Everything that we've awaited in life is summed up in this piece of cinematic history. Every one of the cast members does a masterful job.

How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know, maybe he used one of Gandalf's enchantments! Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment, every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing, to the production crew, to the acting, to the scenery,to the music (oh god I love the music)and just everybody's determination to pull this near impossible feat off, even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune, (Viggo Mortensens' last minute replacement says it all), it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along.

60,20 December 2003,zetes,9, A legitimately great movie,"An adventure movie to match the great ones of the past, and the one to beat for the future. The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were.",

But now regard it as pure perfection. I don't think a film series can be beaten for music, script or acting. It's masterful in all three. I think we can forgive Jackson for the few directing failings along the way, the. Man had a lot on his plate lol. But seriously I'll be watching these films forever. Simply The GOAT.

The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.

The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema.

This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all.  This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one.  This one has epic battles and great visuals as well.  It is also very well acted.  Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one.

But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us.

There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others would have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out.

I hasten to add that I do like the films and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but I just do not see them as the 10/10 all time greats that other people see them as. I love fantasy stories and films in general, I just find these films to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they are. The main thing in the trilogy I find absolutely impressive is Gollum (Andy Serkis). The motion capture performance by Serkis is genius and the CGI character was the best up to that time. Also Gollum is a great character, hilarious, sometimes creepy and fascinating. Also you cannot fault Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and there are other good performances too.",

Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion.

I was outrageously fortunate to attend last night's London premiere of King and, though I don't say such things lightly, this goes straight into the list of candidates for best film ever made. Rest assured, fans, less liberties are taken with the source material than was the case with Towers. But never mind the literary roots - this is CINEMA at its best. Spectacle to put Ben Hur or the Star Wars films to shame; emotion and the human dimension to rival American Beauty or even Casablanca; settings and cinematography that make you want to sell your flat tomorrow to get New Zealand air tickets; and, of course, astonishing performances. So, who to give the Oscars to? Besides Best Picture, Best Director for Peter Jackson and Best Score for Howard Shore - those I take as given. Surely Sean Astin for Samwise - and make that Best Actor in a Starring Role. It's a large main-character cast, so how do you define the star? Put simply, he provides the emotional core, the heart of the story and the summation of its message about fighting for what you believe in, about courage, friendship and love - and he does it SO well. Besides, the Supporting Oscar belongs to Andy Serkis for Smeagol / Gollum. OK, I'm finished, now. I'll leave writing a proper review to others this time; my gush will have to do, as I don't want to include any spoilers and I haven't time to do this sublime film justice.

137,21 October 2016,cdjh-81125,10, The Perfect Culmination of A Perfect Trilogy,"Lord of The Rings Return of The King is one of the most universally beloved movies of all time at all the praise it receives could not be more deserved this is an incredible movie that is the definition of how to conclude a trilogy. Lord of The Rings has never been about the battle sequences they are all about the characters and their interactions. Frodo and Sam have some of the best chemistry I've ever seen in a movie they just feel like they are meant to be each other and feel like brothers every time they are on screen. Aragon, Legolas and Gimili are also amazing together not only are they great for producing laughs but they also have a great connection with one and other you see how well they work together and how they have come to trust and love one and other. The constant physiological warfare between Sam and Gollum is made all the more thriller through the opening of this movie which reveals his finding the one ring and in a very disturbing sequence his mental deterioration afterwards. Faramir and his relationship with Theoden is thrilling you always feel for him. The rather odd pairing of Pippin and Gandalf in this movie is also amazing they just feel like each others crutches during their experiences. Though these films have never relied on the battle sequences they've always benefited from them and here they are incredible you feel the stakes because of how well these characters have been developed, you feel the scale of the enemies they are facing and the grittiness of the close quarters combat. This movie contains one of the greatest third acts ever put to film you just know that it's all been building to this and your heart cannot stop beating. The final showdown between Middle-Earth and Saurons army is extremely satisfying especially to see Aragon take his rightful place as king and to see all these different species truly come together as one. Another inspiring sequence is when Sam and Frodo finally arrive at Mount Doom it feels like the perfect culmination of the story arc and seeing these characters succeed despite being all but broken because of it shows us that they're flesh and blood characters with everything to lose. Now I know it's popular to complain about the long ending but it really works it helps to put the events of the entire trilogy into perspective and the final scene with the Hobbits and Gandalf leaves me in tears every single time again because of how feel we have come to know these characters but also let's you know that they have further adventures ahead of them after the credits roll.

138,18 January 2006,rebeljenn,10, Breathtaking,"'Return of the King' was one of the best films that I have seen in a long while, and it has helped to fill a void and get audiences more interested in fantasy films. Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the photography and use of scenery is amazing. The cast of characters and the battle scenes were also done extremely well and set to an equally-beautiful soundtrack. This is one of the best films in film history and almost equal to 'Star Wars'. It has a good mix of action, adventure, and character development. It's also the most emotional of the films.",

The third was simply mind-blowing with amazing fight scenes, and pretty much all the violence you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, violence truly isn't everything in a movie.

It's amazing at how a movie can be four hours long, yet not feel as if it was more than three, or two and a half. The visual effects are incredible. The trilogy as a whole is unbelievable; marvelous; stupendous; phenomenal; you understand what I'm getting at. It is a true tale of friendship and love. It's an adventure all throughout; not only for the protagonists, but the viewers. The effort put into the whole thing is just shocking.

149,21 January 2004,manalone923,10," Wonderful finale, sweeping emotions and action","Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like ""gets everything right"", and ""I enjoyed every minute of it"", but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving ""Into the West"" is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends.  The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored.",

BY ALL MEANS RENT IT, but make sure you watch the two first movies first.",
162,23 December 2007,johno1100,9, Epic tale of greed and hope (The best of the three),All of peter Jackson's film adaptation's of Jrr Tolkien's tell a tale of hope counter balanced with greed. And as the series concludes with Lord of the rings the return of the king the hope pays of for the heroes as Frodo and Sam finally destroy the ring despite the attempts to kill and tempt them. Many characters go through deep spiritual changes and somehow Jackson puts all these tales together without rushing the movie along. Among other things the movie is also a tale of good vs evil and as with most good vs evil movies the good win. Despite a few minor flaws such as focusing on the glory of war and not the horror. (If the movie was about a historical battle it would probably be a tragic tale and not a heroic tale.)But all in all the masterful tale cancels out the few flaws.,
163,22 January 2005,OboeSaxIII,10, The problem with imagination,"Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the ""true"" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.",
