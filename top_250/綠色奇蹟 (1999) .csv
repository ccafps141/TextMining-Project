0,25 January 2000,Movie-12,10, One of the most penetrating films of the past several years. **** out of ****,THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****,/
1,29 October 2009,thinker1691,9," "" I knows you think I's a powerful man, but the darkness scares me boss ""","The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****",r

Because I want it over and done. I do. I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. Tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world everyday. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. Can you understand?",e
3,7 December 2009,bkoganbing,10, The Least Of us,I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. ,v
4,8 January 2012,oundjianm,10, Do not live your entire life without seeing this film!!!,GREATEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. i remember seeing it when it first came out when i was 12 years old. now i just finished watching it and have gone through practically a whole box of tissues...,i
5,17 June 2001,jlacerra,10, A one of a kind classic,This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.,e
6,2 December 2009,deepaknarwal88,10, this movie can tear emotions out of anyone.,"i expected this movie to be a normal and i just want to see it for Tom Hanks but as movie goes through i cry,i laugh and there comes a feeling which can't be described in words. i rate this movie as the best i have ever seen. some moments in the movie makes me hold my bed pillow in the tightest ever grip. i can guarantee that this movie will leave an impression in your mind for a long time. i even say that this movie is better than shawshank redemption.fantastic story, brilliant acting,mind boggling feelings and overall an unforgettable drama. if you have watched 1000 movies and not this then your movie watching journey is incomplete.i will also make sure that even my next generation should watch this one.",w

8,10 February 2000,uniikki,10, A rare gem of casting and direction.,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.",r
9,15 December 1999,KathyT,10, As wonderful as the book!,"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you.",w
10,5 January 2023,Sleepin_Dragon,10, An incredible movie.,"Paul Edgecomb and his team of prison guards get a surprise when John Coffey walks through the door, a man of huge stature, with a timid demeanour, but a special gift, but convicted for murdering two children.",2

Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed.",2
13,11 July 2013,transylvanianfairy,10, It will stay with you for a long time.,"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.",7
14,16 February 2013,illbebackreviews,10," This movie blew me away, made me laugh, made me cry and me truly understand what the term 'sad' meant","Until I saw 'the Green Mile', I always thought that the 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump' were the two saddest movies that I ever saw, but this movie actually blew me away for good.",1
15,9 January 2000,alan photog,10, Film was invented for creations like this.,"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.",3
16,6 February 2019,undeaddt,8," Rest In Peace, Michael Clarke Duncan, you legend.","With this movie Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the all time best male actors that shook the world with their abnormal amazing acting roles. Among the TOP 100 IMDB rated movies, he has probably more than 4-5, including The Green Mile, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Captain Philips was also an amazing movie. But the spotlight in The Green Mile is reserved for Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey. Nobody can count the amount of people that this person made cry in the early 2000's. He is the most adoring male human being that showed up on the movie screen in this century, his acting is out of this world and emotions are leaking out of every cell of his body. The fact that the actor died 7 years ago makes everyone 10 times more sad....rest in piece legend. Above all, we must not forget that this is another movie based on a Stephen King novel that succeded big time, which shows why we may consider King as the best novel writer of all time.",1
17,27 February 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," Overlong, but haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing","I am starting to like Stephen King's work more now, and I read the book. A wonderful book, that is faithfully(mostly) adapted into an equally wonderful film. My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.",/
18,14 June 2011,symonm,10, Another period prison based Darabont masterpiece!,"In every way, this is a wonderful film and IMO deserves a rare 10/10 because it's hard personally for me to see how it could have been made any better. Hugely touching, emotive on every human level, a brilliant storyline, by all accounts a faithful screenplay and wonderfully cast. It's long, but the time flies.",?
19,24 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, Supernatural prison drama is a feather in the cap for all involved,"An excellent prison epic which proves to be another splendid adaptation of a Stephen King novel – the bar has certainly been raised in the '90s for such adaptations after all the trash we got in the 1980s (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE anybody? Thought not). THE GREEN MILE is a splendid exploration of man's psychology, interactions with other men, and attitudes towards life and death emphasised by the uncomfortable Death Row setting. The characters in this film are vividly portrayed by many accomplished actors and actresses and the film works best as a slow-burning character drama packed with incident and occasionally fireworks. Of course being a King story there is a supernatural aspect to the tale (a prisoner is able to perform miracles) but this does not detract from the realism that the film offers in its story.",r
20,22 June 2020,frankde-jong,7," A good film that is certainly not a remake of ""The Shawshank redemption""","Frank Darabont as a director has only made 4 films. The most highly rated are ""The Shawshank redempion"" (1994) and ""The green mile"" (1999). At first glance these films have much in common. Both adapted from a book written by Stephen King, both situated in a prison and both about the friendship between a white and a black man.",e
21,31 January 2000,thomaseb,10, Amazing and captivating rendition of the novel.,"The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves.",f
22,14 November 2010,ykelentonador,10, Should be higher in top 250. One of those movies which makes you cry and admire creator's mind. True Masterpiece,"This movie goes beyond others into an elite group with movies like Facing The Giants, Good Will Hunting, Men Of Honor and others; in which the story is so brilliant and takes you to a climax higher than the usual, that it baffles you to think that there exist possibility in the human mind to create such a story. Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it.",_
23,7 September 2019,undsiebzig,10, My most favourite movie,"OMG! This movie has it all. The story, the characters, the setting. It's just such an emotional tear-jerker. I cannot understand how someone can dislike this movie. I can highly recommend this, I can guarantee you this will force you to reflect your own character as well as the choices the movie figures make.",=
24,29 March 2008,stallone-9,9, Right next to Shawshank!!!,Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.,t
25,18 November 2012,raulfaust,8, A Picture To Remember,"I believe I'm one of the few human beings that had no idea of what is movie was about. I heard a lot about this picture, of course, but I didn't even know what the main story was. Maybe it's a plus, since it allowed me to see the entire thing without knowing what was gonna happen next. Well, like other death row movies, this one really touched me; ending with people lives, despite what they've done, is a sad subject for me. It must be the most terrifying feeling to know you're going to be killed in a matter of minutes. Preparing yourself for the electric chair might be even worse. As a thrilling Stephen King's story, ""The Green Mile"" brings an innovation-- this time, a character has a special gift of healing people, like a saint. It is indeed beautiful to see that big and apparently bad guy helping people as he can. Filmmakers are mean in this case-- they make you adore the character, just to kill him in the end and let you down. It happened to me as well, I cried in the end and it is not a common thing for me-- so by that you can imagine how strong this movie is. A masterpiece in matter of acting, story and life.",t
26,6 May 2011,Joeyistheman,10, 'what happens on the mile stays on the mile',This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.,_

28,17 January 2000,schd5,10, Mesmerizing & Thought Provoking,"Without using all the old cliches, I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a creative, intriguing, and life enhancing experience. Everything about this movie was delightful. I recommend seeing this movie with someone especially close to you. After the movie my Fiancée and I spent two hours talking and expanding on the films ideas and concepts. This was truly a electrifying experience. I would venture to call this movie one of the best movies of all time.  Sure, there are things that I would have liked to see done differently, but that is what makes a movie more enjoyable. The discussions following this film were wonderful.",r
29,10 October 2001,snexy,8, What a gem....,"Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5",v
30,5 August 2013,ironhorse_iv,9, Frank Darabont's Green Mile goes the extra mile and delivers a great movie.,"I promise you that if you have any humanity in your soul, by the end of watching this movie. You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the ""Christ"" like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall: I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan. You were a great actor.",
31,15 February 2021,auuwws,9, The Green Mile,"Sadest movie I ever saw, I was very sad and cried over John's execution, all the characters of the film were written by the author very carefully, and this is not strange to Stephen King, the story of the film and the film's presentation about reality and linking it to the movie The Shawshank Redemption was wonderful from the writer, the acting was wonderful, especially Michael Clark Duncan and Tom Hanks, I wasn't a little bored watching the movie, unlike most films that lasted three hours or more.

I avoided watching The Green Mile for years after my very first experience left me crying for a whole week and experiencing intense nightmares about it.

The terror here is provided not by a demonic clown or a shop keeper from hell, instead it has a human face. In fact a couple of human faces, in the form of sadistic killer 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell) and corrupt prison guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). Their characterizations are just a few of the excellent portrayals in a film that leave one with mixed emotions and perhaps a misty eye or two.",

37,20 April 2023,klindon-38400,9, Great movie but people don't talk enough about Sam Rockwell,This is the first time I ever saw this fantastic actor. There is something very interesting going on behind his eyes and compelling about everything he does when he is on screen. Do people know how truly rare that is? He's watchable from the moment he shows up to the moment he's gone and you can't wait for him to show up again. That is serious start quality. I have sense come to love him in everything he's been in. I even watched a superhero movie because he was in it lol. Just kidding. Superhero movies have good and bad just like every other genre. I love great acting and great actors. Sam Rockwell is one of my favorites.,

39,2 December 2020,burakkutlu-40593,9, This movie can make anyone cry,"In my opinion, The Green Mile is a masterpiece. Actors play very well especially Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey and Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb. This movie is the best emotional movie I have ever seen. I had cried when I watched the execution scene. I think this was the scene where most people cried. John told Paul not to put that thing on his head, he was afraid of the dark. John had a superpower that he could cure somebody. He cured Paul's illness and revived Mr. Jingles. After they execute John, Paul said God sent us his angel, and they killed him. In my view, this movie is unique. All in all, The Green Mile is a very touching drama movie.",

42,20 April 2006,Hitchcoc,9, A Little Editing Please,"I had no experience with the book. I should have suspected that the supernatural would begin to play into this. It took me a while to get away from it being a grandchild of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to a movie about healing and the power to heal. The whole issue of the electric chair is what I remember the most. The dramatic way we have performed capital punishment. I remember Susan Hayward in "" I Want to Live."" I was 10 years old and the movie still haunts me. Had this man not been a healer, a supernatural creature, the story would have been just fine. His character is so multi-dimensional in the way it lights up a screen. He has that strong presence that says, ""All will be right."" He goes about his business despite the hatred that hovers around him, the redneck culture that has done this to him. He holds his head high because he is right.

43,25 July 2017,Horst_In_Translation,8, Easily one of the best 1990s movies,"""The Green Mile"" is an American movie from 1999, so this one will have its 20th anniversary 2 years from now when I write this review (2017). Let me start by saying that this film runs for over 3 hours, so if very long films aren't your preferred choice, then you can skip it. It's okay, but you are really missing out in that case. The film is based on a novel by Stephen King and the writer is Frank Darabont who launched his career with Stephen King's works and kept going with adaptations for quite a while. Another would obviously be ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the film he made before this one here. Today, Darabont is probably mostly known for his work on ""The Walking Dead"", which is truly ironic looking at how wonderful his works in the 1990s were. As for this one here, I am definitely a bit biased as the cast includes many actors I quite like. This applies not just to lead actor Tom Hanks, but also to Rockwell, Morse, Cromwell and Sinise, even if the latter only has a very brief appearance. And how can you not like Michael Jeter and Michael Clarke Duncan after their performances in here. May they rest in peace. MCD is the only one who scored an Oscar nomination from the cast and this is also his career/life-defining performance for sure. The movie itself was nominated for four Oscars, but did not win any sadly.",
44,2 July 2011,nickmesafilms,10," The Green Mile (1999) - Three Hours of Circus Mice, Electric Chairs, and Dry Sponges!","Frank Darabont, the extraordinary director of the hit ""Shawshank Redemption"", comes back to the big screen with yet another adaptation of another prison drama novel by Stephen King. This time, the story is ""The Green Mile"", and this time he has the help of Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan joining a powerful cast that also includes Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell. The movie stars Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, an officer on death row, with a serious bladder infection, who rounds up a new suspect named John Coffey, portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan, a man with mysterious immortality powers, that may have been accused for the raping and killing of two innocent girls. The movie follows as a dramatic and entertaining tale of hope, faith, and courage. Darabont brings back the lucky charm used in ""Shawshank"", but this time he combines real life with fantasy, and creates a story of miracles and dreams. Anyways, the film has powerful backgrounds, and the film focuses on the story with lots of drama and thrills, and the script is more well-written since Shawshank was well-written. The special effects are amazingly realistic, and the story is like a special charm from the heart. I really enjoyed this film, and it's fun to watch it again and again. You will enjoy it so much, you will start to wonder where the 3-hour running time has gone. ""The Green Mile"", in my review, ""an exhilarating prison drama, truly watchable"".",

Whether you believe he represents Christ or not, there is something transcendent in the idea that each of us is a ""dead man walking,"" and that we should simply be kind to those around us in the time we have. Unfortunately, the film isn't very deft at managing these ideas. Its characters are drawn as if cartoons, without nuance, and it sprawls to a bloated three hour run time. It had no business being that long! Along the way are cliché moments like drama on dark and stormy nights, contrived action in the plot, and moments we can see coming from a mile away.

My problem with TGM is the amount of disbelief that has to be suspended to enjoy it. In Disney cartoons you know that anything is allowed to be possible, it's an animation. In TGM it's completely obvious - and completely unnecessary - that John Coffey is holding a light bulb in the 'help' moments; it's completely obvious that his breathing out the 'badness' is gratuitous CGI; couldn't they just have left him and the others to ACT it? The overwrought SFX turn Coffey's miracles into cheap sideshow stunts. Don't get me started on the mouse, by which the cardboard characters are upstaged. TOO MUCH MOUSE!",

65,29 August 2001,cliff-19,4, Emotional pornography,"I use that expression cautiously and deliberately. This film hides its massive illogic and implausibility behind emotional manipulativeness and cheap tear-jerker tricks. Fans of the film who may be reading this will naturally object as though I am invalidating their tears. But please consider that your tears were coaxed out by a crude setup. Some complaints: 1. Where on earth would one find such compassionate prison guards? To quote Mahathir Muhammad, ""Either one gets callouses on one's heart or you bleed to death."" 2. In the South of 1935, not even the white liberals would treat a black man with such dignity, let alone prison guards. 3. How would a patrician white woman thank an illiterate and dirty black man for saving her life? With a hug? 4. Once John Coffey sees Wild Bill, why would his only words be,""He's a bad man!""? Why did he say nothing? 5. After visiting Coffey's lawyer, why did Paul say nothing to any legal authority? 6. The execution of Delacroix was annoyingly unrealistic. A botched execution (and there have been many) would never be anywhere nearly as gruesome. 7. Finally, and this is the point at which I hated the movie, there were MANY opportunities for the guards to get Coffey's case re-opened, even if he didn't cooperate. But that would have turned it into a courtroom drama, not a religious-like story of redemption, suffering and eternal punishment.",

It start in a pretty classic way: we follow a man who work at prison and we will meet the prisoners and meet the personal too. I found it quite classic until Coffey is introduced and we will be aware of his abilities and power ( yes because its also have a fantasy genre in it) that i found first kind of uninteresting to be honest but more and more we know the situation of Coffey and we will clearly know trough that that he is an innocent man and the man with the tattoo did it. So that kind of revelation really create an intimate relationship with Coffey, Paul and the audience. With his urinate problem and the way they saved the women with the cancer. The end really make us powerless and feel the injustice of that man who clearly didnt deserved all this hate. And of course we can understand that. I found the last part quite interesting and make us really powerless for sure. The mise en scene with the old man whl remembered some memories of a mistake to kill the creature of god make sense even if it was quite fantasy with all the power and stuff. Just make us realised at least for myself that we judged people too quick and we dont really know them deeply and really what happened (like with the 2 girls dead). I found it interesting and the revelation really worked. I didnt expect some scenes or revelations and really surprised me sometimes and i need to say that i really appreciate the movie and the fantasy genre really helped this movie to make us see some stuff that we couldnt see and understand without it and create that special relationship with the audience, Coffey and Paul.

The subject matter, featuring several vile supporting characters, is unpleasant, though this doesn't detract from the emotional value of the piece, which is professionally-handled despite one or two small missteps (an execution scene, for instance, which runs too long). Terrific acting by Hanks (who blends right in with the large cast) and Michael Clarke Duncan, exceptional production design and cinematography.

Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing.  Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves to be too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a 20 minute ""prison life"" vignette in a film such as Darabont's vastly superior ""The Shawshank Redemption.""  Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow.  This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with - but if you don't have a decent screenplay, then you might as well stay home.

105,11 April 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, A true masterpiece,"Just like the summary says; this movie is truly a masterpiece, a modern work of art. The movie is a modern retelling, or a modernization of the story of Jesus. While I never have been, and never will be a Cristian, something in this movie really spoke to me. It had a wonderful message, one that is hard to retell by mere words. To truly understand the wonder of this movie, you have to see it, to experience it for yourself. The plot is excellent, though I thought it moved a little slow at times, but that's mainly because the movie is nearly three hours long. Considering how long it is, it's incredible. I never lost interest in it. The acting is fantastic; especially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan give amazing performances. Normally I hate Stephen King, but for the first time, I'm actually considering reading one of his books, out of my own free will. If I got the chance, I would probably read the book, just to find out if it tells the story any better, though that is nearly impossible. I recommend this to any fan of dramas, in fact, pretty much all movie fans. Everyone should at the very least get a chance to see this masterpiece. 10/10",

For a movie that is longer then three hours I was never bored for one second. And that is rare for me because normally after maximum two hours I start checking my watch.

I agree with what most people on here are saying: this film, along with Shawshank define great American cinema. Both pictures are ingenious in their conception -kudos to master writer Stephen King - and really spark more than just entertainment.

I'm not saying Mr. King is bad, it's just that it's very hard to make a touching movie out of a plot that is depending on something that is so hard to believe in. It's just too unrealistic with all the healing stuff, when the movie was over I just thought 'Ok... so?'. I gave this movie a 6/10, if you want good Stephen King, watch the Langoljeers (that what it's called?). If you want a touching movie on the subject, watch Dead man walking.

The cast plays a significant part because these are people we care about, no matter how big or small their roles are, each one shines at a moment or another, providing an extra level of depth in characterization, and when they leave us, we can't help but feel something cruelly missing, as if we were really experiencing death as a human loss. But aside from the acting, the directing and the writing are responsible for this level of empathy we feel. Indeed, the film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties or nuances when it comes to the characters, the guards are all sympathetic and Percy is clearly the main antagonist, doing everything to be unpopular both among the guards and the viewers. And in the prisoners' group, while they're all bad people by society's standards, only Wild Bill stands out as the evil one.

According to me this is the master piece movie from Tom Hanks. No man I could not sleep after watching this movie. The movie starts with John Coffey's arrest. Then it leads to Old Orphanage. Paul (Tom Hanks) is prison guard in the death row. He is the supervisor of all the executions. His assistants are Brutal, Dean, Harry and New guy Percy. Usually the death row is called as ""The Last Mile"" but they call it as ""The Green Mile"". Paul and his team believe in smooth handling of the prisoners but Percy is not like that. He is very aggressive also he is the brotherhood of state government politician. Before every executions Paul will rehearse twice. Mr. Jingler (The mouse) played an important role in this movie. He become pet for one of the prisoner named Eduard Delacroix who is going to die in few days. But Percy wants the front row of the executions. If Paul gives the front row of the executions Percy will quit his job and will join in Mental Hospital supervisor. During Del's execution Percy didn't wet the sponge which should place in the prisoners head. So Del execution went horrible. All were angry with Percy for this. After sometime John cures Paul's urinary infection and saved Mr. Jingler life. So Paul thinks he can cure Hal's (Prison head) wife who is having Brain Tumor. After that John also met his destiny. Then it leads to again the orphanage. Old Paul and his friend Eille went to Mr.Jingler's house (as Paul and Brutal promised to Del the build the House for Mr. Jingler). This is the outline of the whole story. Music is so good. I love the music when John and Paul team going to Hal's house. Finally I will give 9.5/10.",

155,17 February 2010,Gunn,10, Perfection!,"""The Green Mile"" is a GREAT movie, a Masterpiece. In a great movie everything ""clicks"" during the filming and this is a perfect example. The cast of Green Mile is so perfect that one cannot picture or imagine anyone else in these roles. The most crucial character in this film was John Coffey, and he was the last one cast. John Coffey is such a complex character not only in psychologically but in physical appearance. Michael Clarke Duncan was suggested by Bruce Willis, who'd read Stephen King's book, at the last moment and he delivered in spades. He is the heart of this movie. The other cast members: the always dependable, Tom Hanks, David Morse and James Cromwell, the brilliant Sam Rockwell and Barry Pepper, the terrific character actors Jeffrey DeMunn, Graham Greene, Harry Dean Stanton and veteran Dabbs Greer, along with Bonnie Hunt and Patricia Clarkson and newcomer Doug Hutchison. The late Michael Jeter turned in an Oscar worthy performance as the Cajun prisoner Eduard Delacroix. Last but not least was Mr. Jingles the talented mouse, who was portrayed by a group of equally talented stunt-mice. Frank Darabont deserves credit for his vision and directing which put everything into place. Kudos also to David Tattersall's stunning cinematography, Thomas Newman's whimsical score and to Stephen King for a brilliant story. There are so many great scenes in this film that it's difficult to single out one, but the scene where Paul Edgecombe (Hanks) asks John Coffey (Duncan) what he can do for him, when he knows Coffey is innocent is extremely poignant. I should also give credit to Terence Marsh and William Cruse who ""created"" the Green Mile set. This film is on a par with its counterpart ""The Shawshank Redemption"" also by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont.",

It's a little different from other roles he has had, but good nonetheless. Michael Clark Duncan really steals the show as the huge, softspoken, and kindly John Coffey. He was nominated for best supporting actor, and should have received it. Doug Hutchison has one of the most difficult parts as Percy Whetmore. He does a magnificent job with the role. John Coffey arrives on death row at Cold Mountain Prison in 1935, accused of killing two young girls. As it turns out, he is completely innocent, but prefers to go to his death anyway. Paul is suffering with a painful infection that John eventually cures him of.Del (Michael Jeter) is another prisoner slated to die in the electric chair who befriends a mouse named ""Mr. Jingles"". Percy deliberately kills the mouse, and John brings it back to life, giving witness to his great healing powers. Percy is a spoiled brat, with connections to the governor. He uses this to more or less throw his weight around with the other guards, but gets his in the end. He should have taken that job at the mental institution. This is one movie that grabbed my attention at the beginning, and held it until the end.",

171,21 February 2005,Sylviastel,10, Your view of Death Penalty will change from watching this movie!,"Despite the difficult subject of death row, Stephen King's Green Mile is a story about death row inmates and the men who guard and will execute them in the end. The cast is excellent with Tom Hanks always turning in an Academy Award winning performance as the head guard. I never imagined the Bosom buddy could be brutal. He is surrounded by very accomplished actors and actresses-Bonnie Hunt plays his wife and Patricia Clarkson plays the ill-stricken wife of James Cromwell's character. I enjoyed watching professional actors like James Cromwell, Harry Dean Stanton and William Morse turn in excellent performances all around. I have to say that I was saddened by Michael Jeter's finest performance in the movie before his own death by AIDS. Of course, the main reason I watched was for Doug Hutchison who now plays Sebastian Hulce on Guiding Light, my favorite soap. As wonderful as he was in The Green Mile, he is better as Sebastian. I found his performance to be a breakthrough performance for somebody. But it is Michael Clarke Duncan who truly earned his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor that was really inspiring to watch. If you ever had a definite view of the death penalty, this film will change your mind about the barbarism and cruelty not on the death row inmates but on the guards themselves. I probably won't watch this film again. I get too emotionally involved. I am glad that the electric chair is not used like it used to be. It is rarely used nowadays. It is replaced by lethal injection. But now I wonder about the guards who befriend and form relationships with their prisoners whether they liked it or not. Now I wonder what happens to the guards after they become executioners themselves? You wonder what makes them different from the criminals!",

But John Coffey playing the angel sent from the gods to heal some of humanity's ills adds the hope. Michael Clarke Duncan plays Coffey so unbelievably well that I cannot imagine how the Academy gave the Oscar in that year to Michael Caine for his Cider House Rules role.

It's a very inspired story that, despite it's length, is very easy to follow, all the characters are developed in a very subtle manner, we are never spoon fed information. I did find the fantasy element a bit forced, it kept the story moving and was quite powerful, but I do not feel like Frank Darabont was able to capture that dramatic effect he was going for, it felt like he was not comfortable with it, making the scenes that showcase Coffey's power seem like they were only there as they were mandatory to the novel. The performances are very powerful, Tom Hanks shines in the lead role, further proving his versatility and likability as an actor, as does Michael Clarke Duncan, portraying a damaged, emotional character to superb effect, certainly the highlight of the late great actors career. Well acted and a really enjoyable story, I would recommend Green Mile to anyone looking for a good drama. ",

Both ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" are weighty but moving period pieces with impeccable characters and an epic quality considering the literal confines of the story. ""The Green Mile"" puts a supernatural twist on the genre and though it lacks the inspirational kick that allowed ""Shawshank"" to win the hearts of nearly all who've seen it, it holds its own among the many great dramas of the 1990s.",

The one problem I had, however, was with the latter. The thing is, most anybody, if they saw something like the events in this movie, would be shaken, to say the least. And not just at the time, but long after, questioning what they saw, if it was real and whether they might be going insane. But that doesn't really seem to happen here. Everybody's reaction to something that by rights ought to be world-shattering is really quite underwhelmed, comparatively anyway.

187,7 September 2005,jboothmillard,7, The Green Mile,"Based on the book by Stephen King, and from director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, also a King novel), this is another good prison drama with a good cast. The film begins with Old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) being reminded of his past by Fred Astaire's Top Hat on TV, and then he starts telling his story. In the 1930's, Paul (Tom Hanks) was a slightly cynical prison guard on Death Row, leading men down ""The Green Mile"", along with guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Saving Private Ryan's Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn) and the evil Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). One day the guards meet new prisoner sentenced to death, large, simple-minded John Coffey (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Michael Clarke Duncan). As time goes by the guards start to see that John might not be harmless as people make him out to be, especially after performing the miracles of curing Paul's urinal infection, which was great for his wife Jan (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt), bringing the pet mouse, Mr. Jingles, of prisoner Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) back to life (after Percy squashed it), and more prominently curing the wife of Warden Hal Moores (Babe's James Cromwell) of her illness. Also, they realise that he is innocent and that (after his death, and Percy made dumb, and a flashback) it was in fact 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell) that raped and murdered two little girls. So when they ask John what he wants done, let go to escape or face his sentence. He decided that he has had enough of living and seeing the bad sides of life, and he requests a final meal and film (Top Hat obviously). John's emotional death (the electric chair) was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers. Also starring Dances with Wolves' Graham Greene as Arlen Bitterbuck, Patricia Clarkson as Melinda Moores and Harry Dean Stanton as Toot-Toot. A fantastic cast, a vicious and utterly hateful villain (bastard, prick, arsehole are the best words to describe Percy), some good fantasy moments, and just an unmissable film, even for three hours. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Very good!",

189,14 November 2012,Deanjones1970,10, A soon to be classic movie.,"The Green Mile was definitely one of the best movies of the year. With the character driven storyline, all of the characters played well, to the mix of joy, laughter and sadness. This is one of those movies where every single actor puts their all into their craft. It was interesting that this was taken from a book that Steven king wrote being that it seems he writes a lot of horror and thriller books. I did not get a chance to read the book but i have heard it is almost perfectly taken from the book with just a few parts taken out that didn't improve the movie. Some people have complained that it was too long around 3 hours but i believe that is what made it even better. the way the story flowed and the skills of the actors the movie did not feel like it was slow and dragged on. The movie wasn't about the friendships on the green mile but it was more of a miracle of a man and the people he effects. When Michael Clarke Duncan's character gets convicted of a crime and is placed on the green mile everyone is in awe of not just his size but how humble and mild mannered he is. When a few miraculous events take place the guards start to think he has magical powers gifted to him from god. With all the things the happened and his attitude the guards start to doubt that he did the crime he has been convicted of. The message I got from this was that there is clear that there is injustice and the miracles can happen in the unexpected of places. One thing I also noticed was the depiction of the relationship of the guards and inmates. They all seemed like friends they seem to have been treated with respect and dignity and because of that they seemed to not have as many problems that you may have in other prisons. Weather that was because of the beliefs of King or the director or both that we should treat our prisoners better so that they don't end up back in prison and not as violent while they are in it. This film will get you to think about its subjects and gradually build on you. This will be a movie that will be hard to forget even after the credits have ended.",

The only thing I was scared of was some of the violence... especially Percy's violent ways. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie. In conclusion, THE GREEN MILE was a very touching movie.

The maximum sentence in my opinion should be life in jail. Delacroix did a horrible thing by being a rapist. The movie did an excellent job of making you feel bad for him. His whole demeanor changed and how he acted with the mouse Mr. Jingles was enjoyable to watch. It was easy to feel bad for him when Percy stepped on Mr. Jingles, when Percy told him that Mr. Jingles would not go to a mouse circus when he died like Paul told him, and when Percy botched up his execution. You know what, I really hate Percy.

I say, ""make you"", because I think this film fully intends to manipulate emotions -- the emotions of white, comfortable, middle class Americans who enjoy cheering for the oppressed, simple but pure of heart big black man who is abused by Southern crackers.  Aren't we glad we're not like that? Yet again, a black man gets to be a parody, not a person.  We white folks don't have to be afraid just because he's big and black, see, 'cause he's really a Jesus figure (""J. C."", his initials).  What a relief. Still wouldn't want him living next door, though, would we? All in all, good actors playing two dimensional roles. In the real world, as Kosovo and Northern Ireland and Rwanda show, we're all just a hair-trigger away from being cruel.  Let's have more films that recognize that there are few good guys and bad guys, just a whole lot of us doing the best we can and trying to do it right.  That's too complicated for most Hollywood types, and doesn't usually make much money. ""Dead Man Walking"" was ten times the film that this one was, and even it wasn't a ""10"".",

This prison film fantasy tells the story of a prison guard named Paul Edgecomb (played by Tom Hanks) a man of whom at first doesn't believe in miracles until he encounters one for the very first time and that is a black man named John Coffey (played by Michael Clarke-Duncan). Director Frank Darabont has not only created a great prison film, but also he has created an inspirational and sometimes sad fantasy.

222,19 January 2005,Pigbelly,2, A movie is only as good what you put into it,"First of all, this movie fails like most Stephen King conversions to the big screen. Stephen King is a horrible writer, one of the worst of the 20th Century. His base characterizations are like poorly sketched comic book characters. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors supporting Tom Hanks (Sam Rockwell and Harry Dean Stanton to name two). Tom Hanks has a great money making face but his acting is pretty bland and sub-standard in most movies. The writing, however, is just stupid as most King ventures. Grown men get scared and pee their pants and the ironies that he is able to present are so obvious they are like being hit in the face with a building (very BIG black man is a sweet and harmless innocent).

Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecome was an excellent choice, as was David Morse whom portrayed Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell. Morse is the tall/quiet sidekick to Hanks in this movie, and he shows true restraint by not beating the pain in the butt, Percy Wetmore, (Doug Hutchinson) to death!  (At times I wish he would have!)

Coming from the mind of Stephen King (whose most endearing films were outside of the horror genre; namely, The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me), The Green Mile is a story with many layers depending on how you look at it. Many have likened the story of John Coffey to that of Jesus Christ and, having seen the film, the connection is definitely there to be made with very valid points.
This is a special, once-in-a-lifetime kind of movie that is well worth a watch and will very likely wind up being one that everybody goes back to from time to time.",

229,18 December 1999,bat-5,10, One of the best films of the year.,"If you've read the novel, you'll know that The Green Mile is a story of extraordinary power, and the film does not let you down.  If you've not experienced the novel, be prepared for a story that you will not forget.  Through Frank Darabont's leisurely pace, we become a part of Tom Hanks' world.  We get to see his routines with the inmates, and with his men.  The day that John Coffey arrives on the mile, Hanks' character will never be the same. Some may complain about the running time, but as I stated earlier, the leisurely pace allows you to soak up every minute, every detail and every emotion that you will be exposed to.  The acting is top notch, and spread out over a very good ensemble cast.  Michael Clarke Duncan is wonderful as John Coffey. David Morse is perfectly cast as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell and Tom Hanks is wonderful as always. Doug Hutchinson brings such venom and spite to the role of Percy Whetmore, you will be satisfied with his fate.   The Green Mile is a film that pulls you in and doesn't let you go.  The ending is an emotional whallop that will unsettle you, but at the same time, you'll realize that it's the only way the story could end.  Another great story from Stephen King, who is making a name for himself as not only the most prolific horror novelist, but as a writer of intimate stories about ordinary events, that become the most extraordinary tales of friendship.",
230,2 January 2000,Lamprey,1, Wow! Very Overrated,"This movie takes the cake for 1999.  The Phantom Menace was highly overrated... but not as much as this stale movie that is only average at best.  With little surpises, a bland story, and pointless tacked-on fillers at the beginning and the end, it would surprise me if anyone would want to see this movie twice.  Not nearly as good as Shawshank.  Almost all of the jokes fall flat, which becomes embarrasing to watch... Darabont didn't spend a lot of time on this script, by his own admission even.  From Shawshank, I was expecting some stirring music and cinematography in The Green Mile. Neither were present.  In fact, the cinematography was so bad it almost gave me a headache.  I felt like I was watching a B movie, with all the non-stop close-ups, occuring at a methodic static pace.  Would you watch this movie again?  If not, how can you say it is the best movie of 1999?  It hasn't made any top ten lists of critics, from what I've seen... I really hope this doesn't win the Best Picture Oscar, but it is gauranteed to get nominated, simply because it has been marketed so well.",
231,22 February 2008,emperor_bender,9, John Coffey; like the drink...but spelt different,"I usually don't like drama movies, but for this one I will make an exception. This movie kept me watching the entire time. A lot of movies will become boring and stale at parts, so I will usually tune out at the long boring drawn out parts, but not this film. Every second was entertaining. Stephen King has done a great job once again. Although a lot of the actors weren't big-name actors (except Tom Hanks of course), I still enjoyed their performances (when I name the movies in here it's only the films I had seen them in). Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan, Road to Perdition) was great as Paul Edgecomb, I don't think John Travolta would have pulled it off as well (They were originally going to cast Travolta as Edgecomb instead of Tom Hanks). Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon, Daredevil, Sin City) gave probably his best performance as the miracle-making giant, John Coffey. Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan, 61*, We Were Soldiers) was probably my favorite guard, Dean Stanton. He just seemed to have more depth than some of the others. Michael Jeter (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Jurassic Park III) was cast as Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix, who was actually probably my favorite character. Some of the scenes in this movie were difficult to watch, and Percy the guard, and Wild Bill Wharton were the most annoying characters I've seen in a while. But, this movie was still great. I'm not a drama fan, but this film was still a classic to me. I give this a 9/10. Great job King.",
232,6 March 2000,zza99tmk,1," a terrible would-be successor to ""The Shawshank Redemption""","I really wanted to like this film, I really tried to. But in the end I heavily regretted having seen it and personally I think of ""The Green Mile"" as the first appalling film of this year. This saddens me the more as the director of that film is Frank Darabont who brought us the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"". The parallels to his debut from 1994 are obvious: a prison story full of optimism(a friendship between the two main protagonists (one black, one white)) written by the same author (King) and again overlength (this time you've even got a running time of 3 hours+).I would argue that already the story itself is problematic in its conception: the characterisation is implausible. The prisoners (with the exception of one) are all portrayed as good natured men who obviously could do no harm to other people. It makes the fact that they've been sentenced to death for heinous crimes the more unlikely. For a grim and dark place like a prison the green mile is a unusual harmonistic place.This depiction of a prison and the characters is not just naive and almost laughable, it also reminded me of how more realistic and appropriate in such terms ""Shawshank Redemption"" was. People could say that the film generally is not very realistic since John Coffey has supernatural powers but I honestly think that capital punishment is a too serious subject to treat it as an element of a fairy tale. Moreover the film never questions the death penalty, the message rather seems to be that death row is a necessity. Again I was reminded of an another film, Tim Robbins' ""Dead Man Walking"", arguably one of the best and most important american films of the last decade(if you want to see an appropriate and artistic convincing account of the death row, then you're in for a treat).There's basically nothing to say against an optimistic approach when you're talking about such a sad, disturbing and important issue, but what made me really upset about ""The Green Mile"" is the unbearable extent of sentimentality and naivety in the film. Sure, ""Shawshank Redemption"" was emotional, too; but there it felt right, there Darabont managed to find the right tone - here it is just pure kitsch. When Coffey says towards the end something along the lines that people shouldn't treat each other badly and that he wants a peaceful world, I almost started to giggle. Moreover the contrast between the harmonistic, light- hearted scenes with the mouse and the execution scenes doesn't work at all, it destroys the film. Moreover these three scenes (particularly Percys revenge on Delacroix) are not just ",

242,25 November 2020,sspenny-85173,10, Three reasons why I watched The Green Mile,"""The Green Mile, ""was the movie from 1999, which had been nominated by Oscar. The movie is adapted from Stephen King's novel of the same name. Through Tom Hanks acted a death row correction officer that make the movie full of exceptional. ""The Green Mile, ""is attractive based on story line, vivid character, reflection after finished the movie as well.
The story is about Paul Edgecomb as a death row correction officer. One day, John Coffey, a giant black man convicted by raping and kill two young white girls, arriving at the death row. John was full of mystery, unlike other prisoner, he was a kind, timid and lonely person. However, it happened a serious of miracles at the dead row.
The main character was acted by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, they were both a talented actor in 90's. They let Paul Edgecomb and John Coffey become more vivid in ""The Green Mile.""
After finished the movie, I had a lot of reflections and feelings. For instance, whether the death penalty is justice or not, like John Coffey, even if he was innocent, he could not escape his penalty. And the guilty in Paul Edgecomb.
There is one saddest line in the movie, John Coffey said, ""I am tired of people being ugly to each other, I am tired all of the pain."" In that scene, I cried with him. ""The Green Mile,"" is the classic in 90's, including the amazing story, lively character and reflection issues.

Everything that is so beautiful, is also ugly in the same time.But what can we do if you have to execute one of God's miracles? What can you do? It's a situation, which most of us don't want to share a thought.And yet,Paul had to.And...he did he's job,because it was the best thing to do,not because he wanted.

265,6 August 2022,fredosteen,10, Love Frank Darabont,"As a matured adult I experienced the film very differently. On the surface level, this film is about the brutal murder of two young girls which led a black man to be falsely accused of the crime and sentenced to death. The film delves into the relationships formed between the prisoners and the officers in charge, and the realization that he may be innocent of the crime. However, beneath the surface, the film is riddled with deep symbolism that makes it incredibly difficult to watch.",
266,6 February 2021,edimihalescu,9, Amazing movie,"This movie is truely great. Incredibly emotional, this is the definition of an emotional roller coaster. It is a comedy, but it is also a drama. A fantasy, but also a tragedy. It is impossible to lock this movie down to a genre, and that's what makes it better, and arguably the best movie of 1999, ahead of Fight Club and Matrix.
Despite its incredibly original theme and message, the green mile also has an amazing cast, with Tom Hanks playing one of his more underrated roles, while Michael Clarke Duncan reaches the height of his career playing the massive, but kind and gentle John Coffey, a character with an incredible story and who truly is the beating heart of the movie.
There are some issues that i have with this movie, mainly the run time, which feels extremly long, and also the character of Percy. Like the very existence of this character, who doesn't serve much of a purpose in a logical sense, and seems to only be there to bump up the movie's running time.
With that being said, the green mile is still an incredibly well made movie, and it gets a 9/10 from me",

Special movies that want to revive honesty, friendship and kindness in the hearts of its viewers, also using a colored person as the main role of the film and using a white person as a supporting role has been able to create a sense of companionship and to keep the pain alive in the viewer, but it should be noted that the philosophy and worldview presented in the film, like many other films, lacks proof and only the use of the format was the director's concern, although it could have been with a little study of the appropriate content.

273,29 April 2015,sandnair87,9, Frank Darabont Improves Upon his Literary Source By A Mile!,"The Green Mile, based on Stephen King's 1996 novel, is a stirring drama of metaphysical fantasy wedded to grim reality. The central protagonist Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), a prison guard for the Louisiana State Penitentiary for criminals on the death row, keeps things running smoothly on the Green Mile, so-named due to the scuffed green linoleum that covers the floor between the cells and the electric chair. He receives his convicted tenants with rare dignity and takes no pleasure in strapping them in to ride the lightning, seeing it instead as a sad, necessary business. Of course there's that urinary infection that makes him feel like he's ""pissing razorblades"" but Edgecomb tries to stay calm and compassionate. The ground under his feet begins to shift when John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), condemned to die by electrocution, arrives. A child-like giant, Coffey has been convicted of murdering two pre-pubescent girls in an apparently air-tight case; he was found with their bodies in his massive arms, covered in their blood. Despite his towering stature, he is a gentle man who seems to have a mysterious power much more important than physical might. Edgecomb senses the same, but only takes his own doubts to heart after Coffey displays a miraculous healing touch that cures him of his urinary infection. Soon, it is readily apparent that Coffey is no criminal. In fact, he is a miracle worker, an angel-on-earth with the power to heal and give life. This leaves Paul and the movie with a moral dilemma and throws out every preconceived notion of justice, faith, and redemption behind the barred windows.",

""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. ""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role.

The black guy on death row possesses supernatural abilities transcending this horrible film into the sci-fi genre. Yet don't look for cleverness, technology, or fantasy because it lacks all three.

I mean, I'm not a cynical person, but I truly can't stand 100%-righteous characters such as Coffey, Hedgecomb and all the other nice death row wardens. I'm not a 5-year-old kid and I can't watch The Green Mile without being sarcastic. How can any spectator accept the way this tall black guy is playing? And what did Frank Darabont expect spectators to react watching his so unfair and unhappy fate? Did he want us to burst into tears? Come on! The Shawshank Redemption was shot a few years ago by the same director. It was a prison movie like this one but it was a good one for it avoided too many melodramatic effects and because the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were above all human characters. Those played by Tom Hanks and every other cast member aren't humans. They are nothing but all-American icons and I hate that. Besides the death penalty issue is the heart of the film. Does Darabont seriously tackle it? Never! In The Green Mile, being legally executed appears to be something which has to be taken for granted by every citizen, no matter if people die in some awful way (i.e. Eugène Delacroix, the guy with the lovely mouse), and no matter if an innocent guy sometimes gets toasted. At the end of the film, old Hedgecomb confesses that he couldn't stand executions anymore after Coffey died. So what did he decide to do? Did he organize public protests and demonstrations against this punishment? No! He just left the penitentiary and found another job. What a hero! What an activist!

The film is moving, spiritual and heavy with religious symbolism and metaphor. It is deeply interesting and weaves a captivating tale of murder and death, healing and resurrection. While the film doesn't have the overlying sense of perfectionism that The Shawshank Redemption had (Darabont's major break is too good a film to better), there is no denying that this is a worthy follow up to a what is a modern day masterpiece.

303,30 December 1999,Deckard-16,10, Wow! Darabont and King have done it again.,"This is a very rich movie that takes its sweet time getting set up in its first half and then some gut wrenching and heart felt resolutions in its second half. HOWEVER the first hour and  a half is sweet and very intriguing --it is not a waste of time. Just like The Shawshank Redemption, writer-director Frank Darabont has taken a Stephen King story set primarily in a prison and made it into a faithful and thrilling movie full of heart and soul. The Green Mile is ranks closely behind American Beauty, The Sixth Sense and The Insider as my favorite movie of the year. At some point it gets ridiculous saying which one is better. All I know is that this strange wondrous tale of a very special death row inmate and the effects he has on everybody around him left me and my date stunned. It is brutal, profane, shocking, sweet, heart warming and, at the end, enigmatic. It throws you through a lot of emotions. Although I didn't read the book(s) I've read enough of King to know that his voice rang loudly in Darabont's adaptation. It is a great story. Darabont's treatment in both writing and directing must make the author ecstatic. Tom Hanks shines (once again) as the prison guard assigned to keep peace on Death Row. But when John Coffey becomes his charge he begins to wonder what inner peace is all about. Coffey is played by Michael Duncan in a performance that came as much from out of nowhere as Haley Joel Osment's act in the Sixth Sense. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The amusing meanderings of the first half prove to be essential to the revelations of the second half. It is a real stunner.",

It definitely didn't look as powerful. Man, I was completely wrong! This movie is not only the greatest film of 1999, but in my top ten favorite movies! It is the only movie where every single actor in it was outstanding! Tom Hanks once again does an exceptional role in this movie, but I was also very glad that he was not the only one in the movie that had character. Everyone had an outstanding character in this masterpiece. The story was breathtaking, and the fabulous directing by Frank Darabont added to the great screenplay. Some scenes in the movie were EXTREMELY powerful and also VERY disturbing. One scene in the movie would always stand out in my mind as nerve-wrenching. I can predict the oscars now: Tom Hanks winning best actor, Michael Duncan winning best supporting actor, Frank Darabont winning best director, Frank Darabont winning best screenplay, and The Green Mile winning best picture. I certainly hope that's the way they'll go, since they all deserve to win. I am also very mad at people complaining about the length of the film. Okay, maybe some scenes could have been taken out, but still, every scene in the movie was great! The only flaw I can find in the movie is the slapped together and far fetched ending. The movie should have ended after the final death. It shouldn't have gone back to the old Paul Edgecomb, who explains a cheesy ending. But still, the ending doesn't ruin the movie whatsoever. It still is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it will stay on my list for years to come.",

Reading the novel is one thing, but watching the motion picture is somewhat different. I, personally, have not ever read the novel and never will because of the motion picture. But I'm positive that reading the novel would've given me the same emotional effect that the motion picture (directed by Frank Darabont) has given me. The characters come alive along with the drama, the horror, and the action. It can help non-believers open their eyes and help believers open their eyes even more. It does that effect to me every time I watch The Green Mile and get in touch with the tone, the mood, and the theme that this classic film delivers. An Oscar-worthy classic indeed.

He has always written kid books, and movies have more often than not translated into rather childish movies. This one goes way beyond any of the others. Other than a few good jokes and a few tender moments of genuine emotion, it's just a silly going through the motions check all the boxes type of effort. I found myself rolling my eyes and checking my email and being rather shocked at the sheer absurdity of it all. Supernatureal elements in cinema almost always fail to impress, and the way it was handled here was clumsy at best. The overacting and drawn out scenes to heighten impact fell flat repeatedly, and the general impression I had was trying to breathe life into a long dead drowning victim just pulled from a river. I liked the Coffey character and the inmates all gave really good performances. Especially the Buffalo Bill guy. He was played perfectly-a funny, crude, vulgar and selfish nobody. He had some scene stealing moments. But the guards, the little girls' family, and all associated side plots were all ineffective and bland. The way they acted when the mouse appeared was particularly inane, like they were seeing some mythical creature. Um, it's just a mouse! Big whoopy doo.....silly. Plot holes were rampant and logic defying actions as well as redundant dialonge made it seem like an eternal punishment to be endured rather than enjoyed. Even with some of the violence and crudeness at times it still seemed like a movie geared to children. Their suspension of disbelief would allow them to forgive the numerous mistakes and somehow enjoy it. For me, it rang completely false and ridiculous. Another Tom Hanks movie that should have flopped but became a huge success. Most of his movies are like that unfortunately. His early career comedies are about the only thing I can stand. So yes, there's a few things to enjoy but not enough to keep this marathon of lunacy bearable.",

Like Gloria Stuart in ""Titanic"", Greer's version of the character is the storyteller, remembering his encounters with various prisoners facing death, most notably Michael Clarke Duncan who was wrongfully accused of killing two young white women, something that automatically would sentence a black man to death, even if innocent, ""just because"".

It's a combination of a terrific cast, a hot director, great script, likeable characters, and Tom Hanks, whom the term ""likeable"" seems to have been invented for. This movie was custom made for the Oscars, and although it did not take away the awards it would have liked to, two best picture nominations for Darabont's first two directorial efforts ain't bad at all. Maybe it doesn't break any new ground when compared to some of the more outstanding achievements of 99, but that doesn't matter. It's a movie, made for those of us who enjoy going to the movies, packed full of high drama, a decent helping of suspense, and some generally moving sequences. It also finds a way to slip in a message in what has to be one of the most gruesome deaths I've ever seen in a movie, but at the same time it manages to not be preachy. it's not hard to see that this movie is probably against the death penalty, but I think it treats the subject in a fair and even-handed way. I think this movie will have made a Hollywood heavy-hitter out of Frank Darabont, and it couldn't have happened to a more worthy guy. It's also unfair that he has taken criticism for doing two Stephen King novel adaptions in a row, and both having focused around a prison.

He also possesses a unique healing power. Hanks is happily married but has a urinary problem, which is healed by Duncan, much to his surprise. It becomes somewhat unfocused and disjointed with unexplained situations such as why this guy can heal. Directed by Frank Darabont who previously made The Shawshank Redemption. He is backed by excellent visual elements that highlight the time period. Hanks stands firm as he observes this unique being and struggles to find his innocence, but the conclusion is too depressing. Morse does well as a guard who is the right hand man and witness to everything. Duncan is overwhelming as the large yet fragile prisoner. We are given no explanations other than the reality of watching him ultimately suffer. Doug Hutchinson steals scenes as a small yet sadistic guard who elevates his power beyond reason. Michael Jeter plays an inmate who has a pet mouse and this becomes a controversial scene with Hutchinson. The executions are severe and difficult to watch.

It touched themes of racism and even played upon our own feelings about color and mental illness. The movie tried it's best to walk the green mile of movie telling by making the characters either fully terrible or fully good. My only problem with this movie is the fact that a mentally challenged man of color could be allowed to be wrongly electrocuted for a crime against little white girls. All they had to do was let the warden and anyone else (even the parents) touch John and see the crime as well. To allow an innocent man to die and call it a tear jerker is beyond me. The scene where John walks in to the warden's wife's room was totally innuendo with overtones which were unnecessary. The editor pulled down her dressed after the shock factor. Why couldn't the big healer get exonerated and a twist be put on the old formula where John studies Holistic medicine and become ""Somebody""? I wonder when we will transcend the usual stereotypes and not let the societal monster live.

It's centred around a small cast of unique characters, a mostly singular location and an emotionally moving story; its themes of injustice, inevitability, benevolence and miracles raise it above the typical 'prison film' fare and make it something that's actually rather poignant. It's different to what I expected it to be, telling a small-scale story with some unexpected supernatural elements, and is pretty emotionally powerful throughout. It is actually fairly compassionate, with the prison guards being portrayed as kind and gentle for the most part. There isn't an emphasis on brutality or malevolence, and each of the inmates is made to be sympathetic. It is often compared to 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)', for its setting and key crew - as well as a very similar score by Thomas Newman. While I do prefer 'Shawshank' - a film which is on the top end of my ten favourite films of all time - I certainly appreciate this as well, and honestly feel that it is a very different experience.",

in Heaven exists,or has ever existed.The inability of the films underpinning to provide a belief in the innocence of the character named Coffe-is so cold and even bastardly that this is thought to be the law when in fact it represents the getting of ones way and further it represents through the conduct of its officials,from rookie cop to prison warden the desire to maintain the status quo.The revelation late into the film of the real killers identity should of provided at least some effort to see that an innocent man does not die for a crime that he did not commit.One of the reasons that he did go to the electric chair was because he was the one they chose and come hell or high water he's the one there going to fry.The idea that he fell out of the sky as like a patsy was made very evident by the attorney who represented him.What suggested is that when the law says its got its man it means it.If the viewer wishes to include some ideas about racism I too will not ignore it because there are simply to many stories about the perils of this life not to listen to the evidence.However this is not the end to this story about the world we live in,it provides only the sure thing that any who find there way to death row will most surely die.This film provides a problem and that we as a culture live in a world that is ruled over by a system as well run by Laws and the people it employs to enforce those laws.There are a couple of areas that are worth mentioning,it is this reviewers opinion that one of the attractions of the film is of the emotional content which is exemplified by the miracles witnessed by these officials.The Hanks ordeal is real enough however it is the Wardens wife who believes and in fact provides a witness that is indeed a very worthy chapter in this movie presentation.The makers of this film were very conscious of appearances where we see the wife upon Coffey entrance into her room and the subtle attempts to alter her appearance without changing the scene.The not spoken of up to this point is Mr. Jingles and though this may in fact provide for amusement it is deadly serious.This film made certain that it was not stated out right lest it be against the law however even as of just a couple of days ago-appearing in the New York Times(this day being-Dec.12,2004)there was a graph of the percentage of DNA that is possessed by other species not being human.The mouse then and even now is recognised as having the highest percent of DNA seen to be exactly the same as the human being,that being 55%.What does that mean?it provides for the fact that there is no belief in the existence of Devine Creation and that the human kind literally evolves from the likes of a lower order of life.This film is more deadly then a bullet because its underpinnings are understated and not immediately perceived by there audience.The introduction to the film and as well the end to the film are in fact the answers and seem at first incongruent with the telling of this tale.What answers-The impossible idea of the existence of Mr.Jingles just so in that cabinet-it is so convenient not to be taken seriously and though the old guy is older its not a worthy thought of him being as old as he suggests.If I remember he suggests something in the hundreds and so on,however it to me is not to be believed in and it would seem that in fact there is an admission of actually trying to steal the thunder of Gods Mercy through the carrying out of the orders to execute Coffe.These are unjust and unfriendly neighbors and never the Twain shall meet.What we are asked as of all things to believe in, is Christian in its precept and yet does nothing to assuaged the heart of the human kind as to the very deadly and dangerous purpose had by this overseer as well by its system.When you play with reality this is the kind of review you get and I promise you there is a-lot more where this came from.This film is about stealing the life from the heart of the human kind and though not being of itself particularly inspiring it is also provides for a look see as to what was being stolen if not the heart of the matter and that might be the opportunity to do so-I think we are in fact looking at the profit motive and how deadly serious it is with reality in tow to get its way-This is not recommended viewing and in fact is a UN-American film.",

378,13 February 2006,david-2849,10, Biblical,"Stephen King is something of an oddity to me. On the one hand he comes out with pulp trash like Thinner and The Stand, both works of utter banality written by a bored and cynical author whose only interest lies in the accumulation of wealth and the mass production of brainless rubbish. On the other he creates works of pure genius like Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile whose literary importance are, IMO, right up there with the greats. This latter is, undoubtedly, the work of a literary genius and it should be taught in schools no less. The plot wastes nothing, driving home its point from start to finish and wasting not a single millimetre of film in the process, from the subtlety of John Coffey's name (JC, Jesus Christ) to the crucial importance of every character, including the detestable but ultimately pitiable Percy and the vile, and yet somehow funny Wild Bill. That we are made to laugh at Wild Bill's antics is no sick frivolity on King's part. This movie delves deep into the human soul and asks us exactly what we think right and wrong is, what we think of justice and how we perceive the duplicity of faith and kharma. We are involved. We are made to gasp, cry, shout and cheer. And in our involvement we are forced to make uncomfortable alliances. Is Coffey the second coming? Or is he merely an angel, adrift on earth and 'lost in the dark'? His benevolence is clearly complete. He has no capacity for evil, and yet he is executed for one of the most evil crimes imaginable. His cross is a chair, his disciples are mere prison guards, and yet the injustice of his death is no less potent. Only the symbolism of his place in the world and our empathy with it are questionable compared with the unsullied perfection of King's inspiration. This is a movie rife with subtle asides and depths you'll miss if you blink. But also a movie of great passion and unending love for the art of storytelling. Not a scene is out of place. Not a camera angle goes astray. Hanks, Hutchison and above all else, Clark-Duncan, create a masterpiece between them. Duncan's moving performance is simply breathtaking. Here is an actor used to portraying henchmen, hired goons and 'gangstas' giving the performance of his life as nothing less than the most tear-jerking softy since Bambie. Not since King Kong has such a muscle bound hulk touched the hearts of so many. I defy even the hardest of hearts not to blub as Coffey pleads to be spared the execution hood because he fears the dark. Hanks puts in another sterling performance. Better than Private Ryan, but possibly less than Forrest Gump. This is Hanks as Hanks. Hanks as you know him from such films as Sleepless in Seattle, The Money Pit or Turner and Hooch. Hanks as funny man in a not altogether funny situation. Hanks as the put upon Hanks making do the best he can. But ultimately Hanks at his most convicted. He liked making this movie. You can tell.

Tom Hanks was good as always, although I didn't think he quite lived up to his Oscar winning performances in ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Philadelphia."" Michael Clarke Duncan perfectly captured the character of the mysterious John Coffey. Was he a child murderer or not? That question will be answered in the movie. But there are still more questions about him that are (appropriately, I think) left to the viewers' imagination. Is he a human with special healing powers or is he some sort of supernatural being - an angel, perhaps? We don't know.

The acting is excellent and it is skillfully directed and produced. I'm thankful that Michael Clarke Duncan got this role before his untimely death 13 years later.

Those 3 are not necessarily my favorite movies, but they are special for a different reason. These movies, Forrest Gump, Hatchiko and the Green Mile, engaged me so much emotionally, that I couldn't help but cry at the end. I don't want to take any of the plot away, but John Coffey is easily the most likable character in a movie since Forrest Gump. I don't think that the difficult part is to be sad enough to make someone cry, but to engage the spectators enough to commit that much of there emotions.

402,25 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, The Green Mile is a near perfect story film.,"A term I like to use for a film that is purely focussed on the story. Structured so well that you are on board from start to finish, with a suitable beginning, middle and end. That is what makes a story film. Having now just watched this for the first time, The Green Mile is easily one of Tom Hanks' best films. I'm sure you've all seen it, a prison executioner for prisoners in Death Row encounters a new arrival who causes some unusual happenings. The ability to perform miracles. Ok so I'm going to do this slightly differently. My only negative with this film is the usage of the supernatural elements. Now I know it's a vital aspect of the story, but I'm just not a fan. Obviously used to highlight the moral implications of capital punishment where perhaps some prisoners may actually be innocent, I just find there are other ways to convey this in a more realistic manner. Not Frank Darabont's fault, Stephen King's source material is hit and miss for me. Aside from that personal preference, I found The Green Mile to be utterly captivating and near perfect. Darabont's direction, yet again similarly with 'The Shawshank Redemption', screams confidence. Long takes entirely focussing on the characters. Tom Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Sam Rockwell, James Cromwell all gave emotionally powerful performances. Michael Clarke Duncan though, a-whole-nother level. So much crying yet his dialogue is so powerful. There is one absolutely masterful scene where he holds Hanks' hand, the camera is all on Clarke and he just talks. Just...words. Then one tear rolls down his face and I get them feels. I feeeeeel it. Raw damn powerful emotion. Musical score was gorgeous. The execution scenes were tense and hard to watch. Percy was the perfect embodiment of evil. Well-structured three act narrative and, finally, a sombre conclusion that leaves you feeling empty inside. Safe to say, The Green Mile is the quickest three hours I've spent watching a film. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",

Director Frank Darabont, who impossibly followed up his debut 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' with something even better, is remarkable in his ability to evoke time and place, and to tell a story with a wistful nostalgia that incorporates the audience into its intimacy. Every character  even the minor supporting players  is perfectly drawn, as though we've known them our whole lives; now mere memories in the near-forgotten past.

I am glad you took my advice. I just saw your ""Green Mile"" and I thought it was very good. I see that you adapted it from Stephen King's story about a death row giant and his supernatural powers.

Each and Every scene from the novel is perfectly presented in the movie. As for the performance the whole cast did a great job. but Michael Clarke Duncan stole the show. he expressed his emotion just as the character was supposed to be. Tom hanks executed his performance with the uncanny ability that he posses.

Duncan is absolutely fantastic here, blew me AWAY! I was sobbing like a baby because he truly brings the events of this movie to life in a way that touches you in a special way.

Come to think of it, I cannot think of one single thing that this movie didn't deliver 110% on. And boy is that rare! 10/10 for The Green Mile.

Darabont's first directorial work, the short film The Woman in The Room, was based on a short story by the author. In 1994, the filmmaker had already directed his first feature film for the cinema, the excellent The Shawshank Redemption (also based on King's work), gaining critical recognition. While looking for his next project, Stephen King himself told Darabont about his next book, which was about a man with miraculous powers on death row. The author believed that Darabont would be the perfect man to direct an adaptation, but Darabont was reluctant to make ""another prison movie"". Months later, after reading the published novel, Darabont changed his mind and bought the rights to the work. The result is one of the most gripping movies of the 90s, and one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made.",

462,22 June 2006,aliceboy,8, A film worth watching,"I remember hearing so much about this movie when it came out, and I have wanted to see it about that long but just never got around to it. It was only by chance I finally did see it on TV (uncut, 'cause I'm in Sweden), and it was well worth the wait. It should be said right up front that I haven't read the book, and never will. I'm not that big a Stephen King fan, and haven't really been into him since I was in my early teens. So, I have no idea how much of him or his book has made it into this adaptation, and can only deal with the film on its own merits. Chief among these, of course, is Michael Clarke Duncan. His performance here is an utter revelation from the moment we see his face. The expression he manages to work into a largely expressionless character is astonishing, and that first look at him conveys volumes about who this man is. How Duncan didn't end up having excellent roles thrown his way after this I can't imagine. Oh wait, yes I can: he's huge and black, and Hollywood has no imagination to be able to cast him as much beyond a huge, black man. (It's like Don Cheadle all over again -- except he's small and black -- but still an amazingly talented actor who'll never get the roles he should just for those reasons.) At least he had this one time to shine, and he completely steals this movie. That he lost the Oscar to Michael Caine (who was playing...himself) is just another indication of how worthless the Academy Awards are in rewarding actual talent. He handles John Coffey with a subtlety that, frankly, the role didn't require of him. It's a shame the same couldn't be said for the rest of the cast. Most of the actors gave their roles just what was expected and no more, making the characters come across too often as parodies of who the humans would be. Another standout in 'Green Mile,' though, was Sam Rockwell. His role is King's too-typical crazy redneck, but he uses it as a showcase for some of his most outrageous abilities. It's easy to completely hate this guy, and that's all the more credit to Rockwell. (Compare this to Percy, who's meant to be contemptible, but too often just feels pathetic.) Again, why is this guy's name not on every moviegoers lips? This time, one has to assume it's because he's not leading man material and just has the chops (see also, Gary Oldman). This movie runs just over three hours, and this is one of those happy occasions when the time breezes by (compared to, say, the torturous and totally unnecessary length of Jackson's masturbatory 'King Kong'). The plot never drags, the photography -- though a little Speilbergishly sepia -- is lush and warm and Thomas Newman's score (recognisable from miles away) is sparse and effective. The direction was clearly lacking, most evident in the absence of better performances on the whole, not surprising looking at Darabont's resume. I would absolutely recommend this film, which is something I'd almost never say. It's an all-around viewable piece of work, and a perfectly benign popcorn flick.",

The exception was the stupid guy of Percy Wetmore (played well by Doug Hutchison), who really complicated the lives of the guards with his usual foolish approach to everything. The story should be based in many legends about power of some black people to foresee the future and to cure some health problems. This power is believed to come from gods in the case of Yoruba (Nigeria) belief, so Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, wrongly accused of murdering two children, became a kind of ""god"" in the prison. One of the things that shocked me was the way the electric chair was used early 20th Century.

I thought that Michael Clark Duncan made a once in a life time performance, and I would be stunned if Duncan ever acted better than this. Then Tom Hanks was great, his western accent. Even if they don't tell you he was a western folk, you can just tell by his every move. Then the screenplay was great, personally, my favorite line was: ""We've never gone four times in one night since we were nine teen."" And the art direction, oh the art direction was great, it made everything worth the movie, if you didn't have that art direction then the movie wouldn't give you a feeling like you were there. And the guy who playes Wild Billy made a once in a life time performance also, I don't think this actor will get another good role, because if you look at him, he seems sort of punkish, and probably is hard to get him to play the right role. But Frank, did a great job, and the cast director picked definitely the right people for the job, that's pretty much what I've been trying to say through these lines. Then the producer definitely did a fine job, but he did take a risk by putting the sreen time that long, because other people thought it was to long, I read the zagat book and they stated a lot of people thought it was to long (I know it's 3 hours and 8 minutes, but when you are into a movie so much, it goes by so fast). So really what I'm trying to state is that his is and excellent movie, and don't miss out on it, don't care what other people say about it, because I kind of didn't want to see this at first because I heard it was pretty long, and the ending was pretty corny, but I loved, just go for it. I gave this movie a 10, and now I'll shut my skinny white face up.",
477,26 May 2015,Geeky Randy,9, Geeky Randy's summary,"Unusual but charming blend of crime, drama and fantasy based on the 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name, which follows death row corrections officer Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) during the Great Depression in the United States, and the supernatural events he and his fellow guards witness by gentle and simple-minded prisoner John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is accused of child murder and rape. With many charming characters and fun subplots, this epic outing is enjoyable from start to finish. Dabbs Greer's final film, whose character—an elderly Edgecomb—tells the story in a flashback format. A very touching masterpiece.",
478,4 February 2021,judemcrobbie,9, So Good!,"One of the best scores ever.It sets the tone perfectly from the western (movies) feel of violence to the sadness of John Coffey's (Michael Clarke Duncan) nature. Silence is used throughout the movie as well. It is utilised to create suspense throughout the movie, giving an uncertain yet impending feel.
the tension through the movie the movie is completely there. Its serious nail-biting stuff designed to appeal to the better side of your humanity.
Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely destroys his role. He delivers a complete spectrum of emotions, and despite being an impending 6ft 5 and 300lbs, he perfectly shows the youthful nature of Coffey's character.
My biggest problem with the movie is little more than a nit-pick. the mixing throughout is pretty poor and Duncan's articulation throughout is, at times, completely unintelligible.
From a purely narrative, storytelling standpoint this is one of the best. Every action is previously set up from a moment before in the film. This creates a sense that everything feels natural and fitting, despite being in a supernatural environment.
The imminent fear of John Coffey's death throughout the movie is an extended metaphor for our own lives and 'carpe diem', seize the day and how we should do that before we die, as everything comes to an end eventually
The end of the movie was so powerful as it perfectly culminated the rest of the movie, enough to bring anyone to tears.",

485,23 July 2005,Bogmeister,8, The Long Mile of Hanks & Darabont,"The adaptation of the Stephen King serial novel is given the A-class treatment by Frank Darabont, the same guy who did The Shawshank Redemption(1994), which has gained a great rep since the nineties ended. With a running time of 3 hours, plus the end credits, the pic needs to keep the viewer's attention on an above-average story - which it does. Darabont's style reminds me mostly of Stanley Kubrick's, another Director who tended towards long films. Somehow, Darabont manages to imbue almost every scene with some point of interest, whether it's Hanks' decent everyman struggling with more out-of-the-ordinary scenarios & decisions, or the nearly magical mouse which piques our curiosity in the prison (where much of the story takes place). Of course, it helps to have Hanks as the main actor to carry the picture. The sense of magic is what gives the story that extra lift. King's characters are transposed to the screen with empowering iconic attributes - the basics of humanity are represented in the guards & prisoners: strength, fear, sadism, grief, regret, compassion - all revolving about the 2 big basics of good vs. evil. How they all respond to the signs of magic touching their lives is what attracts the viewer's interest. Since it's not really grounded in reality, the pic sets up the comeuppance of the traditional 'bad guy' (a truly scummy guard) to satisfy the viewer's sense of justice, in ways we know will never happen in our cynical real life.",

489,13 October 2003,BigFlax,7, The rare film that succeeds in spite of itself,"When just about everything else comes together in a movie, gaping flaws in the premise can often be overcome.  Such is the case in Frank Darabont's second Stephen King prison adaptation, The Green Mile.  It's not just that it's hard to believe a mob of white people with shotguns would have turned a suspected black child killer over to the authorities in 1935 Louisiana, but this is a questionable plot point to start a goofily supernatural story.  This is not to say that a movie can't be done well if it features a Christ metaphor (E.T.) or a somewhat off-the-wall supernatural happening that even the characters seem to be having difficulty reconciling (Field of Dreams), but The Green Mile does not carry its premise as well, in no small part due to how ridiculous it looks when Michael Clarke Duncan grabs Tom Hanks for a minute and then expels a whole bunch of black things.  (Apparently all illnesses are caused by evil and not, say, bacteria or viruses.)",

493,28 April 2004,OriginalMovieBuff21,8, Very good movie but doesn't live up to The Shawshank Redemption,I think the green Mile was a wonderul movie in many ways. A little too much violence maybe and a little farfetch'd but it does succeed very well. It is a touching movie after all though. Michael Clarke Duncan brings us a good performance in being charged of guiltiness but was actually an innocent man. Tom Hanks was also wonderful as he usually is in most of movies too and I did like Barry Pepper's character and David Morse's too. This was a well played movie with great scenes. The intellegence of what Frank Darabont put into this was pretty impressive and I'd like to see another movie of his but i don't think that The Green Mile beats The Shawshank Redemption.,

497,9 May 2021,TheHonestCritic,6," This movie is designed to invoke emotion out of pretty much anyone. But, does it actually work for me?","""The Green Mile"" (1999), I've heard a lot about this film before I watched it. For the longest time, I just decided to ignore it. Then, I saw that it was going to be on TV. So, I decided to watch it, since it would be free and I could turn it off if I hated it! I saw it, and I just felt underwhelmed at the end of the day. The story was boring and the acting was all over the place. This plot is based off a novel written by Stephen King. Now, I haven't read the novel, but if this movie is any indication, then it must be dull. Granted, not all the books that Stephen King has written are bad, some of them are decent. But, a lot of them are just boring and depressing, which is exactly what ""The Green Mile"" is. The storyline is, a death row corrections officer, played by Tom Hanks, witnesses supernatural events occur after a mysterious inmate named John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is brought to the penitentiary. Yep, it's about as stupid a plot as you can get. Did I mention that this film is over three hours? How in the world do you possibly need so much time to showcase a minuscule plot thread like this? Well, I suppose that you could argue that the extra time is necessary to express some realism of a lengthy prison sentence. A movie that does a much better job with that premise, is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994). But, that's a whole different film review for another time. Unfortunately, in the case of ""The Green Mile"", it doesn't work here and it drags on way too long. Another thing, the execution of John Coffey didn't make me cry whatsoever, I just thought I'd let you guys know that right away. I've never cried watching a movie or a TV show, because it's all fiction at the end of the day. Now, that being said, over the years, I've heard a lot of people say that they always cry when they watch his death scene. But, his death is entirely pointless on his part, because he is proven innocent of the crime. It angered me more than anything, which is one of the worst things that any movie can do! Most of the characters are unlikeable and the overall story isn't that intriguing to me. As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the plot itself. The only ones who seem to be putting effort into their performances are Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt and Sam Rockwell. Sadly, the the rest of the cast is just abysmal! The only good elements are the sets/locations, special effects, and the soundtrack. All of the sets/locations are great and give the movie a decent atmosphere. As far as special effects go, they are very well done, and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack is composed nicely and it really sets the tone for the thin plot thread. However, I honestly that the music is trying harder than every other element in this movie! Sadly, those three elements do not help this movie. Overall, ""The Green Mile"" is just a very unpleasant and overlong film. Still, I am glad I saw it, and I can see how some people would get emotional while watching it. But, the only emotions I felt were boredom and anger. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""The Green Mile"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10. I consider it to be a bad movie by my high standards, and I personally can't recommend it. Stay away from this film, unless you want three hours executed from your life! This movie will just waste your precious time.",

The supporting cast is very good,especially Percy and Brutal,and there are 2 or 3 moments that remain with you - the 1st electrocution scene, for example.

Some are truly classic... like Pet Sematary, Cujo, Shawshank Redemption or Apt Pupil; and some are crap like Maximum Overdrive, Carrie, The Dark Half or Dreamcatcher. There are good movies based on not-so-good novels, and there are unsatisfactory screen adaptations of excellent King thrillers. ""The Green Mile"" is one of the good movies based on a not-so-good novel by Mr King. Perhaps the principal reason for this is its very good casting. Now-a-days you can always expect an above-average performance from Tom Hanks, and here he is once again at his best. Michael Clark Duncan looks extremely realistic as the convict John Coffey. And the rest of the supporting cast are also excellent, especially Sam Rockwell and Mike Jeter. Gary Sinise again mesmerizes us with a brilliant cameo.

And I had absolutely NO idea how anyone could make a movie around the gigantic, lovable John Coffeey. But here comes John Darabount, big fan of the serial novel, and buys the rights after part 2 of 6. For me, The Green Mile is perfect in every way. The art direction with the green floor, the actors, the direction, the story. Some complaints that it's too long, but I disagree. It's plain perfection. Even more so than the obvious movie to compare, Shawshank Redemption. Probably because I read The Green Mile a year before it was released. So I remembered all the small details. It was funny, scary, mean and the audience cried they're eyes out when the gigantic John Coffeey, plaid gracefully by Michael Clark Duncan, made the ultimate sacrifice. The little touches, like the mice, and Tom Hanks going up, tears in his eyes, to shake Coffeey's hand one final time. It's not supposed to end like this. But it does. And it's perfect.",

I bought the VHS without hesitation when I saw it - although I'm not a hard-core fan of Tom Hanks, either.

Edgecomb's life is changed forever when he meets John Coffey (Michael Duncan), a gentle giant with a unique gift who may have been wrongly convicted.

The plot is very interesting and catches you from the beginning, and keeps you wondering what is going to happen at every moment. The movie throws you deep in the magical world of Stephen King, where, almost everything is possible and the atmosphere is, also, perfectly done.

What would it be like to be able to help people, to read peoples thoughts, to know what is in their hearts?  Most of us will never know.  Everyone from technical crew, actors the director, screenwriter etc all helped to produce a very powerful film.  Its rare when a film can make you feel compassion for the convicted (even those who were actually guilty of their crimes) and hate for those in positions of authority and power.  This film is different to any I have previously seen in its combination of emotional intelligence, history and storyline.  Its thought provoking, emotionally draining and visually stunning.

This film is not only very emotional but it's also incredibly intriguing and a large part of that is due to Michael Clarke Duncan's incredible, Oscar Worthy performance here as Jon Coffey. Duncan proved himself to be a great actor but I had never seen anything like this form him, he brings a vulnerability to his character that always has you intrigued when you don't know the whole story yet but I thought Duncan was perfect at portraying the right amount of innocence and his execution scene will really break your heart and I will reiterate that I truly believe he deserved an Oscar for his performance. Tom Hanks was also fantastic in this film, of course since it Tom Hanks he's incredibly likable but through Hanks performance you know that this character is the best at what he does and his scene Duncan really gave him a time to shine. The mystery around Duncan's character is incredibly interesting, you have your suspicions from his first scene but you don't get all the information all at once your given subtle hints slowly and it makes the film all the more interesting to watch. This film also has a fantastic way of humanising its characters, you get the impression that despite what all these men have done they are still human beings who regret their pasts. This film also made me care about a mouse just as much as any of the human characters an that is truly worthy of praise. I loved how this film depicted The Green Mile itself and was all the guards had fantastic chemistry with one and other. The character of Percy is brought in to be a character that you despise and they do succeed at that and I loved how his character came to suffer but I found the resolution of his arc to be very rushed and their isn't really any kind of fallout from it. Now this film is about three hours long and I didn't really feel it until about the last twenty minutes where scenes begin to drag and don't have the same intrigue that the rest of the film had. ",

Beautiful film very human but I admit it disturbs me to see him, the scene 'execution of John Coffee is too strong, it's as if humans kill him again Christ does not mean that there are signs with the Christian religion Catholic. John Coffee Jesus Christ, the medal of St. Christopher, this movie may upset many Americans, especially Texans and traditionalist conservatives. A film against the death penalty and it is a shame that we still have in the USA! Very good film very human and tender but admit it bothers me to see him, the scene 'execution of John Coffee is too strong, it's as if humans kill him again Christ does not mean that there are signs with the Christian religion Catholic. Many phrases are historical and should keep in mind, but my heart umabno is bad and is so often willing to do evil. Love will triumph! John Coffee Jesus Christ, the medal of St. Christopher, this movie may upset many Americans, especially Texans and traditionalist conservatives. A film against the death penalty and it is a shame that we still have in the USA! This film is 9.0 in contrast to Shaw Shank Redemption which is 8.7 but very nervous all the barbarians who still contemplate the death penalty and have a hardened heart, but the U.S. is a nation of barbarians and have never known a single day civilization Bernard Shaw rightly said .. If this movie was Spielberg would have had more. Since these strontium on the assumption that a film must be beautiful to be directed by big names like Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson, Cameron. .. All these assessments are wrong you understand the level of bad opinion of this site. Only films for intellectuals can be saved. This film was produced with many dollars and the optimal use of special effects make the place as among the best science fiction film Americans. Finitela of using double standards when judged as a movie, try to be objective because they give 3.8 a film of its kind and reward a crap how terrible sin city with 8.2 is really a 'offense. Vote 10 ARISE THE VOTE!!!",

I can't put my finger on why, could be a result of some incredible acting by Michael Clarke Duncan ( R. I. P ) or it could be that Stephen King novels works better on screen as it also applies to Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and The Shining. The book gave me nothing while the movie version made me cry like a little girl. My eyes are wet as we speak..",

593,21 June 2019,pokemon_trainer_lucas,10, An emotional rollercoaster,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. You'll find yourself feeling hate, sadness, sympathy, empathy, anger and so much more. The characters are strong and engaging, and the plot is unique and immersive. Tom Hanks is excellent in this film, he really takes it the extra mile. I highly recommend this.",

I watched the movie several times and it keeps on touching my emotions.",
595,21 June 2001,gws-2,10, A Brilliant and Moving Film,"""The Green Mile"" is a very nearly a great film.  It is funny and moving, sad and frightening, an allegorical tale that depicts good and evil, love and hate, and magic or religion or the supernatural, or something else.  It does all these things with telling effectiveness.  The performances were terrific, particularly those of David Morse as Brutal and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.  The only reason I did not give ""The Green Mile"" a 10 -- I gave it a 9 -- was its three-hour plus length and extreme violence. Don't be put off, though.  Highly recommended.",
596,27 March 2010,rapistnextdoor,10, A Brilliant Cinematic Triumph,The first time I saw this movie I had flicked it on about 20 minutes in while it was playing on the History channel. I was working on a school project at the time and I turned the television on just as a little distraction to keep me entertained abit. I kept the movie on for about 45 minutes until I realized just what I had accidentally tuned in to. I forced myself to turn the TV off because I knew this was a movie one needed to watch and devote all their attention to - and if I would have kept it on my project would never of been touched.,
