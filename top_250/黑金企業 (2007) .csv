2,29 September 2009,murtaza_mma,10, There Will be Praise,"The world of cinema has seen and marveled a plethora of phenomenal performers, who over the years have entranced billions of viewers globally with their guile, grandeur, subtlety, eloquence and idiosyncrasy, but I dare say that none of their performances can match Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, for sheer ruthlessness, panache, eloquence and cheek. Being the chameleon that he truly is, Daniel Day-Lewis incredibly musters up all his prodigious talent as an actor to conjure up his misanthropic alter ego, Daniel Plainview, whose perpetually smirked face bolstered by his malice filled eyes makes him one of the strongest and the most fascinating characters ever caricatured on the silver screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game and virtually unstoppable as Daniel Plainview, a portrayal that not only resuscitated him as an actor, but also established him as someone who wouldn't leave a single stone unturned to bring his character to life and perhaps it is this very attribute that has helped him in his endeavor to be the absolute best at what he does.

4,6 February 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of the best of the last decade,"There Will be Blood! What a fine film! In fact I would go as far to say it is one of the best of the last decade. Visually, it is stunning, I loved the skillful cinematography and shots and the scenery was amazing. Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.",i

8,27 January 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Truly a piece of work,"A few months ago I saw the trailer to There Will Be Blood, at first I was a little put off, it looked very strange and a typical drawn out drama. But then a little later, I saw a different trailer that was much better and looked more interesting. So now it had all this hype and is now nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture, finally it came to theaters in my home town and my mom and I just saw it. Now, I'm just going to get a complaint out, I think this movie was still a little drawn out, it kind of took on a Kubrick type of feel with the first twenty minutes that had no dialog. But that was the only thing that threw me off. While I'm not as in love with this movie as much as everyone else is, There Will be Blood is going to be a sure classic down the line. The direction, the acting, the script, the sets, everything about this film was done beautifully and shows the utter greed and madness that can turn men into monsters.",r

10,29 November 2009,claudio_carvalho,7," Technically Perfect, but Boring and Without Emotion","In 1898, the lonely mining explorer Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) finds silver nuggets in the shaft and a couple of years later her is in drilling business. When the young man Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) sells the information that there is oil in the lands of his family in Little Boston, California, Daniel travels with his son H. W. and buys the ranches in the area. He finds oil and brings prosperity to the locals and increases his fortune. Along the years, Daniel builds an empire but H. W. loses his audition; he meets a man that tells that he is his step brother; he faces the opposition of the preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) from the Church of Third Revelation.

(Dillon Freasier/Russell Harvard), and ruthless business acumen. He descends on the town of Little Boston, California, building a huge oil derrick and enriching the town. He clashes with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the fanatical young preacher, develops a strained relationship with his son (who is deafened in an accident), and solidifies his empire - but at the same time begins to unravel as a person.",0
12,13 January 2008,zetes,10, One of the most memorable characters of 2007 in one of the year's best films,"Wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson's new film calls to mind Orson Welles' Citizen Kane in its themes and subject, and, shockingly, it's a good enough film to sit side by side with the one most often dubbed the greatest movie ever. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector who will do anything to be a success in the business. Much like Citizen Kane, There Will Be Blood depicts how the lust for money will eventually alienate every human being around you, and eventually make you completely isolated from the world. Unlike Citizen Kane, Daniel Plainview doesn't just grow apart from the world, he also becomes insane. There is a lot of metaphorical subtext lining the film's bottom, especially concerning the relationship between fundamentalist Christianity and big business. It's all very interesting to ponder. I don't know if I think the film is one of the most intellectually stimulating movies I've ever seen. For the record, I don't think Citizen Kane is, either. The message ""money corrupts"", while probably true, isn't especially insightful. What both films have in spades is a director with incredible talent who can envelop their audience in the rapturous experience of pure cinema. The desolate, desert setting sucks you in deeply and never lets you go. Every gravelly word spoken by Day-Lewis is anticipated with both glee and dread. It could have went on for three more hours, and only my bladder would have given notice. My only small grumble is Paul Dano in the final scene. He's good throughout, don't get me wrong, but that final sequence takes place over a decade after the last time we saw Eli Sunday. Daniel Plainview has aged, his son (as a child wonderfully played by the wide-eyed Dillon Freasier) has aged. Why is nothing done to Paul Dano to make him look older? At least give him a mustache! I think there must have been a reason for it, but I can't for the life of me imagine what that would be. Otherwise, an amazing experience.",9
13,22 November 2008,sddavis63,2, A Rather Excruciating Two And A Half Hours,"I think the last significant movie I saw that featured Daniel Day-Lewis in a significant role was ""Gangs of New York."" I was reminded of that movie somewhat. My reaction to ""Gangs"" was that it was dreadfully dull, although it did have a smattering of action here and there and at least I could see by the end that there was a point to the whole thing. Its high rating notwithstanding, I have to pin ""There Will Be Blood"" with the same dreadfully dull tag. The difference between this and ""Gangs"" is that there was precious little action to be found here, long stretches of nothingness (about ten minutes passes by at the start of the movie with no dialogue at all) and in the end I really couldn't see what the point of this was. Some parts of this movie are well done. The portrayal of the Old West was totally believable, the look at early oil drilling was interesting, the performances from Day-Lewis as silver miner turned oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday were good and the final confrontation between Plainview and his ""son"" (Russell Harvard) was very emotional. Overall, though, to me the story didn't seem to flow all that well. It just completely failed to capture my attention, and trying to keep focused on a movie that is just plain uninteresting for two and a half hours is excruciating. For whatever reason I also found the musical score by Jonny Greenwood to be at times inappropriate in that it often just didn't seem to fit the mood of what I was seeing on the screen. Clearly I'm in the minority on this, but I just didn't find this to be a good movie at all, and I frankly can't go any higher than a 2/10 for it.",0
14,11 September 2008,baumer,3, There will be boredom,"I have seen some very bad films, most of them horror or ""movies"" that are spoofs of other films. I thought Meet The Spartans was the worst movie I have ever seen, and even though it is, because it is not a film in a true sense of the word, I have to go ahead and say that There Will Be Blood is perhaps worse than it. Because this is a real film, with a real theme and real actors and a director and so on, TWBB should be in the category of one of the worst films ever made.",4
15,14 January 2008,Movie_Muse_Reviews,10," Brilliant and chilling, ""Blood"" will leave you speechless","Words don't describe Paul Thomas Anderson's latest epic film project, and he doesn't let them dominate the story either. A significant chunk of ""There Will Be Blood"" has no dialogue and the ability for it to stay so captivating is only a testament to Anderson's incredible ability to tell stories about people through images that says more than about what's happening.",2
16,8 January 2008,gregeichelberger,4, 'Blood' and oil do not mix,"With all of the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' performance (he was, in fact, given a Best Actor nod from the San Diego Film Critics Society, for whatever that is worth) in the P.T. Anderson-directed tale of early American oil speculation, ""There Will Be Blood,"" I can only relate my extreme disappointment.",3
17,6 January 2010,Theo Robertson,5, Perhaps Too Art House For Its Own Good,"I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released in the cinemas , a story of single minded obsession with some great reviews from Daniel Day Lewis performance . Only problem was when I checked the local listings of the local Odeon cinemas it wasn't being screened . Nor was it being screened at the Edinburgh film house which left me puzzled . I did find out that it screened at the Edinburgh Cameo but had finished its run before I got a chance to see it . I was puzzled that film that received much critical acclaim didn't get a wider release but after seeing it on Sky movies I'm somewhat surprised it got so much acclaim in the first place ",/
18,6 February 2008,Robert_duder,4, I'm jumping OFF this band wagon in confusion and surprise?! There 'Will' Be a lot of things...entertainment wasn't one of them,"I can say that 'usually' I am pretty on par with what the general public think of a movie although I have been known to stray my own way with certain films but I am still blown away in reading all the reviews for this film which would have someone believe that this is one of the best films of the year...an opinion shared overwhelmingly with the Academy who has bestowed numerous Oscar nominations on this film so let me be the first to say that perhaps my opinion is not right this time. However, it is my opinion and I was blown away by how truly outrageously BORING and misrepresented this movie is. I don't consider myself unintelligent by any means. I think I can certainly enjoy a great intellectual, artistic picture, and I DO love a great historical epic but I had seen the previews for this film and they represent it completely different than what the film is. There Will Be Blood should have been titled by its origin of work which was ""Oil"" because that is the only thing this film is about. I get the title...its rags to riches, pulling himself from the very bottom through turbulence and trials and ends with him losing his mind basically but my god it takes him a long time to get there and everything in the middle is as boring as the sand around him.",?
19,14 June 2008,merklekranz,5, First the music..then the film itself ..will grate on you....,"Watch it if you must for the Oscar performance, but do not expect to be entertained. The downward spiral of Daniel Day Lewis's character is paralleled by the movie itself. A buildup of hatred towards the self made millionaire leads nowhere. There is absolutely no payoff for the audience, and after enduring the overlong film, there is a severe letdown with the ending. Those who tout the Oscar performance and fine photography are deluding themselves into thinking there is more here than there actually is. It turns out, ""There Will Be Blood"" , like so many other self-indulgent films, is mistakenly worshiped by a few, while the majority simply shake their heads in disbelief at all the hype. - MERK",r
20,9 April 2008,edwagreen,5, There Will Be Blood- The Blood Sure Clots in the Last 20 Minutes **,"I have never seen a film to deteriorate in the last 20 minutes in the way that ""There Will Be Blood"" does.",e
21,20 June 2010,moonspinner55,5, The film gushes with so much intense stateliness that some viewers hail it a masterpiece before it's half-finished...,"An enigmatic, savvy silver and gold prospector in California in the late-1890s eventually makes enough money to hire a crew and drill for oil; several years later, he gets a curious tip about a possible boom-town up north where the oil is right up on the earth's surface. He views the poor, humble residents there with a jaundiced eye--perhaps they're ripe for the picking--but quickly finds himself battling a religious zealot, the forces of fate, not to mention the greedy, encroaching railroad executives who want to muscle in on his progress. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, who also adapted the screenplay from Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"", opens his picture with a brilliant fifteen-minute prologue with no dialogue (the gripping, extraordinarily physical visuals carry it). Once the characters begin to take shape--particularly Daniel Day-Lewis' distrusting, cynical Daniel Plainview--the dramatic narrative becomes orchestrated in an even more grandiose fashion. Many splendid sequences come of this, yet one gets the feeling that Anderson is trying too hard to bowl his audience over with sneaky plot mechanics (Jonny Greenwood's insidious score always telegraphing us to the upcoming horrors). The ingredients become overcooked, and with such a lengthy running-time it isn't long before the film's early promise leaks out. Day-Lewis, perhaps channeling the ghost of John Huston, won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar for his crafty performance, though it isn't a multi-layered one; the script steadfastly refuses to reveal its characters in any shades other than black and white. Anderson may have hoped to create a swirling sort of mysterious typhoon here, but the artiness of this concept results in impatience over genius. ** from ****",f

23,27 January 2008,onepotato2,2, The New Oldies,"In Europe they consider the novel a nineteenth century device, and they wonder why we Americans are still obsessed with the narrative format. The novel was displaced in the 20th century, by ideas, arguments and essays. But here we are in 2008 still noodling with stories. And in the absence of artists who know where to productively lead cinema, film-novels have been artificially raised to high importance, and film 'novelists' to similar esteem: Lars von Trier (after Dogme 95), Scorcese (lately) and with this movie Paul Thomas Anderson. Their approach holds very little appeal for me, as I have to sit through an hour or two of these completely obvious movies without any real ideas being put into play; without being asked to consider anything substantive.",=

People like to ironically throw around the mindless phrase that whatever movie was ""and insult to"" their ""intelligence"".

There Will Be Blood is a downright insult to the intelligence of anyone who has so much as graduated kindergarten. And here is why: ",t

27,5 January 2008,Quinoa1984,10, Who has the milkshake?,"Curious that both of the two best films of the year (the other No Country for Old Men)- likely two of the most daring and great of American films I've ever encountered- both are measured, classically told stories of the pit of greed that encapsulates in the soulless. In the case of Paul Thomas Anderson's film, he uses a source which, as one might expect if one's read Upton Sinclair, there are as many metaphors to be had as blood. ",u
28,17 February 2010,Hitchcoc,9, Milkshake?,"You can criticize this film at points, but the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing. He certainly has made a career of being menacing. His very presence commands the screen. The sociopath that he plays here is one of those, taking everything he can, having no regrets for his cruelty at any point. He does betray his son and still blames anyone who mentions him, assuming they are judging him. They have every right to. It's interesting that it isn't just the righteous who land on their feet. Daniel is willing to do anything to get what he wants. His passions and obsessions are right there. Anyone who hooks up with him has to know that they are simply pawns in the game. This film is filled with memorable scenes and subtle threat. Levi, the minister, is certainly quite complex and as ambitious as Daniel. His pliable face works for me, though some say he is too whiny and obvious. To me, this is what would work in this setting. For most of the movie he is Daniel's equal in the role of charlatan. The bowling alley scene at the end is worth the price of admission.",r
29,16 February 2008,pacific-oconnor,9, A Powerful Blow,"Who is Paul Thomas Anderson? There is something about him that does't belong to this earth. That could be a compliment or not, it's all up to us. That's what make his cinema so damn unique. At the end of the day it's all up to us. But the abrasive way in which he visits universes and throws his views to us is so powerful, so arrogant, so enthralling, so infuriating that the experience leaves you baffled and suspicious. but also enchanted, transformed. Here, Daniel's saga could very well be the saga of a Hollywood maverick. So little time for sentimentality. Daniel Day Lewis seems to understand it all and he adds his unmistakable humanity to another monster, after his butcher in Gangs Of New York. His performance goes beyond anything we've seen recently anywhere. From Upton Sinclair to Paul Thomas Anderson via Daniel Day Lewis an unmissable work of art.",v

31,14 January 2008,DSampson612,9, Remember Those Hollywood Studio Epics? Me Either. But We're Covered.,"The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been a contender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. But I'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it. Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damned refreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshine Lewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn't gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past...",
32,18 February 2008,g0dolphins,7, The parts were greater than the whole,"This is a most difficult movie to comment on, and I find it hard to put into words as to the reason. I think I enjoyed the movie, but how, why? Did I enjoy Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal as the leading antagonist? Most defiantly. DDL has provided us with many memorable performances and his role as Daniel Plainview is no less in intensity as was Butcher Bob, nor any less authentic as Nathaniel Poe. Did I enjoy other aspects of the film? Sure! The period piece was of considerable interest; how oil can transform your life, for better, worse or otherwise. The cinematography was beautiful and telling. I fully appreciate the hard, dirty, bone weary work that this occupation would entail. The rag tag day-to-day existence for those working the oil fields, and the land from whence it came. The score too was beautifully blended, adding to the epic scope of the experience. Paul Dano was very convincing too as the prophet/preacher of the small community where Plainview acquires vast tracks of land. His character was equally complex, and I felt he complimented DDL quite adequately. Even the story had many merits, as we came to understand the type of people who produced oil, and how the product of its labor and influence can impact those who were associated with its extraction. So one would think that the buzz and hype around it in February 2008 are worthwhile, yet I cannot seem to agree. There is something missing, something that falls short of the expectations. Too many people are of opposite opinion regarding this movie; it is either a masterpiece or drivel. I find it is neither, although I am much more likely to lean towards the former. For that reason alone I should be what, somewhere five or seven on a scale of 1-10? Perhaps it does, I just wish I could feel it. So should I give it a 7 and stop wasting time lamenting over it? Yes, a 7, for reasons I can explain but not feel confident about. It pains me to do so, therefore I can only conclude that my expectations for this movie were not met.",

35,21 January 2008,phantomtristan,1, The Most Overrated Film of 2007!,"Paul Thomas Anderson once again fashions an original and ambitious film of layers filled with challenging themes that, despite producing an occasional scene of brutal realism, fails to be that good. This two-hour and forty-minute story of one man's greedy ambition and his unwavering quest for wealth at whatever cost, reminded me of a Charles Dickens story where all the characters are caricaturesand that is not a good thing.",
36,17 February 2008,come2whereimfrom,6, OK but doesn't live up to the hype.,"Firstly let me say that this is a good film but despite that I was disappointed because it didn't feel like a Paul Thomas Anderson film. The only trace of the visionary director of such films as 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' comes right at the end of this movie, otherwise it plays quite straight. Don't get me wrong it has the stunning Oscar worthy performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview, I haven't seen an actor perform with such intensity for a long time and you do get the sense he lived the part. It also has the unusual but brilliant soundtrack from Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood, the story based on the Upton Sinclair novel 'Oil' is strong and the cinematography is both breathtaking and stylised. But somehow something just doesn't seem right, told over the course of twenty five or so years the only thing that seems to differentiate the decades is Daniels facial hair which starts as a Grizzly Adams and ends up Magnum P.I. and because his acting is so good the supporting cast don't really get a look in. There are shots that would make excellent stills, faces covered in oil lit only by a burning tower or Plainview sat in his chair smoking a pipe as the sun sets behind him but at over two and a half hours it dragged in places and yet it felt like, especially with the time jumps, that there was a lot more we weren't seeing. I wouldn't say I disliked this film some of it is brilliant like a drunken Plainview dribbling and bursting into a semi-controlled rage but I wouldn't go over the top like most critics have and I'm surprised it has won so many awards, thirty three and counting, because its good but its not the best film this year or the best Anderson has done. I feel strange going against the grain but I have to be objective and unfortunately this film just didn't live up to the hype.",

40,16 February 2008,Ianmcane,6," Strange, bewildering and over-hyped","People, please! The 18th greatest film of all-time? are you serious??! It seems to me that almost everyone has been sucked into the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' 'performance of the decade' which is, admittedly, at times captivating and menacing, but also at other times horribly over-acted (see the cringe-worthy baptism scene and pointless ending). If this is a film about one man's descent into mental illness and moral collapse, then director Paul Thomas Anderson has made a terrible hash of it. If not, then could someone please explain what the plot of this film is? It seems to me to be a disjointed assembly of loosely-connected events that do nothing to progress the story-telling process or enhance the viewer's association with the characters. And what about the characters? We have Day-Lewis' charming, ruthless and unstable Daniel Plainview, and......that's about it. The only other notable member of the 'supporting cast' was the corrupt preacher Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. However other than serving as a frequent annoyance to Plainview - who inevitably dispatches of him - i failed to decipher the relevance of their relationship. Plainview's son, H.W. became a complete nonentity after his accident and no effort was made to develop or explain father and son's deteriorating relationship. In fact, no real effort was made to explain Plainview's personal deterioration either, leaving me with a total sense of disaffection with everyone and anyone in the film.",
41,18 November 2011,planktonrules,7, The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is superb.,"Before I began watching this film, I read through the IMDb trivia for ""There Will Be Blood"". It mentioned that Daniel Day-Lewis got inspiration for his role by listening to recordings of John Huston's voice. Well, it's pretty amazing, as his voice DID sound just like him--and it's a bit weird. His acting throughout the film is exceptional--and I can see why he earned an Oscar for this performance.",
42,10 February 2008,deacon_blues-3,6, A long way to go for not very much........,"What can I say about a film such as ""There Will Be Blood""? Consummate acting by principles Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. Beautiful cinematography and devoted, visionary direction by Paul Thomas Anderson. It is a very nicely done film by people who think they are really plumbing the depths of reality and making a profound statement about American society. The problem is that this story is a badly dated allegory by Upton Sinclair about the corrupt nature of American capitalism and its doomed partnership with popular religion. These strange bedfellows form an uneasy partnership based upon their mutual goal of exploiting the masses for their own profit. But the ruthless, competitive nature of capitalism is prophesied as eventually destroying its religious partner once it has outlived its usefulness, or rather once capitalism itself has outlived its usefulness, they will both destroy each other, thus fulfilling the hoped-for leftist apocalypse that will usher in a new age of altruistic socialism where past exploitation is replaced by the communist ideal. Of course, this allegory does not include the happy ending, just the destruction of the demonized institutions of capitalism and religion. I can only release a deep sigh of boredom over this artistically superior but misguided attempt to resurrect the leftist dream of western society's demise well after the leftist ideal itself has already self-destructed. If you are inspired by this sort of dated propaganda, you'll undoubtedly see this film as an unqualified masterpiece. For the rest of us, it merely amounts to a bleak, obscure story about a bunch of miserably corrupt people leading meaningless, mutually destructive lives. The big message to all of us is OIL=EVIL. Got it, people? Very good! Just remember that oil, competition, and religion are the sources of all the evil in the world and you will be on the communist road to utopia. Yippee!",

47,22 March 2013,paul2001sw-1,9, Theatrical but nonetheless impressive,"Paul Thomas Anderson is a masterful film-maker, and 'There Will be Blood' is a gripping movie, with a superb, always surprising score. The tale of a Californian oilman (apparently with groundings in a real life story), it makes history compelling; and compelling is certainly a good word to describe Daniel Day Lewis's performance as a charismatic, charming but fundamentally ruthless figure, whose need to win ultimately drives away all those close to him (and that's the best fate that any of them get). The film isn't perfect: the dialogue never feels natural, and Lewis's acting is stage-y, though in a mostly good way: powerful and intimate, but not completely emotionally engaging; and the story of his final descent seems a little decoupled from the bulk of the movie. This doesn't mean that two hours don't pass very quickly when watching this film.",
48,24 March 2008,stodruza,3, Really suffers on second viewing.,"Anderson is the best American director working with big budgets, period. Which screenwriter who has penned a masterpiece on paper (and not wanting to do the dirty work themselves) would not want Paul making their film? I have the highest regard for him. The highest. In the league with Mikhalkov and Almodovar. I think I know what's wrong with this film. To me the catchism ""character study"" has always been a cop out for not making a film which works on what Robert Mckee terms the ""extra personal"" level of conflict. That, or has not classically arced the character which feels completely wrong for this film. It is fantastic to begin to show this devastating greed of the American flavor in such detail, but to what ends? To the spiritual and moral devastation of one man, but so what, meaning that what Anderson has here is the primordial greed that is still destroying this country, and with what he has written it is not enough to make an aesthetically definitive statement on how it effects everyone of us.",
49,6 November 2007,toolfan-hess,10, A film that will leave film-goers pondering for a long time,"PT Anderson delivers perhaps his best work with ""There Will Be Blood"". Unlike ""Magnolia"", the film's daunting runtime is not very daunting whilst watching it. All acting in the film was solid, even the work of the child actors. Daniel Day-Lewis in particular delivered a truly phenomenal performance, capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity, and comedy simultaneously, at many points throughout the film. At no point does the time period distract from the power of the film. Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve too deep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past. This is not the case for ""There Will Be Blood"", as human interactions are the focus of the film. Johnny Greenwood's chilling score is very strong, benefiting from the elegant minimalism that he show's in the band Radiohead. The cinematography is also spectacular. Robert Elswit beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters. All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film.",

It's not a problem at all that none of the other actors in here are known really. For Dano, it was a bit of a breakthrough film, even if opinions differ about his turn here. It is possibly Day-Lewis' career-defining performance and every scene with him is mesmerizing to watch, especially in the second half when every scene is a winner, also contents-wise and it doesn't matter if we are talking about the restaurant/pub scenes, the ones with his brother, the final scene with his son (including the confession), the milk shake scene or eventually the grand finale.

He doesn't seem to understand how to pace a film, his dialog is insipid and his characters are impossible to identify with. Yet the most irritating thing about his films are that they're BORING! The photography in this film is excellent, but the screeching soundtrack made me want to gouge out my eyes.

You already have a sense of it as Plainview plies the unsophisticated rubes with a pittance compared to the value of their underground wealth. Those scenes conjure up ideas of what it must have really been like during the heady days of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century robber barons. Greed and power, pure and simple, taken well beyond the measure of Humphrey Bogart's character in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" which director Anderson watched faithfully prior to his filming of this modern masterpiece. If you need only one reason to watch this film, it would be Daniel Day Lewis' excruciatingly sinister performance as the oil baron Plainview, setting a new low in human depravity with his 'You're just a bastard from a basket' speech to adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier). But unbelievably, he tops even that with the 'I drink your milkshake' tirade against preacher Eli (Paul Dano). Brilliant in it's intensity and yet unmistakably devoid of any sense of human decency and compassion. It's as if he were describing himself when in an earlier scene, Plainview maintains that ""There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking"". ""There Will Be Blood"" is an intense and tumultuous character study of a man bent on personal success, whose methods and motivation can only result in personal failure as deeply devastating as the fortune he amassed.",

Daniel makes his son his partner while turning a small patch of dirt into a small rambling oil town. Along the way, Daniel will not exactly make a deal with the devil, but with a charismatic young preacher Eli Sunday(Paul Dano). That deal will prove haunting for decades and end bloody. A lucky strike, massive fortunes, ill health, and big oil companies will leave their mark on both Plainview's. The father and son bond will be tattered...victim of ambition, human value, deception and all that comes with the discovery and profits of the black gold called oil. Also in the cast: Kevin J.

Even in the most desperate moments (= the abandoning of his son / the abandoning of his father), the main character's solitude and desperation are portrayed in a very dry and cold way, the audience (at least me) is not moved. 4) The plot has major holes which remain unexplained. 5) the character of the young priest does not show signs of becoming old later in the movie, when everyone else does. 6) This movie has been compared to Kubrick's 2001 Space Odissey, or to Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West for its epic, but such comparisons are nonsense.

If a story needs 2 or 3 hrs, it s OK, but if time is wasted and all the evidence and explanations for the acting of the characters are focused in two or three scenes and the rest is neither visually stunning nor adds much to the justification of the story. Example: we know that the boy is not his real son but when both are alone evidence suggests that both come along quite well; after the accident we still get evidence that he cares for the boy, but is frustrated because he seems severely diseased .... in the end we learn that he just used the boy; OK, but then some earlier scenes (first visit to the ranch) makes no sense.",

Thus my expectations were high and surprisingly they were met. There Will Be Blood astonished me right from its sublime opening. We're introduced to a fabulous shot of somewhat threatening desert mountains with The Shining-esque dissident music playing over it, immediately giving the film a sinister quality. Then we're showed the corruption of Daniel Plainview as he discovers oil by accident and elaborately draws it out, presented entirely with no dialogue, just striking direction and visuals.

Sure I may (and most probably have) missed the point of TWBB, but even if I did get it, I doubt I would have been any more entertained. It really was boring. The story, the characters, the setting, everything. Well, everything except Daniel Day-Lewis. His performance as conflicted small-time oil baron Daniel Plainview is exceptional. So is his mantastic moustache. If the whole film was stripped down to him offering profound monologues on various turn-of-the-century American Midwest sets, it would be acceptable. He really was the only factor maintaining my interest in the film, although he should still lose the Academy Award to Viggo Mortensen.

Nevertheless, I'd liked to have seen more of the slimy/silver tongued ruthlessness in the later dialogue with the corporate oilmen that is reputed to have persisted at the time. The film as a whole is a great testament to the many tales that no doubt can be told about this period in the US's history. However, I found great fault with the musical choices throughout - all overly intrusive, clanging and orchestral when something more basic and wild would have coloured the scenes much more effectively. Daniel Day Lewis was fabulous as usual but the Director should have insisted that he maintain the 'limp' more consistently - a major scene early on after his injury sees him running without impediment...such a shame as otherwise Daniel's performance was spot on.

The soundtrack was overbearing. Every time I closed my eyes I thought ""this film is boring. When is it going to end."" The soundtrack would wake me up. Not that it was bad it just overpowered the film. Daniel Plainview and Paul Sunday were two of the most repulsive characters I've seen in a film.

99,24 February 2008,dan_fango,3, Altogether an unsatisfying watch,This movie started out well enough with a high interest value in the first 50 minutes or so - explaining the struggle of the early oil pioneers with their lack of knowledge and equipment - it took a fair nose dive after that with Daniel Day Lewis's acting just becoming extremely annoying and the soundtrack becoming so shrill and distracting that at times I found myself covering my ears until the passage in question had moved on to quieter times. If DDL was up for an Oscar for this (and i'm no way sure of this) I have to say that the overall quality of Oscar nominees must be slipping - the storyline just got lost in an over-long rambling mess of a film. I have to say that mile for mile DDL's films SEEM to run into an overlong mess (see Gangs of New York) and it seems at times the direction of this movie gets waylayed. This is of course just my opinion and maybe you might get something out of this movie that I did not - Satisfaction - satisfaction that I longed to crave especially after a good opening - but ultimately its promise was larger than its delivery - one for the straight to video I fear with boredom a high factor in the latter stages of the movie and DDL just becoming an annoying inclusion in a thus ultimately unsatisfying experience,

102,8 July 2008,joshbaileynch,9, Anderson's best film since Hard Eight,"If many of the comments here are to be believed then ""There Will Be Blood"" is an over-long and purposeless mess, but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. The story of Daniel Plainview's rise to power as an oil magnate in the early part of the 20th Century and his running conflict with the tub-thumping preacher Eli Sunday is a timely and incisive examination of one of the battle's that lie at the heart of modern America and exerts a strong influence to this day over the way that nation shapes both itself and the world around it. Essentially what the film examines is the battle between capitalism and the church for influence and power. Plainview represents the oil industry/capitalism and the obsessive greed and Darwinian competition that drives that system. His name is in fact at odds with his personality. On the surface he certainly seems a reasonable - even charming man - who tells it the way it is, but this masks the fact that he is actually little more than driven sociopath and exploiter of both his workers and the penniless farmers he buys his oil rich land from. He is motivated not by a regard for people (whom he admits to his ""brother"" he hates) or even family (his own son is discarded when his deafness undermines his usefulness and the arrival of Plainview's brother seems to provide a more viable familial substitute) - instead it is the desire to succeed and make money at the expense of others that really drives him. Indeed when offered a the chance to become a millionaire by speculators who wish to buy his operation Plainview refuses because he would not know what to do if he did not have his business to run. The search for profit is for him an existential issue - the thing that makes him what he is - and yet his inability to see any use beyond his business for that profit hints at a kind of built in madness in his brand of capitalism/the American Dream - an ultimate lack of deeper purpose bound to lead to pain and self destruction. In the hands of men like Plainview big business is a ravening beast caught in a blind and vicious circle of consumption, exploitation and expansion.",

He's an extraordinary actor who I believe I saw for the first time when I saw Gangs of New York, in which he was one of the most lovable villains I'd seen up till that time. But with each role I've seen him play, he has an entirely different presence. For instance, he seems like a totally different person in every way when he's shaven as opposed to mustachioed. Despite Day-Lewis's intriguing stiffness and Minotaur-like density, he is capable of inordinate transformation to the point of complete contradiction. In There Will Be Blood, his physical inhabitance of Daniel Plainview, accompanied by a brilliantly realized sandpaper voice, is a lurching cartoon villain of opaqueness, impossible to probe. Day-Lewis's portrayal is so deeply subjective that the innate content of Plainview asserts itself thoroughly over form.",
106,28 March 2008,nick-1896,2," Ponderous, monotonous, self important and about an hour too long.","I've heard 'There Will Be Blood' described as a portrait of an unlikable man. Sadly that also makes the movie itself completely unlikable. It's beautifully framed and Daniel Day-Lewis is undoubtedly a consummate actor, however, as a piece of entertainment 'Blood' is weaker than water. It is ponderous, portentous and overly self-important. Other than the son and his wife who we hardly see, there are no characters to like or relate to. The scenery is repetitive and bleak, the colours are monotonous. The film drags along like an overly long opera  or an epic funeral dirge. Which brings me to the award for the worst score ever. OK, I'm sure there are worse, but this movie contained some of the most annoying, inappropriate and ill-timed 'music' I've ever heard. From headache inducing modern classical  which mainly seemed to consist of murdering the entire string section, to something I could only describe as horror suspense with detuned orchestral stabs usually reserved for budget slashers. It was like I was watching the wrong soundtrack - none of what I was hearing seemed to fit with what I was seeing. If you plan to watch this at the theatre, take your ipod and crank it up, otherwise wait for the DVD and hit mute. You won't miss much and your ears will thank you for it. Judging by the high rating the movie has here 'There Will Be Blood' is obviously high art and I missed the point. But I know what I like and this is one portrait that ain't going' on my wall.",

If this movie was intended to keep the viewer interested, it failed dismally. In fact I think it was complete nonsense. It seems to me this movie is all about the greed of one very very nasty man who utilises a child to gain access to property where oil can be found and that is the only story line; nothing more, nothing less.

This is the third picture of his that I watch(the other two being Boogie Nights and Magnolia), and he has yet to let me down. He continues to reject commercialism and the mainstream approach, and now brings us a story set during the oil boom in California, with a clash between greed and religion. The long takes and ambiguity is still present in his work, and he certainly isn't holding back on his vision, either; at no point in this does he shy away from the ills of the period. There is a tremendous level of detail to the depiction of the drilling, the machines, etc. This is immensely realistic, and partially because of that, it can be rather unpleasant at times. The plot is interesting from start to finish, and this has good pacing. Every role is well-cast, and the acting is flawless; they all disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. If I hadn't known it was Daniel Day-Lewis, I would not have been able to tell from my viewing. The editing and cinematography are excellent. This is astonishingly well-shot. The music is mostly classical pieces, and it fits beautifully. There is some brutal violence, a bit of disturbing content, and very brief moderate to strong language in this.

Too bad it is misdirected and the acting choices are baffling (what's up with the accent yo?), the writing were lifeless and it sucked the humanity out of all the characters (even the extras don't look that convincing), the photography and lighting is alright, although outdated and cliché (ooh the brooding character is in the dark and the good ones is in the light), last but not least is the score, helmed by radiohead's johnny greenwood, that could single handedly ruin the movie if everything else in the movie was well done.

120,16 December 2008,rmanory,3," A painful, unsatisfying movie","I took this movie at a video store without knowing anything about it. The reason I took it was that D. D. Lewis is one of our most favorite actors. And a very good actor he is indeed, and this movie definitely shows it. However, I will definitely NOT recommend this movie to my friends, unless they have an extra two and a half hours in which they want to get utterly bored, disappointed and depressed. Why bother seeing a movie in which whenever something happens it is disturbing? One in which every scene takes forever with no particular reason. I have seen other movies about oil magnates and their greed. Anyone remembers 'The Giant'? That's the movie with Rock Hudson, Liz Taylor and James Dean, who died during its shooting. That movie describes greed and ruthlessness, but without being boring. I have learned on this board that HW was somebody else's child; that's not clear at all in the movie. The director takes his time in showing Daniel shoveling for a piece of gold in a very long scene, but we are supposed to 'understand' that the child shown in his arms wasn't his? The movie develops a character all right; my problem was that this character does not interest me at all. His development from a nice guy looking nicely after somebody else's child (as it turned out) as his own, worrying about Eli's treatment of Mary, and being overall a fairly reasonable oil digger, into a greedy heartless monster is unclear, and many other things are unclear. No wonder it took Andersen two years to raise the funding. A great movie? Perhaps. A real masterpiece? Maybe. But definitely not for me.",

The long opening sequence designed to show the hard, hard determination of Daniel Plainview was just OK and at times rather self indulgent (where is the editor??). I am sorry but it wasn't visually that great. Yes, the setting is spectacular... But you have to do more than just show up and turn the camera on. And please don't tell me it was ""understated"" or meant to be done that way. It was just really average. There is nothing wrong with long sequences. One of my favorite scenes of all time is the opening from The Sacrifice (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091670/) so I am happy to be patient if there is some sort of artistic payoff. But sadly, not enough of one. The film is two and a half hours long, yet I never get a sense of the where the characters come from. The basics. Whats their motivation ? What drives them ? I am happy to connect the dots or fill in the details, but a film maker has to give you *some* structure on which to let your imagination work. Otherwise, I can just stay home and engage in wonton speculation. Is Eli supposed to be the mirror image of Daniel ? Or just a pale wannabe ? Sure. What about the son ? I was hoping more would be done there or at least focus on the tensions between father and son.. But not really. The ending ? That was just inadequate and in bad taste. And I have to mention the sound. At one point I started to giggle when this incredible overbearing Shostikovitch like tempo set to Daniel and his faux brother.. surveying the land. Yes, that's right. Imagine the Star Trek fight music set to guys staking and surveying the land. Huh ? Michael Clayton and No Country For Old Men were far better movies.",

Along with Robert Elswit's sumptuous cinematography it conveys a mood of impending doom, as we witness Daniel Day-Lewis, entirely alone, at work in a barren landscape. The sound design as he breaks his leg or the sharp 'chink' of the axe is a perfect example of truly cinematic sound design. And that is precisely what this film is - truly cinematic; it is a film in the purest sense: on a visual level, a aural level and a visceral level. And for that it's mesmerizing.",

126,16 February 2008,natw,6, There will be boredom,"""There Will Be Blood"" reminded me very much of ""Gangs of New York,"" which also featured another scenery-eating performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The cinematography is lush, the acting deep and the overall feel of the film majestic. But it is ultimately unsatisfying. The movie traces the life of a misanthropic loner who turns the American dream into a nightmare. Day-Lewis refers to himself as an oil man, and that's what he is. He lets nothing get in the way of getting what he wants, though we're never really sure what that is. Money isn't really the goal, as he turned down a deal offered by Standard Oil that would have made him a multi-millionaire. ""What would I do?"" he asks as he turns down the deal. No doubt, Day-Lewis is a masterful actor, adept at turning in performances of larger-than-life characters. I was disappointed, however, in the Eli Sunday character, as played by Paul Dano, who was so good in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It's unfortunate that a movie often praised as being iconoclastic reverts to the tired stereotype of the hypocritical, self-aggrandizing preacher. And, frankly, Dano's performance is somewhat lacking in nuance. The movie meanders over 2 1/2 hours before crashing to a jarring end. ""I am finished,"" Day-Lewis's character pronounces.

The film is about business man Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in one of the greatest performances of the 21st century. Plainview starts out as a dirt poor oil field worker who grows into a deranged and greedy oil man who plays a vicious game of deceit and treachery with a poor town whose devout faith is the only thing that keeps them all going. It is the complex tale of one man's rise to power and descent into greedy insanity. It boasts a kind of intelligence that modern American cinema rarely achieves.

Brilliantly directed by Anderson, with a phenomenal central performance by Daniel Day Lewis, I think the problem with the film is at a fundamental and conceptual level. The work is ambitiously themed, but Anderson hasn't taken the timeor perhaps didn't have the desireto draw us into the story or the characters. Magnolia was an epic, ambitious work also, but it was on a human scale, and Anderson never seemed to be reaching for his effects. There Will Be Blood is another matter: it's all reaching, but it comes back empty-handed. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel, the film tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview, a man without substance, and apparently without heart or soul, driven by mysterious forces (forces that are never revealed), whose only passion is for oil. Plainview doesn't appear to be all that interested in profit, even, and although he is a ruthless businessman, the impression the film gives is that this is more a point of principle than actual greed. We are never given a clue as to what might be behind such a principle, however, or behind the character's stubborn, almost inhuman drive.",

This is something that happens with cheap TV films or amateur student shorts, a veeery wrong use of scoring.

This strangely gripping if bladder-fillingly long saga has a beautiful flair for visual storytelling compounded by a fantastic though heavy-lifting score, that's as ominous as the piece's prophetic title, and a one-of-a-kind powerhouse performance that sneaks up on you to end with one of the scariest character-driven scenes of recent years. There are stretches which stretch the pace, of course, and its apparent lack of narrative may be frustrating if you're not willing to reflect retroactively on its themes, ideas and, most importantly, character arcs. While the journey each individual takes may seem subtle on the surface, it is really within the expertly-written characters that the picture finds its purpose, an exploration of the people who don't always say what they are thinking but are thankfully clearly thinking something, and its a real treat to dissect every single moment that a simple side-ways glance or overt outburst of furious anger gives us a glimpse behind the eyes of some of the best characters in recent memory. 8/10",

This is one of, writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson' finest achievements and is certainly in the discussion for his best work along with ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" P.T. Anderson is quickly rising as this generation's best director and maybe the greatest visionary film has ever seen. On a technical level, ""There Will Be Blood,"" is near perfection and may end up near the top of AFI' 100 greatest films list in another 20 years or so. The Cinematography is gorgeous. The score is incredible- sometimes a little overused. The acting is great, lead by one of the best of year- see Viggo Mortensen of ""Eastern Promises"" if you want to see a performance that rivals one of this magnitude. Paul Dano was, however, over the top and just couldn't match up with Lewis as he was outclassed and out performed, but some of the smaller roles were played with incredible realism and felt completely genuine. The direction is flawless. The art direction will put you back in the late 1800s on through the late 1920s. The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis will the thing that's remembered for years to come as he now owns title to two of the greatest acting performances of the 21st century (""Gangs of New York""). Like, ""Gangs,"" ""There Will Be Blood"" is powered by Lewis as it's lead by Daniel Plainview, played magnificently by one of the best actors cinema has ever seen as he carries this ambitious film. Without this incredible performance to lean on ""There Will Be Blood"" just can't hold up to what it sets out to do. As we watch the development of Daniel Plainview and his hatred culminate we quickly realize just how deadly Plainview becomes. Where there's oil there's greed, and where there's greed there's disputes, and where there's disputes there's blood, and there will be blood. The greed in this film is saturated through the characters with one after another looking for money.

168,21 January 2019,tabuno,9, Flawed But Great Nevertheless,"21 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. It's rare that a technically flawed movie can survive to be an excellent movie. Because of a great story and strong acting, this movie even with its problems it is able to overcome them. The very beginning the problems with this movie are apparent with the music that is more associated with horror and science fiction. There is a point in the movie where strains of 2001: A Space Odyssey seem to flow over the musical tones. There is another section of the movie where industrial, early nineteenth century mechanical sounds become apparent and last too long into the scene drowning out the natural landscape sounds. The music was intrusive and inconsistent. Also at the beginning, there is a fascinating look at isolated, primitive prospecting. Yet, when the accidents keep coming, they seem more for script convenience then anything else. How many times would a prospector understand how heavy his tools are and be unable to use a single pulley to lift them out of his small shaft? How careful would a prospector learn to be of his makeshift ladder? A more convincing injured person's crawl can be found in the wonderful Touching the Void (2004) about an injured mountain climber. It is confusing about who the characters are in the beginning and if they are the same person and the transition from mining ore to oil occurs. There's not enough spent on the ore transaction as likely the entrance into the oil business. Does Daniel Plainview really have all these other oil rigs or is he lying about them? He doesn't seem to be directly involved with any of the other rigs at all, ever as he seems to imply in his speeches. His first attempt at a speech is focused almost entirely on him even though as important is the interaction between Mr. Plainview as his rather hostile audience that we can only catch glimpses of. The relationship between Mr. Plainview and his boy becomes more and more ambiguous as well as the boy's own antisocial behavior midway into the movie. There is a inordinate lapse between the boy's accident and his rehabilitation. There is the use of a flashback regarding the accidental death of a worker that seemed to serve no purpose. As a character study, Mr. Plainview isn't of course plain at all and unfortunately the audience is left with many unanswered questions and for all the focus and great acting by Daniel Day-Lewis, Mr. Plainview's character still remains a mysterious, so much so that the audience is left wondering whether to pity him or hate him. Mr. Plainview's outbursts as with what happens to Eli Sunday through out the movie, seems to have a possible source, but again such outbursts appear sometimes more apt to come from a crazed individual. His Daniel Day-Lewis's character actually crazed. For all these problems, the movie is compelling and captivating for its various themes and emotional performances. The man of God versus the businessman (a businessman who seems to be a serious version of The Music Man (1962) about a con man as a traveling salesman. We never understand what makes Mr. Plainview tick, but his behavior on screen is so gripping and intense that we can forget the reasons and experience the tragedy itself. A likely candidate for best actor and best supporting actor nominations are in order. An even though, There Will Be Blood deserves a Best Picture nomination, its imperfections should deny it the Best Picture Award, at least technically speaking. Nine out of Ten Stars.",

172,23 November 2017,ironhorse_iv,8, Sit on down & drink your milkshake! 'There will be blood' is a film worth watching!,"2007's 'There will be Blood' is truly the 'Citizen Kane' for the modern age. While, both movies are similar in many ways when it comes to, the negative dealing of capitalism and its inherent trouble of greed. 'There will be Blood' takes the concept into a darker shade of black with its main character, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), loosely based on historic oil tycoon, Edward L. Doheny, on his ruthless quest for wealth during Southern California's oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Without spoiling the film, too much, all I'm going to say, is Plainview does nearly everything horrible to gain success, throughout the movie; yet, surprising, there is something that about Plainview, audiences and critics find him, sympatric. Much of that, comes from the fact, that he is hard-working, determine, and down-right charisma. Because of that, while, most people don't condone his brutal misanthropic action, we still admired his ambition of the American Dream, even if it's bit morally dirty. Another reason, why people tend to like, Plainview, is the fact, that Daniel Day Lewis's acting is astonishing good, with his use of his tone and body language. He impresses us a lot, on how well, Plainview is, in being a master debonair con artist, when it comes to portraying himself as a family man, when it's outright not true. Also, while, the movie doesn't have much of the offbeat humor that Anderson's previous movies, is know for; the way, Plainview coolly lay down brutal mean-spirited insults and threats to weaker, secondary characters was bit humorous, even if it's technically, highly considered as highly offensive bullying. Sometimes, we just happen to like the villain, because in a way, deep inside us. We, too, have a dark side, wanting a bit of power over others. As a result, we, the audience end up having conflicting feelings towards Lewis's character, rather than hating Plainview, downright. No wonder, why he won the Oscar that year. Regardless, I have nothing, against people who think Plainview is just too unlikeable to watch. Like I said before, he does nearly everything sinister on his rags to riches story. Nevertheless, it's still weird that the film was inspired by author, Upton Sinclair's 1926's novel, 'Oil!' Yet, the novel has nothing really to do with the self-made millionaire. Instead, the book focus on the only son of that man. While, most of the changes were, for the greater good. I still wonder, what if, they kept all the socialists provoke arguments throughout the story. The movie might had been a little bit better. Nevertheless, that wasn't the problem with this movie directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The delinquent about this historical drama is the pacing. It's a very slow built. Certain scenes seem to drag on, a little too long for my taste, such as the chat with his, 'supposedly' brother, Henry (Kevin J. O' Connor). Honestly, the director could had cut it, and we would still end up, with the same results. The scene wasn't really needed, but I guess, they really wanted to do the Cain Vs Abel comparison. Don't get me wrong, those sequences weren't bad. It just that the baptizing and confession scenes between biblical-like holy spiritualism vs devilish materialism conflict between Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) and David Plainview sermons was a little bit, better. I like, how both men are fighting for the rights for the town and each other's souls using their industrial and religious powers as tools. It's cool to see that Daniel's business was his religion, and Eli's religion was his business. While, some of their monologue can be, a bit wordy. Most of the dialogue & speeches, they perform, adds to already otherwise meaningful story. The baptizing and confession scenes are perfect examples. Even, the speech at the bowling alley, toward the end was powerful. Kel O'Neill, the original actor for Eli, left halfway through production due to being intimidated by Daniel Day-Lewis during the original filming of the bowling alley scene. Hearing that, proves that those scenes weren't a gutter. It was an authoritative strike. Another great thing, about this film is the camera work. The cinematography that, Paul Thomas Anderson & Robert Elswit did with their crew, was amazing. The film use of bleak desaturated colors was also profound. It made the film's gritty historic account of the time period, seem a little more real. It was dirty looking, but not too ugly. It had the right balance. Even the film score that went along with the visuals from composer Jonny Greenwood, work for the most part. It gave off, an astonishing eerily, creepy vibe that mirror, what's happening on screen. I just wish, he didn't use so much of his own recycled music, from a previous score from the 2003's 'Bodysong' documentary. It made the film, less unique & more generic. It's music, you likely to hear, in hundreds of old-school Gothic horror movies. Nevertheless, some of the recycled music that Greenwood, use, wasn't that bad; such as the case of classical cues. This film gave new life to composer Johannes Brahms's 'Violin Concerto' music. It was epic composition to end an epic film. Overall: All of this, parts was indeed a risky move for Anderson, as 'There will be Blood' was a dramatic shift in both tone and visual style from his previous works such as 1997's 'Boogie Nights' & 1999's 'Magnolia'. Away was the bright vibrant colors with catching uplifting tunes. Now, it was astonishing down to earth ground with a hellish tone that is also deep. For the most part, it kinda work. While, 2007's Coen Brothers crime masterpiece, 'No Country for Old Men' won Best Picture that year at the Academy Award. 'There will be Blood' proves that it was a fighting contender, and that Oil is indeed thinner than water. It's a must watch for anybody that loves movies.",

However, the movie's narrative base is more or less a tale of greed/competition and how it drives and perverts the main character Daniel Plainview (Oscar won for by Daniel Day Lewis here) in his relationships with those around him - particularly between his adopted son and a young split-personality preacher. As a self-proclaimed oil-man Daniel is a slightly paranoid incredulous pessimist who is predatory on all those who stand in the way of his greed. There is also an apparent mockery of religion which is built mostly on a vendetta developed throughout the story between the preacher and Oil-man who prays on the trust of the religious. The movie is slow-paced but not necessarily dull. The main character however never grows or seems to learn - so there's a sad repetition in his behavior of insecurity and lashing out. This begins to wear thin - there's no other dynamic. Unfortunately, the last 20 min of the movie are kind of absurd as the director and screenplay writer decided to go off on a tangent and leave the settings and support characters abruptly that had worked earlier on to build up...and then jolt us with a mean-spirited charade of gratuitous violence - becoming a pretentious gimmick. As it is the movie loses its pull and unfortunately cant recover off the epilogue scenes. Perhaps worth a viewing for good acting and production points.",
178,15 February 2010,Ziya90,8, A very powerful film and different on the subject,"There will be Blood is an example of quintessential cinema, also it is an entertainment as an adventure film and this is Daniel Day Lewis's second greatest performance after My Left Foot. Even if it is not superhuman like My Left Foot, it was amazing. As for direction, as said, this is a masterful work with a powerful story telling. Honestly, I had not supposed that Anderson was such a master director, despite I have seen Magnolia which is a masterpiece for me. At this point, it is frustrating that some people find the movie very boring, slow paced and even some say that nothing happens in this movie! This is funny, because There will be Blood is not an art house film-I don't mean that art house films are boring, but this is an adventure film like Gone with the Wind or something. This is an adventure with a rare and important plot which had not been handled before: oil! As known, Anderson inspired from the another masterpiece The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The story is very adventurous here and Daniel Day Lewis is Bogart? Anyway, the moments take place in the train station affected me a lot, for me it is may be the zenith of the movie. It was touching but in a silent and deep way. However, I had a problem with this movie which is the final act. This is the only disappointment for me. The final act clashes with the atmosphere, the tone, the spirit of the movie that is built throughout. it is like the movie steps into a new age and the movie turns into something postmodern and this post-modernism doesn't fit the movie. Then, Daniel Plainview starts to talk about milkshake, milkshake??? Also, the twin stuff was far fetched and not convincing.",
179,23 April 2021,CubsandCulture,10, Anderson manages to humanize a Sinclair novel.,I don't have much to add to the general consensus of this film. It is a wonderful Western that tells a gripping empire story of a misanthropic and myopic capitalist-a man who trades his soul for all material gain and ends up with nothing. All aspects of the film are some of the best work from the aughts. Day-Lewis gives a utterly convincing performance in the lead role. The film's cinematography has a haunting beauty to it that sells the atmosphere. And Anderson's direction and writing are some of his best work. The final sequence-I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE!-is such a bizarre yet fitting sequence to this tale. But I have read Sinclair's book before I first saw the film-unlike I am guessing the majority of the audience.,

We waited outside in the cold and rain for a good two hours to get in there and get some good seats and I can honestly say, I would have waited double that amount of time. Enough of my rambling though. In regards to the film itself; it was very well done. The cinematography was amazing as well as the set design. As usual, PTA gives us a flawless script with terrifying, humorous, and compelling dialogue. All of the acting was spot on. Paul Dano played the role of a two-faced, maniacal, and power hungry preacher. The young man who plays H.W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A last night, he seemed to know everything about the story and his character and seemed to be a natural. Daniel Day-Lewis. Need I say more? He was breathtaking in TWBB. Amazing is all i can say. You will need to see the film to see for yourself. Some may become bored with the film at times, which is what i gathered from the people sitting around me.

Ironically filmed in same parts of Texas as NO COUNTRY. Daniel Day Lewis gave an awesome performance as Mr. Daniel Plainview.. Early 1900s oilman. His interaction with Paul Dano who played identical twins was spectacular. Basically Mr. Plainview met his match in unassuming but sanctimonious Reverend Eli Sunday. Mr. Plainview did whatever he could , used whomever he could to get ahead. Murder, mayhem, he was a ruthless oilman, a conman to be sure. This movie was a chess match between the 2.Mr. Sunday was not exactly as pure as he portrayed himself to his congregation. One scene in particular that took place in the church is perhaps one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The closest character that came to mind to compare to Mr. Plainview was Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko . Both , ironically , won academy awards , well deserved for their roles. This movie comes to an unexpected last scene that just adds to this fantastic entertainment. Rarely do I see movies that are about 2 and half hrs that you do not want to end. This movie is one of those . You have to be at optimum alertness at all times. This is a pure intellectual film that is well written, well scripted and well acted by all.

Only Mr Palance can do it. 2 hours and 40 minutes is more than is needed to tell this tale and the soundtrack just does not suit the movie at all for the most part.

203,2 March 2008,Cary_Barney,5, Bombastic but empty,"""There Will Be Blood"" is impressive on some levels. Set pieces such as the oil well fire are handled with eerie, remote precision and weird alienating music that bring Kubrick to mind. In fact the chilliness and sudden, jolting brutality of the movie are very late Kubrick. Still, great an actor as Daniel Day Lewis is, his character here is revealed right away -- greedy, egotistical, unstoppable -- and never grows or deviates, so the role is not a vehicle for a great performance. Day Lewis delivers an all-stops-out, bug-eyed, mannered, finally monotonous performance. It's the centerpiece of a film that finally seems uninterested in exploring human or social issues, preferring to go grandiose on us and trumping up (it's apparently not in the book) a metaphysical duel to the death between Day Lewis' oilman and Paul Dano's preacher (another over-the-top performance). It finally rings hollow, schematic, humorless, lifeless. This is a film made with amazing skill and care and control, but like the late Kubrick films you're left wondering why. One hopes that Paul Thomas Anderson isn't turning into the kind of hermetic obsessive Kubrick became, losing touch with humanity and making ponderous films about abstractions. So unlike ""Boogie Nights""!",

In roughly 2.5 hours, the movie does almost nothing to either account for or reveal in any particularly interesting way the moral bankruptcy of Plainview. Insofar as DDL's performance is concerned, it is particularly overacted at the scene of his baptism, when his overt contempt for the proceeding could not be more apparent. While we can sympathize with his plight and laugh with his sarcastic murmurings, it is simply unbelievable that such a manipulative person in desperate need of the critical lease for his pipeline wouldn't at least fake the requisite sincerity, especially as we know the Plainview character is a capable performer and has a history of doing so. The 30 minute over-dramatized coda explains nothing and adds nothing and thus the movie's conclusion is abrupt and unsatisfying.

On the other hand there's Eli Sunday, beautifully played by Paul Dano, a pastor of a church located in the midst of oil-rich country Plainview is eager to exploit. The natural antagonism between the two adversaries escalates with the advantage shifting from one to the other depending upon the exigencies of the moment. From the opening scene to the shattering climax with its unmistakable symbolism this is a modern masterpiece.",

I can't say I fell asleep or didn't enjoy it but neither am I available for dancing in the street, to paraphrase Sandy Woollcott. It was well made, indubitably and well acted but it is just a movie, Ingrid. The date of the source novel, Oil, by Upton Sinclair, was contemporaneous with McTeague, filmed famously by Erich Von Stroheim as Greed and when we throw in James Dean's Jett Rink in Giant we remember once again that nobody writes in a vacuum, be it novel or screenplay.

The false hope that is being pedaled is a bit offensive as is the desperation in that it is sold. Oil for one, and God by the other. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are excellent in how they dupe themselves along with others in their endeavors. But the sadness of such existences is only shown, not felt. The story line is predictable that not even the blaring musical tension can elevate. DDL had depth as Bill The Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"", but despite a sincere commitment, he is still a one dimensional character, albeit a charming one. Some movies are discussed in reference or even comparison to others by the same director, actor or genre. Others stand out as unique. ""There Will Be Blood"" has some of both, which is to say there is much to discuss in those regards. The bottom line is what needs to be considered, and this movie takes a long time to evidence a lack of character development and to show to unsurprising results of such an existence.",

I thought that the plot was very 'run-of-the-mill' & that all the possible sub-plots failed to materialise. And the ending seemed a bit over the top in terms of what happens during the film. Daniel Day-Lewis seems to always impress in any role he plays & his character was intense & very intriguing but that doesn't make a movie on it's own! Nothing unexpected happens at all (except an over the top murder right at the end) & nothing interesting seems to develop. Initially, i thought the 1st couple of sub-plots weren't developed on purpose in order for ones further into the movie to be developed or a surprise plot to appear but nothing happened at all.

248,2 February 2008,cultfilmfan,10, There Will Be Blood,"There Will Be Blood is based upon the novel Oil by author Upton Sinclair. The film takes place in the late 1800's and moves into the 1900's and is about a silver prospector named Daniel Plainview who discovers oil which leads him to great riches and gives him power when he starts his own oil drilling companies. Daniel is approached by a young man who takes him to his family's property and land where Daniel soon discovers that it has tons of oil under the ground, so he sets up a place to live and starts drilling for more profits. During the film we are also shown the relationship between Daniel and his young son H.W. and how the profits he is making soon start to turn him from an honest hard working man into someone that is soon unrecognizable and the film shows his descent into this character and how he his changed because of this. There Will Be Blood is more of a look at the character of Daniel and what makes him who he is and why he does what he does and he is brilliantly played by actor Daniel Day-Lewis and is written so perfectly that we really get an in depth look at the character and what is going on in his mind. The film's story is mostly a look at Daniel and the different people he interacts with, but mostly it is a look at him and the story is told in an epic way because of the dynamic presence and portrayal by Daniel Day-Lewis and the strong writing of Daniel's personality and dialogue. The film is also one of the best looking films I have seen in quite awhile with gorgeous cinematography and great sets, costumes and a wonderful musical score as well. In many ways There Will Be Blood is an epic film because it is a period piece movie and it is a little longer with it's running time, but in that time, so much stuff is going on and no scene feels wasted, or unnecessary because every moment we spend with Daniel drives us deeper and deeper into his character and because he is such a fascinating character from start to finish that he really makes the film a compelling watch and because he is such a layered character with so much going on in his mind that he becomes completely human and his descent into greed and power and perhaps even loneliness and remorse is all the more interesting because of the great script and acting performance that really propels this character onto the screen. The film didn't drag much with it's longer running time and there was so much to appreciate here with the gorgeous look and feel of the film to it's thought provoking and involving story and performances that really make this film a unique and all too hauntingly real portrayal of this sort of situation where one is driven by man made evils. One of the best looking films I have ever seen and one of the best character films as well. There Will Be Blood stands out because of it's excellent work in front of and behind the camera and makes for a truly compelling and interesting watch and is even more so because it is really unlike any film I have seen before and I mean that in the best way possible. One of last year's best achievements and best films.",
249,22 April 2008,imdbfriend,9, Shot at Greatness!,"This movie is absolute masterpiece in terms of story, direction, screenplay, cinematography, background music and acting. Daniel Day Lewis has yet again delivered a packed powerhouse performance. Firstly, Anderson has made a gem of a movie. Anderson's story telling style is quite unique; he doesn't rely completely on dialogs but rather on camera movements capturing the characters emotions and expressions. This style of story telling might make one bore with the movie but believe me not his movie. He knows his trade very well. I have only seen his other movie 'Magnolia' which I liked too but in this movie he excels not just himself but many other filmmakers of this generation too. He definitely seems a director to rely on delivering master pieces. Now, coming to the main man movie belongs too, i.e., Daniel Day Lewis, is undoubtedly the most talented actors of our generations and this movie only strengthen his place further among one of the greatest actors of all time. He portrayed ""Plainview"" so perfectly that I cannot even begin to imagine some other actor playing this role the way he did. Watch the intensity with which he delivers his dialogs, intensity when he is digging for oil, when he is protecting his kid and almost every frame he is in is a shot of greatness, how competitive he is, how chilling he is. Other actors too are good, especially Lewis Kid (as a child), Elli the preacher. I don't want to reveal anything here why Lewis is superb here; why direction is superb here, as to mention those I need to describe some specific scenes and moments in the movie that with the help of the director, and Lewis who takes them to the extreme height of perfection and superiority and which might not give you a full satisfaction of seeing those for the first time in the movie and I don't want to take any such moments away from you.

255,22 November 2008,hjemmefra,10, An examination of alienation,"Contains spoilers. If there's one thing that's absolutely certain about Daniel Plainview, it is this; There Will Be Blood. This movie is a study of the singular man. A man probably emotionally crippled by his past, causing a paranoid fear of intimacy. Believing himself utterly isolated in a meaningless universe, without emotional connection or outlet. On the run from his past driven by spite, he makes for an excellent prospector. Toiling alone in the wilderness. Mining for silver but striking oil amalgamates spite and intellect into pure ambition. The movies eerie, unsettling score charging every scene is, I think, a device to show Plainview's emotional state, reminding us that this is a character study,foreshadowing his ominous fate. His newfound riches lets him blossom into a power-player, a shrewd manipulating businessman.-And a sadist. And ultimately a sociopath while he medicates his emotional isolation with copious amounts of alcohol,despising all weakness in others as he despises his own self-pity. Plainview has a special hatred for religion which is possibly an extension of his issue with intimacy, or probably connected to the past he fled. Despite all his faults he can also seem a man of principles, as he takes care of the orphaned boy and admonishes Mr. Sunday for beating his daughter. But the admonishion carries with it a feeling of power-play against Mr. Sunday and his religious practices.And he of course ends up exploiting and disowning the boy. Several years later when all his ambition is realized we see a shell of a man, finally alone, in his ornate cage of a mansion with nothing left but his bitterness. But still alive. Then comes the priest and Plainview turns the tables on him, returning the favor of betraying his own convictions for greed. He kills the priest and wins his final battle. Vanquishes religion with a few strokes of the bowlingpin-wand.And conquers the universe. ""I'm Finished."" He can die.",
256,19 March 2008,EijnarAmadeus,10," Paul Thomas Anderson's gut-wrenching, raging bull with tour de force Daniel Day-Lewis","'There Will Be Blood' appears with a atonal string note of unease, and with the first wordless 15 minutes it's the darkness of Daniel Day-Lewis, deep in a mine shaft, that creates this relentless intensity; people at the cinema were wincing, laughing and chit-chatting in the opening sequence, not managing to keep a straight face-to-face with such a gritty and greedy man. And by the time the movie's ended off you'll feel gut-punched, it's like you've been going one too many rounds in the ring - but the feeling isn't Anderson' failure of making this too long, but its exhaustion of such intensity and breathtaking cinema-making. The harsh power of the movie shows violence of the flesh and spirit of the American character - Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) is the dark underside of the American success, a man with an enduring greed and brutality who looks at people and sees nothing worth liking. During his progress from being a sweaty, dirt-covered loner in the desert digging for silver to becoming a highly-regarded, successful oil tycoon of ruthlessness he rapes, pillages and murders and winds up so estranged from the normal human beings that he's forgotten that he is one on his own. Plainview encounters Eli Sunday, fantastically played by Paul Dano, a charismatic preacher who gets in immediate competitive force with Plainview. Sunday's shrieking preachment of the gospel offers an alternative offer of redemption through his powerful faith, rather than Plainview's promising of wealth - and Sunday's faith in God is unshakable, compellingly preached and with forceful power. The Clash between these two titanic egos is the heart of the film; Plainview doesn't have any sentimental side, but he has got H.W., a bastard-child who Plainview uses as an illusion of family values to buy land, fooling the owners for their ""oceans of oil"" under their feet. The connection between Day-Lewis and H.W.'s extraordinary Dillon Freasier is masterfully skillful, H.W. is the only peak hole we've got into Plainview's soul - and we don't get the answer though Plainview paints himself as a family as well as an oil man, even at the end to which Plainview sociopath-speech bristles with gruel and evil - does Plainview lack of human feelings? Or does he choose to ruthlessly deny them? And Anderson's painting of his nation's soul is dark - if Plainview and Eli Sunday represents the bigger forces of religion and capitalism and the role they've played throughout America's history, this bleak history lesson shows the behind-the-scenes and corrupted story of a land drenched in greed, violence and hypocrisy. And Anderson uses every tool at hand to drive his masterpiece-story home; the production design is breathtaking, proving that cinematography can be form of art when black smoke and an oil well sprouting with fire and flame is so visually astounding that it not only looks the movie, it speaks for it. And great photography is combined with a revolutionary soundtrack, created by Radiohead guitarist and composer Johnny Greenwood it shifts between its genius work of absence and shocking use of frightful and powerful arrangements. The harrowing climax is the finale of Plainview and Eli, the false prophet arrives to blackmail the viciousness in the greed-mansion built, you don't need to be a A-student to see that this won't become a pretty sight. A Bloody Hell will break loose. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is a landmark performance, he blows and bellows and triumphs in making us see ourselves in Plainview - no matter how much we want to look away 'cause of its discomfiting presence, its impossible to tear your eyes away from. Daniel Day-Lewis makes a 'volcanic' performance, and Anderson has created a landmark in cinema history.",

The ""answer"", if in fact there's any real mystery, can be found in the film's superb cinematic method. This method is the curious angles, the vast vistas, the jump cut edits, and the subtle rhythms that form an eloquent but mute narration that tells a much more vivid story than any dialog or exposition ever could. It's in the near silences of pure movie action that we are able to glimpse the the dark forces that drive Daniel Plainview. People unaccustomed to or ignorant of the pleasures to be found in the act of reflection and contemplation will likely find these moments of the film to be very boring and too self indulgent. That's a tragedy, for them, because it's a great thrill to be included in the creative process, to be counted on to complete the story in our own minds where the creations of our own imaginations are so tremendously satisfying. Apparently, so many people are just too intellectually limited, to damn impatient, to appreciate this film's subtle power.",

My inclination toward believing that the 'Academy' or any other so called prestigious, posse, of judges of cinematography has been totally dismissed from my point of view. I only wish I had not wasted a dollar to rent the DVD! I can't imagine why it would seem that filmmakers have taken to creating odysseys of the most base and, hideously cruel of human behavior with absolutely nothing that may leave a viewer with some sense of hope or goodness in humankind. It seems to be the trend, and, why do we as consumers keep 'gobbling' this crap up? Because we get duped into thinking that there is something of value by the amount of 'hype' that goes into the promotion of these movies. Daniel Day Lewis needs to get an award for being the best actor to play the role of sociopaths. He was just about as good a sociopath in his role in 'The Gangs of New York'.",

The producer of this film should thank his lucky stars for Day-Lewis as he was the only thing to keep one interested and that is still debatable. In addition, like many movies of today, it also takes a bad view on religion and leaves a very bitter taste.

I even think there were far better movies in 1999 than the Oscar winner, American Beauty, but you be the judge of that. This movie, if marketed normally, would've tanked in the box office. Here's how they do it: Show it to a handful of critics by year's end, who'll start the buzz and put it in top-ten lists. Premiere it in one or two art houses in New York and L.A., who are obviously going to be sold out because people wanting to see what all the fuzz is about. The thing goes in crecendo, the movie wins some nominations, premiere it in more theaters. Wins some Oscars, do a wide release. By then, the film is bad-word-of-mouth proof.

Long at two and a half hours, but feeling much longer, this is an arid and joyless experience - possibly the most po-faced film since the widescreen epics of the late 1950's. The film has no clear message, if as it appears to be that greed corrosive to the soul it simply doesn't work because Plainview is corroded from the start. As it goes on the film manages to get more and more ludicrous, the final scenes being hilarious in ways not envisaged by the makers.

Plainview comes across as a boorish, manipulative hustler in the first 2/3rds of the film. Not until the film's final act does Lewis get to go full throttle and act like an unpredictable sadistic madman.

Punch-Drunk Love (2002) did not get any Oscar nomination and is perhaps not as accomplished as his two previous, yet it did win him Best Director at Cannes no less!

The first third or so was good despite the awful soundtrack, but after the pivotal accident scene with his son, I couldn't stop looking at my watch. NOTHING HAPPENS. Was it supposed to be a fascinating character study? Daniel Day-Lewis plays an evil (or just ""competitive"" as he says) cyborg who spends most of his time chewing imaginary tobacco that never gets spit out. The only time he seems remotely human is in the occasional scene where he almost manages to seem like he cares a tiny bit about his son. That's it.

DDL over-acted his way through the film with an unrealistic accent for the time, place, and character. I felt like he was screaming, ""Look at me: I'm ACTING!""

Evidently Hollywood is still unable to effectively tackle the struggle of Communism vs. Capitalism, even as portrayed by a well-known and respected socialist/liberal like Upton Sinclair. Most people will have not read the novel but let me just state the following: The son, H.W. (know as Bunny in the book) is Plainfield's real son and he never goes deaf. He is not an orphan and sees his mother regularly. The father, again Plainfield, does not kill anyone in cold blood. Eli doesn't play a major role in anything, the son is never sent away. The father and son don't fight. Plainfield is not an evil man, but a prosperous capitalist who cares about his workers, the lives of them and their families and so on, because it is in his best interest. Bunny, is a communist/socialist/union sympathizer who spends his fathers money bailing out his socialist, pro-union, and communist friends, skipping classes at the private college he attends, and having sex with movie stars and other wealthy women. That is just a taste of how far out the movie is from the book... Again, this is a horrible movie that took parts, very vaguely, from a great book and turned them into crap that over-glorifies evil and death and ties them to oil for the sake of protesting modern times.

This is an unsubtle film and, while Daniel Day-Lewis was awarded an Oscar for his starring role, I felt that, in the Upton Sinclair tradition, he acted excessively. To be sure his character was conniving and ruthless but even when he is poor and struggling to locate his first well, Day-Lewis is already portraying him as a villain to hiss. The story may develop and evolve but Day-Lewis does not (though he is sober at the beginning and a drunk at the end). Day-Lewis plays a single note throughout the picture which is disagreeable and unenlightening. Upton Sinclair belonged to a particular period in history and, far from bringing some new 21st Century insight, he is best left where he was -- in the age of the robber barons. His books are not often read today for a good reason. They are too heavy-handed -- as is ""There Will Be Blood."" I feel generous in rating it at ""4.""",

This led me to watch his previous Oscar nominated movie ""There will be Blood"" which I was somehow not able to watch (I don't like Daniel Day-Lewis, don't know the reason) over the years. There will be Blood is a hardcore look into the life of a oil man in 19th century played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Sitting through There will be Blood is one of the darkest experiences of my life. The Gothic background score and dark performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and creepy Paul Dano were more than I had ever anticipated. The direction, background score, screenplay and performances of the movie are simply outstanding. This is nothing like we see on regular basis. It takes lots of courage and heart to direct something so dark and bizarre that it makes you question everything around it. Daniel Day-Lewis well deserved Oscar winning performances is haunting and memorable. This man surely knows how to divulge into dark roles (Scratch NINE out of your head right now). Paul Dano is so good that you want to hate him from bottom of your heart. I have never hated a teen since that whinny little ***** boy from ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"".

The story make take place in the early 1900s, but the themes of religion, business, and capitalism have a remarkable relevance in present-day society. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The gusher scene is especially striking. It will be remembered as one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is the strongest that I have seen since Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". The ending is brilliant and satisfying, despite receiving much criticism.

If you like Paul Thomas Anderson's other movies, don't think for a second you will like this movie. Apparently a lot of people do, so maybe you will be one of them, but many of you will hate it. One of the greatest things about his other movies (specifically Magnolia) is that, even though many of the characters are ""bad people"", the characters and the story line are developed so well that the movie elicits an emotional roller coaster...you feel disdain for some characters, then you feel sorry for the characters, and even feel compassion for those same characters at other points in the movie.

This is the first film I've seen from him, and it stars famous method actor Daniel Day Lewis as the lead. It takes place in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and focuses on a prospector during these times. I'll start off with the negatives so I don't forget. There were a couple fade transitions that kind of bothered me and felt out of place, but that's really nitpicking. A big issue I had here was the score. Usually I'm never bothered much by scores, either they're very good mediocre for me, but the score for this film was just very distracting. It wasn't very good in my opinion, and honestly I would've preferred if the score was just took out of some scenes. I guess another problem I have is that, as I'll get into this is an incredibly well-told story, but I think outside of the story itself it doesn't hold much weight. There's some surface level themes about capitalism and greed, but nothing that's super impactful, but honestly I think that's ok (I should mention that this is subjective, of course different themes impact us in different ways, this is just how it impacted me personally).

I kept hearing about this ""descent into evil"" that we are supposed to witness in Daniel Plainview, and I expected that, in a film entitled ""There Will Be Blood,"" there would be blood. I was anticipating a convincing transformation from mere ambition to amorality, in the manner of Michael Corleone - in my opinion, The Godfather Parts 1-2 are my gold standard for a charismatic hero tragically brought down by hubris and greed, devolving before the viewers' eyes until the same character we admire in the beginning becomes truly horrific and despicable. In Corleone's case, he clings to an internally consistent logic in his behavior - defense of family honor and loyalty to the larger cause. In the case of Daniel Day-Lewis' Plainview, we see no such (d)evolution. Instead, we hear an audio assault of TOTALLY inappropriately dramatic violin and percussion spasms which bear no relationship to the events unfolding on the screen, while we watch DDL brilliantly inhabit a character who instills in us a sense of dread about what is going to happen ... except ... it never quite does. While I sat engrossed in the lines and stubble of DDL's weary face and kept trying to anticipate what event would mark the dramatic turning point that leads Plainview to make his tragic choices, that point never arrives. For reasons never clear or logically portrayed, Plainview develops an enormous hatred for Eli the preacher that is far out of proportion to any real encounter that could explain the animus. All of a sudden he beats the preacher up but even that scene plays more comically than forebodingly. While DDL made me believe from the outset that his character was capable of a transformation to extreme violence and hatred, I never fully understood what would ultimately motivate them - his adopted son's accident and inability to continue as a partner and heir to his business? A teenaged charlatan preacher who embodies the worst of hypocrisy in organized religion? A big-oil representative who insults Plainview's parenting skills? A scam artist masquerading as the half-brother we have no reason to believe Plainview would ever have known or cared about otherwise? What the heck is going on here? Plainview lashes out, perhaps from the same frustration the viewer is feeling, at the pointlessness of it all. After reading media reviews about DDL's menacing performance as a ""murderous"" oilman, I was extremely disappointed that his two acts of murder seem like such exaggerated responses to minimal injustices suffered by Plainview. At least in the case of a Michael Corleone or a Bill the Butcher, we can understand what it is that causes the antihero to become a frank villain - in Plainview's case, it is plainly not in view. Thus do all of DDL's amazing talents ultimately go to waste in pursuit of a nonstory.",

If there ever was an example of overacting, here it is. Now, the actor playing the main role did a great job. He's a good actor, he actually made the whole thing at least watchable.

405,20 January 2008,iamtherealace,6, A magnificent performance from Day-Lewis in a film that was only about his performance. SOME SPOILERS,"I went to see ""There Will Be Blood"" expecting the best film of year. What I got was a highly absorbing, intriguing and beautifully well-shot first hour before the picture collapsed. When Plainview's son is sent away because of his deafness the only interesting emotional relationship in the story is removed, leaving Day-Lewis and, um...that's it. Even though HW Plainview returns later on, I was so mind-numbingly bored with the total vacuum of any other dynamic relationship that the film was passed saving at this point. When Plainview set up his big Oil plans in Eli Sunday's community, I thought the story would kick on and evolve in some way. Instead it just stagnates. The major problem here is with Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. Dano has performed very well in other movies I've seen him in, and he clearly has a fine talent, but here he is poorly cast. If Eli Sunday had been played by a heavyweight actor of equal power and intensity as Day-Lewis, then the struggle between the different types of greed bound up in the church and business symbolized by Sunday and Plainview respectively would have been more powerful and significant. As it was, the young and innocent looking Dano came across much more as some kind of crazed weirdo than as the spokesman of this community. The moment that summed this up was when Plainview went back on his word to Sunday at the opening of the drilling site and didn't allow him to bless the new project. The close-up on Dano's face revealed nothing of the anger and belligerence that an older actor might have brought to the role. A stronger, more aggressive performance would have ensured that when HW Plainview vanished, the underlying tension at the heart of the film between spirituality and materialism would have been played out as a real battle, rather than the one-sided demolition job Day-Lewis' powerhouse character did on the weak and submissive Sunday. Such a relationship might have provided a better structure in which the story could have grown. The problem that emanated from Dano's casting as Sunday was that there was a giant vacuum in the story that some people clearly thought was adequately filled by a ""character-study"" of Plainview. Whilst Day-Lewis' performance was sensational-intense, emotionally charged, and so believable, I don't think that any character, however well acted, is interesting enough to justify being the sole subject of a film for an hour and a half. ""Into the Wild,"" a film just as much about the main character as ""There Will be Blood"" is, benefits from the number of relationships Emile Hirsh's character has along the way, which succeed in creating the tension and dynamism that make the film enjoyable. Here the story didn't go anywhere, and the film didn't really know how to finish itself, ultimately ending rather weakly with the terribly contrived confrontation between Plainview and Sunday. Some people will add to the argument that the film is a fantastic ""character study"" by talking about its war on terror orientated themes of power, religion, greed etc. etc. If someone can tell me what the point of the allusions to the war on terror business were (""HW"" Plainview etc.) then I'll be grateful, because as far as I can see the film raised the fact that greed and religion exist, and then left it at that, smugly thinking that making such clever links to the current political climate is an intrinsically valuable act, and that any development of those themes is entirely unnecessary. Day-Lewis here gives an outstanding performance in a film that suffers hugely from its weak story. A real disappointment.",

Powerful is one word. Brutal is another. But one word that is never far from my mind is Magnificent. 'There will be blood' is a tale of greed and tragedy as Daniel Day Lewis delivers alter ego Daniel Plainview, a sneering up and coming oil baron in ruthless pursuit of valuable land to increase his wealth and dominance in early 1900's America. Little is known of Plainview's past, and domination not only of the oil world, but of his own realm is the only certantity as we see a man burning with hatred and equally desire manoeuvre his way to oil immortality. Utterly convincing acting, screenplay and cinematography, Anderson has hit the film making jackpot with this one, a movie so captivating and enthralling I consider it almost perfect.

After seeing it and even sleeping on it, I can't figure out was this was about (and not in a good senses that it keeps me guessing).

It also seems like every P.T Andersen movie since Boogie Nights (brilliant I might add) gets progressively worse, and with ""blood"" he's really hit bottom. I really wanted to like this movie, and was ready to give up several times, but stuck it out. I would rather have watched Juno or Michael Clayton again. And I can think of a couple of movies which should have been nominated for Best Picture over this one. Save your money, and more importantly, your time.",

However (in this case) the man speaks no lie for his veins do indeed run rich with plutonium oil. A crude, black substance embedded deep in the heart of director Paul Thomas Anderson's gargantuan North American epic- There Will Be Blood. A perpetually steady, emotionally-draining tale about the evil deeds of an oil guzzling tycoon that vigorously chews on the themes of gluttony and narcissism, faith and ambition, death and abomination. Do not be mislead by its title, though. For this is not some hysterical slasher-flick (as the juveniles sat behind me seemed to think at the outset). It is a gruelling, drawn-out dissection of a loathsome yet sinisterly-comical individual consumed and maddened by his own persona. And it's absolutely formidable. But it's also a marathon, meaning that it's not for everyone. So if movies of the elongated breed just aren't your thing, then I'm afraid there will be no blood for you. Sorry. However, if you sincerely believe that you've got what it takes to go the 158 minute distance, then brace yourself for a near unblemished semi-classic tour de force driven by a leading character performance to rival the very best.

Like The greatest films of Griffith, Welles, Kubrick, Scorsese, and Malick this film constitutes a stunning breakthrough in film grammar and film technique. By deliberately eschewing dialogue at key moments, Anderson creates an almost unbearable tension. The score is brilliant, the editing comparable to Schonmakers best work for Scorsese, the art direction by Jack Fisk absolutely superb. Daniel Day-Lewis performance is amazingly rich and nuanced, fully equal to his startling work for Scorsese in the under-rated and misunderstood The Age of Innocence and his soul-shattering turn as Bill the Butcher Cutting in Gangs of New York. All of the other performances are good, and Paul Dano is as brilliant in his way as Daniel Day-Lewis. This, in short, is one of those rare and wonderful films which actually merits an ""Eleven"", up there with The Rules of The Game, The Leopard, Badlands, the first Two Godfathers, Seven Samurai, Eight and a Half, Raging Bull, The Red Shoes, the Searchers, Stagecoach, Shadow of A Doubt, Notorious, Vertigo, Barry Lyndon, The Age of Innocence, The Tree of Life, Tokyo Story,Touch Of Evil, Grand Illusion, The Earrings of Madame De_, Intolerance, The General, Sunrise, Faust, Diary Of A Country Priest, Modern Times, Casablanca, Sullivan's Travels, and perhaps a few others.",

It is a flawless movie that is expertly crafted and masterfully carried out. The way that the movie is set up in terms of it's music, cinematography, themes, and characters is the definition of memorable. There Will Be Blood sets up a very dark theme with these things, making you think that something terrible will happen. The one, the only problem with this movie is that not enough terrible things happen. There is not enough blood, and so the dark atmosphere set up by the film is not totally justified. But when you are caught up in the mesmerizing characters and performances and lines, you just won't care.

He was deserving of both of his Oscars (My Left Foot also), that's for sure! The story is both confusing and fascinating. Watching a man evolve from hard worker to innovator to oil magnate and in the process watching his soul decay. Perhaps he was in a soul-less state from the start and we just find out as the story unfolds. Initially he appears to be a man with goals but also a loving and caring father, or foster father and a man who shares his wealth and progress with others but ultimately we see his ulterior motives. The production values are quite impressive and the supporting cast is fine. My question is: ""What's the moral of this story?"" I found myself very unsympathetic to the townsfolk, the so-called preacher Eli, the leach who posed as a brother to Daniel Plainview and even the some of the oil workers. I very often hear film critics saying: ""I couldn't relate to the characters in the film"" and then they pan it.

453,5 March 2010,charlesb-3,1," Bad film, worse acting","First. Daniel Day-Lewis is a ham of the first order. This man has about as much acting ability as my goldfish. Many years ago, an English journalist called Michael Green wrote a great comedy series which included 'The Art of Coarse Acting', which described the ludicrously inept activities of amateur actors in local companies who mostly acted in church halls or tents. On the basis of this bit of grimacing and wholly unconvincing twaddle. Day-Lewis would be lucky to get the part of Fifth Attendant Lord in Henry VI Part III in the Acton Player. From a reasonable start in 'Last of the Mohicans', he has had a Tarantino like vertical descent from good to garbage. Someone should explain that gurning and mugging are not actually acting. Goggling at the camera and talking in an accent no human has ever had do not constitute 'great acting'. Great acting is what goes on at the National Theatre on London's South Bank when Ralph Fiennes, Helen Mirren or Derek Jacobi turn up. It's what goes on frequently at other London theatres or Stratford when Vanessa Redgrave, Tamsin Greig, Julian Bleach and dozens of others go on stage. Second, this film is so ludicrously full of itself that it is an almost Ibsenesque parody. It opens up with a long, dull, 'who cares' sequence when no-one speaks. You are totally certain that something untoward is about to happen that you simply speculate as to what it is, and then laugh when you get it right. Instead of building tension, developing a feeling of otherworldliness, it simple draws attention to the fact that the useless director is trying very hard (and very unsuccessfully) to 'make a point'. Unfortunately, no-one cares what the point might be, the device is as unconvincing as a Henry VIII codpiece and deservedly draws as much despising humour. After about 40 minutes of this drivel, I gave up and wrote this. The DVD cost me GBP3. That was about GBP5 too much.",

What we have though, is an extremely intelligent character study on an individual who is the definition of corrupt. Whilst mining silver, Daniel Plainview discovers an abundance of oil and rapidly starts his own oil extraction company. Success, money and power skews his moral compass as he slowly becomes one of the most unlikeable movie characters I've ever seen. He would do pretty much anything to maintain his company, much like any extreme tycoon enterpriser. Murder people? Definitely. Charm landowners to only then deceive them the next minute? Yeah, why not. Abandon your own son? Whoa now, a step too far. A subtle darkly comedic undertone surrounds the film, particularly with the theme of faith. Mind you, it becomes clearer during the final act where he repeatedly provokes someone into shouting ""I am a false prophet!!"". Whilst the narrative is savage and depressing, simultaneously the visual imagery is just as relentless. The scene where the oil well is accidentally set alight was a beautiful mess. I was entranced. I don't think prospecting or mining is a career I would want to pursue after watching this...! Daniel Day-Lewis deserved that Oscar, he was phenomenal. Yet another transformative performance. Felt sorry for Paul Dano who was excellent but completely overshadowed by Lewis. The musical score was abrupt yet fitting, really admired it. The film did slow down during the second act where Plainview meets a long lost relative, but picks up again in the third act. This deserves the critical acclaim, and perhaps with future viewings it will get the perfect rating. Cements Daniel Day-Lewis as one of the best actors ever.",

475,16 January 2008,thealtmangoodbye,10," Horrifying, hilarious, brutal and beautiful- a masterpiece.","There Will Be Blood is an absurdist black comedy from Hell. It's a deranged, unhinged masterpiece the likes of which we've never, ever witnessed before. Forget all the Kubrick comparisons- the only thing Kubrickian is the score, and even that is only because of the obvious Penderecki comparisons. Kubrick never got this close, this dirty. Paul Thomas Anderson does not separate himself from these characters; he became these characters in writing it, namely Daniel Plainview, portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis in what has very quickly become my favorite screen performance of all time. This is Robert De Niro in Raging Bull quality we're talking about, and personally, I think he one ups De Niro with this film. I know, I know, heresy...but that's how much I responded to his performance. It seems that Anderson somehow found a ""brother...from another mother.."" in DDL, judging by recent appearances where they all but cuddle in front of the interviewer, and together they have crafted one of the most indelible screen characters of recent years. Daniel Plainview is a monster, no buts about it, but he's a recognizable monster. He's not some abstraction. In Plainview, we can see ourselves, and it frightens us, and that's part of this films brilliance. Plainview acts out upon feelings that we don't even like to admit that we are capable of. He's malicious and deviant, and yet charming and likable. It's scary stuff, and DDL's performance will be studied for years to come for the sheer dedication he gives to the characterization. Forgive me if my thoughts seem rambling, I've seen the film three times now and I'm still trying to process it. It's such an experience. I can't even begin to go on about Paul Dano as the equally despicable Eli Sunday. I'd love to talk about the scenes that play out like high comedy ran through oil and grit. There's a baptism scene that could have come out of a brilliant comedy, and many scenes go into bizarre, unexpected territory that you wouldn't see coming in a million years (an uncomfortably funny encounter in a restaurant comes to mind) The film is at moments heart-wrenching, horrifying, hilarious, brutal, poetic, over the top and brilliantly mad. PTA isn't afraid to let the audience decide how to feel; he's not going to hold your hand, and I think that's the problem a lot of people have with the ending. It's definitely the litmus test for the film- if you dislike the ending, then you obviously haven't been paying attention to the character of Daniel Plainview. If you enjoy the ending, then clearly you've followed the entire ride. My advice to people that hate the ending is the same thing I'd say to the people who hate No Country for Old Men's ending- watch it again, think about the ending throughout the entire film. It's the ONLY way the film can end. I think Roger Ebert put it best in his review ""Only madness can supply a termination for this story."" So, with that, I end my random, barely coherent thoughts on the one true masterpiece of 2007, and really of the last decade. It's already in my top 5 EVER, and you should take my word seriously...because I'm a genius. This is most DEFINITELY not a film for everyone- most I've talked to have either loved it or despised it with a fiery passion equally, and it's most certainly a one of a kind experience, but if you are willing, then you most certainly won't be disappointed. I'm finished.",
476,14 March 2008,JamesHitchcock,9, A Symbol of Heroic Evil,"""There Will Be Blood"" is based on one of the classic themes of the cinema- indeed, one of the classic themes of all drama- the rise and fall of a great man. Perhaps the greatest cinematic treatment of this theme is ""Citizen Kane"", and as in Welles's masterpiece the great man in this film is not a king, statesman or general but a business tycoon, and his ""fall"" involves a decline in his moral character rather than a reversal of his financial fortunes. The title may have been chosen to reflect Shakespeare's ""blood will have blood""- a line from ""Macbeth"", a play about another man who achieves temporal power at a terrible cost to his soul.",
477,12 May 2020,a-65018,8, The truth hurts,"The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been a contender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. But I'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it. Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damned refreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshine Lewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn't gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past...",

Day-Lewis - henceforce referred to as DL is a force unlike anything cinema has ever encountered. His raw unsettling role in this movie has such a threat of unresolved anger through it that you can barely tear your eyes from his. Remember Joe Pesci in Good fellas - well Plainview is all that and more yet he communicates it all with a twitch of the face or the raise of an eyebrow. Although the story is compelling it can drag in places but the wonderful Dl carries the entire film on his shoulders and hurls it back at the audience. A great companion piece to no Country for Old Men - two great modern westerns for the 21st century .Lets hope DL doesn't wait before he finds another skin to inhabit.,

It may be desired and may be hinted at, but there is no conflict played out by the actors in this film. What does this film mean? The oil man and religious never play off each other,they do separate scenes--usually kooky--but they do not relate to each other. Is it about greed? I thought the oil man was a hard worker and smart, and generous in what he offered to town. The religious aspect failed as a serious examination because of the bizarre acting. There was one interesting moment when Lewis brings up the little girl to christen the well and cheats the evangelist of his hoped for moment of fame.",
497,19 January 2010,smcbrides,10, human greed goes as deep as the ocean,"There Will Be Blood might possibly be one of the greatest films ever made. Certainly stands in line with Shawshank,Citizen Kane,and all the other timeless American classics. The story of Daniel Plainview who at first is a silver and gold miner, but discovers oil, and from then on is like he is searching day and night for it. Things escalate when he meets a young man/priest Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, who in my opinion was perfect in this film)who wants him to drill on his fathers land but wants as much money as he can get from Plainview. The tension grows and the film dives very deep into the sanity, hatred, and greed of both Plainview and Sunday. That being said, There Will Be Blood shows all of us how much human greed can control our very lives, and how we can stray away from the most important things to us just to be rich. This film will shake some to the very core, leave others speechless, and others just angry because they think they could never get like this. In all reality though we are all capable of this. Some may say this film didn't make sense, others might think its too long, but to me it is a perfectly made movie with an amazing cast, awe inspiring cinematography, and a musical score that sends shivers up and down the spine, There Will Be Blood is without question my favorite film.",

The sounds and compositions, the elegy of the story and the symbolic nature of the craft of acting and showmanship. Daniel Day Lewis puts on a well deserved oscar performance.

When a film runs long, it is expected to provide quality. ""Blood"" is merely tedious. I almost laughed out loud at the ""I drank your milkshake"" part. The overacting by DD-L is ludicrous and unappealing. I half suspect that the attacks on oilmen (I have no problem with Luddite views if they are justified) and religion (if merited, fine) are the source of much of the raving on behalf of the film. But the silliness of ""Blood"" cannot be overlooked by intelligent viewers. If it is post 1929, why does Eli still seem to be 14? Why does the Sunday family not discuss Paul's absence? Why would a shrewd man like Plainview wait so long to test Henry? What happens to his sidekick (the former Julius Caesar of ""Rome"") whose skills alas are seemingly shunted to the cutting room? Why does HW speak like a person always deaf rather than like a person born hearing? Perhaps an actor who could sign was needed and the adult HW is portrayed by an actor actually deaf? As for the music, terrible. ""No Country For Old Men"" is so superior in its rendition of a nihilistic view of America that the two films ought not even be mentioned in the same breath.",

Daniel Day Lewis, in his Oscar winning role, gives one of the best performances in cinema history as he plays Daniel Plainview, an oilman who is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate any possible competition against him, in-order to attain total control. He employs whatever means necessary, regardless of how vicious it may be, for achieving his goal. He is disgusted by the idea of someone else attaining a similar status as his. He even goes as far as denying the existence of God, inorder to cement his position at the top. Eventhough it results in him being an extremely successful businessman, his deeds eventually destroys him emotionally and psychologically. Day Lewis once again proved that he is one of the most versatile actors ever as he completely disappears in the role, giving us one of the most memorable movie villains ever.",

Magnolia had me convinced long ago that Anderson was a showboating poser, but now I'm going to have to take a second look because this film takes the horror-farce high wire of Punch Drunk Love and runs it through an astonishing Daniel Day-Lewis, with exactly the uptick you'd expect. For two hours it looks like the only thing funny about this literalist travesty of American Dream individualism is going to be his unerring John Huston imitation; but as the third act rounds the bend, the appalling things that Day-Lewis is party to become increasingly tinged with existential ludicrousness. And his predilection for avoiding big, substantive struggles by only picking on the biggest weakling available at any given moment leads abruptly to a climax that is equal parts wrenching, horrifying, jaw-dropping and laugh-out-loud hysterical. I've never seen anything like it, and it makes me question my reactions to everything that came before - it DEMANDS to be watched again. This is what bravura means to me, not raining frogs. You pity the rest of the cast for having to share the screen with Day-Lewis, but somehow everyone manages to keep the sense of ensemble: forget the Oscars - Paul Dano deserves a purple heart!",

It was a little slow, and if you were expecting a big showdown or something you'll be disappointed. It really was well written, and I have to say all of the acting was spot-on. The actor who played Eli did a great job of portraying a very eccentric preacher. And the entire movie had me spell bound as I knew next to nothing about oil drilling except what I've seen in movies like Hellfighters. I had no idea what kind of dangers lie in such a business, and not to mention the madness that ensues from being an ""oil man."" Since I heard it was based on Oil! by Upton Sinclair I knew it was going to be a bit crazy- and after seeing this movie I immediately thought I should read that book. This film is not for the young or those who don't understand strange twisty plots, as at times it gets hard to follow, and although few and far between the violent scenes can get somewhat gruesome.

Magnolia, a cinematic experience like no other, and a bold statement to come from Anderson, Blood is a further honing of his craft, and catapulting him to another level of mastery. Based upon the novel Oil!, Blood has something to say, but this isn’t a very uplifting message. The main foes, Plainview and Sunday, each are not lost souls, they are demonic creatures, crawled out for the black oil that surrounds them. Not so much about the oil boom in the turn of the century California, Capitalism and Religious Zealots are butting heads, each possessing their vessels, yet both are kneeling at the alter of greed. Man’s soul is at risk here, but way of redeeming it is a bigger question.",
507,21 January 2018,aaronlbacks,10, I wish I could grow a mustache like Daniel Day-Lewis in this movie,"There is a fine line between what makes a good movie and what makes a great movie. Was it the vocally mute 20-minute intro sequence (a la 2001: A Space Odyssey) which ended up being just as enthralling and encapsulating as the last climatic 20 minutes? Was it the stunning performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano? Was it the perfectionist-level detail that put the plaque on their teeth and the grime underneath their fingernails? Was it the soul-crushing script on the corruption of wealth, the fool's errand which is salvation, and the abuse of the poor? Who can tell but God (if he's not a superstition), but somewhere amidst the 2.5 hour runtime, There Will Be Blood succeeds at becoming a sure contender at several best-of lists. I suppose a good way to find a more definitive answer would be to imagine if this script were handed to any lesser director and cast and see how their product would compare to P.T. Anderson's masterpiece here. Oh, the religious symbolism is too strong, that child performance wasn't quite convincing enough, this is just old-time Breaking Bad. But in the correct hands, the oil wells stand tall, domineering, and admonishing like crosses, Dillon Freasier's performance was on par with the adults, and having seen this movie now, I think Breaking Bad is just a modern There Will Be Blood. All the gears were well oiled and cranking together and it just so happened to come together so perfectly. The cinematography lent itself to some beautiful shots, symbolic framing, and a personification of the environment almost as if it were a character too. The powerfully and torquey filmmaking kept this film chugging on tracks faster and faster and it stayed interesting over the ballsy length. It found refreshing ways for people to be despicable to one another, which is always nice, and the take on the classic King Midas touch folktale was interesting as well. And it seems to be as relevant today too more than a decade after its release with conglomerate corporations and megachurches running amok. I don't know how to leave it; I can't find any critiques, no matter how minor. This is certainly a film to go down in history and I think its flawless character certainly justifies that.

Such films as Casablanca, The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction come to mind for me, along with There Will Be Blood. There isn't a single false note in this movie. It is paced perfectly, every shot has a purpose and tells the story of an industrial man whose morals (or lack thereof) continue to show (or don't show) for a full 2 and a half hours of madness personified. This film asks questions about the nature of the human being and of the point where wanting something becomes wanting something too much. It forces us to ask ourselves questions that relate to modern society, and for a movie that takes place during the early 20th century California oil boom that is pretty incredible. It asks us these questions while presenting us with one of the most evilly misguided characters in film history. The movie shows the true darkness of Daniel Plainview in a perfectly drawn out film and what caused this darkness to finally rear its ugly head, until yes, there is blood. It is one of the best films ever made. 11/10",

526,12 August 2015,sharky_55,9, What are you looking so miserable about?,"I wish more films would open like There Will Be Blood. Bleak, uncompromising and largely silent apart from the siren assault from Greenwood at the opening fade-in, the rise of Daniel Plainview is slowly and methodically unveiled. He starts as a primitive and solitary figure, propping himself up after an injury, then with a few workers (his family, as he calls them, and indeed one of the orphans becomes a part of his family), and only 15 minutes in do we finally get dialogue. It's a purposeful and seductive opening monologue from Daniel Day Lewis, the kind of rich and sonorous speech that is full of experience and trust and honour, but it doesn't fool the rowdy crowd. Realising they cannot be taken advantage of, he leaves and cannot be convinced to return. Plainview gives a similar, more evocative speech later on as he pitches to the residents of Little Boston, this time overlaid with visuals of a thriving communal effort from his workers and their families. And this one is vastly more successful. It's the strength of the performance that elevates the film into a captivating tale of greed and power. Paul Dano's Eli performs absurd exorcisms of spirits and ghosts, but through his own grand act and conviction, the congregation is enthralled, and so are we. And when Plainview says he is an oilman, we tend to agree. ",
527,8 December 2016,tarikson1,10," It may have no point, but that doesn't make it pointless!","There Will Be Blood is a difficult movie and one that managed to do something that only few movies are able to: it crawled into my head and made me think about it. At first I was trying to understand it before I realized that there was nothing to be understood, only observed. And that is exactly why people complain about it: they say this movie is pointless because it has no deeper meaning, no message and no unexpected twist. If you judge it from that point of view, you are right. However, There Will Be Blood should not be assessed that way. Paul Thomas Anderson is not trying to shove us down some kind of message that we ought to try to understand. He's just giving us the story of a man, who finds oil and consequently becomes wealthy. We, the audience, are supposed to observe and to make up our minds about this on our own. There is nothing subjective to the movie, it simply and merely documents a part of a man's life. By not being subjective or judge-mental, it makes people feel stupid because they think that they didn't get what it was all about even though there is nothing to be understood. And in that way, people are stupid as they believe that everything has to have some kind of message or moral subtext. It forces the audience to dwell on this movie and use their brains but apparently not many people are fond of thinking. There Will Be Blood is avoiding all of that which makes it a great piece of art since it accomplishes to remain compelling through the entire run-time even though there is not much happening and therefore I think people are right if they believe that this movie will be looked upon as a classic in a couple of decades.",

There will be blood is about the fictional Oil prospector Daniel Plainview played to absolute perfection by Daniel Day-Lewis in my personal favorite performance by him. He is truly incredible in this film. There Will Be Blood delves deep into Daniel's psyche as greed and power overcome him throughout the course of the film as he try's to take control of his surroundings as well as those around him as he battles the preacher Eli who is also played to perfection by Paul Dano. Paul Thomas Anderson is a master of his craft creating an intense, gripping and brutal story out of something so mundane as Oil. His direction is magnificent, with a particular moment when things at the oil well go wrong, truly showing the audience his skill as a film maker.

Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed, and he probably should have let someone else work on the screenplay. As other reviewers have noted, parts are actually laughable. Anderson spent so much time introducing different plot possibilities in the first and second acts and detailing the quest for oil that he seems to have forgotten the third act entirely. The relationship between the oilman and his adopted son is never fully developed. We jump from the boy's childhood to his wedding. The relationship between the oilman and the minister bounces back and forth -- which one is the protagonist? Neither possesses qualities worth preserving or emulating. This can't be called the story of a tragic fall, since the oilman starts out bad and only gets worse. The abrupt ending, a murder during a drunken brawl, reflected no particular purpose or resolution and had some members of the audience laughing out loud. If you want to watch the disintegration of a man who is victim of his own greed, ""Citizen Kane"" got it right. This one is not even close.",

I mean this is in the best possible way of course. Paul Thomas Anderson created a masterpiece of a film set in California in the early 1800s. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. The wonderful California background and breathtaking scenes (like an oil rig being in flames right at sunset) make this film project images you will never forget.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays his part perfectly. He is an oil man  who worked hard his whole life trying to become rich. One day he is mining alone in the middle of nowhere and his ladder breaks leaving him crippled and alone. This didn't stop him from grabbing some silver he was lucky enough to find and crawling probably miles for help. He will do whatever it takes to make enough money so he can get away from people. That's his goal in life, to become alone. This dark man isn't the normal hero you find in a movie and it makes it very different and hard to recommend to most people. For those who can appreciate a good film, this is a must see.

As in Jaws, and perhaps even more so in this case, the music creates an atmosphere of suspense that no combination of writing, acting, scenery, costume, makeup, etc. could come close to achieving in its absence. Greenwood's (usually) minimalist post-modern orchestral score sets such a tone from the opening seconds of the film, as we see the early struggles of our antihero, Daniel Day-Lewis's Daniel Plainview. We watch a man driven by an unquenchable greed and hear a swell of strings foreshadowing the decades of suffering that his greed will impose (on himself and on anyone in whom he sees an opportunity for advantage).",

Day-Lewis' interchange with the preacher during the final scene & to a lesser extent during his 'confession' of his sins in the church seemed to me like something out of a bad Monty Python sketch. The man who see's the worst in people and has a rage in him just simmering below the surface always threatening to overflow, lacked the physical presence in him or the cool articulate menace that he brought to his butcher character in G O NY to make me fear him or what he could do. I like to root for Daniel Day-Lewis and the characters he portrays in film, Last of the Moahicans & Crucible come to mind. This character was contemptible in every respect, except his uncompromising, unscrupulous lust for money & power. I guess that was the point, I dunno. From the early scenes he appeared to be a caring family man, I do not fully understand how he came to think so ill of the boy he was raising after the accident deprived him of his hearing.

Using a darker approach for defining the times and for his characters' portrayals, he subjects his audience to reflect on the disastrous effects of capitalism and evangelism on the obsessed. Set in 4 phases of time frame  namely 1898, 1902, 1911 and 1927 - the elemental themes of greed, ambition, power, deceit and betrayal, and in a strange and subtle presentation, of adoptive parenting, flow gradually and solidly through the film to expose the declining morals of the characters visually generated through the superb performances of the cast members.",

Yet in getting his way, and even after getting it, Daniel's dominant character of anger and easily offended get the best out of him all the time. This is not excluding persons dearest and closest to him. Unfortunately the 'all is fair' attitude is also shown by people he comes in contact with, including the townspeople stuck in blind faith and also especially the town's false prophet. I like Daniel Day Lewis's performance. He can really create a great distinction between all his roles. This shows that he is quite a master in the art of getting into character.

This is a movie that if it had a great ending, it might have been one of the best movies of all time, but it falls into mediocrity in the final twenty minutes. I wanted a summary in the end, a round up of the purpose of the greatness that had come before it, something new that had yet to have been revealed, but instead it felt like a reiteration of everything that was already shown, which was that Plainview was an a-hole.

602,10 November 2008,Sergeant_Tibbs,10, It deserves its status as a sure-fire classic to come.,"My opinion of the film has remained consistent since I saw it in the cinema back in February. Despite the somewhat ridiculous context that does put me off often when I think of it, the commanding imagery is so engaging and inspiring that I love it. Even as a big fan of Jesse James I do think it deserved its cinematography win; not above Jesse James but still. I definitely nod Paul Thomas Anderson for his vision. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredibly strong but one note performance of a character, most effectively described as ""angry"". It's an extremely commanding performance, from his hateful rants, his glorified speeches and his painful confessions. The direction does hold on to a lot of moments with Day-Lewis and it's extremely effective, even if it does make the film stretch on with its pacing. Paul Dano gives an underrated performance, yet he completely embodies the role and almost manages to steal the show from Day-Lewis. The end wouldn't have worked as well without him. Thankfully, the screenplay adds comforting black comedy elements when it gets too contrived, almost making a joke of itself and redeeming that flaw just making me feel more engrossed. However, it is a film I struggle to truly feel involved and attached to, mostly because the characters are quite dislikeable. The score is wonderfully entwined with the images with the classical edge making it quite elaborate and almost disturbing of its intentions; however, it's almost unlistenable as a stand alone piece. My personal favourite of the 2007 Best Picture nominees. The film is my third favourite Paul Thomas Anderson film, a director I favour a lot and earns its spot on my top 100. Bravo.",

604,14 June 2011,jordnthoms,9, Well worthy of the hype,"I really enjoyed this movie. The three most valuable aspects of the movie are the music, acting, and story. I am a big fan of Jonny Greenwood and I've read a lot of complaints about the soundtrack to this movie. You shouldn't review a film if your idea of a good movie is Wall-E and you shouldn't open your mouth about music if your idea of good music is 50 Cent. I own the soundtrack to the film and I occasionally listen to it while studying or on the train. There are two or three songs that only belong in a movie, but the rest are excellent and all are fitting for a soundtrack to such an eerie and violent film. I honestly put the soundtrack in the ranks of ""Amelie"". As for the acting, Daniel and Henry Plainview were well played. HW Plainview and Eli Sunday weren't truly very convincing, but it wasn't devastating to the film. I truly felt the need to review this movie because I read reviews by so many people who didn't understand the story or thought the movie had no plot. Of course, like any good movie there isn't a linear plot built as predictably as a tunnel with a light at the end. I think many people didn't like the end because it was unsettling to their worldview. I think the director, whoever he is, was trying to give an accurate portrayal. Perhaps it is because I am an environmentalists but the character of Daniel Plainview is still alive and kicking. I liked the theme or religion throughout because it demonstrates how people will allow others to take advantage of them because their focus is on divinity and eternal life. Daniel Plainview is the man on top. He is easy to hate for no reason, but this movie gives plenty of reasons to hate him. The movie is an accurate representation of the aggregation of power and the path to success, especially in the business of oil.",

607,20 March 2008,siobhandenton,10, A True American Classic,"If you're looking for subtlety then you're not going to find it in P T Anderson's There Will Be Blood; from the grand scale locations to the larger than life characters, Anderson's film feels truly epic. Yet don't take this as a fault of the film, indeed it is the films epic quality that ensures its success. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil, There Will Be Blood tells the story of Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day-Lewis). After Plainview accidentally discovers oil (and its monetary gains), he becomes set on sourcing further oil and thus gaining more wealth. After a tip off in which Plainview is told of oil rich land in California, his greed ultimately leads to a battle of wills between Plainview and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, who also plays the small but pivotal role of Paul Sunday) the young minister of a church, culminating in the almost comic final scene of the film, as Plainview's greed ultimately consumes him. Day-Lewis deservedly won an Academy Award for his performance of a man entirely obsessed by greed, and indeed it is he on who the film rests upon. His performance is startling, utterly embodying the enigmatic character of Plainview. There is a distinct lack of character development, and whilst the audience is shown Plainview at the beginning of his ascent we never truly learn his motives and feelings. However, the lack of information that we have about the character ensures that the audience not only learns all they need to know, but they are kept at a distance from this ultimately lonely figure. In fact there is no dialogue for the first fifteen minutes of the film, in which we watch Plainview mining, working entirely by himself. The cinematography adds to the almost mystical quality of the film, reminiscent of Terence Malick's Days of Heaven, which was shot entirely during magic hour. Ultimately, this is an epic film showcasing the subversion of the American Dream, and deserves to be remembered as a true American Classic.",

614,10 January 2008,fertilecelluloid,9," ""There Will Be Blood"" delivers on its promise and then some","We are promised that ""There Will Blood"" and there is in Paul Thomas Anderson's intense tale of oil man Daniel Plainview's (Daniel Day Lewis) war with the world. Plainview is a man in competition with himself and everybody around him. He drives his competitor's into the ground and makes no concessions to anybody . He is a complex, admirable (at times), fascinating character who possesses more than his fair share of humanity's worst excesses. Anderson pits his surly protagonist against a smart, young fundamentalist Christian who is on to his game but lacks Plainview's sociopathic ambition. The film's main character is the juice, but we're also rewarded with intense sequences involving much pain, lots of blood, and shocking, terribly convincing violence. Scenes featuring mining accidents resulting in injury or death are uncomfortable to behold. ""There Will Be Blood"" has the intensity of ""Taxi Driver"" and that film's riveting focus on one character. It is not a horror film in the narrow sense, but it trades in horror's base elements -- suspense, abnormal psychology, violence, greed, fear and blood. Several dozen pints of it. This is riveting stuff. But what do you expect from Ghoulardi Film Productions?",

The acting by Daniel Day Lewis was fine, the locations were splendid (even if the sound track was irritating and intrusive), but there just isn't anything in Daniel Plainview's character to make him the least bit sympathetic. I have to agree with other reviewers who stated that all the other characters served only to be the recipients of Plainview's tirades. Maybe if we had been given some hint as to why Daniel was so angry and bitter we could have had an understanding, and maybe a bit of empathy. I felt no more for this character at the end of the movie than I had at the beginning. There was certainly enough time for the story to be told in full and characters to have been filled out.

Are they right? Well, lets face it, P.T.A. is one of the most incredible directors of the last 50 years, in my opinion. Considering most of his early films were overlooked, I'm content with how much respect this one has. Because, simply put, it's a masterpiece. An American epic, of the same caliber as Citizen Kane. It's a study on the effects of greed, and how the rise to power can sometimes completely corrupt and demonize the human spirit. Daniel Day Lewis.. it goes without saying, but this is his best performance to date. Paul Dano is also equally amazing, but unfortunately stands in the shadows of DDL. It's also, filmed so masterfully, as if Kubrick rose from the grave. In fact, the whole thing really reminded me of an Orson Wells/Stanley Kubrick hybrid.

I was very interested in seeing it after Daniel Day Lewis' acceptance speech at the Oscars. His joy & pride, and enthusiasm were very inspiring. But the movie lets one down. It seems more a vehicle for his acting than his acting was to tell the story. The overall mood was one of uncertainty, apprehension, pending disaster. Plainview himself is an uneven, uncertain character. What ever his motives the intentions he expressed in setting up the conditions for the oil workers was admirable.

Indeed the interactions between the characters are great and the film is able to convey a lot of emotional tension. And this is because the characters are unpredictable, you know what they want but not completely and often they act in a unexpected way. I was so invested in the meanings of the movie because it doesn't convey all the answers but leaves the viewer with a lot of ""why"" that he has to answer himself. And the most convincinIg thought I had is that the protagonist of this movie is the Nietzsche's ubermensch (the superman) and throughout the film there are a lot of concepts of his philosophy. But nothing could have been possible without Daniel Day-Lewis: he is so great that I can't describe his work with mere words. In this movie (actually, in every movie he's in) he gave an incredible performance and as usual he disappears in his character. The way he moves, his looks, the way he talks, all these things made memorable an already well written character. In conclusion: a great film by Paul Thomas Anderson.",

The film casts Daniel Day-Lewis in the role of Daniel Plainview, an oilman by his own admission and one of the first Americans who initiated the oil drilling industry that would later conquer the whole world. Day-Lewis creates a fascinating character who dominates the screen from the beginning until the end of the movie's runtime with his peculiar accent, quirky expression, and commanding persona. Daniel's antagonist in the movie is Eli, a Christian pastor who cuts a deal with Plainview to start the drilling in his family's land. The two characters will clash in the course of the movie and they will have an unforgettable showdown sequence in the end. Oil serves as a symbol of blood in the movie's universe, hence the title.",

Cinematography is sometimes interesting, sometimes excellent. I found the colors rather dull though. And the 2 1/2 hour runtime is just way too long for a movie where nothing happens.

Paul is a major character, almost the perfect person, who cares about the needs of people and their working conditions. 11. Paul is killed in the end when hit over the head during a union busting riot. 12. Eli, although a charlatan, never renounces his faith. 13. The church of the third revelation was a joke set up by dad, but Eli took it and ran with it. 14. The son does not marry a Watkins.

The son does marry Rachel who is also a socialist and together they found a school for others of like belief. 16. Dad is never baptized. 17. Dad never kills anyone. 18. Dad marries a psychic and dies a few days later setting up a fight over his estate. 19. Dad's partner ends up with most of the money. 20. Dad and son love each other very much.

A lot of people liked it for some reason and these will remain reasons I won't understand, no matter how much praise this production gets. There were so many other great, dark films released this year that embraced each other simultaneously and pulled it off. I get the point of this movie. Evil beats good and money is more powerful than religion. Is that supposed to be a metaphor for the current situation in the U.S.? If so, I get that point.

I don't enjoy seeing a movie about a man who is so very ruthless, stingy, selfish, and a real fathead with no personality good or bad. It lacked all types of character motivation; Dans performance was totally over the top. There was no love interest in this film; I presume he wasn't gay (no guy would go near him) and he had no girlfriend or wife. As for being a modern day 'Citizen Kane', let's get real.

But you learn nothing about the character. Although the film is very long, the interesting things are left out. Especially the last third of the movie is very boring. Important events like the marriage are shown very shortly instead we see Day-Lewis being drunk on the floor for endless minutes. Daniel Day-Lewis is very pretentiously acting.

Then I was just starting to become obsessed with film and didn't have a lot of knowledge on classic film and film in general. Now I have an identity in what I like and what I want to do as a director and I know what I like and what I don't like in pacing, staging, scenery, acting, & directing in general. If you just watch this film you might see something in an only evil mood or a beautiful and powerful movie, but not know exactly why. A lot of people I know criticize the film for lacking humanity, but that is just not the case. Some people who love the film compare it to Citizen Kane and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, two of my favorites, but that's not the case either.

I've seen it again since and feel more drawn on and into this poetic, and ambiguous work. I am amazed by the power the film has been able to exert on me. I'm amazed in the same sense The Shining drew me into the mystery of the characters and settings of that film. Instead of being led through the halls of a haunted hotel or the literal hedge maze, in There Will Be Blood I'm led down into the Earth where silver, gold, oil, and Hell exist and I am a-mazed. There are many images in There Will Be Blood of fire and damnation and of the Devil himself in the characters of Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday. Both know the Devil well. All of the acting is top-notch but Daniel Day-Lewis creates not so much a man as he does an elemental force of nature, a force that can and will destroy even those he deeply cares about, his own family",

As a born again Christian I find much religious bigotry and religious condemnation from the religious leaders who are more like the Pharasiees and Scribes of Jesus's time than followers of Christ. Bizarre behavior not explained like the main character promises to ""cut his throat"" while asleep for making a possible offensive comment about him and his son's relationship. Paranoid characters. The whole cast comes off as self-serving and quite barbaric. Another bizarre showing of fundamentalist/pentacostal religious services. Not much spirituality and bible knowledge in context but plenty of showmanship; something Christ did NOT ever display. I do not like pentacostal/charamasatic churches because 90% is showmanship and little is REALLY of God. Also no such thing as modern day prophet(at least I never have seen or met a REAL one). Never seen a real one. Anyone can shoot their mouth off and claim they are a prophet but lets see some examples. Then we find no power of God their just human boasting. Jesus said ""You will know my disciples by their love for one another"" No disciples of Jesus in this movie I see. Perhaps they are Christian because they were born again but if one defines a disciple as a close follower/student of Jesus then no one in this film loved anyone and therefore not disciples.

644,16 January 2008,filmfan92,9," Trouble, Toil and Oil","Whether ""There Will Be Blood"" is any good to you at all depends on whether or not you enjoy watching greedy people mastermind the undoing of other greedy people. Think of 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead', but with an extra glaze of acid laid on thick. The movie is hard to watch, and its emotional high points are moments of unbearable tension, slimy avarice, and nervous, squirming laughter. If this is the kind of thing you enjoy (I admit I do), than be all means, this is your movie. This one will also appeal to even the most casual fan of Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives a performance so earth-shaking that it renders all possible adjectives limp. As oilman Daniel Planview, Lewis creates not a man but a creature with human flaws-here is a thing that sees every facet of life in terms of what he stands to gain. It's alternately fascinating and horrifying to watch an ensemble of money-grubbers fight amongst themselves to earn the favor of Plainview, who is in turn ardently working to repel them along with the rest of humanity. In the finale, when Plainview decides to throw aside the inconveniences of law and religion to fight his battle for self-absorbed isolation, Lewis elevates a series of already good scenes to classic status. This is also your cup of tea of you like to pick apart and argue about your film fare. For example: if Plainview is working so hard to cast off the personal experience and stock up on materialism, then why do we have a scene in which Plainview shoots a stack of his recent purchases? Are even material things a burden to him? What is his definition of freedom? What is any man's definition of freedom? See! Great discussion movie. The Wrap Up: This one is for fans of: Feel-bad cinema, Daniel-Day Lewis, discussion movies This one is not for: Fans of uplift and sentimentality, impatient filmgoers, squeamish audiences. I thought: While the film sometimes sags into its own whacko zone, and the fat needed some trimming in places, this is the kind of bold, volcanic film that defines the word ""originality"".

Just as The Master was a thoroughly involving character piece with a sado-masochistic drive, so too is There Will Be Blood, but with a stronger, more apparent narrative-drive that burns us up with more velocity, that leaves us immediately knowing we've been hit. Perhaps that's why people preferred this to The Master. That isn't to say this is less-subtle though. This is Anderson being Kubrickian in his cinematic ventures, letting the film unfold meticulously whilst planting seeds in your mind - seeds that don't grow with the film feeding them, but with you puzzling over them.

The film follows the rise to power for charismatic and ruthless oil prospector Daniel Plainview (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Daniel Day-Lewis), driven to succeed by intense hatred of others and a psychological need to see competitors fail. Daniel is told by Paul Sunday (BAFTA nominated Paul Dano) that he lives on land where oil-rich land in Little Boston, California, so he goes to investigate, and quickly buys property by manipulating people, and sets up a well. He uses adopted son H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier) to project the image he is a family man, promising to build schools and make the community flourish. There is the point when H.W. is deafened by a oil eruption, and Daniel just gets him to see a teacher and translator, quickly solving the problem, and also showing his lack of care for anyone but himself. Greed becomes more apparent, and Daniel builds tension towards preacher Eli Sunday (also Dano), and years later, an older H.W. (Russell Harvard) has been alienated, and the film ends with Daniel's big outburst, murdering Eli. Also starring Kevin J. O'Connor as Henry, Ciarán Hinds as Fletcher, Sydney McCallister as Young Mary Sunday, David Warshofsky as H.M. Tilford, Colton Woodward as William Bandy and Colleen Foy as Adult Mary Sunday. I will be honest, for a film being two and a half hours long, I preferred the first hour to the rest, after it goes a little less interesting (well, apart from the ending), this is why I have taken away a star from the rating. Never-the-less, a brilliant story with a compelling Oscar worthy performance from Day-Lewis, with great direction by Anderson, and some good moments to catch your eye, definitely one to see. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Editing, BestSound Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated BAFTA Film Award Best Cinematography, Best Music for Jonny Greenwood, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor.

It certainly wasn't something that I haven't seen before, it was just set in a different context. To sum the whole movie up in just a few words would be to say. It involves a lot of oil found under a small town of poor, Christian believers. Where there is oil there is money, and where there is money there is greed. It also involves the relationship between a man and his son after a catastrophic event occurs. It certainly gives us an idea on how the oil business was ran in the early 1900's. This movie is sort of an analogy on how the world is being maintained today. Oil is a high commodity, and banks and oil companies are taking advantage of the situation.

Plot holes galore, melodramatic music, over stylised. Lets just start with the Daniel Day Lewis character, Daniel Plainview. In every film there is a protagonist that we go on a journey with (if you don't agree with this then stop reading) the protagonist must have have some redeeming quality and we the audience go with him or her. The protagonist does not have to be a hero, see (Kevin Bacon in ""The Woodsman for very grim example or Eric Bana in ""Chopper"" for a charismatic anti hero)"" We go with Daniel Plainview on a nihilistic capitalist spree driven by greed. That's fair enough. I like unpopular people, I am one. However, the film relentlessly shows us how awful Daniel Plainass is.

His films were unique in their style and scope even though Anderson didn't even try to hide his cinematic references; he openly discussed influences from Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese, and these influences were more than prominent in his films, especially his two oeuvres, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both of whom characterized with an ensnaring sense of visual style with dizzying, ever-flowing camera-work and featuring broad, multi-character palettes. Punch-Drunk Love was a deviation from his previous films in that its scope was notably smaller, but Anderson's visual style and ""indie"" film quirkiness were prominently front-and-center. It seems that the 4-year break since his last film have changed the director, who returns in There Will Be Blood with what is his most mature, epic and self-fulfilling work to date. Stripping himself of his Altman and Scorsese influences, this time around Anderson provides us not with a sprawling mesh of multiple characters or quirky dramas, but rather a singular, monolith character study perhaps most easily comparable to Citizen Kane; There Will Be Blood is, first and foremost, an utterly full and complete dissection of its main character, Daniel Plainview.",

The stark opening sequence, coupled with the remarkable music, generated a level of tension that became electric, and never really let up. As a study of a certain kind of human nature, and certain all too human characteristics, it would be hard to conceive of a more potent blend of components: writing, cinematography, and--above all--virtuosic acting. While the cast as a whole was wonderfully effective, the work of Daniel Day-Lewis simply towers over anything I've seen on any screen for quite some time. I like to think I have a large store of descriptive language at my disposal but, i this instance, I feel somewhat stumped: volcanic (in places), nuanced (where nuance is needed), and always showing great care in the choices made, Day-Lewis, who is seldom off-screen, simply overwhelmed me. (HERE COMES A SPOILER) The final climactic sequence, coming at a point when it didn't seem that DDL could possibly have anything in reserve, was both hypnotic and horrifying. Happily, while I had felt that DDL simply blew Leonardo DiCaprio away in Gangs of New York, in this film he was superbly supported by everyone. Yes it was not fast-paced, but what of that? It was relentless and infinitely absorbing. It deserves at east a couple of Oscars if these awards have any significance at all--and this in a year when there was some very fine competition. I expect that this is a film that will stand among the very best of the coming decade. I look forward to seeing it again once I've had a chance to catch my breath.

The film for me was one of those products you would see in one of those obscure film houses where a small group of wannabe artists and critics convince themselves of the value of the film. Having seen Day-Lewis in a number of films now, I must admit I wonder why people admire him and his performances.

Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing and truly awesome. I cannot think of another actor who could have done this role in quite this way. As usual he inhabits the character so that immediately one forgets the actor and becomes immersed in the man and his being. In a voice and cadence reminiscent of, if not an outright imitation of, John Huston's, Lewis's presence expands on screen into a Dickensian/Shakespearean grand guignol for the ages. Lewis specializes in recreating these humans who are forces of nature; unstoppable, unrepentant, builders and destroyers, and ultimately the seed that sprouted into America, like it or not.",

In a harsh landscape, people scrabbled to make a living and if you had an iota of business acumen and the penchant to use others for your own gain, you went far. (This is how I understood the storyline!) Daniel Day Lewis is scarily good in the main role, veering between showy salesman and brutal taskmaster, he delivers one of the scariest characters seen on screen recently. Paul Dano, in his preacher role, matches Day-Lewis scene for scene, which is surprising for one so young. I'm inclined to say that Mr Dano was robbed of an Oscar nom.

O'Connor, Ciaran Hinds: Powerful and provocative period film set in early 1900's. Daniel Day-Lewis plays a hard working oil driller who raises his son to take over after him. When summoned to a small community by a young preacher he sets forth preparing for an oil drill. Complications arise when his son loses his hearing during a freak accident. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson whose vision of the Christian evangelism may offend despite its somewhat honest viewpoint. This continues Anderson's fantastic directional career, which includes Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love. Powerful performance by Day-Lewis who portrays a hard working man hindered by brokenness and disappointment. Paul Dano is effective as a wayward preacher whom attempts to persuade Lewis to join his Church but ultimately forced into a blunt revelation in the conclusion. Lewis's son is first played by Dillon Freasier whose dedication is hindered by his eventual handicap. He will marry and part ways with his ruthless father. Kevin J.

In my humble opinion there was not a better made, acted, written, or scored movie from 00' to 09'. I was stunned when No Country for Old Men beat this movie as best picture. The movie is slow, but the story requires a pace of that nature. If Paul Thomas Anderson did not show the viewers the paintstakingly, slow, struggles it took for an independent oil man making his way in the blossoming world of ""big oil"" than this movie would have never worked. That, coupled with quite possibly one of the best acting performances of all-time by Daniel Day Lewis, and you have, again, the best movie of the decade. Lewis scored with this film not only because he nailed the determined, driven, and often-times, nasty character of Daniel Plainview, but in the scenes where there was no dialouge, his expressions, gestures, and physical acting took over. The score, by Jonny Greenwood (who was snubbed an Oscar nomination because of ridiculous Academy rules), works on every level in every scene. Without it, this movie may not have had half the emotion it did. P.T. Anderson is the best American director out there, I have LOVED every film of his, and may be biased as a result of my appreciation of his style.

I thought first of Black Snake Moan, released in late 2006, because of the intensity of the acting. Where Samuel Jackson in Black Snake Moan is powerful and impressive, Daniel Day-Lewis is entirely overwhelming. His work is on a par with the best of Lawrence Olivier and Marlon Brando. In his role as an ambitious American oil man of the early twentieth century, the British theatrical acting tradition meets American method acting with breathtaking results.",

For those who haven't seen Paul Thomas Anderson's latest Herculean effort, I won't spoil things by giving away details, but suffice it to say that it's as if Anderson suddenly realized he forgot to finish the screenplay, so he wrapped it all up with a little set piece featuring scenery chewing actors, gallons of booze, and a bowling pin.

730,3 March 2008,TheEmulator23,9, Brilliant if not a little overly long.,"I loved this movie except for a few very minuscule things. First of all Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is probably the most deserved Oscar that has been won by anyone from the past decade. (except maybe for Scorcese winning finally for best director last year for ""The Departed."") My only real complaint was that there were some scenes that were either too long or completely unnecessary. I went and saw this with my 16 year old cousin and he was not only not impressed he was very bored. I don't think I would have liked this having been that age 14 years ago either. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that likes crappy movies like ""Fools Gold"" or the god-awful movies that Martin Lawerence, Eddie Murphy and even the used to be funny Steve Martin movies those men are making now. So if you like movies that don't make you think...at all, or you have to have instant gratification with the movies you see, don't bother because you won't like it. However if you like a movie that has interesting characters, fantastic music, great cinematography, and an almost perfect screenplay then please rush to a theater to see this now! This isn't really one of those movies that you might want to see over and over but it is one of those you should at least see once. Besides the way the last 15-20 minutes plays out, sitting through the first 2 plus hours is worth all the wait.",

732,8 January 2008,nirvana6604,10, Why is it so hard for people to really understand?,"As a film connoisseur i enjoy films ranging from emotionally challenging to something you don't have to think about. Now I saw There will be Blood Twice, because i felt i missed certain things the first go around. I was correct, some of the shots are the most visually pleasing in years. The acting which is of the highest caliber, the highest,is also smart and engaging. What Paul Thomas Anderson is trying to show us here is that everyone is fundamentally a bastard and even his bible references were as amazing as they have ever been, Eli's father being named Able and the way it's played out is reminiscent of Cane and Abel from the bible, and having the number 612 on almost every train, which is a psalm in the bible about a wolf in sheep's clothing. The direction in this movie is near flawless, and the soundtrack done wonderfully by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood is flawless. If people want to say Paul Thomas Anderson is a hack let them, but he's made a career out of great film, he's on the level of Scorsese and Wes Anderson and far surpasses Altman because i know people love Altman over Anderson. The fact is the man made the best movie of the year, and it's arguably the best movie of this decade so far, and before you judge it read the book, READ THE BOOK.",
733,9 April 2014,neeraj31071991,10, Good solid acting along with an incredible story. A Masterpiece.,"Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson have created one of the greatest movies of this time and perhaps of all time. There is so much ambition, brilliance, detail, and probably everything that you would put in a great movie. I don't think that anything, and anything could top this level of amazement for me. The film has put me through a cathartic and dogmatic experience by just watching. Truly outstanding on every level. A masterpiece One of the great things about this film is that it cannot be put in a specific genre, or cannot even be pinned down to what 3-4-5 different genres got mixed into the end result, because this film simply defies that question. It's too universal, complex, and humane to be categorized easily. It's not even an art film or a western exactly. It echoes classic Hollywood, but it's way more ambivalent and ambigous than that. It's definitely a highly artistic piece of periodic cinema from an American auteur in the age of postmodernism. I cannot define it much further.. I love the music throughout the film. It defines the energy. Just a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. DDL morphs the character so well I can almost feel the aches and pains from years of hard work and injury.",
734,3 January 2009,blackburnj-1,8, Impressive but unsatisfying,"Paul Thomas Anderson's epic about oil and one man's struggle for riches and power has been greeted as a modern classic. Featuring an astonishing performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, numerous memorable sequences, magnificent photography and an incredible, iconic score, one can see that all of the ingredients are there. So, why is it that, having seen the film three times, it still doesn't seem to be a great film? The first viewing was bewildering. It was obvious that this is a hugely impressive film and one which should be seen. Day-Lewis is spectacular as Daniel Plainview and thoroughly deserved his second Oscar. Added to that, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson uses his epic canvas to full effect with stunning visuals. The film is too long, but quite engrossing and always seems to be able to draw out another fantastic sequence to keep your attention.

The deaf kid burns the cabin down and that is the last we hear of that. No punishment, rebuilding.....nothing. Acting involves using yourself and a script to tell a story. In this case, half the movie is shots of the lead character walking around, either doing nothing, or doing the same thing over and over. When he is doing something, there is no explanation by the characters, or the filmmaker as to what is going on. From what I can gather, he spends his days and nights walking around, banging stakes in the ground, and slapping and threatening people for little or no reason. To sum up, read my first sentence.",

Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil, the film attempts to show how the individual's drive for success fueled the growth of a nation and also contributed to a national zeitgeist that says anything is available for a price, either money or blood. With an indirect reference to today's quest for domination of oil markets abroad and Godly materialism at home, Anderson is on target with his message but the film lacks convincing three-dimensional characters, a story that reflects the chiaroscuro of life with its ups and downs, its joy and pain, and any feeling for the world's beauty.",

This film was absolutely pointless and like DDL's poor interpretation of a drunkard, I really needed, like him, a drink to try to put everything into sync. Too bad the liquor did not work for me. DDL's acting: Legend has it that DDL's acting techniques are legendary because he immerses himself into the role months before shooting begins and then takes months after shooting has stopped to get back to normal. Well I could swear if I closed my eyes and every time he opened his mouth to say something, I thought it was John Huston talking. Wow, this is great acting indeed, a ventriloquist interpreting John Huston....I will not go into details here like those folks that thought this movie was better than slice bread but I will say this, the movie was not a movie but really a bad dream and I'm glad I've awaken to find out it was only a bad dream....let's all hope there are no nightmares to come.",

But really he loves his son, and is proud of him.
