0,6 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," Last, butchered, unappreciated, work from one of the greatest...","... Directors of all time. Let's start with a story. Many years ago, when your grandfather was still a boy, a failed, beaten-down actor named Clint Eastwood packed up his horse and saddle (speaking metaphorically here), left Hollywood forever (or so he thought) and headed out to Europe to pick up cash wherever he could. He ended up doing a film in Italy for an almost-unknown director named Sergio Leone and an almost-unknown sound guy named Ennio Morricone. The film was (as history would later record) an ""Italian Western,"" that is, as the iconic western drama was all but disappearing in the US, it was being ""re-imagined"" by Italian writers and directors, and then filmed in Italy, using mainly Italian actors. On the set, Eastwood spoke in English and everyone else spoke in Italian. (Dubbing later fixed all that). Filming now over, Eastwood took his cash and left. Weeks later, in a bar in another part of Europe, he overheard mention that a certain film was the leading box office attraction on the continent. The name sounded familiar but, frankly, during production, a final name for the film he'd just done had not even been selected. He investigated. Yes, this was the film he had just completed, now titled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The rest is history. Sort of. Two sequels were done with Eastwood playing the same character. Monster hits.",/

In the bar of an old friend, loyal and foolish, he slowly asked him: ""How have you lived in these 35 years?"" Quietly answered: ""I just go to bed every morning."" It's hard to say a word, full of vicissitudes. His temples were covered with white hair. He was no longer a gangster on the street, and he was no longer a gangster in the sky. He was just a calm, stumbling old man. He had nothing but memories ...",e

4,19 October 2003,Quinoa1984,10," A sprawling, deliberately paced, and generally a superbly crafted piece of work","It's been said that when one watches a ""spaghetti"" western (one of the ""Man with no name"" films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good.

6,23 October 2011,murtaza_mma,10, A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Leone's magnum opus and a testament to the free spirit of Art,"In order to cater to their everlasting lust for making money, the movie production studios have always endorsed the motto of quid pro quo – ""A favor in return of another"". Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur—by the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty—has had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality.

7,26 November 2005,ccthemovieman-1,8," Leone's ""Godfather"" Version, And About As Good","This Godfather-type film was done by Sergio Leone, of spaghetti-western fame, so you know you will see and experience several of his trademarks. Namely: (1) a lot of facial closeups; (2) some slow-motion or slow-moving dramatic scenes; (3) good overall photography and (4) a unique soundtrack.",/
8,8 May 2019,PCT1970,8, Leone Doing What He Does Best,"Leone helms a virtuous epic film in the crime / drama genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, editing, cinematography, score and acting. There are many famous artists involved in this film and they deliver superlative and realistic performances. De Niro and Woods in particular are superb. The plot revolves around a former gangster, Noodles, who returns to New York after disappearing four decades earlier to start a new life and for other reasons. The plot initially hints as to why Noodles left New York, but after his return we learn the entire story as seen through his own flashbacks. We see Noodles and his friends growing up in a Jewish slum in New York's Lower East Side. Noodles, a natural leader, rises to bootlegger and ultimately a Mafia boss. This does not come without violence, betrayal and remorse. The film does a magnificent job examining all of the characters and what makes them tick. The plot is gripping, intense, violent, gritty, bloody, duplicitous and has a cathartic ending. This is a sprawling story and thus turns into a lengthy and entertaining film which Leone is known for to begin with. It is a masterful work of art, memorable, timeless and a classic. This film takes a different path, as far as the storyline, than most traditional gangster films which is refreshing. This viewer has revisited this film many times and in my opinion it is bravura in it's genre and holds it's own with the other celebrated gangster / mob films.",r

It is amazing, a true milestone in the crime drama genre. The cinematography, images, scenery and locations are all superb and quite sweeping, while Ennio Morricone's score ranks up there with his very best. While the film clocks in at nearly four hours long, it never feels boring to me while the pace is quite elegiac everything else just compels you. I will admit, this is another film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it.",5
12,12 April 2011,mark-whait,10, Leone classic will live on for decades,"Master of the Western Sergio Leone swapped Clint Eastwood for Robert DeNiro, Cowboys for Gangsters and the Wild West for an even wilder New York, with this seminal masterpiece. It was Leone's last film before his tragically early death at just 60, and although he was working on a big budget World War II film at the time of his demise, in a way that is tragically fitting as no film could have topped this one. Of course, whilst Leone naturally made his name in the sixties with the infamous Spaghetti western, the sheer sprawling grandeur of OUATIA is an unforgettable experience that attacks the senses. From the opening image of Robert DeNiro's opium filled body to the final scene some 229 minutes later, the sensation carries on throughout and hits home more powerfully than any cheroot-chewing Clint or twanging Morricone soundtrack ever did. DeNiro plays 'Noodles', a young man who grew up with his compatriots in Prohibition America, who then returns to his old haunts three decades later to reflect on his life as a hard-bitten gangster. Every scene is pitch perfect, and whilst there are some caps doffed to the likes of The Godfather, Leone doesn't hold back with scenes of rape, murder and brutality that give the film an edge sharper than a month's worth of Eastwood stubble. It's amazing in that Leone was returning to the helm of a movie for the first time in over a decade - there is no let up in the brilliance and certainly no signs of rustiness. And legendary collaborator Morricone is also back in tandem. Morricone delivers one of his most mesmerising scores and it was reported that DeNiro demanded some music be pre-written for scenes and then played back whilst they were being shot just so he could pitch the mood of his character. It's hard to say that this is Morricone's best work because his career is generously decorated with brilliant soundtracks, but it's also the case that 'Deborah's Theme', for example, is even played at funerals these days, such is the power of the music. Even Lennon and McCartney's 'Yesterday' gets an airing. James Woods and Elizabeth McGovern provide faultless support from the cast, but this is a movie of colossal brilliance and will rightfully live on for many decades to come.",0

14,6 December 2015,BA_Harrison,9, Leone's gangster masterpiece.,"Director Sergio Leone is best known for his classic spaghetti westerns, but for my money, his final movie, gangster epic Once Upon A Time In America, is his most accomplished work. With a running time of 229 minutes (more if you're watching the Extended Director's Cut), it's longer than either Once Upon A Time in the West or The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and it's pacing is just as measured (some might say 'slow'), but the time passes far less painfully, so engaging are the characters and the drama that unfolds.",5

At Cannes people yelled and screamed, couldn't believe just how good it was. The profound atrocity was a combination of two completely brainless acts, the first being Zack Stienberg's hatchet job for US release, supposedly requested by either Warner Bros or The Ladd Company (one blames the other now) and the second was the lack of anyone (and everyone)to post anything in this great film for Academy Award consideration, of which probably as many as 14 nominations and 4 sure- fire Oscars went down the toilet.

20,16 August 2019,thetyvonlesure,8, A Mob Movie Art Piece,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (3 hour and 49 minute version) is a beautifully paced art piece. The film jumps between time periods, masterfully blending three different zeitgeists. The detail placed in this film is brilliant. The story takes its' time to get where it needed to be. While the film is long, it feels as if there's more than one movie within this film. Leone makes the film feel like a trilogy or bilogy of sorts, when he tells different stories from multiple eras. The set/environments of the film are very stylish. The set and environment expand and become more vibrant with the story overtime. Leone successfully transitions us from a period of immigrants in New York in the early 1900s, to the prohibition era, to a more modern period. The film tells a different story of America for a specific group. As these characters grow, so does the country and its' conflict. The characters within this film are very relatable, in the sense that their lives represent our elevation or descent into our later years. Despite their deplorable actions, the characters are all charismatic and engaging. The dialogue between characters is natural. The acting in this film is great. The younger cast and their older counterparts transition these characters in a cohesive manner. It's as if you're actually watching the younger cast grow into their older selves. Robert De Niro and James Woods do a fantastic job in their roles. Their acting is phenomenal. The cinematography is great, with shots that feel as if they were ripped from a Picasso painting or a Michelangelo sculpture. The shots in this film are masterful, with few exceptions. The storytelling keeps you engaged for the most part. The only exception is after the intermission. After the intermission, the film feels a little boring and fruitless at times. It could have been done in a manner of ease, however it feels crammed in with the rest of the film. The film is very long (depending on what version you watch). However, it's a great film. Overall, Once Upon a Time in America is a classic mob movie that encompasses an artistic vision with timeless storytelling.",e

But, the picturization of this simple thing has been done in an incredibly beautiful manner. What comes out pretty clearly as the movie unfolds is, at the end of the day, what matters is the people you love and who love you. Somewhere down the line, people undervalue the treasure of love and friendship but in actuality when one is standing at the dusk of life, everything seems small in front of a true friend and the innocent and happy time spent together. Other than that, the actors have been marvellous. They are so effortless in their acts that it seems that you're witnessing the actual characters going through everything..

31,21 November 2009,Nighthawk1,10, An impressive achievement and a work of cinematic genius,"Serves as a perfect example of how adept and proficient Sergio Leone was as a director. I thought this movie would be more like a sweeping epic gangster movie similar to The Godfather. In a way it is, but more often than not it isn't. The two movies frequently contrast and differ with each other. I'm not sure if it's even fair to compare the two because the two films are aiming to accomplish different agendas and both follow distinct paths. The ambiguity and various forms of symbolism presented throughout the film will likely leave people scratching their heads in a state of confusion. I don't think Leone ever meant the film to be cut and dry in any obvious way. He really wanted the viewer to come to their own conclusions as to what has taken place by the conclusion of the film. Leone wanted the audience to think deeply about it. This is truly a thought provoking. Once Upon a Time in America is intelligent, has an intricate narrative, a multiple-layered plot and is profound. The movie is without a doubt an impressive achievement and a work of cinematic genius.",

Trust the tale' urged DH Lawrence of American literature, and it is a maxim we would do well to heed in watching any film by Sergio Leone, but in particular this, ostensibly his most realistic and straightforward.  None of his films have packed the given period with so much signifying detail - the gorgeous sepia-toned 1921 sequence, with its Jewish shops and inhabitants, horses and carts, cakes, clothes, the pervading brown, the corrupt cops, the sexual fumblings; the Prohibition years, the sharp suits, the mixture of bonhomie and surgical violence, the disused harbours and warehouses with fading signs, the speakeasies and opium dens, the vast art-deco restaurants.  Only the 60s sequence feels undersketched, a handful of stray signs - muzak Beatles, acoustic-strumming hippies, corruption-exposing TV - pointing to the era.  This, I think, is very deliberate.",

Sergio Leone's violent, visual, masterpiece of turn of the century Jewish boys from New York growing into a life of crime has a different effect on all those who have viewed it in its various forms. I, personally have never seen the shortened version so I can not comment on it. There isn't anything in this film that isn't worth the four hour running time.

They shared their fortunes (which they earned by making some crime in the under world), their loves and their lives. When they grew to men, they shared a dream, a dream to skip poverty, which was their world, and rise to power. But they don't realize that it will cost them their friendship - that it will be built on greed, violence and betrayal for making the dream come true. Finally, their dream would end as a mystery that refuse to die. Except from De Niro, James Woods is making his maybe best role of Max, who becomes the leader of the gang of which De Niro is a member.

The themes, love, friendship, betrayal, morality, memory, life, etc... are so poignant and universal that it is hard not to relate to the characters and situations in this film at least in some way. All the performances are exceptional, James Woods being the highlight in my opinion. I have watched this film three times now, and I plan on re-visiting it even more in the future, as I now own the DVD. To describe this film it is hard to know where to start, as the story is told almost completely out of chronological order; it is a film which literally requires you to watch it more than once. Basically, it is a film about the life of a man, played by Robert De Niro, from his boyhood, right through to his old age, and about the friends and enemies he makes, and all the major issues he encounters. But more specifically, it is about his relationship with one main friend, the adult part of whom is played by James Woods.

44,30 September 2006,ignatz928,10, Leone's masterpiece,"As with all of Leone's films, America displays a fastidious concern with detail in its sets, costumes, and props. Leone's concern, however, is not with strict historical realism, but rather with creating a sort of heightened reality. Though his movie is a gangster story that takes place in small-scale or squalid places like opium dens, tenement buildings, and crowded delicatessens, production designer Carlo Simi gives everything a touch of opulence, a larger than life quality. And I mean ""larger than life"" quite literally- as has often been said about Leone's work, America's sets, while often evocative and convincing in their individual details, as a whole are grandiosely overscaled, so that the interior of a kosher delicatessen on the Lower East Side appears as large as a train station, and an opium den supposedly hidden in the back room of a Chinese puppet theater (with, according to Leone biographer Christopher Frayling, Indonesian puppets performing an Indian epic) has people on cots stretching up the ceiling. The epic quality of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West lay more in their style and physical scale than in the movies' actual stories, which are rather slight. Leone placed his characters against the background of vast historical movements and events, but he didn't focus on the powerful people causing or at least marshaling these events. On the contrary, much of the larger than life quality of his heroes and villains came from how they seemed to exist outside of society and normal human concerns, like, as writer Danny Peary pointed out, a more-than-human race of warriors doomed by the advent of civilization. Gangsters, of course, don't stand outside of society so much as they infiltrate it and corrupt it, and Leone adopts to this difference with a comparatively restrained style, particularly for his actors. Still, little remnants of his spaghetti westerns remain in his interpretation of mobsters. One important difference from The Godfather is that Leone's gangsters are not bosses- they do their own dirty work, whether it be smuggling, union racketeering, or murder. They're still outlaws more than figures of authority, and the main source of contention between Noodles and Max is the latter's decision to hire the gang out to ""the Syndicate,"" as represented by Joe Pesci's mob powerbroker. In interviews on the film Leone spoke of the Prohibition era as the second great era of frontier lawlessness in America, which makes no sense from a historical point of view but works beautifully from a pop culture perspective, which of course is the point. Leone puts an almost touching faith here in the viability of genre as a means through which to filter his epic vision of twentieth century America. The childhood scenes are like a wicked, R-rated version of Our Gang, with the pint-sized crooks exhibiting a strange innocence, displayed most memorably in the famous cream pie scene. But already this innocence has begun to curdle into amorality, into an unthinking amorality and disregard for others. Leone sympathetically and amusedly dwells on their battles with the buffoonish, corrupt neighborhood cop, known as ""Fart-face."" These scenes have a particularly Our Gang-like quality to them, depicting clever and precocious outwitting stupid and cruel adults. The first of the gang's exploits that we see, however, consists of them burning down them the news-stand of a man who has refused to pay protection money to the local boss. The kids watch excitedly through a grille as flames devour a man's livelihood before his eyes as if they were watching a show put on for their own amusement. All throughout the film, we see people watching other people at a remove, particularly men watching women. Noodle is the ultimate spectator, often silent, constantly watching others, desiring women he can't have, observing events he can't control, seemingly vanishing for extended periods of time (first for eight years, then for thirty-five,) to reappear in an America that has gone on without him, among people who have gone on without him. At least 2/3 of the film, and possibly the whole film, occur in his head, in flashbacks to his past, so Noodles can watch his own life unfolding like strips of film in a projector. Early on, we see patrons watching an Indonesian shadow-play in the theater that fronts for the opium den where Noodles hides from the world. The silent audience outside and the stoned customers within taken together are like a Janus-faced portrait of a movie watcher, subsuming their daily lives in the play of shadow and light on a screen in a state close to dreaming, or drug-induced hallucination, or even death.",

My head was blown off, not by huge special effects or big explosions, there's nothing of that in the movie, but from an amazing story, beautifully told, and lots of detail. You really need to turn off from the world to see this masterpiece. It has great acting, great plot, awesome music, long silent scenes where music is the only story teller.

48,3 March 2007,mjg32,10, Up there with the best,"Sergio Leone's last film was also his best, with this epic life story of two best friends who work together as gangsters. Whether it is a real life story, or simply Noodles' drug-induced dreams is never resolved, but this and the film's non-chronological order add to its effectiveness. The usual brilliant camera-work of Leone's films, and the wonderful musical score by Ennio Morricone are a wonderful accompaniment to the strong violence and character's emotions. The story takes you through all the emotions, but ultimately leaves you feeling happy that you have viewed such a masterpiece. The acting of not just De Niro and James Woods, but all the characters, young and old, is superb and at no point does the storyline become overlong or boring. At 220 minutes, it takes some watching, but believe me it is well worth it. This is one of the best ever gangster films, a true masterpiece from one of the world's greatest directors, and was a perfect sign off for Leone.",

52,20 June 2006,mentalcritic,10, Leone turned down The Godfather to make this. It was the right decision.,"Don't get me wrong, I love The Godfather and all, but the story does not suit Sergio Leone's unique and distinctly European style of direction. Once Upon A Time In America, on the other hand, was a story practically made for the man. Running at over three and a half hours in the most complete cut known to exist today, its pace might be leisurely and its action incidental, but one other thing it has in common with other Leone films is that it is never slow or boring. As a film about gangsters, it is a fine example. As a film about looking back upon the twists and turns life can take, it is a masterpiece. Although there are moments when its sets or props reveal the time the film was shot in, OUATIA is a timeless exploration of how the bonds between boys stretch, alter, and even break as they become men. The tagline (""As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did."") is surprisingly accurate in summarising the film in spite of the fact that it gives very little away. It was Leone's last film, and a more fitting memorial simply does not exist in the medium.",
53,8 November 2006,sundancekid26,9, A really gem of a film.,"Once Upon a Time in America was originally released in 1984.It starred Robert Deniro, James Woods, Joe Pesci and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Sergio Leone, the film featured an alumnus of Leone's crew who had worked on all of his films. This included Enno Morricone's musicality as well as Carlo Simi's production design and Tonino Delli Kelli's masterful and creative cinematography. Once Upon a Time in America is a complex tale about New York City Pals who grow into gangsters and live their friendship throughout prohibition. Near the end of prohibition, a bank heist gone wrong becomes the focal point of the story. A subsequent reunion of the surviving friends 30 years later primarily involves Noodles (Deniro) revisiting his past. The movie itself is almost four hours long and its 1.85:1 ratio shows off Leone's unique visual style. For instance, at one point we may see a crane drop down from the top of the frame like some sort of giraffe to catch Noodles entering an old pub or we may watch in awe as the Brooklyn Bridge is reconstructed right before our eyes. These are just two amongst many commodities that really do reinstate this as Leone's pinnacle masterpiece. It would also be his final film. Deniro delivers the goods as usual. His method style of acting that we are so used to seems to be replaced by a more complacent and tranquil demeanor in this film. James Woods's character has a hint of ambiguity; at the end of the film I both admired and hated his character. Joe Pesci has a minimalistic role as a small-time hustler. Another mentionable fact of OUATIA would be the quality child acting portrayed throughout the film. A young Jennifer Connelly nails her role as Noodles lost childhood sweetheart in the early scenes of the picture. Throughout OUATIA we are treated to Morricone's breathtaking compositions. Perhaps it is the orchestrated version of The Beatles' 'Yesterday', or any other of his musical motifs. Not since, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' has Morricone been so luminous. Overall this film is pure cinematic art. From time to time there isn't a word said but the music and pictures on screen carry the story forward. OUATIA was released in three different edited versions - apparently the full version created a quandary for Warner Brother's executives and it was butchered down two hours. This broke Leone's heart and he would never live to see the full version be released many years later on DVD. I would recommend Once Upon a Time in America to anyone who has a deep passion for movies. It contains gratuitous use of much Leoneism and will be talked about for many decades to come. However, it does take an average of two viewings before the plot begins to make complete sense, but when it does prepare to be engulfed in Leone's most enduring creation since the sixties. A gem of a film indeed!",

Wonderful and unforgettable score by Morricone.","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a really rare movie. It was a passion project directed by Sergio Leone and I could see that he put a lot of love into it. It is a different take on the whole mob genre, as it focuses more on the characters' personal lifes, what they feel, their weaknesses and their friendships. There is also a good dose of violence, but it is definitely used as background. In short, do not expect a movie such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas"".",

While it's rated R, it's a 'hard R'--and I could almost see it getting an NC-17 if shown today--especially when much more benign films like ""A Dirty Shame"" was recently given the NC-17 distinction. In the film, you'll see closeups of a guy peeing, lots of blood, a kid on toilet, lots of teen sex, a very, very explicit rape, and a closeup of a guy getting shot in the eye.

59,6 January 2002,tgdane,10, An operatic epic,"Once Upon a Time in America, which bookends Once Upon a Time in the West as director Sergio Leone's best work, is a powerhouse of a movie. A gangster epic told in a very different style than the standard of the genre, The Godfather, it is in some ways (at least to this viewer) even more emotionally compelling. Although the movie was sabotaged upon release by an edited studio version eliminating about 40% of its original length, the version now available for rental is thankfully the nearly 4 hour version intended by Leone.  The story is at essence a basic one about friendship among thieves, telling the story of a group of Jewish kids in New York near the turn of the century who grow up to become powerful and ruthless mobsters, while maintaining (or trying to) their bond with one another.  As was most famously done in the taxi scene between Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront, the movie again makes the point that bad people can have good aspects to them, such as loyalty, devotion, and even love. I think this movie includes one of Deniro's best roles, and far and away James Woods best film work. The score, by arguably the greatest movie composer of all time, Ennio Morricone, is incredibly haunting in its beauty and sadness (with no fewer than three separate themes that are breathtakingly beautiful).  The non-chronological manner in which the story is told results in a wonderfully effective narrative device:  the movie begins and ends with the same scene.  The first time you see the scene, it is a frantic jumble, without meaning or context, and you do not know why it is so important.  When the scene recurs at the end of the film, everything has become clear, and the scene has an incredible poignancy and sadness to it:  although it occurs in the middle of events chronologically, you realize that, in a real sense, life stopped at this point for one of the film's main characters.  There is no other event that matters anymore to him. This is not a simple movie, and it merits repeated viewings.  Indeed, in my view one cannot fully appreciate the greatness of the film until the second viewing, when the full story is known, and the  events of the film resonate with knowledge of where they ultimately, and tragically, lead.",

61,26 July 2018,zardoz-13,10," The Jewish Version of ""The Godfather""","Sergio Leone's most ambitious film took decades for the ""Fistful of Dollars"" director to make, and he endured many struggles, not the least of which was the terrible re-editing of the film for American audiences. Leone's director's cut with flashbacks galore, told with a kind of surrealism that may be difficult for audiences to watch, develops the action. For example, the opening section of the film shows our hero hiding out in a Chinese opium den while a mysterious telephone rings for what seems forever before it is answered. The initial American cut took the film's complex narrative and reorganized events so that the story unfolded in chronological order. This flawed version ran 139 minutes and lacks the epic quality of the European cut. Whereas Leone's much longer version--clocking in at 229 minutes--jumped around and exhibited little fidelity to chronological order. Basically, the film charts the rise and fall of a quartet of Jewish gangsters who grew up in New York City and got involved in the liquor trade during Prohibition. These kids developed a way to salvage barrels of booze that had to be dumped into the East River when the law descended upon the bootleggers. David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro), Max Bercovicz (James Woods), Philip ""Cockeye"" Stein (William Forsythe) and Patrick ""Patsy"" Goldberg (James Hayden) rise to become major players in Prohibition. Sergio Leone wasn't interesting in simply making an urban version of ""Once Upon a Time In the West."" Indeed, he wanted to follow these characters across decades into the 1960s. Naturally, the film is beautiful, and the action adheres to the tropes of crime chronicles. Interestingly enough, the European cut opens with three gunmen--like those in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly""--searching for Noodles because they have a contract on him. Essentially, the film defies synopsis, but it is a work of art to watch, despite lots of nudity. Hardcore Leone fans will feast on this sprawling yarn with its elegantly orchestrated gunfights.",

There is no doubt he has done several classic films, with his best Westerns and this gangster epic. What makes Sergio's films so magnificent is their timelessness.

The acting is magnificent with the central character noodles played by both Robert De Niro and Scott Tiler (playing him during childhood) being every inch the despicable little swine but yet still creating a character that rather strangely you can warm too. The film features a stellar cast including Eliabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, James woods and tuesday weld in a tale that twists and turns but all the way though makes perfect sense. The people in this film are nasty pieces of work and you can understand why noodles does what he does but you can also understand why people dislike him (largely because he is after them all).

The film keeps a very slow pace throughout, and as a result becomes entrancing and before to long you really start to hope you never leave the movie. You wish it wouldn't stop.  The world the characters exist in is one of non-existence.

82,17 June 2012,nihao,9," Strip off the veneer, Tear down the facade...","Injustice. This film deals with it, this film suffered it. Leone and his team never saw a single Oscar for what is, undoubtedly, one of the GREAT movies of film history. Supposedly the reason was that HIS version was far too long, and 'unapetizing' for the American public. Years later, this seems ridiculous. American cinema has topped the record for gore and 'unhealthy' material. And DVD finally gave us O.U.a T. in A. in its glorious entirety. And complexity. Yes, because this script is so perfect, so stimulating and so bewitching, that although I have seen the movie 3 times in the last 30 years, it still surprises me...adds nuances and revelations to it's original story. truly admirable! The facade of good ole, healthy America is severely battered by this story of unhealthy ambition, betrayal, revenge and power. 'Noodles' De Niro (the nick-name of our 'positive' protagonist reminds us that Leone was the king of 'spaghetti' westerns), returns, twice, to the site of past crimes... risking his life and ideals in the process. The savagely bitter finale remind us that he does so, simply because he is 'curious'. Because he NEEDS the truth. And this need, although painful, is necessary. Guilt, it is implied, is a powerful corrosive agent, however icy James Woods' character may be. There is , whatsmore, a sub-text which Sergio Leone works on here, and it is the role of DRUGS in society. In order to bear the injustice and treason, the violence and solitude that life has dealt out, Noodles resorts to Opium, as a source of relief; of contemplation. Could it be that the director is reminding us that Heroin's reign in Italy and in the U.S. during the 70ies and 80ies may closely reflect 'modern' Society's degradation? As always, Leone blends his political criticism of the American way with a strong misogynist vein. His women are few and far between in the westerns, but in the two 'Once upon a time..."" movies they are increasingly present, and increasingly foxy. The are either prostitutes or cock-teasers with a strong masochist element. And it seems he prefers the 'honest whore'. This film could be reviewed by a psychoanalyst, a priest, a gangster or a politician , and all, I'm sure, would offer a different reading, as in Kurosawa's 'Rashomon'. But Leone is NOT a subtle film-maker. And maybe this reputation of his as something of a gangster in the, very selective Italian league of the 60 ies and 70ies, cheated him out of the credit he receives only now. Somewhat like Ken Russell in the British panorama, Leone's stylish but brutal approach to the realities of life, hurt the shyly hypocritical sensitivities of public and censors alike... let alone the distributors' in Hollywood. Technically the movie is breathtaking, especially Pescucci's wardrobe, Rochetti's make-up (the aging jobs are almost all superlative, and fundamental in helping us deal with such a complex game of 'flash-backs'), the Greg Tolland-style photography and shots by Tonino Delli Colli, the sets, editing and...of course, dulcis-in-fundo, Ennio Morricone's timeless score which, once again, is part and parcel of the film, an emotional bomb which Leone knowingly 'drops' in all the right moments. Deborah's theme is crushing. And the brilliant use of music and silence in Noodles' visit to his friend's mausoleum... comic and audacious. So, it's 9 out of 10, given that the perfect film may not exist (Jean Vigo's 'L'Atalante' ?), and the nearest thing to reading a GREAT novel, but with the whole 'caboodle' of the art of our time.

83,27 May 2012,Artimidor,10, Once upon a time there was Sergio Leone,"Sergio Leone's life-long struggle to make the perfect picture would eventually culminate in a crime fairy-tale on Jewish mobsters, aptly titled ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984). And it would hold its ground despite heavy competition of Coppola's well received ""Godfather"" films and the critically acclaimed Scorsese's gangster epics. Made 13 years after his previous picture, Leone's interlude as a producer didn't take away his passion to get the ""America"" project that was in the pipeline finally going. Eventually it bore fruit and would also turn out to be his ultimate one, and maybe his best. In it the former master of spaghetti westerns takes the time to tell a multifaceted story and crams several whole gangster lives into a nearly four hour long epic, still complaining about essential 45 minutes that he was forced to cut.

It's about the formative years of the American Empire, and has much to teach us that is relevant still.

92,27 December 2009,johnmschofield,10, This is another masterpiece from a master director,It appears that when filming had been completed there was somewhere between 8 to 10 hours of footage and the director and the editor had to trim this to around six hours. The plan being to release the film as two three hour parts. Apparently the producers refused to do this and insisted that the film be cut more and this is where the 229 minute version was arrived at. It also seems that the director wanted the eventual cut to be at least 265 minutes to include 'essential' footage but this 'extra' had to be left on the cutting room floor. The reason I have put this narrative at the beginning of this review is to demonstrate that if anybody has any problem with the continuity or events not being linked clearly then it is for these reasons and not a lack of care and attention from those ultimately responsible in the making of this film. I choose to believe the above mainly because of the very nature of the film. It is an epic and therefore in my opinion be judged on the overall feel of the film when the person watching it has watched it all. I would not recommend anyone watch the even shorter version which is only 139 minutes. I have never seen it but I am told it is a shambles and should be avoided. The 229 minutes version is apparently the only one we the viewing public have access to (excluding the shambles) so please bear in mind the above when you do watch this film.,

94,22 June 2021,ivanmessimilos,9, Last gem from great director,"An epic final work by legendary director Sergio Leone. Originally, the material for the film was between 8 and 10 hours, so he thought of releasing two 3-hour films. When the producers refused, he shortened the film to ""only"" three hours and forty-nine minutes. In America, they were unlucky because a shortened version of two hours came out in cinemas, which, as expected, experienced a fiasco at the box office. I understand that some People film can turn down because of its duration of almost four hours, but the truth is that the film is by no means boring because it covers an action of almost 50 years and we follow three time periods that do not always go linearly. The film asks us to connect some scenes and find meaning. One such huge story about friendship, crime, power, money, human relationships simply requires a longer duration than the average duration of a film otherwise the end product would be an extremely bad copy and would make no sense. The great starring roles of De Niro and James Woods, the brilliant music of Morricone as well as the fact that this is the only film the director has made from 1971 until his death in 1989 make it a true gem of film art. The only grievances of the film, if I splitter, can be found in some scenes that, apparently intentionally as part of the director's vision, last unnecessarily long like a phone ringing twenty-four times, De Niro stirring a cup of coffee just over a minute or watching a boy secretly watching a girl practicing dance.

101,3 November 2003,eamon-hennedy,10, Well Worth The Running Time!,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In America is undeniably a masterpiece. A superb film on every level, it feels like the brother of The Godfather Films. While both this film and the Godfather Part II make use of the flashback structure and both feature Robert De Niro, all comparisons end there as this is a vastly different film. Yes they are both gangster films, but this is a different kettle of fish. Whereas the main theme of the Godfather films is that of family, here we deal with the role of friendship in the life of the gangster and how betrayal can lead to bitter recriminations and heartache. However it doesn't just tell the story of gangster betrays friends, oh no, it goes deeper than that. We go into a world where you question the events depicted and the role many characters play. This is a film with no easy answers and with it comes difficult questions. This is essentially the more deeper cousin of The Godfather films. We come to question whether or not the sequences in the 1960's are real. Is it just a dream concocted  by De Niro in the Opium den. It this a possible future, but one that is only possible. What about the brief case. Whereas in Pulp Fiction the case is more of a running joke, here it seems like a plot point that we have missed all of a sudden, while one also has to question why Noodles goes on to rape the woman he supposedly loves in one of the film's most shocking sequences.",

104,4 April 2001,irajoel,10, Leone's masterpiece,"Its inconceivable to me, how anyone viewing this great film in its 4 hour version could not be moved, excited & ultimately overwhelmed by it. From the opening with that Goddamn ringing phone, to the last shot of a smiling stoned out DeNiro this film is a true work of art. Complicated & personal, Leone weaves an epic tale about a bunch of Jewish gangster-friends from their criminal childhood on New York's lower eastside in the 1900's to the 1960's. And like many films of the genre,Once Upon touches on the themes of friendship, loyalty & betrayal but does so in what some find an unsettling structure. The film constantly weaves from past to present and back again & I think that this form of filmmaking makes some American moviegoers uneasy. They like their films with beginnings, middles & hopefully happy endings. Now this is a film that is all over the place, with characters that come & go impolitely & age without aging. Leone the artist takes a sacred genre and does marvelous tricks & turns to it. Its also a very violent & sexy film, a little too ""European"" for a mainstream American film, so the film is butched down to a 2 hour version that gets bombed by critics, and hated by audiences who came expecting another Godfather sequel, because hey after all DeNiro is in it. Also in the film is James Woods & the always great Tuesday Weld. The music is by Ennio Morricone & the beautiful cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli. I'm delighted to see how many positive and interesting comments this film has gotten here, and I too can't wait for it to be on DVD. There is also a longer version than the 4 hour one, in which Louise Flecher has a part, I've seen the stills.",

Yes, the casting was impressive. Yes, funny how Deborah doesn't age. (I think her Cleopatra makeup is supposed to hide it. And I think she wipes off what is her masking of her feelings for Noodles.) The musical score is haunting beautiful. I did watch the film twice in a row. The cinematography was spectacular. Throughout the characters are seen through glass, cut glass, plain glass, mirrors; over & over they have the choice of this door or that, many hidden doors, hidden corridors. Noodles especially has these choices; keep going, go back, disappear? A beautiful example is in the hospital when after voting against Max about an upcoming opportunity, Noodles leaves by one elevator, headed Down. But in the lobby both elevator doors open, Noodles come out one and Max comes out the other. They make up, and leave arm in arm. Simple. They were split, then come back together, their friendship seemingly taking precedence over anything else. Even their initial meeting takes place with a large glass prismed light fixture.

Sergio Leone created a masterpiece that left a lovemark in many hearts. First of all because of a story. It slowly unfolds during the whole movie, opening up new stories. Like a child opens up a box inside a box inside a box with a gift in the last one. There is always something new happening on the screen, like the real life is always unpredictable - it gives us twists and turns so we don't get bored. There are many stories: Max and Noodles, Max and Deborah, story of Max alone, Noodles alone, Deborah, story of the Police Chief, story of America during all those times. And in the end all those stories sum up and create a book. With many different lives slowly rolling out from youth to death.

112,9 November 2013,videorama-759-859391,10, The greatest mafia film you're ever likely to see,"Something has led me to believe that Sergio Leone, must be the envy of a lot of gangster film directors for bringing this once in a lifetime mafia classic to the screen, something I would of loved to experience, up there with Scarface. Every scene in this is magical as it is precious, like each fragment of a second or each piece of a finely tuned instrument. The acting is once in a lifetime spectacular, from a wonderfully chosen cast, and it's smaller players (Joe Pesci, James Russo, even Danny Aiello) The story moves back and forth through three generations of a forged friendship between four successful gangsters, plus one, shot way too young, where one of the four gangsters paid for it, while avenging his shot mate, by knifing the enemy (Russo) We move ahead in time where the avenging Noodles (Deniro) gets out and rejoins Max (Woods) and his two other mates, one being the great character actor (William Forsythe) his trademark facial, a lazy eye. The movie starts off in a few violently confronting scenes, the first one, having you hooked from the start, involving one of Deniro's floosies, who's way of death is practically mapped out for her. The next scene has the brother of a girl, Deniro's always had the hots for, being used a punching bag. Violence isn't frequent, only used when necessary, but when it happens, IT HAPPENS. I'm really not gonna tell you much more here. The film is a flawless masterpiece on many levels, photography, music score, remarkable period settings, (the New York bridge for one) etc. About every scene is treasured. I know two people who say this is their favorite movie. It may not be mine, but it's up there. This great treasured jewel of a film, you would never believe was made by the same guy responsible for those spaghetti (Clint) westerns. Leone must be having a great laugh now, for creating something so unique, it will never come this way again, and it happened in the good old year of 1985. For those, who haven't seen this film, here's my question to you: Why?",
113,24 July 2020,simoneminerva,10, An ageless classic,"A story of half a century of American history, the film is built through a complex narrative structure divided into three different time planes, which cross and overlap several times during the course of the film. 1922-23, the main characters are young boys, angels with a dirty face at the harsh street school in New York's Lower East Side; 1932-33, Noodles (Robert De Niro) and his comrades, now adults, became a group of rampant gangsters thanks to prohibition and their links with organized crime; 1968, the present (or perhaps the future), with the return of Noodles to New York in search of answers.
Once upon a time in America it is first and foremost a film about friendship, firstly the one between Noodles and Max (central theme of the whole story), it is a film about love, what Noodles feels for the beautiful Deborah, who will consume in brutal rape in one of the film's most heinous scenes. It is a film about ambition, the one that will bring the four young protagonists to glory (and then to ruin). It is a film about trust, betrayal but also about death.

A movie anchored by such a character is rare & Leone pulls it off in casting De Niro in a brilliant performance. James Woods gives his most sustained great performance, different from his usual bursts of yelling and nostril flailing. There is so much going on in this film it's impossible to take it all in in one viewing. It's operatic to be sure as well as a straightforward gangster film as well as an expose of how a person can become utterly corrupt chasing the American dream. The imposing supporting cast is dynamite with both Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth McGovern standing out. Weld has NEVER done anything like her nymphomaniac femme fatale, she soundly dwarfs the evil she mustered in PRETTY POISON. McGovern, who, after such a grand start, has not really had a film career of substance is shockingly good. Treat Williams, Danny Aiello and Burt Young create indelible characters despite limited screen time and the young actors playing the leads as children are outstanding (and nearly perfect younger lookalikes).",

Adulation's for the writers.Still i feel De Niro was great but without the direction and vision of Sergio Leone this would have been incomplete.Not to forget James Woods who also gives a great performance.The ending just breaks you or rather portrays your own guilt in front of you.This is special feeling that you wont get.Don't think of a good feeling after watching this.As you will surely delve into bonds of friendship which you had long time ago.Surely this movie will leave you numb....hats off Sergio Leone and tribute to you....still i ponder the opium scene and the guilt....and i wonder......",
129,27 June 2007,ackstasis,9," ""I like the stink of the streets. It cleans out my lungs.""","The director's final film, Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a spectacular sprawling epic of the lives of a group of Jewish Prohibition-era gangsters, witnessed through the memory of one member, Noodles (Robert De Niro), many decades afterward. Grand in both conception and execution, the film brilliantly combines flawless acting, a poetic script, stunning cinematography and a memorable musical score from long-time Leone-collaborator, Ennio Morricone. Despite weighing in at a hefty 229 minutes (Leone had originally envisioned a 6-hour epic), the film never fails to hold the audience's interest, flashing backwards and forwards between three eras in Noodle's life in an almost dream-like fashion, offering a compelling and comprehensive glimpse into his years as a gangster.",
130,6 November 2017,Richie-67-485852,10, Once Upon A Time in your life,"Bravo! Everyone connected with this movie should take a long well-deserved bow. Most excellent entertainment across the board bar none. All my favorite actors are at their peak plus the supporting players came through as well. If that is not enough, treat yourself to one of the best scores you will ever hear too. The music when applied to certain scenes just tugs and pulls on you until you give in and you are glad that you did too. There are different versions out there to experience. I found the blue-ray 251 minute version which Leone had a hand in and it made good sense. I have seen the other versions and I couldn't quite figure out what was going on even after I was captivated. Imagine that if it held you when chopped up it will spellbind you when complete. It does! Let us not forget that the story itself of gangsters, murders, robberies prostitution etc. can never be glorified and encouraged as a way of life in real life. Quite the opposite. It is a life misspent even it is exciting and dangerous to live in a perverted way. It reminds me of The Godfather movie where we fall in love with Don Corleone but lets be clear he was a bad man. What comes through here in this movie is the magic of growing up, having friends, doing things together, first loves and adventures. What hurts is seeing all those things fail or not complete themselves. This movie gives you both and then some. You have to stop and think about what Tuco said in the Good, Bad & Ugly to his brother. In this town, in order to survive, one becomes a priest or a bandit. Same with this movie only minus the priest part. These kids growing up on the streets have nothing worthwhile to look forward to accept trouble that brings excitement or jail. In between they hope for money, food, a better life and that it gets easier not harder. Street life is like that. You get to glimpse very well this no where type of existence courtesy of expert directing here. It would take someone who knew about this type of growing up to present correctly and more importantly with deep feeling and genuineness. This movies delivers that and more. Haunting, reflective, deep, pain, sorrow and mystery rolled up altogether using peoples lives to make the points. That's why the viewer can relate so well. It could have been and in many cases was...your life too. Recommend a meal while watching with a tasty drink and a decent snack. Make sure you have enough for three plus hours. I have seen this at least three times. I am not through either.....",
131,9 August 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9, Excellent gangster film from a great film-maker,"Sergio Leone is truly a magnificent director; I hadn't realized the magnitude of his talent and abilities until I saw this great film. The film deals with a group of friends, who meet each other and start a partnership as children. They start out as criminals, and end up as criminals. The story is excellent, and the way it is told is great, and almost unique. The non-linear time-line in the film has been copied since this film was made, by other, mostly lesser talented, film-makers, such as Quentin Tarantino. I liked the way the first 30 minutes moved along, between present and immediate past, and then went all the way back to the very beginning of the story. The plot is excellent. The way it unfolds is truly spectacular, and while some might say that it is cheapened by the fact that we know pretty much how it'll end from the beginning, I really think it added to the greatness of the film and story. The plot also moves along at a great pace, it's never boring, despite the fact that the film is over three hours long, and it's not really an action film. I would say that it has it's share of action and suspense, though. There were sequences that rival action films that are considered as some of the best in newer times. There was at least three sequences were the suspense was nerve-wrecking, and the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. The special effects were amazingly well-done, much better than most of the same time period. I'd have to say that effects-wise, it's probably the best movie of the 80's. The acting is spectacular. Even the child actors were amazing; it was interesting to see Jennifer Connely, who's since become a star herself, play a role at such a young age, and playing it so well. The performances of the child actors are some of the best that I've ever seen in any movie, children or adults. All of the main characters, as well as most of the supporting characters were well-acted. The characters are well-written, credible, and rarely ever seemed out-of-character. The way gangster methods is portrayed is realistic and authentic, as is some of the plot. I would have to say that this film actually almost rivals The Godfather Part I as the best gangster film ever made. The only thing that bothered me was the plot twist at the end; it really seemed wrong and unlikely to me, as well as my father, who's reading a lot about the mafia. We both agreed that it seemed weird and out of character. That one thing marred the ending for me, and brought this film down from a perfect score. Apart from the ending, the final plot twist, this film is great. I recommend this to fans of Sergio Leone, gangster films, and just great films in general. Fans of any of the actors might also find it interesting. Don't be thrown off by the long runtime; it's worth every minute, up to the end(the last 15 minutes bothered me, but nothing else). 9/10",
132,16 September 2006,rwkrok,10, Buy the Director's Cut,"Easily one of the best movies ever made. The acting of the impressive cast is every bit as good as one would expect and the script is excellent. The cinematic quality is pure artistry. The movie has just the perfect look: the muted colors, the use of both close-ups and panoramic shots - very Sergio Leone. The score lends an ethereal quality to it that is essential to the mood. I thought the ""Yesterday"" injection when Noodles returns as an old man to Fat Moe's was a bit over the top - but the boys whistling the score as they were waiting to roll the drunk was pure genius. Avoid the butchered 2 1/2 hour version at all costs, buy the director's cut and watch it several times - you'll see new things each time. I did think the garbage truck was a bit bizarre and unnecessary, but that's another small issue with what is truly a masterpiece.",

134,5 July 2009,gangstahippie,10," Amazing mafia movie, about as good as the godfather","I had heard quite a bit about this film before I finally bought the DVD a few weeks ago.I had never seen it play on TV so I picked it up and watched it that very day.I must say, I was blown away.I knew it was going to be good, but the film was excellent.It is definitely in my Top 5 favorite gangster films.It's one of the few films I know which concentrates on Jewish gangsters as opposed to italians.Everything about this movie is great, from the score, to the acting, to the story.It's almost perfect.It's a bit hard to understand at times and you might need multiple viewings to get the complete experience.The film is in non-chronological order and jumps from three different time periods, the 1910's, the 1930's and the 1960's.We see the characters as kids, how they meet and how they start their own criminal activities while worrying about another gangster.They then jump to the 1930's, where they are adult gangsters, robbing banks and dealing in alcohol during prohibition, and finally the 1960's where the leader returns to the old place after 35 years.The cast of the film involves Robert De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, William Forsythe and Jennifer Connelly.The acting is excellent from everybody involved.It's quite bloody and violent for a 1980's film.It's also a good thing the original version has been released here.Apparently, for the U.S theatrical release, the film company cut almost 90min of footage and re-edited the film in chronological order.This caused the film to be a mess, it got horrible reviews from critics and did not make much money at the box office.The original version is widely praised and is an excellent film.If only they had released that version in the first place.The cut version is very rare nowadays.I personally think this is one of the best mafia films of all time and if you are a fan of ""The Godfather"", you will probably love this film.",

136,24 September 1999,Dan C.,10, Crime drama at its best.,"I rented this movie back in 1985 and thought it was one of the best crime dramas I had ever seen. The story was great and so was the acting. But what I liked the most was the way it was directed. Long stares, the way scenes jumped from past to present, and the way it all ties together at the end. I like the way that it makes you think about some of the things that happened without just making it obvious. There are some different versions of this film, one which was originally shown to american audiences was a 2 hour mess, a horrible film that made absolutely no sense. Then there is the almost 4 hour movie that Leone originally wanted and is a masterpiece, See this one it is a great film. Also the movie has a great cast, DeNiro,James Woods, Burt Young, Joe Pesci, James Russo, Danny Aiello, and also those kids.",
137,13 April 2012,dave13-1,9, Worth the investment of time.,"Some reviewers of this movie have complained about its length (almost 4 hours). So? Watch it on two successive nights in two hour installments, and count your self lucky. For years, the sole version of this movie that was available on video was severely cut down, shorter by 90 minutes, and the result was nothing less than butchery. It was like somebody deciding Picasso's Guernica was too huge, so let's take these scissors and make it smaller... Actions taken by the adult characters often made no sense, since those actions were supposed to resonate with actions taken when the characters were young, and those earlier actions were cut out. Spend the time, watch the movie and think about what you are seeing. This is, simply put, one of the five best movies of 1984 and in the long version you get to see it in all of its broad sweeping and elaborate narrative structure and all of its interesting little details. Marvel at the cast of young actors (including a then 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly) who dream of something better than the immigrant ghetto poverty they grew up in, and watch as their dreams and schemes and casual morality sow the seeds of the adults they will become. Live in their America, in the moment and across the decades - an America of limitless opportunity, but also of infinite potential for corruption and exploitation. Success in this America meant always having something on the go and it usually meant trying to keep one step ahead of the cops, whether you were a street punk or a 'legitimate businessman'. Note: other Zippers have made much of DeNiro's gangster's attempted rape of his former childhood friend in the film, but this scene was by no means gratuitous or exploitative. It was, in fact, a demonstration of how far the worlds of the two had grown apart, and this is just one example of how deeply and symbolically EVERYTHING in this movie resonates. A movie this ambitious or good can't ever be 'too long'.",
138,15 September 2016,dworldeater,8, Great mob epic and last film from the legendary Sergio Leone,"Sergio Leone's last film Once Upon A Time In America is a very well crafted gangster epic that looks and sounds great with excellent acting and direction. The film is somewhat in the same vein as The Godfather, but with more unexpected twists and turns and of course shot in Sergio Leone's distinct style. The film was supposed to be 6 hours long in Sergio's original cut, over 10 hours of footage was shot, the version that I have viewed clocks in at around 4 hours and is the closest version available to the directors cut. While some of this footage could have made the film more comprehensible, what is left is cohesive and much of what is missing is left to the viewers interpretation. Which is good, I think. Anyway, the film centers around the life of Noodles and his friends and business associates, who were street hoods as youths in NYC's lower east side and later bootlegger gangsters during the prohibition era. The cast is excellent with Robert De Niro, James Woods, William Forsythe and great looks and excellent performances from Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth Mc Govern. Joe Pesci and Burt Young have memorable cameos as well. Another thing that sets this apart from most other films in the genre is that these mobsters are not Italian or Irish, but Jewish. Once Upon A Time In America is a great film and is recommended viewing if you have seen The Godfather films, but are open to something a little more offbeat, but still very much high quality then you should give this film a go.",

But after reviewing the cast, which includes Robert DeNiro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Treat Williams, and Jennifer Connelly in her first film role, I just had to check it out. I am very glad that I did. I was missing out on one of the most ambitious, engaging, and epic of all crime drama/gangster films. This was Leone's final film before his death in 1989, but what a film to end an illustrious film career with. Maybe not as well known as other Leone classics such as ""A Fist Full of Dollars"", ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" or ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but none the less a film that deserves to be put on the same level as those others, and also enjoy a small niche in the Leone library all it's own.",

Ten years in the making, the film was originally suppose to be 4 hours and 30 minutes long. Due to creative differences and distributions, the European cut was 3 hours and 40 minutes. The American cut however, was a mere 2 hours long. The narrative was beyond broken and everything made no sense leaving Leone reportedly heartbroken, vowing never to make another film and would sadly pass away a few years later. Luckily for us, it's been reported someday that Leone's children and the movies composer Ennio Morricone, will collect all four and a half hours and have a definitive cut soon underway.

""Once Upon A Time In America"" is such a film. Sergio Leone was an absolute master of cinema and unfortunately, this turned out to be his swansong. And what a swansong it is. I can never get sick of watching this film. Without a doubt, this would be in my personal top five movies of all time. Luckily in Australia, we never encountered the two hour version. That would have been a fate worse than death. Some films, like ""Gone With The Wind"", use this length merely to show off. Everything in ""Once Upon A Time In America"" counts. Even the slightest line or gesture, like the running discussion between Max and Noodles about swimming. This is a film that lets its characters breathe rather than follow a set pattern. More than once, this film goes totally against what one expects it to do.",
149,16 July 2020,dromasca,8, 35 years before The Irishman,"An almost four hours film saga whose action takes place in the world of the American mob and spreads over several decades. Robert De Niro plays the lead role of a gangster whose career is filled with corpses, robberies, collaborations with corrupt police and large unions, and whose love affairs have no chance to end well. The special effects of cinema make De Niro move smoothly from youth to the age of memories and vice versa, in a narrative structure that uses flashbacks copiously. But no, the film we talk about is not 'The Irishman', and the hero of the film does not belong to the Irish mob but rather to the New York Jewish mob during the Prohibition years. The film we talk about is 'Once Upon a Time in America', made 35 years before Scorsese's film, and was the last of seven films directed by Sergio Leone.

Unfortunately we had no idea we had watched a completely butchered version of the film that jumped around too much and made little sense. We quickly forgot the experience and watched much more satisfying films for the rest of the summer popcorn infused flicks of the 1980's.

161,12 August 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," Never really feels like the epic they were maybe going for, but still a pretty convincing movie","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is of course as the title suggests an American (and Italian) movie from 1984. A bit of a coincidence I watched this now that Quentin Tarantino has a film with a similar title hitting cinemas, but we shall talk about that one later. This one here was the last really big project for director Sergio Leone as the man in charge behind the camera. He also worked on it as a writer when it came to adapting Harry Grey's novel, but this is no surprise because there were really many writers busy here. Again no surprise because the film comes pretty close to the 4-hour mark. Yes it is really long. Again (I kid you not) no surprise because most of Leone's films are very long and it's not the only one to make it past three hours. Still the man today is probably mostly known for his western movies and not really for this one, even if this is probably the film that garnered him the most awards recognition. It did not get in anywhere at the Oscars, but Leone scored his only Golden Globe nomination and Ennio Morricone also got in there for his soundtrack. At the BAFTAs it was even more successful with a win for Morricone and the costume design too. Leone himself scored another director nomination and also a bit surprising to me Tuesday Weld was nominated for her supporting performance. Oh well, away from awards now let us take a look at the film itself. It plays during three different times with many many years between them. Mostly these sequences are one at a piece for a long time and there aren't too many jumps in-between. Still it is not a chronological film at all. The best example is that the childhood segment may be the one that is first dealt with extensively, but we also have scenes from the protagonist's years as an adult and finally as an old man too. Said protagonist is called Noodles and played by Robert De Niro and his character is really in pretty much every scene of this long movie that certainly would also work as a miniseries. Still, the childhood part, obviously it is not De Niro himself who plays the character there. This film is from the year when I was born and De Niro was around the age of 40 when this was made. It is kinda interesting, maybe a bit funny too to see him with aging makeup now 35 years later when he is really as old, probably even older, as his character is in here. But it shows that they did a really good job here. Make-up, costumes, sets are all very convincing and same is true about the acting all around. Leone knew what he was doing that much is safe, even if people do not really think of this film nowadays when talking about him, but that is really probably only because of how defining he was for the italo western genre with his Eastwood collaborations. A film like this one here is one that still would be a worthy additon to anybody's body of work. I must say it felt a bit Scorsese to me at times. There aren't many scenes during which it felt Leone. One maybe was during the childhood parts when the two boys run into the other guy who criminally runs the neighborhood. There is one slow motion scene also accompanied by Morricone's soundtrack intensely that felt really very much like Leone during his western days. As for Morricone, he did a pretty good job here overall for sure. His soundtrack is not as much in your face as it is on other occasions, but he is always there when it counts and otherwise convincingly subtle as he should be considering how much of a master of his craft he is. I'm happy he eventually won an Oscar (fittingly for a Tarantino movie as I mentioned him earlier) and is also still alive, hopefully will be for a few more years.",

167,29 May 2018,MJB784,9, It's wonderful!,"It's a great mobster movie. It's about the life of this gangster through his childhood and adulthood including him imagining his future through a dream state of inhaling opium. I have a feeling that all the scenes taken place before his opium smoking intro were real and he was hallucinating the scenes when he has grey hair. For one explanation, the phone kept ringing as a sign that something is off. He's slowly heading into the dream world from the opium. The story is told through memory and dreams and how the two begin and end similarly. For every time a scene ends, a similar image begins. It's 3 hours and 49 minutes, but doesn't feel long. I usually find Leone boring because a lot of scenes go on too long where we wait until someone says or does something. Once Upon a Time in America is smoother and better paced and the story pulls you in more.",

As it was said in documentary movie about Sergio Leone, he collapsed after movie of his life was cut like it was done in USA in 1984. I can't even imagine what scenes were cut out.

177,29 December 2002,esteban1747,9, A masterpiece of mafia films,"This is not another film, this is simply a jewel very well done by its director Sergio Leone. The sequences go forth and back each time giving an idea of the lives of several boys-hooligans, who later became real gangsters. The scenarios were right ones at each time starting from early 1900 and ending at 70s of the 20th century. One must acknowledge that each detail was really taken into account for making such a film and that acting of De Niro, James Woods and several others was the best. This time De Niro is a cool-blood gangster while Woods shows himself with more temperament. De Niro also shows a kind of ethics in his behavior with regards to his colleagues, being a teenager he is the one able to kill another gangster or a policeman with a knife to revenge the murder of of his youngest colleagues and to go to jail for long time; when his best friend Max wants to accomplish a very risky robbery he calls the police to prevent him doing this non sense act, but his colleagues were not so friendly as he was, they were wolves in their business, something that Noodles (De Niro) understood late in his life.

184,24 January 2007,paul2001sw-1,5, From spaghetti to Noodles!,"Sergio Leone, best known as the godfather of spaghetti Westerns, here makes a film about a gangster called Noodles. With its broad historical sweep, achronological story lines, three hour-plus runtime and generous score (written by longtime collaborator Ennio Morricone), it's nothing if not ambitious. Indeed, some of the balletic collages of music and images in this movie resemble no other film more than '2001: A Space Oddysey', which is certainly not something you can say of most gangster movies. Unfortuantly, the dialogue and characterisation are not as strong as the imagery, the conclusion to the plot doesn't quite convince (or indeed, pack a big enough punch to wholly satisfy after a movie of this length), and at times the film seems almost to endorse its central characters' crude, and sometimes sexually violent, world view.

Since then i've watched it many times and over those repeated viewings i've come to understand more and more what the film is about and what the characters and story represent. But that is my take on it and as such, one of the beautiful things about this film is that people, i feel, will take what they want from it depending on how much time and attention they want to put into it. In simple terms this is not a film you can watch just the once - if you do you will feel confused and probably let down.

His 'dollars' trilogy made Clint Eastwood an international celebrity and pointed the way to newer, grittier westerns. And My name is Nobody was both a fitting tribute to and subtle mockery of the genre. But for his final work he moved into another traditional American medium, the gangster film. It was largely overlooked, both because of its original three hour and forty minute runtime, and a pathetic theatrical version that cut it almost in half.

187,18 May 2011,johnnyboyz,8," Don't let the title lead you astray, this is no fable-like fairytale; Leone's final film formulating into a mesmeric and thoroughly worthwhile three and a half hour opus.","Once Upon a Time in America begins with some music featuring an artist singing of an America to be proud of; of an America worth dying for and a nation of which is generally somewhat better than just rather decent. The places Sergio Leone's 1984 film, the last before his 1989 death, will go are places not necessarily inclined towards painting images of the place as the song would suggest; his film an other-worldly and quite fantastic hierarchical tale told across numerous decades in the early to mid-twentieth century about kids coming to grow into adults but all the while living a persistent existence as criminals. The film begins at the ground zero stage of the 1920s streets of Brooklyn, New York City, before going on well into the 1960s; a stage by which time friendships have been forged; mistakes have been made and people have come and gone for whatever reasons. By the time it has ended, we are exhausted but in a strictly positive way.",
188,30 May 2000,yihong.yao,10, The best gangster movie ever made,"Godfather is probably more entertaining. However, this movie makes you want to cry and think hard about life.  I have watched this movie about 10 times. Everytime after I watched it, I felt exhausted and extremely sad.  There is just so much stuff in this movie and it's basically impossible for me to compare this movie to any other single movie, maybe a string of Fellini's or Bergman's movies. Remember I am using the word string. A lot of people just do not like this movie. People I think (or used to think) had good taste think the movie is too long, too dry, and basically just a big waste of time. But some people who have seen it agree with my view that it is an enormously rich and rewarding film. The problem is that the film is almost four hours long, and can be somewhat confusing with its layers of flashbacks. However, the full story of the film is a large one, and Leone's style is so operatic at this point that it takes much longer than the plot demands. There are many slow crane shots of various streets in New York's lower east side, and many awkward silences and pauses where nothing is physically happening. The action, however, does not seem slow to me. None of Leone's movies seem slow. Leone keeps everything moving quite nicely, yet he pauses to establish the mood with, for example, a crane shot of the bustling New York street, or a scene where Noodles stirs his coffee for a couple minutes, letting the mood become extremely uncomfortable. None of Sergio Leone's Western characters seem to have much emotion in any of his movies. There is emotion, but it tends to be emotion that is extremely repressed, hidden beneath a calm, tough exterior. This film is different. Noodles (Robert de Niro) does not seem to have any emotions, extremely odd for the protagonist of a movie. When Noodles comes home and visits Fat Moe after 35 years away, his first words after seeing Moe are ""I brought you back the key to your clock"". There is a reason for Noodles loss of affect, as the psychologists call it. His emotion has been buried under the memory of having inadvertently killed his best friends, his soul has clearly died. After meeting Max (James Woods) as a kid, Noodles, Max, Patsy, and Cockeye form a gang. After spending mostof his childhood in jail for avenging the death of a friend, Noodles rejoins Max and the gang,to find Max starting an ambitious climb to the top of the organized crime ladder. Eventually,Max becomes too ambitious, and after prohibition is repealed, seeks to rob the Federal Reserve. To stop him from an obviously suicidal heist, Noodles turns Max in. However,Max and the rest of the gang get into a shoot-out with the police, and Noodles soon hears of the death of Max, Patsy and Cockeye. Noodles can't stop thinking about the call made that killed his best friends, and soon has to flee New York because the crime syndicate he worked for now is trying to kill him. Thirty-five years later, he is still haunted by the memories of his dead friends. He is mysteriously summoned to New York by an unknown person for unknown reasons, and soon discovers a trail of clues that will lead to a great revelation. At the end, there is the final smile by Noodles, doped up on opium, the only time in the movie that he looks completely happy and at peace. Even though this is an earlier Noodles, this is Leone's way of depicting Noodle's return to normality after 35 years of grief. It is the perfect conclusion to this movie. This is a story of a man at war with himself. Noodles is criminal, savage, ruthless, and is sexually animalistic (as demonstrated in the various raping scenes). Yet he is also tender, loving, down-to-earth, and honorable. The center of this conflict is Deborah, who loves Noodles, and tries to turn him away from his criminal side. Deborah is the one pure thing in his life, the one thing that he loves, and when she is about to leave for an acting career, Noodles rapes her. He rapes her because he is mad at her, he is confused, and realizes that this is probably the last time he will ever see her, so he must have sex with now or never. Besides, that is Noodle's instinct, and his sudden moves on Deborah would be quite acceptable with the kind of girl he normally sees. Perhaps he rapes her because he sees in her a purity that he can never have, tries to take it and in the process destroys it. When Noodles' realizes what he has done, he starts on a slow recovery process, gradually becoming less and less criminal, which forces the rift with Max, who is determined to build a huge organized crime empire. When Max and the others are dead, and Noodles flees New York, his bad side has vanished. And when he comes back, he is a changed man. The reason that I feel this is the best gangster movie is because none have the combination of style and substance that this films brings. It's not just about gangsters, its a look inside the soul of Noodles. Robert de Niro gives such a wonderful understated performance that the character of Noodles sticks with you. I can still remember Noodles just by a certain look in de Niro's eyes, a sort of calm depression, a look that has the weariness of the world in it. This is a movie where the mood of repressed sadness will linger long after the film has ended. Very few films are as powerful.",
189,22 September 2016,Leofwine_draca,7, Mature and reflective film-making,"A human drama masquerading as a gangster story, this, the last and perhaps most epic film of Sergio Leone's career, is a story that takes three and a half hours to play out. During the running time we are subjected to a lengthy, complex, and utterly compelling drama that charts the rise and fall of love, friendship, and betrayal in the life of Noodles, a Jewish gangster as played by Robert De Niro. Only true fans of the cinematic experience need apply, who have the patience to sit through many slow scenes and watch the story play out on its own without any rush or contrivances. Once you realise that every moment that plays out on screen is important in the life of the central protagonist you'll realise what a good film this; there is no excess baggage, no extraneous characters, just realism and heartfelt drama. The whole gangster aspect of the story and the setting is just a backdrop for emotions and relationships to play out. Despite the lack of action (fans of Leone's westerns will find the shoot-outs and fights in short supply here) there are many shocking moments in the movie, many involving sexual violence of one kind or another which is tough to watch but still compelling.",

Frame by frame scenes, the quality of the film, the music, the acting (brilliant - with my main man Deniro ..aka GOD) and a volatile James Woods makes you feel like you've lived an entire life of someone when you see this movie.  Although The Godfather and the trilogy are my favorite movies of all time - this movie along with the GFather trilogy are perhaps the only ones who make the viewer well and truly feel like they've taken a lifelong journey - literally living a life.

It's true, this is a very long, very sad film encompassing child murder, prostitution, graphic rape, terrible betrayal, and the weary recollections of a pathetic, broken old man. It's also unmistakably, tremendously alive, and alert to the possibilities of narrative (non-linear) and form (pure artistry in every frame).

The long shots people complain about are to show the hopelessness. Nothing to look forward to, instead drilled in the moment forever. The overly long scenes of small unimportant things, are really narrative lessons about the characters motives and mindset. Such as the scene where the boy slowly succumbs to greed and eats the cupcake. It shows how little he cares for the big picture, instead greedily consuming what he can now.

Maybe the director wanted to glorify, or maybe he wanted to show the barbaric brutality of mobsters, or maybe he wanted to do both. That's the way this viewer felt, anyway, while watching. There are glorification scenes a'plenty, and then there's the rape scene in the back of the hired car where all beauty and piety and loveliness and pure love and righteousness are maligned in such a way that you really wish the driver of the vehicle puts an end to the perpetrator then and there, let the cards fall where they may with the criminal's syndicate lifelong friends. There are far better mobster films out there, most of them produced during the Noir era of Hollywood because the director's of that era hated crime and what these monkeys were doing to Hollywood and the rest of the world.

It's a thriller, it's a dream, it's reality, it's about life and death, it's about love, it's about betrayal, it's about not so sympathetic people but yet we are fascinated by them, it's about America, a strange place, corrupt, yet its also fascinating and beautiful, filled with gangsters, hoods and the American dream that is an illusion. The music is by Ennio Morricone and is one of the best scores of a time. Neither of those kids or republican 2020 seem to mention this.

219,25 November 2010,albertoveronese,10, Something to do with greatness,"Sergio Leone was the greatest filmmaker of all time; all his films are masterpieces, they have something to do with greatness and cinematic excellence, the best films ever made. Once Upon A Time In America covers the periods in the 20s and 30s as recalled from 1968. It's a poignant and dense movie in which the motion, the frame and soundtrack simultaneously strike in a beautiful counterpoint. The movie is an example of visual and aural storytelling beyond time and reality – it's an indivisible whole where time is not a linear flow into past, present, and future. Once Upon A Time ""in"" America is not a social historical analysis nor a scientific work, it's a tale, a fairy tale which defies description because it's a dream that Noodle (Robert De Niro) begins in 1938 and doesn't end in 1968. Sergio Leone believed in huge stadium like movie theater where people would come together and watch on a giant screen an epic tale of passion, love, friendship, betrayal, vengeance, faith and perseverance; he believed in four, six hours long films, he believed in the extraordinary visual composition and movements that movies can celebrate, he believed in the powerful vibrancy, depth and richness of wide format films, he understood and empathized the sense of insight that follow a discovery one make for oneself – it was a fulfillment of integrity and lyrical concern over a lifetime. I can't even try to imagine what we all lost with his too-soon passing, what his next film would have been – Leone was planning a Soviet co-production film on the Siege of Leningrad during World War II – an epic larger-than-life film project left uncompleted at the time of his death. His film-making skills were so good that it's quite a physical experience to see his movies... they offer pleasure on a lot of different levels, you don't really know where it comes from but it's a shock of joy and sadness, full of feeling, emotions so essential to our lives. Watching and studying Sergio Leone's films are likely to yield to a better visual culture.",
220,21 August 2005,Hancock_the_Superb,9," Leone's ""Moby Dick"": A Flawed Masterpiece","This movie was the culmination of a sixteen-year obsession by director Sergio Leone. Ever since he first read ""The Hoods"" in 1967, he wanted to make this movie. But, the studios saw him as a Western director (given the Clint Eastwood ""Man With No Name"" trilogy's success, not really surprising), and he was forced to make ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", a masterpiece, and ""A Fistful of Dynamite"", an interesting but uneven political Western. After a decade of producing various films, Leone was finally able to get this film off the ground, with a major studio backing - and then, when it was finally released in 1984, Warner Bros. criminally hacked the movie down to just over two hours from a final cut near four, ruining the scope and feel of the movie and causing it to flop. Now, the movie is available in a not-quite-complete (the director's cut is somewhere around 270 minutes) form at 227 minutes, but still complete enough that the scope of the film and Leone's intentions can be appreciated. Obviously, the film - long, violent, and somewhat hard to follow - is not for everyone; classifying this film as a ""gangster"" or ""crime"" movie simply does not do it justice. But for those willing to check it out, OUATIA is a rewarding, bittersweet experience.",

I think there are few films in American cinema history that clearly meet this level of quality: the _Godfather_ saga, _Schindler's List_, _Apocalypse Now_, a great number of Kubrick films, some of Hitchcock's films, some Welles films, David Lean's epics, and maybe some others that don't come to mind right off.  In the ""maybe"" class I'd put this one, perhaps Leone's other epics (though, again, I'd have to see *those* again), _Chinatown_, and perhaps several others.

227,21 April 2005,AudemarsPiguet,9, Seldomly a film of such beauty...,"I was in my teens,about sixteen or seventeen,when I first saw this film and,incidentally,I was at an age when the twenties imagery fascinated me-well it still does... Highly artistic was the opening scene,when the annoying phone calls are associated with a lavish party scene-a symbol for life's vanity and the revenge of a guilty conscience for all the pleasures(similarly in Shakespearean theater the obsessive repetition of nagging noises is actually stands for the guilt complexes from the past reemerging). It's,like previously other viewers noticed,the story of a few poor immigrant boys trying to conquer the new promised land-even if they end up building an empire of crime(let's face it,they did't have any other chance to evolve from rags to riches considering their social background)they are somewhat American pioneers,these solitary,strong-minded and ambitious heroes who turned the U.S. into what it is today. By the way,American capitalism and political life,even if apparently honest and fair-play are not necessarily based on legal methods... Eventually their twisted friendship will(like in a passionate,irrationally intense love-story)destroy everything it touched-and in between an epic spanning between 1915 and 1968,a visual treat of elegant vintage cars,stylish clothing and sophisticated champagne bottles-all the luxury and fascination of the legendary prohibition age. The scene where Prohibition is ""buried""-somewhat resembling the ""Death of Glitter"" concert from ""Velvet Goldmine"",actually a coffin-shaped chocolate-cake is surrounded by four candles stuck into Cordon Rouge bottles,is one of the most influential in film history,probably known and loved even by the ones who aren't much into this genre,did not watch/enjoy this film. In my opinion this scene is capturing all the beauty and vanity of life,youth,ambition and pleasure-it is almost possible to feel,to sense an utterly voluptuous universe fading away,becoming impossible to hold back... I don't think that the characters were homosexual,in spite of their very strong friendly love,I guess this film is rather a hymn in the honor of a myth as old as mankind:friendship;even admitting that this film involves a certain homo erotic subtext,it is that high-minded, poetic,strictly Platonic homo eroticism to be found in the strong bonds that existed among e.g. ancient warriors wanting to be buried together and have their ashes mixed for eternity-this ritual(though altered) actually happens this way in this film too. I also don,t buy the preconception that Max was a traitor-notice that even his more balanced friends are actually brutes occasionally violently bursting out like wild animals-he's just a better survivor and fighter that the rest.Of course he might be more megalomaniac,self-indulgent and egocentric than the others,but he's acting according to the rules of gangland and of his Jewish background-the Jewish origin of most of the characters partly explain their talent for money-making,their compellingly manipulative personalities,their practical intelligence. While Noodles turns out,in my opinion,as a winner in the end.Even if poor and forgotten,even if he gets high in order to forget life's misery,he seems balanced and appeased in the end.After going trough pretty much of what his century had to offer,after undergoing so many experiences and changes,he takes refuge in a world(even if artificially created by drugs)where,in an almost godlike way,only the beauty,the legendary side of the violent age of gangsters exists.He therefore rescued,almost like Proust,trough the power of memory,his glamorous and adventurous youth from extinction. Another fascinating (among many others) scene is the one when a posh partying crowd is throwing with Cordon Rouge bottles out of an old timer swiftly and almost invisibly driving by-this scene somewhat exhales the ghastly,nostalgic roaring twenties beauty,like in a novel by Fitzgerald or a visually disturbingly compelling&lush period piece by Ken Russel. Irespective of the dark,violent and bleak message of this film,I'll always remember it as one of the most accomplished visual poems dedicated to youth and the unlimited ambitions it is often linked with. Therefore a lush and highly fulfilling treat due to its immense and very credible evocative power,depicting credible and actual scenes without ever being common or boring.",
228,5 January 2003,aattanas,10, Absolute masterpiece,"Sergio Leone's film ""Once upon a time in America"" is a movie that can not be compared with any other. It tells a lengthty but fruitful tale of jewish gangsters from the early 1920's through the late 1960's.  Sergio Leone has created a completely authentic visual representation of a time that has long since past. The film has tremendous acting courtesy of, Robert De Niro, James Woods, Tuesday Weld, Elizabeth McGovern, and Jennifer Connelly (who would go on to win the best actress oscar for 2001's ""A beautiful mind."") Even the smaller roles were equally impressive. To name a few: Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, and the most entertaining, Danny Aiello. The script leaves no stone unturned in the tragic lives of the characters. The directing is as beautiful as Ennio Morricone's unforgettable and mesmerizing score. This movie may be a challenge for those who have difficulty sitting through long films. ""Once upon a time in America"" clocks at 3 hours & 47 minutes. This is the long version. Steer clear of the horiffic shorter version. Despite the films length, this film does not drag at all. As there is never a dull moment.

I thought that it would be your ordinary Godfather like mafia movie, but it was way better.  This movie might not have the best editing, but it has a great story and Acting.  De Niro is good as always, But James Woods is the one that stands out in probably the best performance of his career.  Like most Mafia movies it deals with the American Dream, but while Adding to the American Dream story there is also a theme of loyalty, friendship, and love.  The love story between Noodles and Debroah is probably one of the best love stories ever on film.  The scene where the youngest member of the gang dies and Noodles' retaliation is beautiful.  I have seen alot of Gang/Mafia movies and probably this is my 2nd favorite (Behind the Godfather.)  I thought the film would move slow but it moved fast un-like Godfather part II in which there was all this extra dialoge that the film didn't need.  There is great direction from Sergio Leone, and a great Musical score by Ennio Morricone.  I recommend all people to see this movie, it is a wonderful story.

And yet the movies are very different. The Godfather is more about the mafia and old crime families whereas this movie is much more from rags to riches kind of story.

240,20 May 2008,jmbruce,10, A timeless classic that deserved far better than what it got!,"People have called ""Once Upon a Time in America"" a 'Jewish Godfather,' but it is so much more than Coppola's Oscar winning film. In fact, it is so much more than that; it is a pure Sergio Leone epic full of greed, wealth, love, deceit and betrayal. This would have swept the Oscars for 1984, been on the Best Films of All Time lists, and be an instant classic. Leone would win an Oscar for his comeback and become the biggest man in Hollywood. All this would have happened, had it not fallen victim to studio-forced editing. Roger Ebert praised the uncut original film that received a standing ovation at Cannes Film Festival and was released in its entirety in Europe, but he was disgusted with the 144 minute version that premiered in America. No wonder the film did not do well at the U.S box office, but it has since made more than its budget back in home video, DVD and TV airings. Sort of like The Shawshank Redemption (although that film made it's budget back but not enough to make a profit), but the sold fact that it was Leone who directed ''OUATIA'' makes the film talked about even today!",

243,27 July 2003,noilie,1, An unnecessarily padded and ersatz schlep of a film.,"It is high time that American critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned, sloppy veneration of films like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America'. The checkered history of this opulent film (and the grand, fanciful myth associated with it's production and many versions) belies its mediocrity on a narrative level. The film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts, its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets, the minutia of production detail and the, by 1984, cliche'd but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience. The plot's time frame is confusing, gimmicky and laboured, leading some critics to imagine the Noodles figure's opium binging to be the antecedent of some future 'dream reality' as well as the sepia-toned remembrances. This ham handed, overly fan boy-apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display. Even at this full (?) running time, figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness: the Deborah character is fleetingly established in child form, a cold and unattainable 'trophy' female, not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re-establish her relationship with a post-prison Noodles, the said re-union henceforth rings completely false. The deadening pace is somewhat to blame, certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long, signifying very little, hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production, fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof. The trajectory of the figures' lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of America's teens through prohibition and its spoils, ending with the (arguable) ruin of its moribund central figures (save Deborah- a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders). This notion is commonplace, even banal. The cast of characters as imagined in the one note script (written by seven Italians no less) are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors, who at least venture a few variant facial expressions. This is understandable given the almost unworkable material. Some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably self-absorbed, but actively seek their own goals, assuming the compliance of others (e.g. when Noodles gets out of prison, Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming Noodles will comply). This explanation of their abrupt, abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense. Although Ennio Morricone's score is much revered, it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive, it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves, many violent, just do not warrant. At points it is questionable whether or not Morricone was watching the same film I was so incongruous is his work. As a paean to American Filmmaking, it succeeds in terms of mood (helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods) and visuals (not helped by said score) but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity.",

There is just so much happening here you wont pick everything up upon the first viewing. The main character Noodles (De Niro) is everything you could want. He is a hero and a dispicable person at times. I use the word hero because of my fascination with the crime genre. You must respect the drive of a man who rises from poverty to success no matter how it's done. Similar to Michael Corleone in the Godfather you cant help but to love the blurred line of Good Guy/Bad Guy in the complex character that is Noodles.

247,18 March 2017,moonspinner55,6, Reflections on a turbulent life,"Stylish, perceptive and violent crime drama from director Sergio Leone, an epic-scaled adaptation of the book ""The Hoods"" by Herschel Goldberg (aka Harry Grey) about the lives of four gangsters in the years 1921, 1933 and 1968. Former street kids from the Jewish ghettos of Manhattan's lower East Side graduate from petty crimes and bootlegging to robbery and rape, to providing muscle for a union boss. Initially crippled by the film company's decision to hack the U.S. release print down to 2 hours and 15 minutes (the current extended director's cut runs 4 hours and 18 minutes), ""Once Upon a Time in America"" took many years to garner its now-sterling reputation among admirers of the gangster genre. Still, even in its mammoth original state, the wan subplots involving the ladies (Elizabeth McGovern as an actress and Tuesday Weld as a lascivious moll)--and a penchant for vulgarity and the exploitation of women in general--lessens the overall impact of the tale. The art direction, the score (from Ennio Morricone), the cinematography (by Tonino Delli Colli) and Leone's rhythm are each florid and outstanding in their individual respects, while the performances by Robert De Niro and James Woods (and, in a smaller dimension, Joe Pesci) are dynamic. **1/2 from ****",

You can't look away, not even for a second, not even for a single shot -- you're like, ""what happened??"" and not with trepidation or fear or annoyance you've missed something, you just want to see *every shot*. And you can't tell what's going to happen, either -- you can't even give away spoilers starting with the opening scenes, because even then it would qualify as spoilers because you don't know and can't *tell* what's going to happen. *Even the opening scenes count as spoilers*. This is one of the most majestic and confident cutting-between-time-frames I've ever seen -- it just ropes you in, and every part's equally interesting, every part just furthers the ropes and deepens the mystery. All it does is explain itself, from word one -- and more, and more. None of the sloppy editing and cuts that make an awkward leap in say Danny DeVito's ""Hoffa"" from the early '90s -- all the movie seems to do is identify bad ideas from other movies, and avoid them. The effect is spellbinding. Nobody's been better than they were in this movie -- they've only been *as good*. You won't be wasting your time watching this movie. I promise you.",

254,18 October 2013,Red-Barracuda,8," A great film but, dare I say it...a bit over-long","With this film Sergio Leone, the spaghetti western genius, made his gangster film. It was a project long in the making and it took many years to finally make the screen. The result is an epic film that covers four decades in the lives of a gang of Jewish hoodlums from Ney York's Lower East Side. It's told in a fractured time structure specifically covering the years 1922, 1933 and 1968. In the earliest period the characters are boys, entering the world of crime, in the middle section they are at the height of their powers as gangsters in the prohibition era, while in the latter year the story climaxes when they are old men. It isn't told chronologically though. There are flash-backs and flash-forwards; and in this way the film can deal with themes of memories, guilt and redemption much better, while it is able to conceal plot twists far more effectively. The story is essentially about the relationship between Noodles and Max, childhood friends who grew up to be gangsters. Noodles returns to New York in '68 after being in self-imposed exile for 35 years. He seemingly sold out his friends and is haunted by this memory but he soon realises on arrival that events in his past were not as they seemed.",

258,11 July 2020,dhunjiwadia,10, Once upon a time....in our life....we get to savour something extraordinary.,"This weekend had to be a celebration of #EnnioMorricone's work.
I chose to watch #OnceUponATimeInAmerica. Ennio Morricone perfectly understood what #SergioLeone wanted. For many scenes, there isn't a word said. The music and the images on their own tell a story.
Deborah's theme keeps lingering in the mind long after you've finished watching the movie. As also Cockeye's song with Gheorghe Zamfir's pan flute accompaniment.
The film is magical. But there's a catch - very few people have ever seen it. Even people who think they have seen it, have not. The studio behind the film went beserk when they saw the length and butchered it to a short version which got rejected by the American audiences on its release. The video version, that respects the director's intent, is magical - all 3 hours and 49 minutes of it. (If you're looking for a 90 minutes slam-bang movie, then this will be a disappointment.) One of the best films ever made. Sergio Leone is a director who understands the art of cutting a movie in a manner that keeps you focused till the end.
And terrific performances. But what else can one expect from actors of the calibre of Robert De Niro, Elizabeth McGovern, James Woods, Joe Pesci and the entire ensemble.
Lastly, the script which took 12 years to complete that covers every detail.

266,13 January 2021,dannyrovira-38154,9, LEONE'S UNDERRATED MASTERPIECE IS IMPRESSIVE,"Sergio Leone's sprawling crime epic drama is his final motion picture and his most underrated masterpiece. The film tells the story of five decades in the lives of four Jewish gangsters who are lifelong friends from the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the 1920's that became merciless criminals, but they have a special bond of loyalty to each other. The great Robert De Niro magnificently plays one of them named David 'Noodles' Aaronson, in a marvelously controlled understated turn, he is a small-time hood who is now hiding out in an opium den in a Chinese theater. He is hunted by a couple of murderous thugs sent by the betrayer who was once a beloved childhood friend, who is also responsible for the murders of his other friends. A ringing telephone in the drug den ignites his memory and through a complex series of back and forth flashbacks we go back and relive his life experiences from his adolescents to his adult life in crime and the tragic outcome. Masterful direction by Leone, with marvelous performances by James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, Danny Aiello, Richard Bright, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Brian Bloom, and young Jennifer Connelly in her motion picture debut. Extraordinary cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli, with an exquisite score by Ennio Morricone The period recreation is absolutely flawless in this engrossing film that is a must-see for any serious movie lover. Highly recommended. Note: Leone originally wanted and envisioned two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes. The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement. The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made. The original ""European cut"" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time. I own the 4 hour 11 minute director's cut version on blu ray. A truly phenomenal crime epic!",

Impeccable score of Ennio Morricone, and as always impeccable props, amazing locations, and for me the scene where the young boy dies, might have been the reason why Leone wanted to make this movie.

They are disgusting when they are kids burning a poor mans newstand because he didnt pay a cut to the gangsters and follow them to bigger things when they are older. In all this story we are supposed to feel for these hoodlums and care about their friendship. Well i didnt care at all,from the first reel i just wanted them to rot in jail and never hear of them again. Just my two cents about these stories of the so called crime genre. Only in america crime is condidered to be just another business and movies about it are considered masterpieces. Just like the Godfather and so on.

It's a trilogy, starting in the early 30's and ending in the late 60's.
Whatever had to be told, is vastly explained with meticulous detailing. Some may find it hard to understand the opening 20 minutes of the movies, but I think implications are strong enough to connect the dots and sort out the storyline, although not that obvious.
Makeups, clothes and set design in this movie are just examples of masterpieces. I gave it 8/10 simply for the long narrative, poor sound edit (respectively) and mediocre actings of anyones but the chief roles.

Honestly I don't like western-movie too much, but from ""Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)"", I started to appreciate this kind of epic- genre. And then, I wonder what it's like when Leone directs other genre, such as crime. So I decided to watch this long-running-movie. For the first impression, I really shocked by its duration, 229 minutes, the longest movie I've ever watched. But, sure there are some reasons why he made for more than three hours. Especially, it is a drama-movie, I really understand how the character of each figure must be strong.",
305,25 December 2022,parthaykulkarni,10, The Best and Worst Film of 1984?,"Ok, so maybe it's not the worst film of 1984 but, in my opinion, it is probably the best film of 1984, at least of the ones I've seen. It's important to note when I say best film, I mean the ""European Cut"" and when I say worst film, I mean the ""American Cut"". Yeah, the Ladd Company decided to cut the film down to 139 minutes, excising the 1968 scenes and much of the childhood sequences. Also, Secretary Bailey's death isn't ambiguous anymore and the whole story's in chronological order and Sergio Leone had nothing to do with this cut so just don't watch it. Goddamn it, Ladd Company. But at least there is the European Cut, though, where everything is perfect. Everything from the acting to the script to the immaculate production design to Ennio Morricone's score, is all 11/10 (and that's not even sarcastic). If you have not watched this film, I don't know what you're doing, but whatever you're doing, you're doing it wrong. Watch this film 1,000 times, if possible. Sergio Leone and his crew deserve your support and money, even though they're all dead or very, very old by this point.",
306,19 October 2014,packard8,1, So boring I wanted to cry- a character study with no sympathetic characters,"When I found this tape in my collection, I was astounded that I had missed it when it came out. The cast list reads like a who's who of awesome actors, suited perfectly for a gangster movie. And Sergio Leone directing! Wow! I read several reviews comparing this movie to the Godfather and Goodfellas, and was over the moon to see it. I set my machine up, got ready and sat down. An hour and a half later (I fast forwarded through so much of it) I was dulled to the point of near madness. The cinematography was great, and brilliantly imaged, but literally nothing of importance happened in this entire movie. The characters were unsympathetic with back stories of little to no relevance or interest. The plot dragged on ad nauseum, padded by long close ups of ""dramatic"" faces staring contemplatively as if they knew something we didn't. Oh they did, and that was that you should go to bed early and skip this one entirely. The few action scenes were few and far between, and the interminable dialog and love interest offal seemed to drag forever. Maybe I missed something, because I had to fast forward through a lot of this movie, something I rarely do, but I just couldn't stand it after the overwhelming pretentiousness of each character's chatter. Worst of all, nothing happened of interest. Nothing. It was as if the movie were made for the sole purpose of getting Oscar attention, without any nod to entertainment value. If you make a period gangster film, make it better than a History Channel documentary. the only redeeming quality of this film was the cinematography and the old cars. Instead, just watch Godfather and then go to a car show.",

The friends made in the streets, and the brownstones alleys and roofs. The expressions, the mannerisms, voice inflections are perfect. As you watch it over and over (the 4 hours version) more and more can be appreciated and new things just come clearer. The visions of young love (lust)through the wall cutout. The sadness of watching the young lad waiting for Pegola as he ate the whipped cream cupcake.

There was this movie that seemed to have just begun. I sat on the bed for (what I thought would be) a moment to decide whether to keep it on. I started to take off my tie and shoes as I did. . . Nearly three hours later, I realized I had not got beyond that. I had become totally captivated by the violent tale that unfolded on the screen. I've never quite figured out what chord this movie struck within me. Perhaps the terrible waste and regret that arises from the virtually mindless, unbridled pursuit by Noodles and his gang, of their extraordinary appetite for pleasure and wealth? Why I would resonate so strongly with that, I have not tried to fathom.",

1. The set and costume design are gorgeous for every time period, and it's never jarring at all when the film skips to-and-fro from the differing time periods.
2. The violence is incredibly brutal, unforgiving, and highly visceral.
3. The directing, as usual with Sergio Leone (Director), is phenomenal. Every shot has clearly been carefully thought-out.
4. For the most part, the make-up and prosthetics are great, especially when utilised to age the characters.
5. Ennio Morricone (Composer) knocks it out the park again, and his score almost single-handedly creates the emotions in every scene.
6. There are some genuinely heartbreaking moments. For example, when Bugsy (James Russo) shoots Dominic (Noah Moazezi), and Young Noodles (Scott Tiler) gets locked up for avenging him.
7. The rape scene between Noodles (Robert De Niro) and Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern) is suitably uncomfortable, raw, and Elizabeth McGovern nails the scene immensely.
8. Robert De Niro, Elizabeth McGovern, and James Woods (Max) all give amazing performances.
9. The film is essentially a captivating and enthralling tale about facing the consequences of your actions.",

315,30 June 2016,krn-68304,10," Take a bow, Leone.","One can simple say that Once upon a time in America is director Serigo Leone's masterpiece. The Italian director most famous for his curry westerns was offered to direct The godfather which he rejected. Hence came to be this film, as Leone's version of a crime movie, and oh boy it sure does not disappoint! The story follows the protagonist Noodles(Robert De Niro) and his friends through the years, making money through petty crimes until his old age. This movie is apt in exploring friendship, love, betrayal, with so much subtlety and it shows that the movie maker has genuine care for each character. Every character in the movie has its own flaws and the actors portray it masterfully. Robert De Niro gives a masterful performance by being subtle and avoids his usual Deniro mannerisms that we are used to. Through the last half of the movie we can see the regret through his eyes, conveyed so beautifully. Observe his expression in the scene where Deborah leaves and you'll know. James Woods is great in the role of Max and does steal some scenes, especially the one scene with his new chair. The cinematography off this film is top notch. The close ups of the actors look like beautiful portraits and the wide shots are just as beautiful. The score by Maestro Ennio Morricone is haunting, giving a feeling of nostalgia in important scenes.""Deborah's Theme"" is one of my favorite themes of all time and so beautifully used by Leone in this picture. Many people are turned off by the run time of this movie which is almost four hours and complain its slow etc. Well, i request those who are planning to watch this movie to be patient and concentrate and i assure you, it will be rewarding. This movie was Leone's last before his death and it was butchered by the producers- the original being cut by almost 2 hours leading to a mixed reaction by American audiences. Hence i recommend to watch only the 4 hour version and ignore the other version of this movie. Cinephiles, do not miss this one",

There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a ""line up"" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the ""was the whole movie an opium dream ?"" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old.

The contents of an old briefcase serve as an aide memoire as the retrospective illustrates just how he and three of his childhood friends decided that the gutter was not for them, and that using the ""system"" to get on was the only way. Prohibition, violence, crime, brutality were the currency back then and ""Noodles"" learned not to have scruples about such things. Love, romance feature too - choices, compromises and tragedy all feature as Sergio Leone and De Niro immerses us in the characterful and emotionally charged chronology. The film looks great, the attention to detail is superb, and a really strong supporting cast help offer us s sense that we are actually there for much of the time. Living and breathing the squalor, the danger, the opportunity and perhaps, the inevitability, of the paths these kids took in a the 1930s. It is very long, but that's effective rather than dull. It allows the characters to develop, to breathe and then to disappear - only, perhaps, to reappear in a different guise later on. Ageing is also a factor here too - just as they rose, others rise too with differing standards and ethics - their sense of loyalty and integrity not quite marrying up! No Oscar nominations which is really rather odd - this is easily one of the best, most authentic-looking, depictions of the rise of NYC that cinema has ever delivered. Director's cut on a big screen if you can - it helps focus the attention, shows the cinematography to best effect and helps appreciate just how vast Leone's vision was.",

It was a treat to see Jennifer Connelly in her 1st role, and of course it had to be her eyes that got her the part, since Leone tells at least part of his stories with the eyes. This brings up the movie's weakness, the story. I didn't think it was a compelling story, not one to spend 3+ hours on. There weren't many tense moments, unsympathetic main characters that all deserved to die if only for not cracking any good jokes or one liners, and there was none of the sweeping scope that you might expect from a Leone movie.

You care about the characters and you care about what happens to them. The music is perfect for this film. (*SPOILER WARNING*- If you haven't seen the movie yet, stop reading now.) The way Sergio Leone constructs the film with the flashbacks is flat-out brilliant. Robert De Niro is the perfect actor to portray Noodles because he can play him young, a gangster who wants power, and an old man, broken by the knowledge that his phone call to the police to saves his friends from a certain death inadvertently led to a shoot out with the police that caused their deaths anyway. The way De Niro portrays the broken Noodles who is broke in finances and spirit 35 yrs. after his friends' death is what makes his performance wonderful to watch. James Woods is another great actor who plays Noddles closest friend, Max. These two characters and actors make up the heart of the film. The final revelation of the film ties up all the loose ends and completes one of the most brilliant movie puzzles I have ever seen.

Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so).",

Simple story about love, death, betrayal, and redemption, has unmistakeable 70s feel, which was very rare in terrible years of 1980s for a film. Leone gives us something script doesn't: he makes it so slow paced, even simple scenes have some hidden meaning in them, we are allowed to  meditate over characters' routine actions, which makes the most trivial details unusual and enigmatic. The film is nostalgic by the time that never existed. Even if it didn't show anything we haven't seen before, and probably events in the movie couldn't inspire philosophical interpretation, thanks to Leone, after watching ""Once Upon a Time in America"" we have a feeling that we just witnessed something huge and wonderful, even though we are not sure what exactly.",

This new extended version just adds another hour or so of more confusion and general boredom.  What a waste.  This film has some of the finest production values you could ever hope for.  Some of the sets are like time capsules. However, unfortunately for the this viewer the movie comes off as often incoherent and self-indulgent.  Some reviewers seem to like Morricone's soundtrack.

In a movie like this, original music would have been better. Number two, the James Woods' character fakes his death and reinvents himself as a politician and none of his old friends from the neighborhood recognized him as his original person. Also, as great as DeNiro is, he portrayed a Jewish gangster better in Casino but will always look like who he is which is Italian.

I know, it is not easy to follow the plot, because there are a lot of timeline´s to come clear with, but it is worth it. I like movies in which there are a lot of ideas (story and screenplay) guiding you to a final climax at the end of it all. In OUATIA you are told the story´s of a bunch of kids, becoming the mob. It is entertaining the whole time (yes, a little bit slow sometimes,okay) and it leads to the point where it´s obvious that all the lives are just wasted. No friendship and no love does exist in the life of these guys. The way that the movie tells you that, makes me love it. Yes, Noodles is only a character, and the character is a killer, smuggler and whatever, but beholding the wasted life of this man really makes sad!

An obedient film lover will make a list of many reasons why this movie is great. Why it should be on your list of movies to watch and why it should be considered an important work of cinema can be debated and defended time and time again. Still, many will agree that the movie falls short in many ways to be considered a classic. Fans and critics will both agree that Once Upon a Time in American will easily confuse its audience without hardly any trouble. A period piece that jumps around from decade to decade will alone make the time-line confusing to any audience. Throw in character motivation and you have a roller coaster of confusion and endless questioning. With a blockbuster cast of some of the most talented names in Hollywood, and a legendary film maker, it's hard to acknowledge that the end result would be anything less that great. With Once Upon a Time in America, it is just that. Many will support the imperfectness that the movie is by showcasing the several different edited versions and why the final version came to being. Then again, whether or not each version tells a different story, the overall structure of the story still remains. No matter if we have 3 hour or 6 hour version, we are still left with empty characters from the very beginning. With all its faults and mystery that both versions have, the plot, the theme and many of its characters have holes. The potential Once Upon a Time in America had with its reach as a cinematic triumph, falls short from anything spectacular. What could have been one of the best 'American' films, falls among the many mobster flicks which does not do this movie justice.

Oh, how foolish I was. This is the last film by master Sergio Leone, whose filmmaking knowledge is almost god-like, and what a way to finish one's career. It contains probably the cruelest depiction of mafia I've ever seen and it is as realistic as it should be. One of the themes of this film is friendship and bond that these guys once had. As their bond was broken, nothing remained the same. This is a valuable lesson, indeed. Shame on WB studio which cut this masterpiece and made blurry and tragic version without any flashbacks, which ruined Leone's reputation and career. Again, this film is an absolute pleasure and I can't wait to see it again!",
371,4 April 2021,silverton-37959,4, The book deserved better.,"Even though the book was pretty bad, it deserved a better treatment than Leone could deliver.

372,25 January 2022,perica-43151,7, Not as great as other Leone movies,"While the 4 hour cut of the movie is nowadays celebrated as one of the greatest movies ever, it falls far short of masterpieces like Godfather, or other Leone's work. Sure, it has some nice childhood growing-of-gangster-age story, has a few memorable scenes, but the whole 60s section of the movie, which might be a pipe dream, is not so great, and the story, however you interpret it, is not as remarkable. It also all but celebrates rapes done by De Niro character (well cast as rapey gangsters fit his overblown persona nicely, and especially delusional self-absolving and lets forget about my misdeeds and stupidity attitude whilst judging others, in a self-righteous, with zero basis in reality, way). The gratuitous rape sequences and plenty of nudity fit somewhat better into Felliniesque European film tradition, Leone is not Fellini and thus the whole narrative seems to glorify mobster immoralities in a way more subtle works, like Godfather, never do. Subversive element is all but lost and all that is left is not so great, but still solid, ponderings of the older Leone. If you expect a masterpiece on par with Godfather or the best of Leone's own work, you might be quite disappointed. If you expect an overlong movie with some amusing growing of age story that celebrates rape and speaks of rationalizations of the corrupt peoples, with great film music and nice shots, it might be quite OK.",

If you want to see this film make sure you give yourself plenty of time and be patient as it does take a while to get started but it is worth it. It could be described as a gangster movie and it is but there is much more to it than that. It skips generations a few times so you need to give it your full attention.

The non-linear storyline is second to none. Though on the surface, it appears to be another gangster movie, I see it more as a love story. Leone did a superb job of portraying the relationships of Max and Noodles, and Debra and Noodles. James Woods' performance was stellar, and Robert De Niro as always, is on top of his game. The Godfather is definitely the best of the genre. I would rank Once Upon A Time in America as the best gangster movie of all-time had the supporting cast been more visible. Though the supporting cast performances were right on, having some established Hollywood ""names"" might have helped. The Godfather offered a supporting cast that had more household names that the audience could ""connect"" with.

376,9 March 2015,crendine,1, Not Even Close. Leone Fails.,"Of all the entries in the gangster/mob genre, this one is by far, my least favorite. The drawn-out, extended opening of this film sets the stage for a rather lengthy (more than 3 and 1/2 hours) and far-fetched story about the rise of Jewish mobsters in New York City. Although a huge fan of his, I have to admit that this is one film where Robert DeNiro just does not seem to fit. While James Woods turns in a competent performance, he too just seems a bit over the top and unconvincing. The rest of the cast, as well, while convincing at certain points, doesn't seem to gel and many of the scenes should have been shortened or deleted completely. The storyline is poor and leaves nothing memorable. Clearly, this is one genre where Sergio Leone just does not belong.",

384,21 July 2010,jboothmillard,7, Once upon a Time in America,"I knew it was a gangster film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You die, and that was good enough for me, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sergio Leone (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Basically it is a episodic style tale focusing on the lives of a small group of Jewisg gangsters living in New York City, the story spans over forty years. Told in mostly flashbacks and flash-forwards, it mainly looks at small-time crook David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro) and his partners in crime, Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz (James Woods), Philip 'Cockeye' Stein (William Forsythe) and Patrick 'Patsy' Goldberg (James Hayden). It sees them grow up as youths in the rough Jewish neighbourhood of the Lower East Side of New York in the 1920s, the early 1920s Prohibition, and the late 1960s with an elderly Noodles returning to look into his past. I didn't fully understand all of the plot, especially with the mixture of flashing backwards and forwards in time, but you are intrigued to see what situations Noodles and the gang are going to get themselves into. Also starring Elizabeth McGovern as Deborah Gelly, Treat Williams as James Conway O'Donnell, BAFTA nominated Tuesday Weld as Carol, Burt Young as Joe, Joe Pesci as Frankie Manoldi, Danny Aiello as Police Chief Vincent Aiello and Jennifer Connelly as Young Deborah. As I said, I didn't really get the plot, I just enjoyed the actors being rough and in a few scenes quite quiet, the violence and gun play, and some good music by Ennio Morricone. It was apparently a big flop when it was brought out in cinemas, but these days they like to call it a masterpiece, I suppose in certain scenes I'd agree with that, it is about three hours twenty seven minutes long, but it is certainly a different kind of epic crime drams to see. It won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design and Best Score for Ennio Morricone, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Robert De Niro was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",
385,13 July 2006,simonk_h,10, Better than The Godfather,"I can't watch the Godfather. It's so boring! Both these films are slow but there is a difference, which I think I've figured out. Once Upon a Time in America is slow because it has an attitude. This attitude needs to play itself out over each scene. Example: Noodles returns to gang headquarters and stirs his coffee for two minutes. The gang know that something has gone wrong between him and Deborah and want him to discuss it. Noodles does not want to discuss it and so stirs his coffee until someone talks about something else. The Godfather is slow because nothing happens. Example: The scenes in the hospital with Michael and Don Vito. Nothing is going on. It's no fun to watch. It's not entertaining. Still, come to think of it, Once Upon a Time in America is not exactly entertaining as such. Those rape scenes are really horrible and I, personally, can't watch them. However, one can appreciate how great a film it is and what an achievement in story-telling. Leone does not attempt to make these men seem sympathetic because they are bad men. And though it seems simplistic to say it; bad men do bad things. What can you do? That is just one facet of the strength of the movie, though. The child actors are a revelation. The kid who plays Dominic is brilliant, why we never saw more of him and less of Macauly Culkin is anybody's guess. The other thing is that they look just like young versions of the older actors. The final word, however, must go to Robert de Niro and James Woods. James Woods has rarely been better. He's come close, no doubt about that but never bettered. De Niro is on excellent form with a marvellously restrained performance. Sometimes you have to have a protagonist who is not an extrovert and this is just that character. Noodles, as portrayed by De Niro, is unhappy with his lot for several reasons and let's people know about subtley. The best Leone film? Difficult to say. They're all great films so this would definitely rank as one of the best and certainly deserves more praise than it gets, even now, in the film world.",

Preformances are all perfect, direction is unbeatable, how this didn't win any oscars or nominations even, is ludicrous, (Although that is the fault of the distributor for releasing a 'butchered' version of the film). Costumes, sets, everything clicks. Ennio Morricone's music is as outstanding as ever. My favourite parts: The first time cut signified by 'Yesterday'. THe second signified by the frisbee, and the egnimatic ending, in the rubbish truck. Its heavy going at 3 hours 40 mins, but its like eating a large meal. Hard but satisfying.

Although it's quite lengthy, it is continually entertaining, thrilling, and even a little confusing. The scenery of the film is magnificent, as is the way the story is told. Robert DeNiro, as always, is fantastic, but James Woods plays an amazing role that has gained my certain respect. I wished Joe Pesci would have been worked into a bigger role because he is outstanding and hilarious in mob movies, but his minimal screen time and rather insignificant character role can be explained. He would doubtfully fit as any of the main 4, and beyond that are only a couple other key characters and he wouldn't work as any.

The full length, belatedly released, restores to the film the astonishing scope and depth of feeling left on the cutting room floor before its initial opening, and boasts several excellent performances, led by Robert De Niro as the erstwhile street punk who betrays his friends in order to save them. The ambiguous script is still a textbook lesson in narrative overkill, with half a dozen writers contributing episode after incident after colorful digression, and the accumulative effect of the film's three-and-a-half hour running time is finally more exhausting than exhilarating. It's certainly the late director's richest (and, in many ways, most accomplished) feature, mixing equal parts elegance and crudity, not unlike a long, beautifully written poem peppered with gutter expletives.",

How is this film at 8.4...this just goes to show you that there are some films in the top 250 that just don't deserve to be part of the top. The characters in this movie are not memorable, antagonists aren't memorable, dialogue isn't memorable at all...guys this is my advice.,there are other films out there that you will enjoy but this right here don't even bother...it's overrated, bad and I felt like I wasted the whole day of my life because it made me sleepy and had to pause it multiple times.

I've never seen his gladiator movie (who has?) but his westerns are either masterpieces or close to it. That said, great film directors are like great boxers. Too much time out of the ring sucks away their greatness. Leone's thirteen years off did the same to him. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a bad movie, a really bad movie. The first twenty minutes or so are very good but once it flashbacks to the youngsters, the wheels come off. The characters as children are so unsympathetic and uninteresting they kill whatever chance the movie had. Not only that but the young actors all deliver obnoxious performances. The adult cast doesn't fare much better. Some of my favorite actors (James Woods for example) deliver pretty poor performances in this movie. Leone was a master of the anti-hero. This movie doesn't have any anti-heroes. It just has villains. That makes makes for a very uninteresting and very long movie. The only thing this movie has going for it is Ennio Morricone's great music. When ""Once Upon a Time in America"" came out it a ""cause celebre"" with film critics and serious film fans. Long version vs short version. Art vs commerce. I've seen both versions many times. They're both bad movies. The short version is better because it lets you get on with your life a lot sooner.

It started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes.(and yes I did watch the full length version). I love Robert DeNiro and as usual he did a fine acting job, but in all his other gangster films, no matter how many people he kills, I always still had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a lowlife drug-addict, rapist with no care for anyone but himself. Also, James Woods, another fine actor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and he flipped out came completely out of left-field and towards the end the writers just throw in this random comment about how his father died in a nut house and that's why James Woods didn't like being called crazy. So much was left undeveloped in this movie.  Also, we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out more about Joe Pesci's character.  It seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids.  The story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job.  Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and I don't see how anyone can even compare this to the Godfather 1 and 2, or even Goodfellas. I am sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this film",

This film is about a group of kids raised in the gutter.  These friends band to together and form their own crime racket along with an undying bond of loyalty that is too be pushed to its max. The main character, Noodles, unlike many other mob movies, is not the don or the brains, but instead is the heart.  After paying his debt to society Noodles returns to see his friends have gained a nice little slice of the illegal actions of the twenties.

423,5 June 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6, Long but not boring.,"Leone's last film is also his longest, at least in its widely accepted 'complete' version, and it represents his most drastic shift in terms of tone, time-period and, in some ways, theme. 'Once Upon A Time In America (1984)' isn't a western, nor even a proto neo-western, and it shares much more in common with 'serious' 70s movies such as 'The Godfather (1972)' than with its own, often partially light-hearted predecessors. Still, that isn't an inherently bad thing. Neither is the picture's length, which is primarily a product of Leone's desire to take his time with each and every shot while also covering around fifty years of the protagonist's life. Though it does feel a bit baggy and, at times, aimless, taking a pair of scissors to it wouldn't solve anything (as evidenced by the reception of the apparently nonsensical two-hour cut originally shown in the US). For a film that's nearly four hours, it remains surprisingly engaging. It isn't energetic, by any means, but it's always interesting and feels like it knows what it's doing. The movie's most entertaining moments actually come from, essentially, an extended flashback (though, its general time-hopping structure doesn't have a definitive jumping-off point). This part depicts its characters as young teenagers, portraying their initial descent into crime as one of circumstance and naïveté. It's an engaging segment that carries with it a sort of coming of age, and it does a lot of the legwork for the rest of the picture. Once the characters become adults, they're a lot more callous and, as a result, a lot less empathetic. We're aligned with the lead as he's reintroduced to his old friends and is inducted into their new line of work, but he soon slips away from us to become a pretty unlikeable guy. I mean, his instantaneous willingness to rape is enough to prevent any real attachment between audience and character. However, he's still an interesting persona and his journey is one worth watching, especially as it moves into his later years. By the time the ending rolls around, you might have become somewhat numb to the storytelling. It's for this reason that the final act doesn't quite work as well as it, by all rights, should. Don't get me wrong, the ending is good and the moments leading up to it are arguably the flick's most intriguing. It's just that much of the movie - in the second act, especially - kind of stays at one level of intensity, which creates a sort of monotone state that can't be broken simply by a slightly more entertaining sequence. This is perhaps the picture's biggest problem; it simply isn't all that gripping. However, it's enjoyable enough for its majority and it deals with some interesting, if underplayed, themes. Plus, Moriccone's melancholy musical score doesn't disappoint. Ultimately, it's perhaps Leone's weakest major effort, but it's still a good film. If you don't mind its length, it's worth watching once. 6/10",

I know this all sounds very nit-picky as on the whole it is a very well made film,the settings are good,the costumes are great and so is most of the acting.From a historical point of view its very interesting as it shows you how people lived back in the early 30's during the prohibition and depression years.But on the whole i don't feel its the classic i once thought it was.",

Ok, so you presume it is a message to her that she will end up dead unless she does whatever the people intimidating her want her to do. But no. You see, the people who made that scary sign are in the apartment, waiting for her. So why would you go through the trouble of drawing an entire human figure with goddamn bullets as a message if you are going to deliver the message in person? See, it's stupid, And then we get a confusing montage of scenes that are completely baffling and shot in almost complete darkness, so they look even less understandable as well as bizarrely gloomy. And all the while a telephone rings off screen. And it rings. And rings. I actually waited for it to stop ringing before I stopped watching, out of sheer curiosity.

The film has a somewhat complex structure as it switches back and forth between three eras (1920's, 30's, 60's). Despite its extreme length, it manages to sustain interest thanks to Leone's masterful direction and excellent period detail, reminiscent of The Godfather Part II. The film is at its best in showing the early years in New York City, beautifully evoking a bygone era. The child actors, including a young Jennifer Connelly, are very good. The script leaves some loose ends (who the men are chasing DeNiro at the beginning is never explained, the Pesci character abruptly disappears) but is still satisfying.

Having said that, it is also true that the attention to detail and the lavish sets make the nearly four our of watching never a chore. Then there is also Robert De Niro who lifts the movie above an ordinary gangster flick. Arguably, one of the best things about the movie is the music, but since God Bless America was used so movingly in the ending of The Deer Hunter (also with De Niro), it was in poor taste to use it as the final song six years later again so stridently. The actors playing the gangsters as boys and those playing the gangsters as adults are all fine. With all that, what a pity that the movie finally fails. It does so in the sense that the ending is a farce, something that sits poorly with an epic movie, and it does so in the sense that it makes the mistake of practicing alchemy, of distilling friendship and love and sensitivity from a group of extraordinary vicious men, murderers whose sense of humor is expressed in swapping babies in a nursery. The viewer is asked to believe that these cockroaches are capable of great sensitivity.

So watch Goodfellas and The Godfather and you'll see the same movie as Once Upon a Time in America wants to be and you'll have spent approximately the same amount of time but you won't be bored to numbness.

To note, I watched the 229min version which admittedly at times plodded a little bit. Nonetheless I enjoyed the younger boys in their trouble-making and growing up very much. It was a good evolution of mishievousness changing into crime and mayhem. The relationships between the lead boys and then later Woods and Deniro helped pillar the movie. The violence was at times more than needed unfortunately (or fortunately if you like that kind of thing) - note an overlong rape seen which dragged on in poor taste. Music also became repetitive. Nonetheless the setting and characters were well developed and realized, definitely worth a rental especially if you like crime/gangster movies.",

Basically, the epic story of a jewish mobster in early 20th century america, and his quest to be rich and powerful with his friends. To me, this doesn't measure up to any of Leone's westerns, or the Godfather (to which it compares). The problem isn't in the cinematography, the acting, or the dialogue, and the music wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. The plot is okay; the jumping back and forth doesn't work as well here as it does in The Godfather part 2, but it's alright. The big problem and the worst part of the movie is the main character - he's almost completely unlikeable. He's a rapist, and he does it a lot. He isn't shown in any sympathetic light at all, and he isn't even a charming kind of evil (like Alex from A Clockwork Orange). De Niro plays him fine, I just find him to be a poorly written or thought up character, who drags the whole movie down.",

I am normally very good at staying with a movie that jumps around but this was a nightmare. It might have made a genuine epic if the tale was told chronologically rather than the backward / forwards mess it became.,

I would argue that it is the latter, as Sergio Leone has been raised to a mythical status due to his unique directing talents and the success of the four western films he directed. Despite what Leone brought to this film (and his signature techniques are all at work here), that alone does not make a great film, and unfortunately ""Once Upon a Time in America"" suffers from several key shortcomings.

While he's best known for his Spaghetti Westerns, he did make a few films like Once Upon a Time in America (1984). One does wonder if Leone was given free rein with this film, as it was probably an hour longer than it needed to be and included a lot of situations that could have been cut out, or at least trimmed down. If anything, it's clear directors like Quentin Tarantino were influenced by movies like this, considering some of the similarities between it and Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood (2019).",

No, the film should not have been cut down and butchered beyond all recognition as was the case with its original American theatrical release. Somewhere in between there must be a happy medium. But given the choice between the two extremes it is certainly much better that we are able to see the film as director Sergio Leone intended for it to be seen. Leone's vision for how the story should unfold is what makes the film unique. At times it can be a frustrating film to watch with its exceptionally deliberate pacing. There are certainly times while watching the film where you wish Leone would pick up the pace and move things along. But upon reflection, after seeing the whole film in its entirety, only then can you really appreciate what Leone has done. It's a terrific story and it's a story which is told in a simply brilliant manner. Yes, the film drags at times. Yes, there certainly could have been some cuts here and there to make the running time more manageable. But in the end there is no denying that the film works. It's by no means perfect. There are notable lulls and lesser moments scattered throughout. But the film as a whole ends up being greater than the sum of its parts.

The rape scene in the car was hard to watch almost too real but gangsters are not nice people and maybe films made today glorify it too much. The fact who got the girl was a good twist to the film.

The plot line is incredibly thin and you can predict what will happen in virtually every single scene. I've never seen such a waste of good actors and production. The only comparison there is between this and The Godfather is that both contain violence - that's it. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. De Niro snoozes his way through the entire movie - I get the feeling he knew it was a hump. For a movie with Joe Pesce, where the hell was he? One scene? Way to go on character development. And the female lead - while De Niro ages into a sixty-something - she doesn't change a bit! And Woods looks eighty! No explanation of how Woods got to be who he is at the end - zero.

The sets and costumes give an amazing picture of the setting-New York in 1918, the early 1930s and 1968. Each shot can be considered a work of art and would be able to pass as a genuine photograph of the time period. The art direction even makes the film itself appear to be made long before 1984. The score by Ennio Morricone is also amazing and perfectly matches the visuals.
The two protagonists, Noodles and Max are both very well written and they develop into completely different people over the course of the story. It's fascinating to watch Noodles reflect on his past life in the 1968 segment, which is interspersed throughout the film. There is also a plot twist revealed at the end which, while not exactly mindblowing, was well foreshadowed and executed. Similarly, the opening segments don't really make sense until a second viewing.
It is a very long film and the camera often lingers on mundane things for a long time, but I personally wasn't bothered by this.

483,21 March 2023,davispro,10," A beautifully dark, visually, audibly, literally and intellectually stunning masterpiece","This film takes its time to tell the story it wants to tell, it doesnt hurry up to please a lazy viewer. The audience has to *want* to soak up the details to appreciate the depth it offers. The film depicts the stories a man thinks about his entire life. The formative days, the good times, the friends, the enemies, the atrocities, the impulses, the growth, the digestion and the regrets. It captures just exactly *how* life is. Main characters do not have to be redeemable to the audience, only to themselves. Noodles finds a way to dream a reality where he is not responsible for the bad things he did to the people that he loved. In the end, he smiles and laughs because he never had to care what others thought, he needed to believe for some reason, what he did was the right thing to do in his own mind. The film shows a modern viewer what New York City was really built on, what it looked and felt like, and how fortunes were made. A tough place, full of scrappy individuals that could make a buck from nothing at all. A city of fresh immigrants and opportunity, legal and illegal. The film doesnt try to hide the sex exploitation that NYC used to thrive on. It doesnt hide the violent past the city has hidden in the cobblestones, nor the envy and betrayal that fueled it. Leone captures it all. Then there is the score. The composition fits snuggly with eachs scene and carries the emotion even further. Each time Cockeye plays his theme it is like turning the page on a new chapter. 4 hours and 10 minutes of pure artistic cinematic history. If only sergio could see his masterpiece today.

This is a great journey that in the end, goes nowhere. I have no problem with a long story, or with the jumping back and forth in time, or with the many plot lines.

And I don't buy into the theory that this was all an opium-induced dream. If that were the case, this whole damn story would be totally pointless, just a waste of time.

I liked it and I thought most of the performances were top notch especially James Woods and of course my favorite actor, Robert DeNiro. The screenplay is greatly written, the dialogue is fantastic, and most of all Ennio Morricone's score is terrific. For the first two hours, the movie was excellent. Everything was going great and there was such great scenes and great storytelling. The problem I had was the next two hours of the film, which I thought was pretty flat. There were a couple memorable scenes, but I thought that most scenes of the second part were boring and could've been a lot better. Overall, this is a good 4 hour movie that leaves Sergio Leone on a great note for many fans, but this could've been a perfect 10 for me if the second part of the film wasn't flat, since the first two hours of the film were fantastic.

BUT this picture is just flat out Amazing.
The music is spectacular and composed by Leone's life long friend Ennio Morrcione a oscar award winning composer ! And the actors really delivered a breathtaking performance . James woods showed such raw and great talent throughout the film as Max and when you combine a young Robert deniro with a director and acting cast of this type you will be left amazed like I was . I love how Leone took some ideas from all different films and added it to this one which went on to be his last before he passed away . He used flashback scenes to tell a story about a Jewish gang through the probation era and how young poor street thugs became successful Criminals also showed how in that life of crime friends and family mean nothing and being DEAD or being BETRAYED is the only way. I was lil upset on how Lil of a role Joe Pesci played in this film Fresh off a great performance with fellow castmate Robert deniro In RAGING BULL.
I couldn't believe how long the movie was and expected it to be long and boring I WAS sadly mistaking every minute of it is amazing and you really have to pay attention to every single detail or you might miss something . IT was truly amazing story telling this movie has everything from romance to murder it will change you're way on how you look at movies and gangsters it's a great ride from start to finish. The dialogue is very clever the conversations seem very realistic and legit .
They just don't make movies like this anymore
It's a shame it didn't get any oscars or the respect it deserves !! Because the of the 144 min version ! This movie should be seen in one way and one way only the 4 hour LEONE version not the short edited one .
Other than that ENJOY cause you will be watching a top ten movie of all time in my opinion and the best film from the 80's in this genre . If you think I'm crazy just ask Quentin Tarantino",

I love the music, I love the way the film is done and I love the acting. This big epic is one of the best gangster films ever.",
501,4 July 2020,zawad360,10, Flawless crime depiction!,"I've followed Crime genre quite well but this piece of film has a specialty. It perfectly portraits emotions and feelings alongside the main storyline. I can't remember any crime film that had such beautiful depiction of relationships among criminals. This is a complete film and I'll rate it higher than any other crime film I've watched (worth mentioning I find it better than Godfather, Goodfellas and so on)",
502,1 May 2019,jimmyjoe583,5, Oy Vey!,"The version I am reviewing is called the directors cut. It is 4 hours and 11 minutes long!
Leone was aiming for EPIC here but it feels more like overwrought and overly long. Not every Italian director is Bertolucci or even Coppola!
This movie is about a old gangster who is summoned home and reflecting upon his youth and young adulthood as a gangster in same city.
The actors do their usual best but poor plot lines and editing between flashback and current scenes bog down the film.
The female leads are nothing but sex objects and there is no effort to flesh out or address their actions.
Leone does a good job of giving screen time to all the child actors but as adults De Niro and Woods deserve and garner most of the screen time.
There are several huge plot holes in the film I saw that are beyond the pale and greatly reduce the impact of this film.",

506,4 July 2021,Bigweight66,5," Unless your a HUGE De Niro fan, I can't recommend you sit through 229 minutes of this!","Once Upon a Time in America is a movie that follows the lives of 5 friends and their associates from 1918 to 1968. As youths the 5 friends thrive on being petty criminals in New York, and they start to move up the ladder with their criminal activities. Their friendships are strong, they manage to build up a large sum of money, and enjoy the benefits that come with having money. As men they become fully fledged gangster's, and lives are lost a long the way. The movie's story telling bounces from decade to decade in flash back style. The ending is a bit puzzling and not what might have been expected.",
507,1 March 2021,josephjanaskie,10," Simplicity, Complexity, Suspense","Once Upon a Time in America should be regarded as a prototype for every one of its subsequent films in association to suspense. The entire film adds suspense upon suspense. Its extreme close ups, slow camera movements, and slow acting play vitally to layer onto the already intense suspense. Watching De Niro's minute long reactions and expressions repeatedly may seem like it gets old, but these reactions are telling and pieces of fantastic acting.",
508,30 January 2020,isantistao,6," A Good Movie, But Too Long & Disturbing","This movie is good...could be great...but it is just way too long and it is also too disturbing. It is 4 hours long, which would be find if that time wasn't filled with excessive gazing and staring off into space, and scenes where it just felt like the movie was taking a long pause. So much of it really needed to be edited out, the film really should be half as long.",
509,25 June 2020,karanjdhv-37323,9, Master Piece from Leone,"The pace of the movie is very slow so you have to wait for the movie to really kick start it till a good 20-30 mins. Eventually you will get to know all about noodles, his growing up experiences , his love , friends and how they start a gang to enter into the crime world. Eventually he retires one day when one of the main leader(Max) of the gang dies and noodles end up regretting it for 35 years that he was responsible for killing his friend(Max). The last twist of the movie brings down curtains on the betrayal that noodles has had all his life. He just smiles in the end without taking any revenge on anything he just accepts what wrong had been done to him.",
510,25 May 2007,mlraymond,6," Strange, sad movie about friendship, aging, love and betrayal","This movie has a haunting quality that makes it literally unforgettable. I've seen it twice now; once several years ago on television in a heavily edited version, and recently in the full director's cut, nearly four hour version.",
511,6 September 2001,parableofthebeast,2," almost good, but not really: too long, too dark, horrible score","There are some excellent scenes in this movie, chilling, moving, brilliant. But it is far too long and the jusxtaposition of events in random chronolobical order doesn't work. The strongest scenes are invariably followed by long, dull, slow moving, darkly lit, introverted characterization, as De Nero tries to pull off something. What that something is remains unclear. The movie fails at penetrating the surface of its intent - see movie description. We really don't come to understand much except that De Nero can smile after 30 years of being lost and betrayed. His final smile borders on ludicrous. The lighting and perhaps the worst musical score imagineable make a shambles of the movie's pace and continuity. It's too long, too poorly edited, and fails to develop the more than a few remarkable scenes and bring us something, anything, beyond random snap shots or old hand held 8mm home movies about some time and some place in the early part of the 20th century. The characters and their stories loose their vitality and are finally unrecognizable.",
512,8 February 2007,kaiserschosse,10, < about friendship and betrayal >,"The best i've ever seen, it's a incredible movie, musics are unbelievable, marvelous, magnificent,amazing, splendid; these words are not enough:) Ennio Morricone is great composer, this is something shall never happen again therefore respect and greet the precious highness, really wanna cry.. :(( i always like mafia style movies but this one is more different than the others, i was a kid when i was first saw this movie,it was very long one, but i never got bored and wanted never ends,now i watched hundreds of them but this one is unforgettable, because it's about friendship and betrayal, i mean so pure and simple and loyalty maybe the most important thing for me. I can never forget the last screen-shot the smile of De Niro,was like the meaning of life:) all actors played superb, and the director did his best job,many thanks to everyone in the movie.. ",
513,6 February 2006,wesley_j_ramos,1, What is all the fuss about?,"This film looked beautiful and pitting Jennifer Connelly to play a young Elizabeth McGovern is a brilliant piece of casting. But the rest of the film falls terribly short. The story is all over the place, the direction is utterly confusing, the script is laughable and, despite the great cast, the acting is pathetic at best. I've seen two versions of this film and it gets worse and worse every time. I'm not too sure how director Sergio Leone envisioned this film, but it felt like Leone lost his focus and tried to put two small overblown films into one hugely overblown film. How on earth this film got onto IMDb's top 250 is beyond me. I think Once Upon a Time in America may fall into the category of being ""voted"" a great film based on the names in the cast and production crew.",
514,10 March 2000,allan57,10, this is the greatest movie ever...,"this has to be the greatest movie ever...why is hard to say. maybe for the soundtrack alone,possibly! it is a very emotional and i felt harrowing at times, yet also inspiring in its portrayal of these young mens lives until old age,dont miss it and watch it over and over again.......",
515,26 December 2018,supersaiyanwarrior,10, A bomb,"Sometimes I am not able to decide whether the GODFATHER or '
Once upon a time in AMERICA' Is the best gangster flick or the best movie in world. Excellent music by ennio moriccone and direction of sergio leone brings you back to the sphagetti western era. A very accurate portrayed of the old New York. A must watch for anyone. GREAT ACTING BY DE NIRO.",

Let me tell you that I am a bottom line guy. And the bottom line is that the movie, IMO is flat-out boring. I tried so hard after reading the overwhelming amount of positive reviews on it. In fact let's start with the positives. There are good aspects to the film.",
517,4 December 2013,user-861-315519,10," Fidelity, Friendship and betrays","Childhood memories was beautiful once upon a time. As four brothers, they never abandoned each other. Noodle even sacrificed few years for revenge for his friends. Such a moving story. But if it just end like that it would not be a good movie. Why it is the best? Because it not only showed the best part of human virtue, it also showed the rotten one. Max, the big brother, dominated everything. For avarice, money and power, he killed all of his friends, the one that helped and accompanied him since he was young. This is life. With friendship, we can enjoy the best ever. We can share bitterness and happiness with them. However, betray also exist. It might make us sad but it is just what life like, ups and downs. Even though I watched it few months ago, the pictures were still clearly in my mind. The most impressive part is noodle I slipped. Ps. the music was gorgeous childhood memory and yesterday it is the best movie ever!!!",
518,18 April 2015,Zachaban,2, Stick with the westerns,"First of all: It would take a lot of excitement and quality to justify four hours of runtime. This is simply not given. The scenes drag for no apparent reason. A long intermission between sentences can have a strong impact on occasion, but not if it's in almost every scene. An ugly rape scene has zero consequence - when the involved characters meet again, it is like nothing has happened.",
519,10 September 2021,zwdg97,2, Cupcakes are better than sex.,"I love mob movies. They're one of my favourite genres, and most of my favourite movies are 3 hours or longer. Usually the story calls for it. However once upon a time in America has to be one of the most overrated, boring, poorly written movies I have ever seen. There is no redeeming qualities. Scenes are either boring or aggravating because they're so bloody bad. If you want to see DeNiro go watch the Irishman or one of the many other movies in his catalogue.",

I am a fan of great movies and unintentionally horrible movies. There are many movies that have given me great joy over the years. Many are like girlfriends. You become infatuated with them and for a brief moment, they are the most beautiful thing in the world. But, there is only one movie that has been my constant friend and companion for a large part of my life, and that is Once Upon A Time in America.",
