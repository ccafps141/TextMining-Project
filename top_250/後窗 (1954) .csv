0,3 December 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Well of course when you've got nothing better to do with a broken leg you will accuse your neighbor of murder!,"Finally, I watched ""Rear Window"" by famous Alfred Hitchcock. First off, I saw this movie on the top 250, and it's #14 on top of that! I mean, it's gotta be great or a classic, right? Also, I'm a fan of the Simpsons, and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife, Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie ""Rear Window"", I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show, but it's a good reference if it's from The Simpsons.",/
1,10 April 2001,FlickJunkie-2,10, Another Hitchcock masterpiece,"Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?",r
2,22 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Sophisticated Hitchcock, with a wonderful performance from James Stewart!","Rear Window is a one of the more sophisticated Hitchcock films, and I will always consider it a masterpiece. It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as ""the villain of the piece,"" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",e
3,15 January 2004,Quinoa1984,10," In the mid-fifties, Hitchcock brought remarkable suspense by reverting to the logic of a silent film (with an observer behind the lens as the hero)","Many reviewers and critics have commented on Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the voyeur in Rear Window (the mere thought of a voyeur in a suspense film conjures up images from other classic Hitchcock films), and I felt that voyeuristic bug as well.  But I realized something that I hadn't thought of as I watched it for the first time- this is a return for Hitchcock to his skills as a master of silent-film chills.  As L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart in one of his most infamous performances) is in his wheelchair viewing out one perspective to other inhabitants in the apartment, the audience views right along-side him.  So, for more or less 50 percent of the film, the only sounds we hear are the sounds of mere realism, as Hitch's camera keeps a close eye on things.  ",v
4,8 April 2004,dxia,10, Our Obsession with Voyeurism,"After viewing 'Rear Window' again, I've come to realize that Alfred Hitchcock was not only a great moviemaker but also a great moviewatcher. In the making of 'Rear Window,' he knew exactly what it is about movies that makes them so captivating. It is the illusion of voyeurism that holds our attention just as it held Hitchcock's. The ability to see without being seen has a spellbinding effect. Why else is it so uncommon to have characters in movies look directly into the camera? It just isn't as fun to watch someone when they know you're there. When we watch movies, we are participating in looking into another world and seeing the images of which we have no right to see and listening to the conversations that we should not hear. 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom' are some of the best movies that aren't afraid to admit this human trait. We are all voyeurs.",i

6,15 April 2018,yocarlosvarelapr,10, Rear Window is 64,"I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?",w
7,16 August 2002,DennisLittrell,8, Midcentury voyeurism,"This is the quintessential Hitchcock flick, easy to understand, addictively interesting, featuring great stars (Grace Kelly and James Stewart), familiar bit players (Thelma Ritter in one of her best roles as Stewart's talkative nurse), and a kind of almost imperceptible satire on the human animal. In this case, Hitchcock has glorious fun displaying a whole range of human behaviors through the device of watching them through a Greenwich Village rear window before the age of air conditioners when everyone had to leave their windows open (and some even slept on the fire escapeâ€“I've done that) to cope with the appalling heat and humidity during an eastern seaboard heatwave.",/
8,24 November 2004,dtb,10, Reading from Top to Bottom...Hitchcock's Sophisticated Masterpiece,"Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (""Miss Torso""), then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed.",r
9,8 April 2001,telegonus,9, The Master In Control,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience's thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors' private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he's looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly's) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn't trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It's a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock's first truly 'fifties' film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he'd been doing before. There's less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it's romantic about couples and cynical about people. There's a little bit of everything in it,--it's a work of art.",w
10,30 December 2005,bkoganbing,9, Enforced Idleness,"Alfred Hitchcock's second film with James Stewart is the story of Stewart's enforced idleness due to a broken leg.

11,12 February 2018,bLuR-7,9, First-rate thriller,"Having watched it for the second time recently, I was struck by how razor-sharp the film's script actually was. Sure, it didn't have a big Agatha Christie-type mystery reveal; but the banter and repartee between the main characters was just so well-written. Of course, the film's framing and camerawork is legendary (for good reason) and Grace Kelly has a luminous screen presence. Suspenseful, intriguing, and a film that shows off a master at the peak of his craft.",0
12,30 October 2005,moonspinner55,8," A colorful, friendly story...about a murder","Exceptionally likable movie about a desperate killer and his secret murder, yet also one about the bond of friendships and the camaraderie which arises in the face of exciting danger. Photographer James Stewart, laid up with a broken leg, gets to know the neighbors in his housing complex--by watching them all day out his back window (it's a sticky hot summer and everyone has their lashes up). This Alfred Hitchcock thriller gets off on the wrong foot by introducing Stewart's love-interest, Grace Kelly, rather clumsily. Kelly is supposed to look out of place in Stewart's rumpled apartment, with her designer dresses and Park Ave. manner, and we're meant to see that they are possibly an inappropriate match; however, Kelly's character wounds too easily, and the argument that ensues between she and Stewart isn't convincing. Luckily, she's allowed to warm up soon after, and she's wonderful when teamed with Thelma Ritter as Stewart's sharp little nursemaid. Ritter, in one of her best roles, keeps score on all that's going on and soon all three are involved in some mysterious doings happening across the courtyard. Dandy yarn has one of the most satisfying wrap-ups for a Hitchcock picture, and three fine actors who really get into these roles. It's squirrelly and suspenseful, quite amiable and masterfully done. ***1/2 from ****",5

14,5 March 2006,EUyeshima,10," Voyeurism, Murder, Stewart and Kelly Make for a Hitch High","It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films, but 1954's ""Rear Window"" is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like ""Miss Torso"" and ""Miss Lonelyhearts"". But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.",8

16,7 February 2018,Coventry,4," I spy, with my little eye, the most overrated Alfred Hitchcock thriller.","This is likely to go down as the least popular user-comment in history, but then so be it. I believe in honesty and freedom of speech. Although universally considered as one of the top three (or maybe top five) best thrillers that Alfred Hitchcock made in his lengthy and undeniably brilliant career, I personally feel that ""Rear Window"" is the most overrated movie of all times and I sincerely can't fathom why it's such a cinematic landmark. I reckon that the basic plot idea is utmost intriguing and that it's rather inventive how the cameras film literally everything from within the same secluded living room location, but that about sums up all the film's strengths. The narcistic photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) sits immobilized in his apartment, bound to both a wheelchair and a humongous plaster cast around his leg ever since he took too much risk during a photo shoot on a racetrack. Purely out of boredom, he begins to watch all his neighbors across the little cement garden. The watching quickly turns into observing with binoculars and then into spying with his most professional & strongest photo lenses. He then thinks he witnesses a middle-aged man murdering his wife in cold blood, but a befriended police inspector, his lovely girlfriend and even his nosy housekeeper have trouble believing him. I was particularly annoyed by the behavior and ignorance of the protagonist. Jeff is supposed to be an intelligent person, so he must understand or at least respect that the police can't just go invading someone's private property and interrogate them about a possibly felony for which there isn't any evidence. The entire film evidently revolves on L.B. Jefferies' arrogant persona, and of course it doesn't help that I never really liked the actor James Stewart. I can appreciate him when his characters aren't omnipresent, like in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" for example, but here he was rapidly getting on my nerves. The other characters, including Grace Kelly who never looked prettier, are downgraded to mere extras. I am also aware that practically every review praises that the powerful impact of ""Rear Window"" lies in the fact that it's a statement on the human towards voyeurism and blah blah, but to me a film has to be entertaining and plausible first and foremost.

17,17 July 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,10, Nosy neighbour.,"'Rear Window (1954)' is one of the greatest films of all time, a thriller that does more with its single location than most movies do with their entire world. With restrained yet masterful direction, a witty yet suspenseful script and down-to-earth yet powerhouse performances, the piece solidifies itself as one of the most gripping, edge-of-your-seat and exciting experiences of its kind. That's even more impressive when you consider that its protagonist is wheelchair-bound for its duration and that the only real danger to him comes towards the flick's explosive final third. It's just phenomenal, really. It sucks you in straight away and doesn't let you go until it ends, keeping you watching with bated breath and smiling lips. It's so well-crafted in every aspect that it's difficult to find any flaws with it, however small they may be. It really is one of the most enjoyable pictures... well, ever. I love it. 10/10",/
18,31 March 2022,PCC0921,10," Raymond Burr was born on May 21st, 1917","Voyeurism, the stimulation of the libido and a slick murder mystery are the key instruments used by Hitchcock in Rear Window (1954). However, the most important aspect of this film, that must garner attention, is the incredible sense of timing, in all aspects of this film. Just like the magic he was able to tap into, six years earlier, with Rope (1948), the timing in this film is perfect also. I guarantee something like this could not be duplicated today the way it was then. Today's filmmakers would wind up using computers, CGI effects and every other technological trick available in the 21st century, but all Hitchcock had was a stopwatch. The fact that Hitchcock was able to orchestrate all of this is incredible. Each window is its own movie or play, that has to start and end on time, so the camera can move onto the next window. Each actor had to be ready to say their line, pick up a newspaper or play a song on the piano in the allotted amount of time needed.",?

25,20 November 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," One of the greatest Hitchcock films, but not his best","While Psycho is still my favorite Hitchcock film, this comes very, very close to that. Having only seen the made-for-TV remake starring Christopher Reeves, I was quite excited to see this, as it's referred to by many as one of the(if not the) greatest Hitchcock thriller. Now, while I still prefer Psycho over this, I must say that it's a very well-done and effective mystery-thriller, and most of the second half had me almost biting my nails from suspense. The plot is very good, and its theme appeals to some of the most base instincts, including the tiny little voyeur that we all have. The pace is great, I was never bored during any point of the movie. The acting is great, Stewart and Kelly give excellent performances. The characters are all well-written, credible, and, as they almost always are under Hitchcock's direction; very human. The cinematography is excellent; most of the camera angles are from inside the main character's apartment, which creates a very effective and scary feeling of claustrophobia and adds to the suspense. The mystery keeps you guessing throughout the movie, but the ending seemed a little like a letdown... there's no definite answer to the mystery. Then again, maybe that was Hitchcock's intention... to any true mystery, there is no real answer. And Hitchcock probably wanted to have each viewer make up an answer for him- or herself. The film has some great suspense, and a few of the scenes will have you sitting at the edge of your seat. The ending was very close to being anticlimactic, but it managed to make up for it by having one of the most thrilling and nail-biting endings in a Hitchcock film ever. The main reason I rate Psycho higher than this on a personal scale is that the theme works better there... the killer is more easily understandable, while here he's just... well, sloppy and arrogant, half of the time. That was my one complaint while watching the movie, and it won't bring down my rating, not even a notch, because I'm positive it was the way Hitchcock intended it to be. His characters are always human, and what is more human than failing? I recommend this film to any fan of thriller, mystery and/or Hitchcock. You won't be disappointed. Great film. 10/10",t

Before setting out on the journey, if you are given a synopsis, it's difficult to imagine how the slight story can hold one's attention for nearly two hours. There are in effect multiple plots extending beyond the suspected murder. Each apartment holding it's own narrative and inviting the viewer into the private lives of the block.

It's a bit weird actually how you find yourself anticipating Jeffries' reactions because you're thinking the way he does as he scans his neighbors' apartments in an almost lurid act of voyeurism.

Forget about the murderer for a minute and consider every other tenant featured in their mini-vignettes - Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, the Songwriter, the newlyweds, the doggy elevator couple.

When he suspects his neighbor of cheating and about to leave his wife he notices he starts acting funny. Then one day something horrible seems to have happened and the neighbors wife seems missing.

This movie is directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) and stars James Stewart (Vertigo), Princess of Monaco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨ Grace Kelly (To Catch A Thief) and Thelma Ritter (All About Eve). The acting in this is out of this world as James Stewart and Kelly play off eachother well and portray the evolution of their characters throughout the film perfectly. The script is excellent as you'd expect from Hitchcock and the intensity of the events - both across the street and within the relationship are well depicted. Grace Kelly continues the list of blond bombshells Hitchcock targeted as actresses that were both gorgeous and over the top talented. This entire movie is essentially on one set and is still so good. The scenarios that unfold during the peeping Tom moments are fun and the ending is intense and well executed. This is a Hitchcock gem that is a must see and a solid 9-9.5/10.",

James Stewart plays a photographer laid up in a wheelchair in his apartment where observing his neighbors passes the time. There is Miss torso the ballet dancer whose apartment is frequented by bachelors. Miss Lonely Hearts is the opposite and sinks into a depression. The struggling pianist stoops to alcohol to cope with failure. The newly weds arrives where passion turns to nagging demands. Finally there is the salesman whose ill nagging wife suddenly disappears and Stewart believes murder has taken place. Fantastic suspense masterpiece told completely by observation. Stewart is excellent as a man with limited resources but becomes paralyzed with horror when he can only watch. It is interesting that his one weapon is his profession. Grace Kelly is gorgeous as a woman whose lifestyle eludes him yet she welcomes adventure in the form of seeking evidence. Thelma Ritter plays Stewart's visiting nurse who adds sound advice and also welcomes adventure.

Playing in the background is a peaceful score and after about one minute and forty seconds of credits and a static camera, Hitchcock moves us outside that window, showing us the sights of the village's backyard. From flower beds, to cats lounging around, to a dog being transported from the top balcony to the ground below, etc, the sight is familiar and commonplace to this specific setting.

38,6 November 2008,writers_reign,5, Tenement Symphony,"Hitchcock buffs often point out that his serious movies are laced with laughs and this one has a terrific laugh toward the end. Murder suspect Raymond Burr has been lured out of his apartment in order that Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter can dig up the flowerbed. Frustrated to find nothing Kelly enters his apartment in search of evidence. Stewart, watching from across the courtyard, sees Burr returning and unable to warn Kelly rings the police - after first looking up the number - explains that a man is assaulting a woman (not true, though he IS about to) and - wait for it - the police ARRIVE inside five minutes. I mean is this funny or not. I seem to be saying the same thing over and over; namely that Hitchcock is vastly overrated. Why then do I watch his films. Well you might ask. The short answer is that I know a lot of people, some of them are even friends, who have, in my opinion, fallen for the hype, because by now the myth is self-perpetuating, and keep pressing dvds on me in the hope of converting me. They're something akin to those well-meaning folks who can't see an unattached person without attempted matchmaking. So far I'm holding out. Whilst I acknowledge a competent filmmaker that's as far as it goes. On the other hand any director would have his work cut out to coax even a mediocre, let alone a bad performance out of Jimmy Stewart just as any director would have his work cut out to elicit anything resembling acting from Grace Kelly. So now we have a stand-off. On the plus side we have Thelma Ritter, who enhances anything she appears in but then he spoils it again by casting ex-Forestry Commission employee Wendell Corey. Not as bad as To Catch A Thief but then what is.",

One of them, a salesman (Raymond Burr), seems to dispose of his nagging, invalid wife by chopping her up and removing her body in sections, but Stewart has no evidence. Gradually, he draws his nurse (Thelma Ritter) into his web of convictions, then his girl friend (Grace Kelly, than whom no girl friend is more gracious -- or better looking for that matter, all that nacreous beauty coiled around a soft pink core). But he is unable to convince his ""ornery old friend"", the police detective, Wendell Corey, that anything is wrong.

This is, above any story that can be explored during its narrative, a declaration of love for cinema and a tribute to the spectator. Just as Jeff inserted himself into the lives of strangers, trying to decipher their secrets, dramas and complexities, the movie viewer puts himself in the same role; the role of observer.

43,4 July 2021,nickenchuggets,9," ""You're great at creating difficult situations.""","Rear Window is a movie that is often hailed as Hitchcock's best, which in my mind, is a pretty polarizing statement. After seeing it, I thought it was real good, but there's some other things he directed that are better. I still like this movie because it is similar to Rope in many ways. Both have James Stewart, both involve somebody trying to hide something, and both take place in largely one area. The movie's story involves a guy called Jeff (James Stewart) who is temporarily confined to a wheelchair because his leg is broken. The rear window of his apartment offers a good view of other people's apartments. One person that lives within Jeff's field of vision is Lars Thorwald, who seems to have a lot of arguments with his wife (who is immobilized). Jeff is friends with Lisa (Grace Kelly), who visits him sometimes, but isn't convinced when Jeff tells her the guy in the apartment across from his is mentally unstable. Soon, he observes Lars taking out a large saw and a knife. Jeff is fairly certain by now Lars killed his wife and buried her in the flower bed outside his apartment. His suspicion is confirmed when someone's dog is killed by Lars because it tried digging near the flowers. Shortly after this, Jeff is now positive Lars did it to cover himself. Jeff anonymously calls Lars and tells him to meet him somewhere to lure him away from his apartment, which allows Lisa to dig up the flowers. To everyone's surprise, there's nothing under them. Lisa then decides to do something unprecedented. She climbs into Lars' apartment herself and tries to find evidence that he killed his wife. Just then, Lars comes back to his apartment and finds her there, and a very awkward confrontation ensues where he tries to strangle her. Jeff is forced to call the cops to rescue her, but it backfires since she is arrested for breaking in. Before she is taken away by cops, she makes a gesture to Jeff, pointing to Mrs. Thorwald's ring on her finger, which implies she is not dead. Lars also catches on to what she is doing and realizes she's gesturing to somebody who is watching them both. After this, Lars has had enough and goes to confront Jeff man to man. He attempts to murder Jeff by pushing him out his window, but Jeff uses his camera bulbs to blind him. Lars is apprehended, and Jeff is actually pushed out the window. It doesn't kill him, but now his other leg is broken too. Rear Window as a whole has many moments and plot elements that we've come to associate with Hitchcock, such as twists, betrayals, and obviously, suspense. James Stewart always manages to deliver a top of the class and memorable performance, and this is no different. Despite not having use of his leg, he pursues his belief that Lars is a murderer relentlessly. Grace Kelly as his friend Lisa is shown to be much more than just a love interest for him, since she eventually has enough bravado to search Lars' rooms herself. Maybe I was too hard earlier when I wrote that it's not up to Hitchcock's usual standards. He still manages to create a very nice movie centered around a suspected killer, and that's not an easy task. Along with movies such as 39 Steps, North by Northwest and The Lodger, this is one of his most well made films and will continue to be admired for years to come.",
44,24 September 2018,gab-14712,9, Incredibly Suspenseful and Tense!,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's most important auteurs and every motion picture release with his name attached was a big event. The sharp-detailed director had two movies released in 1954. The first was the thrilling, perhaps a bit minor Dial M for Murder. His second film is the subject of this review, Rear Window. Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's best, if not the best thrillers he has ever made. The story is simple enough, but the film envelopes you in a world of nonstop tension.

In fact, 'Rear Window' could even be seen as a film about television, with Jeffries, the protagonist, switching views of other apartments just like a man constantly changing channels on his television set. As Thelma Ritter's character Stella says, ""We have become a race of peeping toms"", relating to a key issue of the film: the voyeuristic tendencies of society.",

He enrols the help of his girlfriend Lisa to help him solve the puzzle.,
47,10 May 2017,robert-temple-1,4, A very inferior Hitchcock film,"When this film was released, it was a big hit, but much of the reason for that was that Grace Kelly was in it, and she was the darling then. Also, people had not yet grown tired of James Stewart. But the film itself is contrived, artificial, tedious, unconvincing, and silly. Looking back now at the ethereal beauty of Grace Kelly, her perfect face, her perfect dainty profile, her perfect lips as she kisses, and her highly cultivated dreamy look which is meant to convince us that she is in love, it is a bit like remembering that one tried to eat the lace-like sugar ornament on the first wedding cake one encountered as a child: far too sweet, indeed sickly. The outrageous designer dresses and suits worn by Kelly in this film, including a ludicrously flouncy skirt, can perhaps be excused by the period, combined with a director indulging his well-known fantasies. But let's consider the film itself and what is wrong with it. For one thing, it is one of those films set in a single room which directors vainly imagine they can make compelling for the entire length of a film, but so rarely do. Alfred Hitchcock was notorious for preferring always to shoot in controlled studio conditions whenever he could, and would build whole exteriors inside a studio rather than step outside to the real thing where â€“ what was it? â€“ he was afraid of catching cold? No, it was insecurity and the need for control, especially control over those beautiful blonde victim actresses whom he wished to dominate either directly or through story lines. He could not kiss them himself, but he could have other people kiss them and film it. He could also punish them, or even murder them on screen. In this film, Grace Kelly is not killed, though she does have a serious scare. The story is about a press photographer who has broken his leg and is stranded in his small Manhattan apartment with his entire leg in plaster, sitting in a wheelchair by his large rear window. From there, he can spy on his neighbours, at first through binoculars, but later through a telephoto lens attached to his camera. It is summer in Manhattan, apparently August, when everyone in the 1950s was sweating and suffering from the heat, and air conditioners were not yet widespread. All the windows are open, one couple are sleeping at night on a mattress on an outside balcony, and everyone is on view, and one can hear everything and see everything. The photographer is played by James Stewart. He turns into a compulsive Peeping Tom because he is bored and, after all, he is a photographer who is always looking for things anyway. Stewart plays the role in his usual default manner, that of the droll and drawling good fellow. (His acting range was never broadband. He could always be counted on to be the same.) Grace Kelly flies in every evening in some fantasy gown or other to look after him. She professes that she adores him, loves him overwhelmingly, and why cannot they marry. He grumbles and complains both to her and his masseuse Thelma Ritter that Kelly isn't really what he is looking for. Pull the other unbroken leg! Grace Kelly not good enough for him? Try telling that to the public. The whole world was lusting after Grace Kelly at that moment, and tedious, drawling James Stewart wants to find someone better? How can she put up with him is the better question. And yet, this is what Hitchcock would have us believe. But she is having none of it, and will not be disposed of by her boring choice of husband-to-be. Being as well endowed with money as she is with good looks, she goes off to The 21 Club and orders a takeaway dinner for two. It arrives, carried by a man in a red bellhop uniform, and consists of a bottle of chilled Puligny Montrachet (of unimaginable expense in America then, and indeed now) and lobster thermidor. And thus her courtship of her reluctant photographer is carried out. She brings a small overnight bag because she is going to stay with him one night, and from it she pulls something long and silky. Shortly afterwards she emerges from the bedroom dressed in the most outrageous Hollywood floating negligee and strikes a pose in front of Stewart, asking him how he likes it (i.e., how he likes her). He remains indifferent. Surely erotic fantasy is here butting its head against a brick wall. Stewart remains more interested in spying on the neighbours. (Is he gay? What is his problem?) He rolls his jaw around and does a bit of drawling with it from time to time. Are there really no other takers on Kelly's Park Avenue? Must she really keep coming slumming in Lower Manhattan where her adored James Stewart overlooks a motley back yard with different small apartments inhabited by oddballs? (There is the usual irritating bad soprano practising her scales, an all too realistic touch, though we never see her.) Several of the oddballs are overdone, to say the least. The dancing girl in shorts is perhaps the most ridiculous. The story concerns Stewart believing that he may have witnessed the aftermath of a man murdering his invalid wife, cutting her body up and taking it away in stages in a metal suitcase. Everyone ridicules him for imagining this, but Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter end up believing him and try to collect additional evidence. This lengthy and languid attempt to keep us watching this dreary story is a complete waste of time.",

In the hands of Alfred Hitchcock however, the character's confinement is skilfully used to rationalise his unhealthy preoccupation with spying on his neighbours and to generate the kind of tension that's such an important component of this gripping murder mystery. Suspicion, voyeurism and obsession feature strongly and the presence of a cool blonde, a romantic subplot and some offbeat humour all add to the entertainment value of this fine movie which eventually became recognised as an all-time classic.",

I must admit that, on my first viewing of the film, I was quite new to his work, and, whilst I thought it was a solid achievement, it didn't strike me as being anything particularly special. How wrong I was! With subsequent viewings of 'Rear Window,' include one in a cinema, I was able to better appreciate its intricacies: the flawless performances, the 100 minutes of subtle, wonderfully-executed suspense, the shades of delightfully-dark humour, the manner in which Hitchcock places the viewer inside Jeff's tiny apartment. Released in 1954, 'Rear Window' was the second of four Hitchcock films to star James Stewart (the others being 'Rope,' 'Vertigo' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'), and the second of three to feature one of Hollywood's greatest beauties, Grace Kelly ('Dial M for Murder,' 'To Catch a Thief').",

And I found it updated which is not very strange since we are talking about a film made in the early fifties. There is not much suspense in the plot mostly because as the story goes by, it is very obvious who the murderer is. The definition of suspense is: that the spectator should be guessing who the guilty person is, or even better: guessing who the bad guy is. In this film, we do know who the bad guy is, but we don't know if he really did it or not. Real suspense would have been that the guy that everyone thought that did it, in fact didn't, and that the one that looks innocent had done it. Now that would've been a twist! There are a couple of other things that killed the suspense in me. Why a man that is a photographer and tries to convince a policeman that his neighbour killed his wife and has no evidence and is looking through the window with a telephoto camera, doesn't take pictures of the scene of the crime and use them as evidence. And how come that a man that is going to murder his wife and cut her in small pieces doesn't draw down the window blinds so no one can see what he is doing and testify against him!?. But I have to admit, typically Hitchcock, delivers a proffesional job because he makes you see things that only a great director like him can. He will make you believe that Jeff and Lisa are absolutely right and everyone else is wrong just by watching this couple's attitude, created through their acting. And there is the strength of these actors; they are extremely reassuring in their personalities that as such, it impregnates the whole film. Just by the way they pose and sit and look you can almost smell that whatever they do is right. On the contrary, Thorwald hasn't a chance because from the very first scene he is doomed; he is the bad guy almost before the film has started. And I intuitively guessed it and killed all the suspense. I liked ""Vertigo"" even if some scenes are a little bit slow and long and I liked ""Psycho"", that's a masterpiece. But ""Rear Window"" it's too obvious.",

98,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,9," Hitchcock, Simple and Sweet","Alfred Hitchcock finds a way to take a person who is doing the wrong thing and make him a hero, another example of the genius that was the director. Jimmy Stewart plays Jeff Jeffries, a world famous photographer who broke his leg and is wheel-chair bound. In an age before video games, computers, cable TV, for that matter widespread TV viewing, boredom was adverted by leaving the apartment and doing something. Well, Jeffries and his wheel chair couldn't leave the apartment, so he has to fill his hours by eavesdropping on the neighbors across the courtyard from his bedroom. The entire apartment complex may be one of the greatest set designs of all time, an entire building as a set, looking fantastic, like an actual apartment that could be found anywhere, and the source for the success of the film. An unconvincing set, something that looks fake would take away from the real tension that ensues. Jeffries is wrong in watching all of his neighbors going through their lives each night, as we are told by his physical therapist, Stella (Thelma Ritter), tells him at the beginning of the movie. One night, while Jeffries is looking out the window while going in and out of sleep, he thinks he sees a neighbor kill someone (Raymond Burr). Not sure, he discusses it with his girlfriend, the radiant and beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, and convinces her to go over to the man's apartment to look for clues. That is the setup and Hitchcock pumps up the tension by allowing the audience to see everything the same way Jeffries does, through the rear window of his apartment. There are very few shots that do not originate from somewhere in Jeffries' apartment, a simplistic approach that makes it all seem so real. Hitchcock also fills all of the other apartments with characters that interest Jeffries and ourselves, plus adds a song writer to a studio apartment who supplies the soundtrack to the movie. Every detail shown early in the movie comes into play later in the movie. Hitchcock never cheats, and we are left wondering what will happen next. Rear Window may be the simplest movie ever made, proving you don't have to blow up 700 cars to create a truly tense and spine-tingling movie.",

105,14 August 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Suspended between window and yard,"This film has become a cult film with time. Everything seems to be at that level though the situation and plot are rather light. What is important here is that Hitchcock transforms this back yard and garden surrounded by buildings all around and a highly voyeuristic microcosm into a complete vision of human society with all its dramas, and its pleasures and joys. To transform such a small microcosm entirely closed onto itself into a vision of the whole society we hardly get a couple of glimpses of through an alley opening onto the main street is marvelous and amazing. The second phenomenal fact is that the main actor is a wheelchair-ridden man with a severely broken leg in a cast. How can the whole world completely turn and whirl around that sole man? It is only possible because it is absolutely seen through the only eyes of this man or the eyes of the people standing next to him. There is only one instance when the point of vision is not his own eyes but a point outside in the yard-garden: at the end when he is being dropped from his window and then we get for a very short period of time the vision from the cops' eyes. This gives to that film such a personal dimension that it is nearly sickening: we have the impression of invading the privacy of that man. In fact what I have just said is false because he alternates what the man can see and close-up shots on him to show his personal reactions to what he has just seen. This constant alternating of voyeuristic sequences from the eyes of one man and close-up shots on his body language and language forces us into his own skin, body, bones. We are no longer voyeurs but ghosts in him seeing through his eyes. We are the direct witnesses of what he sees because we see it with him, through his own eyes and we start feeling the same emotions as he does. Of course everything is seen through the camera, but Hitchcock even uses some tools to emphasize the voyeuristic dimension and force us into it: a camera with a zooming lens that is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer. The last point I would like to insist on is that Hitchcock shows a murder but he is not interested in the murder per se but in the reactions of the witnesses, those who see everything and how they are blind to what they see. Then he builds up the slow recognition in their eyes, language and behavior, and then they become obsessive about it, to the point of becoming if not courageous at least unconscious of the risks they are taking or running. That too is remarkable and that nearly makes us get out of the simplistic voyeurism I have spoken of all along and climb into some kind of distantiation from the penned up impression of before, a distantiation that leads us to the idea that courage in a human society is often the result of a conviction that makes us blind to the danger or risk we are facing. Courage is the result of a lack of consciousness more than intensified consciousness. This is the human dimension Hitchcock always brought to his films. And that is kind of lost in our modern action films that do not have one single second now and then to just rest and digest what has happened before.",

Stewart, Kelly & the wonderful Ritter are the filmgoer stand-ins with a fantasy twist: longing to know the ending, going into the story, & even affecting the outcome.

107,7 September 2003,schappe1,10, Sweating the details with the Master,"It was Fred Astaire who discovered that you have to photograph dancers with a static camera because dancers move and a moving camera reduces movement. Most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, (although not all: see ROPE) are like a game of billiards. The characters are like billiard balls moving all over the table and colliding with each other until they all meet at the finale. But here the camera is static and it is the world that moves. What comes out is not simply the story, but all the details- all the stories. The result is a moment in time- a few days in the courtyard of a New York City apartment building in the sweaty summer of 1954- captured forever and most vividly. How many details and how many human stories do you see in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SABOTEUR, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Just the one. When you watch those films you are in an audience in a theater, watching a story played out on the screen. Here you see it all. You are in the movie. Remembering REAR WINDOW is like remembering something that you witnessed yourself- something that actually happened to you, not just a movie you watched.

Its masterful voyeuristic cinematography, its impeccably atmospheric sound and John Michael Hays's screen adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's short story have been quite sufficiently recognized over the past half century. I suppose there is one thing that people don't tend to think about, or at least it is one thing I haven't heard anyone say, and that is that Rear Window is a virtuoso portrait the human element of privacy, and feeling naked when we notice that it is invaded.

Hitchcock, who was notorious for mixing in such deeper themes with seemingly superficial suspense epics seemed to particularly relish the tale of Rear Window, a film entirely devoted to a man simply watching.

Are the audience expected to sit for an hour looking from the window on neighbors and traking the murderer? Can't the characters go outside off the apartment and go to other locations? (I mean more film locations). If this whole movie reminded me of how Hitchcock ""blocks a scene"", this was even worse cause there is nothing much to see or expect when the characters are ""trapped"" in a four room wall for an hour of a movie. The acting was decent and there isn't much about the characters for the audience to be attached to them. The only good thing in this movie was probably the opening sequence and the introduction to James Stuart's character.",
138,1 March 2009,barryrd,9, Classic Hitchcock from a unique perspective,"With the acting talent of two of Alfred Hitchcock's favourite actors, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and a strong supporting cast of Thelma Ritter, as his nurse, Cornell Wilde, the detective buddy, and Raymond Burr, a neighbouring tenant, we have the ingredients of a great movie. However, this movie is much more than a great cast since the directing genius of Hitchcock is more than evident. The location is in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan. The movie takes place on a small set-a bachelor apartment with distance scenes in the courtyard and other apartments seen through the lens of a camera. It seems a stretch that everyone in the complex would leave their blinds open but then, no one suspects that one tenant has a telephoto lens to zoom in on their private lives.",

140,15 September 2002,esteban1747,7, A wheelchair man spies his neighbors,"This is another good thriller of Hitchcock. James Stewart, as usual, was the selection as a leading actor together with the then nice Grace Kelly, always efficient supporting actress Thelma Ritter, a solid acting of Wendell Corey, and the villain Raymond Burr, who later in his career became the famous actor of the detective Perry Mason. The best is that the thriller does not show any particular violent scenes until its end when the wheelchair journalist (Stewart) was caught in his activities by the guilty man (Burr). Notwithstanding with this, the film keeps you always awaiting for a final discovery of the supposed killer. So watching the film you have entertainment, you may see the people's life of 50s, and you enjoy with the plot of the thriller. Film-makers should see how Hitchcock did to delight everyone with a really simple plot.",

However, it is not possible to know this first hand, because no creature on Earth can sit through the movie. This is because it has the worst and most annoying sound effects ever in any movie. Hitchcok certainly wanted the audience to twist and hate the noise, but there is considerable overkill here. A human's nerves can't take this horrible noise and concentrate on what is going on. Even if you sit through it, you don't know what is going on, because you are in way too much pain. Some people insist they can watch it, but it isn't possible without drugs.

154,4 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, Rear Window,"Oscar nominated Sir Alfred Hitchcock has created another masterpiece, my second favourite after Psycho. Basically L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (the great James Stewart) is the reporter who is spending his last weeks in his apartment with a broken leg, and all he can do to pass the time is stare out the window watching his neighbours enjoying the hot weather (with no blinds down). During his time though, he is occasionally visited by the nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his model girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (the beautiful Grace Kelly). While he is watching the individual occupants of the windows, he has given them all nicknames and is consumed by their private dramas. But one particularly window has caught his attention, when Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) is looking very suspicious with knives, saws and ropes, going out late at night, and his nagging wife has disappeared. Jeff is convinced that he has murdered his wife, and is constantly trying to watch the action, and prove Throwald's guilt. Det. Lt. Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) is convinced he is overreacting, but more and more incidents with Thorwald make Jeff, and you (the audience) believe this accusation. The best moments are when Jeff gives Thorwald a note and a phone call, the investigation of the patio, and the concluding fight. Hitchcock's cameo is the man in the songwriter/pianist's studio winding a clock. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Grace Kelly was number 86, and James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Stewart was also number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Kelly was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Stewart was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, Hitchcock was number 75, and Kelly number 92 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

It's amazing how we get a photographer who is stuck in his apartment, with a movie that (essentially) all takes place in that apartment and the view it has, and still manages to stay interesting. Part of the suspense is that every time the main character is peeking out the window, somebody could look back at him at any moment, so there's always an underlying tension in almost every scene. IT isn't answered until the very end if the ""villain"" actually is a murderer or not either, so that question looms throughout. Overall the suspense hangs throughout the entire movie, and makes it that much more engrossing.

Jefferies, Jeff to his friends, a photographer used to working in the world's trouble spots; now however he is stuck at home in New York one hot summer with a broken leg and nothing to do but look out of the window. Through this window he watches the activities of his neighbours; there is the woman who exercises in her underwear, an apparently lonely woman, a man who lives with his nagging wife, a musician and a couple who are sleeping on the fire escape in an attempt to keep cool. The only company Jeff has is his nurse Stella and his beautiful girl friend Lisa. Even when they are visiting he can't stop watching the neighbours though. One night he sees something odd; the man with the nagging wife, who we later learn is called Lars Thorwald comes and goes several times with a suitcase and in the morning there is no sign of his wife. Jeff is convinced that he must have murdered her; his friend Lt. Doyle is less than convinced though... several witnesses corroborate Thorwald's story that his wife went away by train. He tells Lisa and she is initially sceptical but when he tells her how he has seen Thorwald examining jewellery in his wife's favourite handbag she believes him... after all what woman would go on a trip and not take her favourite handbag or jewellery?

169,10 February 2019,schappe1,10, A World of Its Own,"It was Fred Astaire who discovered that you have to photograph dancers with a static camera because dancers move and a moving camera reduces movement. Most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, (although not all: see ROPE) are like a game of billiards. The characters are like billiard balls moving all over the table and colliding with each other until they all meet at the finale. But here the camera is static and it is the world that moves. What comes out is not simply the story, but all the details- all the stories. The result is a moment in time- a few days in the courtyard of a New York City apartment building in the sweaty summer of 1954- captured forever and most vividly. How many details and how many human stories do you see in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SABUTEUR, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Just the one. When you watch those films you are in an audience in a theater, watching a story played out on the screen. Here you see it all. You are in the movie. Remembering REAR WINDOW is like remembering something that you witnessed yourself- something that actually happened to you, not just a movie you watched.

The stagnant setting just intensifies the story's infectious feeling of malaise. There also should have been more of a mystery to it, to keep you guessing and interested.

200,23 March 2020,IreneWatsonC,10, WINDOW: Observe the beauty and ugliness of human nature,"This is a great movie with profound and moral paradoxes. The premise of the film is the existence of a criminal act. So the movie seems to tell viewers that voyeurism is immoral, but it is precisely because of this immoral behavior that it prevents the crime itself and thus creates a sense of justice. Hitchcock used his films to explain this human natural desire. He used his movie to make us understand: peeping is universal in everyone's heart. However, excessive peeping goes beyond the boundaries of morality and even law. From this perspective, the restraint of civilization has caused the depression of humanity to a certain extent. We need to comply with both constraints and instincts, and there is a certain conflict between the two. As an external window, it also plays a media role for the observer to observe the inner heart of the person. Interestingly, the observer's peeping behavior is also a manifestation of human nature.",
201,22 February 2006,drebin73,10," Hitchcocks Best, Cinemas Best","This is the greatest movie of all time. I believe that Jimmy Stewart is one of the greatest actors ever and that Grace Kelly is one of the best actresses of the era. Rear Window takes place in a small apartment complex in the village. Jimmy Stewart plays famous photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies who after an accident is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. He has nothing to do but stare out of the window and look at the neighbors. He plays this role very well. When Jeff thinks he has witnessed a murder from the apartment across the way he gets help from his high society girl friend Lisa played by Grace Kelly and his comical nurse Stella played by Thelma Ritter and his detective friend Lt. Doyle played by Wendell Corey. When you carefully watch the movie you can see that there is a great amount of humor throughout the whole film as well as a whole crap-load of suspense. Thelma Ritter is the more obvious comic relief of the film with funny one liners: "" When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway. "" One thing that this movie tackles is the subject of voyeurism the act of watching someone without there knowledge and not for sexual gratification. This is what most movies are anyway, we are in a way spying on the people in the movie and become interested in their lives.This movie just focuses on it specifically. One thing that it is interesting is how the camera never leaves Jeff's apartment. We can see conversations between the neighbors but we can not hear what they are saying so we have to figure out what is going on by their body language. The whole movie is a bunch of reaction shots from Stewart. Jeff sees something, then we see him react to it. Another thing in this movie is the relation ship between Jeff and Lisa ""Jeff: She wants me to marry her. Stella: That's normal. Jeff: I don't want to. Stella: That's abnormal."" Jeff feels that her lifestyle would not be the kind that she would want to be apart of seeing that he travels all over the world to photograph things like war and other things of that nature"" Raymond Burr stars as the suspected murderer Lars Thorwald. This movie is the greatest movie and I can't do it justice by telling you about it like this. This one just needs to be seen by everybody. 11 out of 10",

What colours. What rhythm. What music and sound syncing in. What eminently played out little scenes seen from Jeff's window.
It is the darker dimension that makes this film perfect. The audience is kept in suspense over many plotlines, carefully developed an masterly filmed. Seen in this way, the building opposite is the main attraction, with about five stories going on at the same time, some with very dark outcomes.
An all-time high in visual arts.",
213,6 August 2015,brchthethird,9, Interesting social commentary wrapped up in Hitchcock's best film so far,"Not having seen every film that Hitchcock made, and therefore not entirely qualified to analyze what makes a film ""his,"" REAR WINDOW is definitely getting closer to what my idea of the ideal Hitchcock film is. Like his other pictures, it takes a simple premise and puts the audience through the wringer as to how it will turn out. Here, James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photojournalist who passes the time by looking at his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. However, based on some things he sees, he begins to think that a murder may have been committed. Having just come off of ROPE, where the film was edited to appear as one single take, I noticed another technical challenge with this. The entire view the audience is given is from Jeff's apartment, which essentially forces us into his perspective. We see exactly what he sees, and know what he knows (with a few exceptions). In the hands of a weaker director, having basically only one fully developed character would have resulted in a very weak film, but Hitchcock makes it work somehow. It also doesn't hurt that James Stewart has a likable screen presence. And boy, is Grace Kelly easy on the eyes (and a talented actress, too)! However, what made the film so much more interesting was the social commentary that Hitchcock flirted with for part of the running time. Most of it is contained in some first-half conversations between Jeff and his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly). Although I could just be reading this onto the film, it seems like Jeff's apartment-bound snoop is a metaphor for society's growing passivity. This is kind of supported by the fact that he's averse to getting married, is content with the status quo, etc. This is in contrast to his girlfriend, who is more ambitious. It's almost tragically ironic that they end up bonding over a murder they think has been committed based on their limited point of view from Jeff's apartment. Also, given the interconnectedness that the internet provides, and the privacy concerns that come along with it, one could certainly read the ethics of surveillance onto the film as well. Even if that wasn't the intention (and Hitchcock's primary concern was entertainment), you can certainly see how the film was prescient in that regard. Just substitute the digital world for the apartment complex, where you think that you know people based on what they post on Facebook. If anything, you can take away that life is better experienced than merely observed. However, my only minor complaint has to do with the ending (again). Hitchcock is a master when it comes to building tension and suspense, but after so much cinematic foreplay there wasn't enough time to savor the release when it comes. I will say that Raymond Burr, even though you only got really one scene to appreciate his character up close, was quite menacing. There were also lots of cool little moments that you get to see as Jeff spies on his neighbors. And, I was able to catch Hitchcock's cameo this time! From my limited perspective of only having seen a handful of Hitchcock's films at this point, I can still safely say that this is the best so far. I also can't wait to dig further into to his filmography.",

There are times in our childhood, I am sure, when we spied on someone whether it was our parents, siblings or neighbors. As humans, we have the compelling feeling to be nosy and try to find out about business that is none of ours whatsoever. Alfred Hitchcock knew this feeling, so much so that he knew he could make a murder mystery out of it. Here, L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) represents all of us, unable to be satisfied with our own lives, so we pry into the lives of others. Unfortunately for him, he is also stuck with a cast for a broken leg, and is so bored with his current situation, he takes his overactive imagination and comes to the conclusion that one of his neighbors has committed murder.",

Besides the premise of a person confined to their window, seeing what they think is a murder, the two could not be anymore different. This film is one that will never age, whether it story, acting, or sheer inventiveness in its execution. Only Hitchcock could build the suspense as high as he does for almost two hours never leaving one room the entire time. Our hero is in a full leg cast and a prisoner to his room and window. Besides that interior, everything else we see is from his vantage point across to the rest of the apartment complex and a sliver of space opening to the street beyond.

James Stewart delivers a nuanced performance as the bored, yet curious photographer, while Grace Kelly's character adds a layer of sophistication and mystery. The film's use of color and lighting, particularly in the final sequence, adds to the already stunning visual aesthetic and reinforces the themes of morality and justice.

Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows.

In the complete oeuvre of Hitchcock, Rear Window firmly occupies the very top shelf, together with such classics as the aforementioned Vertigo, North by Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960). It is a great film, not only from a critical standpoint but also from the audience's point-of-view.

It is also more light-handed than later films by the director, such as the quite scary Psycho. ",

With the aid of his lovely girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), and his caretaker, Stella (Thelma Ritter), Jeffries sets out to discover Mrs. Thorwald's fate.

267,23 June 2005,silverscreen888,9, Original and Fascinating; Hitchcock's Window On Hidden Secrets,"This narrative is not about ""voyeurism"" as some have opined; it is about human self assertion in the world of reality, not of people. It also has to be one of Alfred Hithcock's signature noir achievements; it is both popular an estimable for many reasons, I suggest. The set is one of the most memorable and imaginative eve--group of New York apartments across a courtyard, visible from his window to wheel-chair bound photographer Jimmy Stewart as he recovers from an accident suffered while photographing at an auto race track. Bored, he begins observing his neighbors, in a detached, using optical instruments where necessary and taking a few photographs. His would-be-fiancÃ©e, pretty Grace Kelly, begins by distrusting his entertaining himself in this manner; but his loquacious maid Thelma Ritter approves of his ""hobby"". When Stewart believes he has discovered a murder perpetrated by Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald, a true figure of menace, he enlists the help of his police detective war buddy played magnificently by Wendell Corey. This is noir because the authorities charged with helping in such a case--his best friend--refuse to believe him. What follows is a double climax that is most exciting. Thorwald catches Kelly searching in the murder apartment, so Stewart has to call police to get her away; and then Thorwald penetrates his anonymity and comes after him, to try to kill him. Kelly does well as Stewart's snooty but courageous girl, and Ritter is in top form as an enthusiastic co-conspirator. No one else is given much to do in the film except to be background characters; but this talented group includes Jesslyn Fax, Frank Cady, songwriter Ross Bagdasarian, Judith Evelyn and Georgine Darcy. This script has been adapted from a fascinating story idea by veteran Cornell Woolrich; John Michael Hayes and director Hitchcock also contributed. This is an expensive-looking production wherein Waxman's subtle score, intricate settings, costumes, art direction, lighting, cinematography and sound are all far-above-average. Stewart has one of his best roles ever here, and Burr despite a lack of lines made a strong impression as the white-haired killer so much older than his own years. The film is perhaps overrated in importance; but it would nearly be impossible to overvalue the skill exerted by Hitchock in camera use or the cleverness of his management of space and time in achieving what we see here. The result is a polished gem of directing, from the daring opening 360 degree establishing pan shot that introduces us to Stewart's presently-limited world of action (with his broken leg) to the exciting climactic battle with Thorwald involving flashbulbs as a defense and police racing to save him before it's too late. Kelly throughout wants him to become a society photographer and marry her; Stewart wants to continue being a free-lance observer of the world in dangerous places. So the underlying theme of this low-key narrative is ""how people need to find out what makes them happy""; the film is Stewart's evidence as ""Scotty"" that he needs to be who he is--a man who slakes his curiosity in the world by observing and remaining just a little detached. A most watchable minor masterpiece; artistically, it's no ""Vertigo"" or ""Duel in the Sun""; it is an undeniable and original classic mystery.",

As far as this minimalism is concerned: The great master of suspense did a very similar thing to ""Rear Windows"" in ""Dial M for Murder"" (also shot in 1954), where one single apartment serves as the focal point for the entire action, and suspense can boil in this closed environment until the lid bursts open.",

Director Alfred Hitchcock was well-known for having a wide heartless streak toward many of his characters, though his actual treatment of cast and crew will remain open to debate forever. While it's easy to tolerate a certain level of Expendability for ""the master of suspense's"" many murder-centric plots, I find it a little harder to take when children and animals are involved. Though two years after REAR WINDOW's debut, young Hank McKenna is threatened through almost the entire story of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, is a hair on his head REALLY harmed? On the other hand, to turn the future Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) into a vicious dog killer goes beyond my pale, meriting at least a one point rating deduction for REAR WINDOW. It's bad enough when a guy named Lars offs his spouse; but C'Mon, Fido, too? We're entering Wicked Witch of the West territory here. Hitchcock gave James Stewart--who otherwise lived A WONDERFUL LIFE--three of his most loathsome roles (NOT counting his outing as little Hank's daddy), and there's a coldness to ""Jeff's"" opportunistic voyeurism in REAR WINDOW that suggests it's only a matter of time before this character slides a lot further into the wrong side of the law!",

What is seen in the other apartments is a mystery you will have to reveal on your own. And when you do; you will be stunned with that you've concluded. 	Alfred Hitchcock did a brilliant job filming this story, as he does with all of his films. The different techniques that he uses play such an enormous part in this film. For example: when the man in the apartment tries to hide in a particular scene from another man, instead of running to another room, he scoots himself into a shadow, and it is so much more practical.

306,14 February 2018,mge-29659,9, A Technical Marvel,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a fantastic example of his ingenuity and vision when creating films. While of course this movie has a great story with meaningful dialogue, the way Hitchcock tells the story is what truly is impressive. The movie starts with a panning shot around the main character's apartment, which reveals that he is a photographer who has broken his leg and is now wheelchair bound. Because of this the entire movie is shot from the perspective of the apartment. The camera never leaves. As a result, many important film techniques were necessary to create a complex story with multiple characters only looking from one spot. 
 Hitchcock is restricted to using only a few camera angles because the entire movie is shot from in perspective, for example eye-level for shots in the apartment, and then long shots and a few close-ups for things outside the apartment. But even with so few types of camera angles, Hitchcock uses the camera angles to advance the story. For example, every shot from the apartment is a long shot in the beginning, the same way anyone in the apartment would see. These long shots show the basis of what is happening in the scene, but it is difficult to see the details from this angle. but when the main character grabs a pair of binoculars to investigate further, a close is used, showing the viewer exactly what the character would see, and giving them the same amount of detail.
 Another technical piece of film that Hitchcock incorporates into the story is the use of light and dark. Early in the film the main character is spying on his suspicious neighbor, and he realizes he can be seen through his window, so he backs into his unlit apartment to stay hidden. This action of hiding in the dark is repeated throughout the film, until the neighbor eventually notices him and make's it to the apartment. Since the main character is crippled, he obviously can't fight. So, he uses the light and dark to his advantage. He turns all the lights off and uses flash bulbs to blind his attacker. Hitchcock uses light and dark as a weapon for the main character, as it's the only way he can defend himself with his condition.
 While Hitchcock uses camera tricks to create suspense and intrigue in the film, he mostly uses mise en scene to carefully create every scene and put everything exactly where it should be to perfectly tell the story. Many of the ""mysteries"" created in the film are crated purely out of the perspective of the main characters. For example, the suspicious neighbor is yelling at his wife, but the shade is down in their window, so neither the characters or the viewers know what's really going on. Or when the neighbor moves his wife's purse form the bedroom to another room, a wall perfectly blocks the neighbor from the main characters point of view. Every object in each scene, and every wall or blockage of something is carefully planned out by Hitchcock to create a sense of suspense and mystery, while just sitting in one spot, away from all the action.
 Hitchcock's Rear Window is truly a test of his creativity when directing a film. To be able to tell an interesting and well written story from the perspective of one person who doesn't move the whole movie really shows how good of a director Alfred Hitchcock is. He perfectly incorporates many technical pieces of film such as specific camera angles, right, and placement of subjects within a scene for giving the viewer a similar perspective to the main character, and creating an interesting and well-developed world just from the view of one rear window",

It's somewhat bland and predictable, and though I can appreciate a good slow-paced film every now and then this one just felt like it dragged- a lot. Not a lot happens in the first eighty minutes, and then a lot happens in the last half hour, and it just all feels off. There's only so many scenes of James Stewart watching his neighbours that I can watch before I start to feel a little bored. I get what the film's trying to say about voyeurism and all that, and the set the movie's filmed on was definitely impressive for its time, but overall I found the film a bit of a chore to get through. Look, it's not a bad movie, and I can see its appeal, but it just wasn't for me. Maybe a second viewing will make me change my mind, but for the time-being it really isn't one of my favourites. 7/10",

Not that dissecting people's voyeuristic tendencies is the film's only strength, but it is certainly what sets this film apart from all other films as well as other Alfred Hitchcock classics. It operates at a much slower pace, and it isolates the viewer by almost never taking the camera out of the room. This experimental technique is the mark of the artist working on his masterpiece, which is certainly the case (although just the first of many) with Hitchcock and ""Rear Window."" ",

I have seen most of the IMDb top 20 movies and they lived up to my expectations or exceeded expectations apart from perhaps The Dark Knight, Star Wars, and Lord of the ring. Those movies are up there understandably due the votes of the huge fan base. But how did Rear Window got up there? Due to the fan base of Hitchcock? Probably... and may be also due to the fact this is a pioneering movie of its genre. I can try and agree with reasons given by reviewers who has given very high rating for this movie. However, the whole package is bit disappointing, specially when you put this movie in current context. I cannot agree that this is a timeless classic. Anyway, you have to put my rating of 5 in context as well. I am rating it for the entertainment value forgetting about the fact that Hitchcock did this movie in 1954 and he was a pioneer of the genre.",

Rear Window is a tout thriller that uses the minimalistic setting to the fullest as a invalid man becomes a voyeur of his neighbours and their activities and soon suspects one of his neighbours murdered their wife. Hitchcock expertly brings up into this world as we see the events and lives of other people from a distance and see the world through L.B. Jefferies' (James Stewart), making the world of the apartment courtyard with his camera pans and movements. As well as the entertaining murder mystery Rear Window was a film with snappy dialogue and character relationships whilst looking at different types of households and people in the different apartments, and how the idea of tight neat community was even dying back in the 50s.",

Voyeurism is always at least a running motif in the movies that Hitchcock made, made manifest by people watching other people through peep holes or windows or just out of sight, but it's in Rear Window where the entirety of the story's action revolves around one person voyeuristically watching others.

318,15 September 2009,PeterRoeder,8, Very interesting,"I just saw this movie again, and it is very interesting. Along with Vertigo it is one of Hitchcock's most interesting movies. It is really scary the way we are slowly drawn into the murder, and given little clues and diversions. Hitchcock is a master at that, and like in the other movie with James Stevart (Vertigo) this movie is almost bordering on the supernatural. This is what makes it so scary. It is not the same horror as in Psycho but it is extremely eerie and disturbing. We wonder what is going on, and are constantly forced to be extremely careful in evaluating what we see on the screen. The story unfolds very nicely leading up to a good climax. I think Vertigo is even better than Rear Window, but in a way they are telling the same story, and both of them are very weird, bordering on the supernatural and playing with what is possible in the real world.",

And do we really need James Stewart and Grace Kelley to both recognize and feel guilty about their voyeurism? Other than that, though, it's well nigh perfect with not only the usual Hitch tension and creepiness but with forays into loneliness and urban angst as well and perhaps the best evocation of the sights and especially the sounds of a stifling New York summer night until ol Spike came along in '89 and did the right thing.

In this case, it's a murder most foul behind the drawn curtains of a neighboring unit. Costar Grace Kelly is refined and magnetic as the fashion conscious would-be fiancÃ©e; a model of smooth-talking elegance who, after initial doubts, is soon drawn into the intrigue of what's actually happened in that dark room across the way. After an argumentative start, Stewart and Kelly quickly settle in as a close-knit pair of obsessed observers, stoking each other's suspicions and inducing a steady shared vigil. The issue of their troubled romance is problematic, introduced in the first act and never truly resolved, but that doesn't bother me.

The man knew his way around the camera in ways that are highly instructive in how today's filmmakers should learn to make movies. One thing I have noticed about the few Hitchcock movies I've seen is that the man has an eye for simplicity - that is simply telling stories that by themselves seem insignificant, but something, I'm not sure what exactly, I guess just the way he tells his stories, composes his scenes, and directs his actors are nothing short of brilliant and instructive.",

The movie also provides an interesting glimpse of contemporary urban life. Although the movie is a crime drama, it depicts the compartmentalization of existence and the isolation of individuals in large groups. People live in the same building, yet there is no sense of community. A murder can take place and nobody would even know it. The most nefarious acts could take place and nobody would know it. People living in close proximity yet emotionally so disconnected. This is captured by this movie. The social statement may be unintentional yet it is unmistakable. The format of the story itself does not seem complicated: a man watches his neighbors and believes that something bad has happened. The problem is in trying to prove it. Hitchcock uses several clever devices to heighten the suspense. But it is the acting of James Stewart that takes precedence. This is James Stewart at his best.",

325,1 March 2004,Shortee16,7, Surprisingly captivating,"`Rear Window' is an incredible mix of things; mystery, life lessons as lived within the perimeters of various stages of life, and romance. James Stewart portrays Jeff, an ambitious photographer who is temporarily on a wheelchair due to a work related accident. He believes to have witnessed a crime as he watched his neighbors' lives through the rear window of his apartment. The cinematography of Hitchcock's film is deserving of recognition, because it was the largest inside set of the time. The film's setting is inside Jeff's apartment throughout the duration of it, with one exception. Yet every single apartment watched through the apartment's window is so incredibly detailed and thanks to the filming allows the audience to capture all that goes on inside the far off windows. Hitchcock does an amazing job at carefully choosing the stages of life in which every one of Jeff's neighbors is going through. One woman is your typical lone heart; he gives us an aspiring musician, a ballerina, a newlywed couple, as well as a look inside a troubled marriage's apartment. These don't just stand for their clearly stated definitions, but also in a certain way reflect what Jeff's life is like. As he gives marriage a serious thought. Grace Kelly is portraying Lisa Carol Fremont, the woman Jeff is seeing and who represents an opposite of Jeff's character. She is rich and holds a high social status, and also deeply desires a commitment to Jeff. The chemistry created between Lisa and Jeff is reflected very well by the actors. Jeff is almost blinded to see the perfect woman throwing herself at him. The pace Rear Window starts off with is steady, yet seems to drag at about the middle of the film, making it hard for the audience to follow, again towards the end its faster pace is picked up again. This is recovered by the choice of inspirational and dynamic music continually played in the background of the film. Hitchcock demonstrates his geniality and incredible talent by the making of Rear window",

There was no such thing as the internet back then, so he has to spend his time spying on his neighbors. He swears he sees one of them (Raymond Burr) commit a murder.

However this movie does contain some suspenseful moments but often end abruptly and without explanation. The storyline is unlikely and far-fetched and some of the actions taken out by the main characters are ridiculous, an example being when Stewarts girlfriend sneaks into the culprits apartment by hopping a fire escape into a two story window.

The plot of this film is L.B. Jeffries (Stewart) has broken his leg, and the only thing to do to pass the time is look out the window at his neighbors. When he begins to believe that one neighbor across the way had killed the man's wife, he becomes obsessed watching him. It's really amazing how a great film can be made out of this. The whole movie takes place in one set, with James Stewart only in his room the entire movie, but it works so well. Along with being a thriller, this movie also has some a lot of light comedy, especially in Jimmy Stewart watching the neighbors do various things.

I would say this is one of the best films for a newcomer of Hitchcock, and it has pretty much everything that makes a Hitchcock film just that, it has beautiful style and revealing cinematography, making the camera its own character, fully fleshed out characters that are built slowly from the beginning, and of course plenty of intensity and suspense revolving around this brutal murder mystery. It's sharp script helps elevate some of the more dated, for the times sort of material, which there's a decent amount here.

342,7 February 2000,krumski,10," Hands down, Hitchcock's greatest film","You could say that Psycho is more shocking, Vertigo more psychologically probing, and North by Northwest more sheer fun - but no other single Hitchcock film fires successfully on so many cylinders all at once. Every aspect of the director's considerable artistry is on view here - his humor, his tight plot construction, his brilliant set design, his visual ingenuity, the sexy and sophisticated interplay between his two leads - each honed and refined to perfection. Everything works in this film, and works brilliantly. The physical limitations of the plot - i.e. that it all takes place on one set - could have seriously undermined the film by allowing it to become too static, but instead Hitchcock actually makes the resulting claustrophobia work to great effect; it all builds to a climactic scene that is as pulse-poundingly suspenseful as anything ever committed to film. There are not many movies which could be described as ""perfect"" - even in the best of them, there's usually at least one or two minor flaws somewhere - but Rear Window definitely earns that distinction.

The film was rather unremarkable in my estimation, despite the superb work by the cast and the undeniable craftsmanship.  It just didn't seem particularly interesting to me. The cast was great.  Jimmy Stewart (a longtime favourite for his work in ""It's A Wonderful Life"") is quite convincing as L.B. Jeffries, the photographer with a broken leg who is convinced his girlfriend is too good for him; Grace Kelly is truly luminous, and her work makes me want to see more of her movies; Thelma Ritter (from ""All About Eve"") is great as Stella, Stewart's nurse.

I like how the movie played with the mood, downplaying and emphasizing back and forth both the mood and the pace. After watching North by Northwest, Psycho, and Rear Window, in that order, I now have a greater regard toward how Alfred Hitchcock handles his movies' concepts, plots, and the general direction. James Stewart performed better in other movies, in my opinion. But I like how Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter acted out.

Marriage is the theme overshadowed by murder. James Stewart's finest performance if you ask me and the captivating Grace Kelly as beautiful as ever. This movie is 65 years old, but if you watched the movie without knowing the date of the release, you wouldn't think of it to be older than 10 years old.

I get that this movie is from the 1950s but surely they were aware of the existence of twist endings. If any movie needed a twist ending it was this one. The whole movie Jimmy Stewart is framing Torwald as a killer, and turns out he is. That is not suspenseful. He zeros in on spying on Torwald and convincing Grace Kelly to commit multiple felonies as she breaks into the killers apartment to get proof of something while Stewart fights off the killer with the POWER OF THE CAMERA OH YEAH!

It seems as though it could be the setting for an adaptation of a Broadway musical, but as this is a Hitchcock film it's not too surprising that no one starts singing and that darker designs lie beneath the benign surface. The people that live in the confined apartment setting have a captive audience, L. B. Jefferies, who is confined to his room in a wheelchair with a cast on his leg. Jeff occupies his time by scrutinizing the lives of those around him by peering through their windows. Eventually he sees what he deems to be suspicious conduct from one of his neighbors and conjectures that something sinister is afoot.",

When considering the villain (Thorwald) does not speak for most of the film, I am impressed by how much can be conveyed through body language.

385,16 April 2020,garethcrook,10, Perfection.,"My joint favourite Hitchcock film (the other being North By Northwest). This is just perfection. Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly and a cast of top class support flex their muscles through 2 hours of dramatic, mysterious, speculative bliss. If the apartment bound Jimmy Stewart isn't enough as the action hungry photographer in search of adventure from his wheelchair, you have his girlfriend Grace Kelly, bringing pure class with some socialite sophistication. J.B. (Stewart) really is punching way above his weight. On top of that you've got Thelma Ritter as nurse Stella with the razor sharp wit threatening to steal every scene she graces. J.B. is seeking danger, missing his assignments having acquired a broken leg in the last one two months ago. He thinks he's found it too, through his telephoto lens looking out of his rear window at a myriad of stories in every one of his neighbours apartments. He has an over active imagination, his paranoia growing at what he witnesses, much to the annoyance of Lisa (Kelly) who wants him to settle down and join her in respectable social circles. He draws you in though and Lisa too, who senses excitement as they find some much needed common ground and the conspiracy grows with each new snippet of information. It's a breath of fresh air, as the dialogue drops and we watch the windows, picking up fragments of sound and snap shots of actions. Almost like silent film in places. This is Hitchcock at the top of his game, ramping up the tension as we near the flawless finale with the danger dialled up and a killer on the loose! Surely everyone has seen this film? But on the off chance you've not, stop what you're doing and watch it right now.",

389,14 February 2018,axg-83361,10, A Review on Rear Window,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, features a shocking neighborhood murder, only to be uncovered by a peeping wheelchair-bound photographer, L.B Jefferies, and his cover girl girlfriend Lisa Fremont. How we know such details from each character is due to Hitchcock's panning and fantastic sense of mise en scÃ¨ne. At the opening of the film, what is first seen is the window the main character L.B. Jefferies spends his days looking out of. From there, the camera's motion moves as if it were to float about the neighborhood, catching the neighbors, sleeping Jefferies, his shattered camera and a magazine with his girlfriend on it. Without getting too into it, Hitchcock had already planted important information into the viewer's mind without having to achieve the same thing through an extensive amount of dialogue. Very aware of what and how people and objects are placed, he knew precisely what he was doing. 
One of the first things the viewer learns about the photographer is that he seems unhappy to be in a relationship with a 'perfect woman', he finds him and Lisa to be incompatible due the fact that the two come from different worlds. Each neighbor featured in a way relates to Jeffries's relationship situation or relationships in general. For example, there was a moment where the shot was focused on Miss Lonelyhearts raising her glass to nobody, and Jefferies did the same. This could because 
Not to mention the most obvious aspect of the film, the one vantage point. Hitchcock creatively chose to limit the motion of the camera to the motion of the main character. Doing this, it is impressive how he envisioned and conveyed what he wanted using other camera techniques. For example, he used close ups on several neighbors to shift the focus onto them. In addition, there were several closeups of both Jeffries and Lisa individually and together. The proximity in these shots along with the eye leveled position of the camera play a role in how intimate the viewer gets to the character, including their feelings and emotions. This, I believe creates a more intense feeling when suspense is reached towards the end of the film.
The use of light is also intriguing. Its symbol of clarity and when not present, obscurity. Having this in mind, it is important to mention that whenever the characters had to hide from the gaze of Mr.Thorwald, they would retreat into the darkness. In addition, whenever Lisa came over to talk to Jeffries about the potential murder, she would turn the lights on, begging for him to stop scaring her and talking nonsense. However, when she began to believe him, she stood in the darkness alongside him. Lights were also turned off when Mr. Thorwald found Lisa with his wife's jewelry, right before he attacked her. Not to mention that light was also used to fend away the big angry Thorwald from strangling Jefferies sooner. Besides that, where the film stands in the beginning, is drastically different to what it becomes later in the film. A man with relationship problems quickly turns to a gang attempting to catch a neighborhood murderer. However, this change is not remotely noticed, which makes it important to note. 
The suspense portrayed was incredible. The unsafe and dangerous measures that Lisa went through to invade the Thorwald apartment was only the beginning of a very hair-raising, intense ending. There were very sudden moments in between cuts where Lisa would be shown and the terrifying responses from Jefferies and Stella would also be shown right after. Meaning that there were moments where we couldn't see when Thorwald was coming or not. The film was an overall great thriller to experience.",

392,20 March 2004,arih27,1, Not so much!,"Um, Where do I start?  There wasn't enough evidence to accuse the neighbor of murder...there was way too much dialogue....the plot line was a little shaky and very boring.  I would have to say that this movie is a huge disappointment for me.  Could there be any more talking, please? (note the sarcasm) A movie is supposed to depict story through imagery and finite dialogue, I seriously fell asleep after the droning on and on and on and....on.  After the first 30-45 minutes, I couldn't stay awake, I actually had to fast forward through a large portion in the middle.  And where does Jeffries get off suspecting his neighbor?  That was not believable in the least.  Uh, if I were to spy on any of my neighbors, which is a little, no a lot, weird in the first place, I wouldn't be so bold as to jump to the conclusion that he murdered his wife based on his going in and out of his apartment in the rain at odd hours and carrying a saw and knife around the house.  I got the impression that the neighbor's wife was so ill that she was taken to her family's home out of town via the train due to the husband's incapability of caring for her any longer.  In other words, he moved her home to mom and dad because he couldn't take on the responsibility anymore.  And if you are as ill as she seemed to be, why would you need your purse or jewelry of all things?  Not going anywhere anyway.  I didn't get that the neighbor was a killer or a threat.  I understand that Jeffries thought so, but when anyone is that bored and lonely with nothing else to do but sit near a window and neighbor watch, your imagination gets the best of you.  Needless to say when it was all said and done, I was very displeased, but had a good nap.",

394,13 February 2018,coleboggan,10, The Best Thriller I've Ever Seen,"I think that Alfred Hitchcock's rear window is a fantastic movie. I'd go as far as to say that it is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. There are a few main aspects of the film that I would like to point out that sold me on this wonderful film: the framing and filming techniques, suspense building, and pacing of the film were all perfect, and made for an interesting, thrilling, and over-all exciting display of some of theater's finest filming techniques that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.
 First, the framing of the film was excellent. Upon first hearing the premise, that the entire movie takes place from one man's room, you might be hesitant. Such a boring, consistent setting couldn't possibly make for an interesting film. But within the first few minutes of starting, you find very quickly that these first impressions were very wrong. The film manages to build a complex, active, and very real world using just the room of main character, photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, and the view from his window. By cutting from shots of his apartment to the surrounding complex outside, the movie manages to make you think there's more to this film than just Jeff's living room. On top of this, the framing techniques used keep the film exciting. To start, you never see more than Jeff can through his window; this allows you to really connect with the characters, and theorize about the events going on at the same time as they do. We'll talk more about this under pacing, but the film always gives you just enough information to make you wonder what's really going on. Using what's not shown in frame as much as what is, Hitchcock manages to keep you glued to the screen throughout the movie.
 This lasting interest is brought about just as much through the pacing and suspense of the film. While Jeff is looking out his window one day, he notices some suspicious behavior from one of his neighbors, and begins to think he has witnessed a murder. As the film continues, the evidence of this is given to you in bits and pieces. You only see half the story, and half to piece the puzzle together yourself, along with the main characters, who slowly start to believe Jeff's theories about his neighbor's actions. However, with every bit of evidence towards the crime, Jeff's detective friend strikes it down with a completely logical explanation, leading Jeff, and the audience along with him, to believe that he might be delusional. Every plot point in the film is spaced beautifully, so that every time you think you've figured it out, some new idea or suspicious act comes up and throws you completely off. As Jeff slowly convinces more people that he's witnessed a murder, there are always others who outright deny his ideas.
 Another point related to pacing is the building of suspense. The movie manages to subtly build suspense as the movie progresses, resulting in a thrilling conclusion. One method it uses to do this is by confining our hero. Due to an accident at a race track, Jeff is confined to the wheelchair in his room with a broken leg. He is unable to leave his room, which is what results in him watching his neighbors through his rear window. The suspense continues to build as he watches helplessly as the events before him unfold. There's nothing he can do but watch it happen and try to make a convincing argument. 
 With all of these filming concepts combined, Alfred Hitchcock was able to produce one of the best thrillers of all time, certainly the best I've ever seen. It was intense, interesting, and kept me theorizing until the last second. With a great cast and exceptional production value, I would easily recommend this film to anyone looking for a classic with an exciting plot and interesting premise that will keep you engaged and entertained.",
395,11 May 2009,slaterspins,5, Through a Glass Not Darkly Enough,"First let me get this out of the way. I'm a huge Hitchcock fan. But this simply is not one of my favorites. Usually movies based on noir writer Cornell Woolrich's plots work very well with his unusual twists and turns and core themes of nothing being as it 'seems' until in the end we see 'the truth' behind the facade. There's a little of that here, but just a little. It's as straightforward as possible. Yes, the set for this movie is wonderful. But the 'star' turns from Stewart, Kelly, Ritter, even Burr et. al, are a bit artificial. James Stewart, I have to admit, I've never liked in Hitchcock movies like 'Rope' or 'Man Who Knew Too Much' - his aw shucks, limited acting vocabulary doesn't stretch far. Grace Kelly - I don't believe she is in love with this man for a minute. Her accent is strange throughout and distracting and she is wooden - trying so hard to look beautiful she doesn't dare let a real expression cross her face. Her saving the day from afar is the last thing I'd expect this Patrician Figure to attempt - maybe Teresa Wright or even an Anna Massey, but not Grace. Thelma does her shtick - but does it to better effect in ALL ABOUT EVE. Burr seems a bit uncomfortable in the role of the one-note hapless villain and Judith Evelyn seems lost as sea as well in her rather thankless cameo as Ms. Lonelyhearts. She does her usual hysterical turn, but not as well as she does in THE TINGLER or FEMALE ON THE BEACH. There are some boring stretches along the way and too much artifice here - notwithstanding the interesting 'claustropobic' set, done just as well in LIFEBOAT as far as I'm concerned. The actors never seemed real people but 'stars' playing themselves. As such, they didn't provide enough interest for me as characters and helped keep the movie a bit 'flat'. The so-called climactic scene of Burr confronting Stweart was a real let-down. I can name a lot of H's movies that seemed scarier and more real, and had great photography too, such as THE BIRDS, MARNIE, and the excellently acted FRENZY. Not to mention the tension, editing and groundbreaking cinematic 'vision' seen in his early black and white pictures. But this seems to be everybody's favorite and that's fine with me, there's no right or wrong opinion. This one just doesn't grab me.",

His girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly) is the polar opposite. Lisa is into fashion, while Jeff is into adventure. He's rugged, and she's gorgeous and really just too perfect for him. So while they're having their differences Jeff starts to suspect that a neighbor of his names Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) has killed his wife. Eventually Lisa becomes convinced too. They try to alert a friend of Jeff's named Lieutenant Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey) but he's not listening, so Jeff and Lisa take it up themselves. Jeff sends Lisa to investigate Thorwald's apartment but she is caught. When Thorwald goes to confront Jeff, he pushes Jeff out the window. Luckily the police save Jeff, Thorwald is arrested, and Jeff and Lisa reconnect. The whole film takes place in one room. Even when something is happening across the courtyard we see it through Jeff's binoculars. The only time this doesn't happen is near the end when the police catch Jeff from falling. The acting is all great. Stewart, and Kelly were both amazing in this movie. And it leaves you with an eerie feeling that a murder could be going on right by the house.",

Jimmy Stewart gives the best performance of his career as an actor.And also this is one of the best movies of 1954,and when i first watched this movie it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, Director Alfred Hitchcock really knew what he did behind the camera while he was shooting this timeless classic.",
404,18 November 2010,Keyska2004,10, Beware of what happens out back.,"This is the first movie that my wife and I fell in love with when we began dating. Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter all give stellar performances. Raymond Burr as a ""bad guy"", after watching Perry Mason for years it was hard to envision him out of character. Jimmy's photographic character is so obsessed with his work that he plays the bachelor for life man even though he has the most beautiful girlfriend in Grace Kelly. Thelma Ritter is the comedic relief character in this thriller, her know it and seen it all therapist makes you smile. The whole story is based out Jimmy's rear apartment window. Even though this fill is now over 50 years old, it still wins over kids today, Alfred Hitchcock was a superb director who knew how to get the most our of his actors. Music is one of the key elements in this film, where you need to watch it a couple of times to pick up on all of the nuances that Hitchcock is famous for in all of his films. As a side note, in the opening scenes you can see Alfred up in the studio apartment with the piano player, he always did a cameo scene in his movies. Enjoy this film with a friend so you can talk about it later on.",

The film is well executed, the story well developed and the climax of the events leads to a climax in the emotional department at the same time, like a catharsis for the characters. Not easy to make a film based on such a simple premise, and yet, Hitchcock does it again. The film never gets complacent and seeks to constantly bring just enough to justify its playing time, while not going overboard or derailing from the plot, something mediocre films tend to do when the plot is this simple and they need to inject a dynamic into the events. A film with purpose that doesn't just tell an intriguing suspenseful story. Another solid Hitchcock.",

408,15 February 2018,awm-77697,6, Rear window movie review,"Rear window is such a unique and interesting movie. It is one that almost stands alone in its plot and camera angles and things of that sort. During the first twenty to thirty minutes of this movie it was almost extremely boring and I kept constantly asking myself the same question over and over again, which is ""are they really going to keep the camera in this one room for the whole movie?"" I kept on telling myself that the camera would probably move sometime soon and they would change scenery sometime soon, but that time just never came. Throughout the film it took sometime for me to actually accept the new movie style that Hitchcock portrays in this film. 
 During this film I went through almost 3 different stages of interest. The first stage consisted mostly of confusion and trying to figure out what was going on as they were introducing the different characters and scenarios. It was a very new movie feel for me so it took time to get used to. The second phase for me was unfortunately boredom, as I couldn't really engage into what was being played out in the different apartments. It wasn't until the end of the movie, about the time when the dog is found dead with its neck snapped that I really started to enjoy and became engaged in the film. The ending was very engaging and was extremely well done. It created an excellent sense of tension and suspense that I think engages every single viewer. During the whole process of watching the movie I can't really say I enjoyed it at all but once I looked back on it and realized the different cinematic elements and styles I came to appreciate it and understand it more.
 I definitely have a strong bias here because I was born into a generation of such great quality cameras and such good editing and animation. For this reason it can be really hard for me to engage in older movies of this style. Nonetheless this movie was very interesting to look back on and see how Hitchcock portrayed the characters in such an interesting way. It was so different and cool to basically see people as non-actors but just as every day people. You really get a sense of this when the movie is portraying someone in their everyday life without them supposedly knowing that they are being watched. You see the pureness of every shot. This film really enacts a different feeling in the viewer, as it is something were really not used to seeing.
 Overall I cant really say that I enjoyed this movie to much as I found it slightly boring and un-engaging. There are many great cinematic elements that make it very different and interesting. The whole stationary camera sense was just two different for me and I was able to really appreciate and enjoy the movie very much.",

412,25 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,10," Amongst considerable competition, one of Hitchcock's very finest films.","Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window is one of his most celebrated movies, with reasons often cited including its suspense and the leading performance from James Stewart as a man trapped in his apartment due to an injury and who has nothing better to do than spy on his neighbours. But the reasons that the film works so very well are more complicated than that.
Stewart plays photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, who has been stuck in his apartment for six weeks after breaking his leg and has been gradually drawn into voyeuristic fascination with his neighbours' lives. Naturally, the audience becomes as fascinated by the voyeurism and the glimpses of other lives as Jeff does and this is critical to the film's success in seizing and maintaining the viewer's attention: Jeff does not witness a murder, but rather starts to observe behaviour in one of his neighbours that makes him suspicious - correctly - that one has taken place. The suspense lies in Jeff's attempts to find definitive proof that his neighbour - Lars Thorwald - is guilty of wrong-doing, with some help from his girlfriend Lisa and nurse Stella.
Thus, for much of the film the plot unfolds slowly and steadily and is more mystery than thriller. However, from the moment that Lisa slips a note under Thorwald's door, things get palpably tenser, especially when she subsequently breaks into Thorwald's flat and he returns before she's left. There's an arresting moment when Thorwald realises that he is being watched and stares directly into the camera - both Jeff's and Hitchcock's. The dramatic climax, with Thorwald attacking Jeff in his flat, is masterfully tense, with Jeff only able to defend himself with his camera flash as he desperately tries to hold off his assailant long enough for the police to arrive.
This intriguing plot, which cleverly invites the audience to join Jeff in his voyeurism and subsequent desire to prove that Thorwald has murdered his wife, is only one reason why Rear Window is so successful. There are many other contributing factors, from John Michael Hayes' sparklingly witty screenplay to the performances of the actors. James Stewart conveys Jeff's frustration and suspicion perfectly, as he becomes convinced of Thorwald's guilt and has to try and convince other people of it, and he makes Jeff look convincingly terrified as Thorwald tries to throw him out of the window to his death. Grace Kelly is typically endearing as Jeff's love interest Lisa, who he keeps trying to push away, since he doesn't believe that she could ever adapt to his lifestyle as a globe-trotting photographer; having initially tried to act as a voice of reason in the face of his suspicions, she gradually becomes convinced of Thorwald's guilt and becomes an active participant in Jeff's investigations, exposing herself to danger in a way that suggests the couple has a future together. Raymond Burr plays Thorwald and gets very few lines, but manages to exude menace in long-shot throughout the film.
Hitchcock's frequent collaborator Robert Burks provides the cinematography and does so in a way that perfectly suits the film's subject matter. We get many POV shots as Jeff spies on his neighbours; tantalisingly, we are led to make the same conclusions about Raymond Burr's Lars Thorwald as Jeff does, because the camera shows us exactly what he sees. The film is set entirely within Jeff's flat and the enormous and highly detailed Greenwich Village courtyard set, which gives the film a confined, claustrophobic feel that reflects Jeff's temporary isolation. Franz Waxman's soundtrack is confined to the credits - most of the soundtrack consists of diagetic sounds and music, as we hear the noises from neighbouring apartments that Jeff hears. Everything about the film's script and direction is carefully designed to draw the audience into Jeff's situation. Thus, the death of the dog - which Jeff and the audience have watched scampering around the courtyard several times - has more emotional impact than the death of Thorwald's wife, whom we never see.
Rear Window's enduring popularity is therefore not simply a product of an engaging and intriguing storyline, but a result of Hitchcock's near-perfect execution of his craft. Amongst considerable competition, it remains one of his very finest films.",

The film looks great.  You can see Lars Thorwald's lit cigar in his dark apartment and the sunset has color that hasn't been seen since the original theatrical run.  The film will never age.  Hitchcock's masterful direction draws you into the life of L.B. Jeffries and his confinement to a wheelchair.  The only things we are allowed to see is what Jeffries can see.   One stormy night, Jeffries hears a scream that sets his suspicions running.  Did Lars Thorwald kill his wife?  If not, why is he acting so strangely? Hitchcock pulls us deeper into the mystery the same way that Jeffries hooks his nurse and girlfriend.  Eventually, they start doing all the footwork and all Jeffries can do is watch.   The fun of Rear Window is watching the tension mount as Hitchcock work his cinematic touches to bring the fear and anxiety from the screen, and have it do a number on your nerves.   A great film that will always be entertaining.",

It's a perfect view of everyone their. There's a very attractive young lady who's very much into dancing. An older couple who have developed a simple little system so that they can allow their pet dog to be 'let out' so to speak from the 3rd floor balcony, and there is a couple who constantly seems to be arguing about something. This is the couple that become intricate to the story. Eventually the wife disappears and the wheelchair bound man becomes obsessed with the idea that the wife has been murdered. What follows is a buildup which is Hitchcock all the way. Nobody builds suspense like him, and even though I was disappointed by the ending because I was kind of hoping for more of a twist, it's still pretty powerful. I highly recommend.

It's actually been remade under different names at least 3 times (one with Christopher Reeve after his accident), so it's highly influental. And proves, like Rope (but better) that with the right man behind the camera, you CAN make a movie suspenseful with only one location. We are peeping toms alongside Stewart (I remember a quote from Ricky Gervais: ""If I walk past a house without curtains, I look inside. It's they're bloody fault), staring in on happy and sad lifes. And again Hitch steps out of the curve, making Grace Kelly the adventerous hero, and James Stewart... well, impotent, as Hitchcock himself said. He is a man of adventure, but cant do anything with a broken leg, other than spying. Btw, some of the dialogue is funny as hell, considered when it was filmed.

It still is a masterpiece and is a sorry comment on movies today which rely more on technology and violence to hold an audience rather than characters and plot. A really talky film, it's an entire four course meal that truly satisfies. What has always impressed me is the final scene with Thorwald where you actually feel sorry for the guy. It's a rare film maker that can make you do this, after setting him up as the villain for two hours. This film can be studied for the wonderful use of camera alone and still be compelling.

I have, up until today, NEVER watched Rear Window. I went in with high expectations after seeing Hitchcock's brilliant Psycho and my high expectations were blown away! I loved everything about this movie. In my opinion, it is one of the few movies that define a flawless, classical masterpiece! The acting by everyone is brilliant which makes us interested in each of these characters. Normally old people like Stella, who is quite a main character, can get really frustrating but here we like a character like her. I also enjoyed Lisa's character and Jefferies great.",

The idea of setting an entire film in just one location would seem like a major faux pas in a thriller film.

This piece of art is also magnificently told and just keeps you going and meanwhile changing your opinion many times during movie. Did he kill or did he not how to be certain and then things just get real bad. Then the character of neighbor is more revealed and you get feeling that he might have killed his wife. After all trouble and nervousness that couple of scenes brought it's finally clear that he killed her without any doubt but... Here he comes and there is no one to protect Jeff as he is unable to get away but threat is closer and closer. Finally it get to he high point in movie where he struggles to keep his life and amazingly he does it. So much tension this movie brings that it you keeps you stunned and focused for almost two hours and you want more but it ends. Performances by our lead actors were amazingly beautiful and they are something you are going to remember and tell everyone about. Magnificent, glorious, tense, profoundly mysterious. 4/4",

One day he suspects he has seen a man cover up his wife's murder. Also involved is Lisa played by the stunning Grace Kelly, she is a fun society girl and she is falling for L.B, she also gets on the idea of the man murdering his wife. Hitchock plays out suspense like no other. Not only does he amazing talent for suspense the lines he gives Jimmy Stewart and the way he spits out so funny and amazing. This was a small short story put onto the screen that is like a play. This is a true masterpiece of cinema. I can't believe that Hitchcock never won an Oscar in his career. He got a lifetime achievement Oscar but it's not really the same.",

Jeffries was a great character and always knew what to do. Like when the man came from across the street came into Jeffrie's room, he knew to make the camera flash go off to protect himself. The character was also great because he would always make snappy lines about the murderer. It was fun to watch the murderer become so mad at Jeffries. Jeffries was really smart and funny. That was the main reason I liked this movie. Eventually, I would like to see ""The Birds"" That movie is a story about a town that is attacked by evil birds. Both movies were rumored to be great. This is a definite see!",
462,2 March 2008,HelloTexas11,8, Hitchcock gets us again,"Alfred Hitchcock certainly lives up to his 'master of suspense' billing with 'Rear Window,' as it is one of the most suspenseful movies ever made. It's also probably the ultimate 'talk back to the screen' film. About a third of the way through till the end, you'll find yourself thinking and maybe even saying out loud, ""Oh no!"" and ""don't go in there!"" and ""hurry before he gets back!"" etc. So it's great fun to watch, a real nail-biter. The entire film takes place on one elaborately built set, the back of a four-sided, four-story apartment complex with a small courtyard in the middle. Watching 'Rear Window' is like watching a stage play albeit on a stage like no other. Everyone, apparently, can see into everyone else's apartment when the windows are left open, which they obligingly are, most of the time. This would seem to stretch credulity to the breaking point, since everyone is apparently just as oblivious to being watched, but one accepts it as crucial to the plot and after a certain point it hardly seems to matter. James Stewart stars as a man confined to his apartment in a wheelchair for several weeks due to a broken leg, and takes to, well, spying on his neighbors. What begins as a way to fend off boredom soon becomes an obsession. There is the newlywed couple (the only ones who typically have their shades drawn); a songwriter who plays his piano a lot; a single woman Stewart dubs 'Miss Lonely Hearts' because she imagines having suitors over for dinner; a gorgeous blonde who is forever doing exercises and dancing; another couple that sleep out on their stoop every night; and most importantly, a man (Raymond Burr) and his nagging wife. Stewart becomes convinced, after the wife disappears, that Burr has killed her and disposed of her body. Grace Kelly plays Stewart's girlfriend and Thelma Ritter, an insurance company nurse who checks in on him regularly. They are both skeptical at first of his theory but soon are drawn into it and become as obsessed as he is. I don't normally issue 'spoiler alerts' even though I'm always giving the end away, but since the build-up in 'Rear Window' is so crucial, I will this time. The only time I was disappointed in this film was at the very end. I was expecting some sort of twist or surprise ending, and the denouement when it came was no surprise at all, except perhaps in that it wasn't a surprise. Maybe that was the point. Frankly, I tended to agree with the police officer who occasionally dropped by Stewart's apartment to discuss the matter and ended up pooh-poohing most of Stewart's notions. All through the movie, Stewart's character reminded me of a conspiracy buff... one of those people who is convinced men didn't really land on the moon or someone other than Oswald killed JFK. Or in this case, is convinced through a lot of circumstantial evidence, some of it very questionable, that his neighbor killed his wife. But as I said, maybe that's the point, because the evidence Stewart sees is what keeps us in suspense for two hours. Is he right or is this just a bored man's wild imagination working overtime and a half? It's fun to conjecture the latter is true, even if the former was the correct assumption all along.",

The romance makes for an interesting subplot also showing up its era. Grace Kelly plays a society sweetheart who has fallen for a photographer. She wants to marry and he doesn't.

James Stewart plays the 'louse' who declares she could never follow him through the middle east photographing on dangerous assignments and he could never fit into her ideal.

Jeffries (James Stewart) can't resist the urge of peeking at his neighbours. What makes this movie so great, besides the witty dialogue and simple yet perfectly executed plot, has to be that unique feeling where you become one with the main character. As a viewer you share and experience everything from Jeffries' perspective which automatically creates a certain suspense. Personally, I found the authenticity of this movie to be quite charming. Rear Window remains an all-time classic for a reason. Good walls make good neighbours, but what happens when you're getting a bit too curious?",
475,11 December 2018,emmakenny-39680,9, Suspense through lighting,"Rear Window is a great example of Hitchcock's mastery of cinematography. This movie follows the story of Jefferies, an adventure seeking photographer that is stuck in his small apartment due to a leg injury he received while on the job. He resorts to finding entertainment by watching his neighbors through his rear window. When he notices some suspicious behavior from one of the occupants across the way his boring recovery becomes a lot more interesting. Through solving this mystery Jefferies learns a lot about himself, his relationships with others, and how people interact with each other.
This movie is a great example of using lights and shadows to create suspense. By having the entire movie filmed from one vantage point, Jeffeirie's apartment, the light was pretty restricted. However, Hitchcock creates amazing effects with minimal light. By using the window blinds to highlight certain parts of the room Hitchcock is able to make certain moments in the film more intense for the viewers. One of the most effective ways lighting was used to create suspense was by only having the eyes of the actors in the light. This made the characters more mysterious and invoked a sense of fear into the viewers.
Overall this was a fantastic film that incorporated the elements of cinematography extremely well and had a entertaining and captivating story line.",

For the entirety of the film we're looking through the eyes of our main character Jeff, looking at things he knows he shouldn't be. We become connected to Jeff and when he can't stop himself from seeing and believing things he shouldn't, nor can we. This is the genius of Hitchcock. His main character becomes a vessel.

Alfred Hitchcock does a careful job at selecting the perfect cast for this movie. James Stewart as L.B. Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Freemont. He especially does a great job of casting Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald. Raymond was in his thirties when this movie was made, but they made him look twenty five years older. Throughout this movie, Jeffries is stuck in his apartment with a broken leg. He is not left alone though. Stella (Thelma Ritter) comes in every day in the morning to take care of him, and Lisa (Grace Kelly) visits him at night. Being stuck in his apartment all day has him bored to death. He has nothing better to do than to look out the rear window at others, either walking around, or across the court yard.

Rear Window is something you don't see often in the cinema, Hitchcock had the freedom to take a ""crazy"" and tough idea into the work, and the fact that it's from 1954 it's mind blowing. With this film,Hitchcock was a child playing with a doll house, and he did it properly.
