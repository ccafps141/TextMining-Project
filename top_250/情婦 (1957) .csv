0,6 March 2006,bkoganbing,9, The Goal Is Always Justice,"In a recent biography of Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen. I can't praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.",/

3,3 February 2005,The_Void,8, Another triumph for cinematic genius Billy Wilder!,"Billy Wilder is a director with an understanding of cinema that is almost unmatched throughout the medium's entire history - that's why his films are always so good. Witness for the Prosecution is yet another highlight in the great director's history, and it proves that courtroom dramas can be both riveting and a great opportunity for some first rate comedy. Wilder's film features one of the most well paced plots I've ever seen in a film, and it's a plot that includes some very finely tuned twists. Towards the end, Wilder bombards us with twist after twist, each one both making sense and topping the one before it. In a time when people are impressed by films such as 'The Sixth Sense', Billy Wilder still shows us how to skilfully attribute a twist into a film's plot. The plot itself follows the story of Sir Wilfrid Robarts; an ace defence lawyer that has been told that his health won't allow him to tackle anything more than mundane cases, but is brought back into the fray when a case involving the murder of an elderly woman comes into his hands. Wilfrid must now juggle the case and his health as he attempts to keep the young man from being sent down.",v
4,10 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9, This had me to the bitter end!,"I love it when a movie captivates me, carries me along, then surprises me at the end. This is a masterpiece of human maneuvering. It has outstanding acting and a plot to die for. This is a fairly pedestrian Agatha Christie short story. I'm not saying it's not a wonderful story, just that it doesn't come to life like it does on the screen. Charles Laughton is the wonder barrister who is taking the case, even though he is in poor health. The murder case seems a relatively simple one until we begin to trip over the many layers left lying on the path. Marlene Dietrich does a masterful job in all her roles (I won't say anymore than that so I don't spoil the ending). Tyrone Power is able to balance his pathos and his potential guilt. The beauty of the movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. There are some modestly funny subplots and a great deal of careful investigation. I guarantee you that once you start watching, you won't be able to turn it off.",i
5,27 October 2017,Coventry,9, The Mother of all Courtroom dramas/thrillers.,"Yours truly has never been much of a reader, though with one notable exception: the work of Agatha Christie. I absolutely, positively worship this brilliant woman and try to read as many of her novels, short stories and stage play adaptations as possible. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a genuine classic, and although somewhat atypical for Christie, it is undeniably one of the greatest stories ever penned down. There's one major disadvantage about having read all of Christie's whodunits, of course, namely that you can't experience the same astounding twist-in-the-end twice! I would really have loved to be overwhelmed by the climax of this film- version, especially because Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power give away such fabulous performances. The story, with its fascinating characters and dazzling plot twists, does remain the movie's biggest strongpoint, but there are a number of more reasons why ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is righteously considered as one of the most massive milestones in cinematic history. Billy Wilder's surefooted direction, for one, and the stellar performances of the entire ensemble cast. I mentioned Dietrich and Power already, but there's also the downright phenomenal Charles Laughton (arguably the most shamefully neglected actor/director in history) and an appealing supportive role for Elsa Lancaster. But do I daresay that the ultimate success-factor of this stage play adaptation is the masterful re-creation of the court trial? The bombastic settings and decors, the echoing acoustics, the powerful monologues of confident (and arrogant) barristers and the intimidating gowns and wigs are largely what make ""Witness for the Prosecution"" not only the first but also the mother of all courtroom dramas. This may just be the opinion of an avid fan, but practically ALL great courtroom-dramas that were released from the sixties until present day (""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Philadelphia"", ""Devil's Advocate"", ""A Few Good Men""Â…) were clearly influenced by ""Witness for the Prosecution"". In fact, I only have one minor complaint: *** Spoiler **** the film version adds one more final twist that I didn't find 100% plausible.",e
6,7 September 2015,AlsExGal,10," ""I suspected something, but not that. Never that!""","That's a quotation from the film and what you'll say at the conclusion. I saw it the first time 36 years ago back when network TV ran old movies late at night, and I'd never even heard of it. I thought it was a Hitchcock film with all of the unexpected twists, but no, the director was Billy Wilder. How surprised I was to see Wilder do Hitchcock better than Hitchcock ever could! The set-up is this - Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is an inventor that is having trouble getting his inventions to market. He befriends a wealthy older woman, one Emily French. She is obviously flirting with him, and Vole, though married, flirts back, his objective being that maybe she will financially back one of his inventions. Then disaster strikes. Emily French is found murdered. Vole is an obvious suspect because Mrs. French has just changed her will and left everything to Vole. There is circumstantial evidence pointing to Vole, and he says he knows nothing about the will. Enter barrister Sir Wilfred, the finest in England, whose doctor has told him he must quit work and go on a vacation because of his heart condition. Sir Wilfred talks to Vole, believes his story, and also talks to his wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich) who backs up Leonard's story but comes across as somewhat cold to her husband's peril. Sir Wilfred is convinced to take the case and agrees to retire upon this last trial. Past that I cannot tell you any details or I'll ruin it for you.",w
7,30 December 2007,littlemartinarocena,10, A Hitchcockian Billy Wilder,"At the end of the day the films you give top marks are those films that become constant companions. You can see them again at the drop of a hat, you show them to people who have never see them and it's always a triumph. ""Witness For The Prosecution"" is one of those wonders. Suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy this banquet of a romp. Charles Laughton showed here what he was made of better, more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films, at least the moments with him in it, are unforgettable - Captain Blight or Henry VIII, Quasimodo or that malefic Senator from South Carolina. Here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it's such an incredible fun to watch him do it. Tyrone Power is a toy in his hands but not Marlene Dietrich who stands her ground, not merely as a character but as a presence on the screen. Billy Wilder visits early Hitchcock territory with wit and fun. Elsa Lanchester's nurse is the cherry on top of this delightful film.",/
8,29 August 2004,flickershows,8, Love That Laughton,"Charlie Chaplin was funny. Charles Laughton was witty. As good as 'Witness For The Prosecution' is---Agatha Christie's story, the other actors, the technical expertise---the Oscar-nominated Laughton is THE reason to see this film. What he brings to Billy Wilder's 1957 courtroom thriller is his tremendous wit and intellect. It's a serious story, but the dark-comic tag team of Wilder/Laughton upgraded the film from ""a good courtroom mystery"" to ""a classic of the courtroom genre"".",r
9,16 April 2018,HotToastyRag,9, One of the best courtroom movies of all time,"Witness for the Prosecution is one of the most entertaining courtroom stories of all time, written by the crime mistress herself, Agatha Christie. Charles Laughton completely owns the courtroom, starring as a famously brilliant barrister who's supposed to be taking a break for his health-but he gets drawn in by a truly compelling murder trial. Tyrone Power, in his last movie, has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. While all the evidence racks up against him, Charles doesn't give up hope and tries to win the case, all the while trying to crack the very hard nut Marlene Dietrich. Marlene is Tyrone's wife, and it's impossible to tell what she's really thinking or feeling.",w
10,2 February 2006,theowinthrop,10, The Best of the Pre - 1970s Agatha Christie films?,"After the artistic success of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, the only notable film based on Dame Agatha Christie's stories was a remake of LOVE FROM A STRANGER with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney as the ill-matched couple, but re-staged in the 1890s rather than 1930 England. Then, in 1957, Billy Wilder made this production of a short story by Dame Agatha called WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. With a tip-top cast of Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power, and Elsa Lancaster, the film was a brilliantly done version of Christie's short story, changed in it's ending (but to a changed ending found in Christie's own dramatization).

Leonard is a former soldier that fought in World War II and is married with his beloved German wife Christine Helm Vole (Marlene Dietrich). He is unemployed and accused of seducing and murdering the wealthy middle-aged single woman Emily French (Norma Varden) to inherit 80,000 pounds.

16,11 January 2006,rmax304823,7, Suspenseful and amusing Christie,"It's hard to imagine how Dame Agatha could have pounded out so many mysteries. I know she lived a long time, but still, if I lived as long as Methusala I couldn't grind out that many pieces. Not just novels, either, but plays, including this one. And they all tell the kinds of stories that involve a lot of lead time while the author works out the details of the intricate plots. Between Jack Kerouac knocking out ""On The Road"" on a single roll of toilet paper or whatever it was, and Nabokov and his multitudinous 3 X 5 index cards, Christie must have been very much closer to Nabokov.",8
17,13 January 2007,dtb,10," Wilder, Laughton, Lanchester, & Dietrich Add Sparkle to Christie's Courtroom Classic","WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! The Billy Wilder touch adds cynical wit to his sparkling adaptation of Dame Agatha Christie's play WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (WftP), with some of the best lines in a Wilder movie since DOUBLE INDEMNITY, thanks to Wilder, Harry Kurnitz, and Larry Marcus. In our household, ""Is that really desirable?"" has become a catchphrase, along with many other gems from the mouths of star Charles Laughton and the rest of the sterling cast! :-) I only hope people seeing this for the first time haven't already seen Marlene Dietrich's scene-stealing performance in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL, or they might tumble to the twist finale before they're supposed to! :-) (In fact, if I recall correctly, when WftP was shown on Turner Classic Movies, Robert Osborne mentioned in his intro that Welles helped Dietrich out with her WftP ""Cockney informant"" makeup as a favor!) La Dietrich looks fabulous and keeps you fascinated even when she's coming across as the ultimate bitch; it's a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar along with co-stars Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Tyrone Power's usual slightly wooden delivery actually serves him well as the defendant; somehow it adds to defendant Leonard Vole's air of feckless innocence. Henry Daniell, John Williams, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, and particularly Norma Varden as the ill-fated Emily French provide able support, too, with Una O'Connor stealing her scenes as Mrs. French's loyal but ""antagnistic"" Scottish housekeeper. A young, brunette Ruta Lee provides a memorable moment or two. As sickly but sly barrister Wilfrid Robarts and his chipper but no-nonsense nurse, Miss Plimsoll, real-life husband and wife Laughton and Lanchester shine in the most engaging performances of their careers. The comic sparring chemistry between Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Miss Plimsoll, and the warmth and understanding that's grown between them by movie's end, had my husband Vinnie opining that if another movie was made featuring these characters, Miss Plimsoll would probably end up as Mrs. Robarts before it was over -- what a delightful series that could have been! Hey, at the very least, I'd have paid good money to see Billy Wilder direct Laughton, Lanchester, and Dietrich in a sequel in which Sir Wilfrid prepares for the trial of Christine Vole, a.k.a. Christine Helm! :-)",/

19,4 January 2008,willandthomas-picturehou,9, Fun with Charles and Marlene,"To see ""Witness for the Prosecution"" for the first time in 2008 is a jolting surprise. Nobody could do it better than Billy Wilder did in 1957. A man accused of murder, Tyrone Power, the weakest link in this terrific chain. Sir Wilfred is called to defend him, he is played by the extraordinary Charles Laughton, but he's just out of hospital - he wasn't dismissed he was expelled - and due to doctor's orders he's not to take any criminal cases. He finds Power charming and personable enough but he's not going to risk his life to save his until Marlene Dietrich makes her entrance - and what an entrance!

WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is best appreciated by a slightly more mature viewer, and you'll find it a genuine knockout! This is one film that will keep you mesmerized, and rightly so, with the likes of legendary author Agatha Christie's assistance in the writer's seat and veteran Billy Wilder in the director's perch. It is also, and sadly, a fond farewell to the talents of Tyrone Power, who is quite good as the accused! And talk about an incredible cast. Marlene Dietrich, a bit more mature here, nearly steals the production away from her fellow actors with one unforgettable performance, as does crusty, ole Charles Laughton, who indeed has his hands full with this complicated case.

35,19 December 2007,ackstasis,8," ""I am constantly surprised that women's hats do not provoke more murders.""","Alfred Hitchcock once remarked that he often had fans approaching him to say how much they enjoyed 'Witness for the Prosecution (1957).' Knowing Hitch's wicked sense of humour, he probably would have gone along with it, but that doesn't change the fact that the film belongs to Billy Wilder, however reminiscent of a Hitchcock picture it might be. Adapted from a short story, and subsequently a play, by mystery author Agatha Christie, the film has a distinct theatrical feel to it, the story gradually unfolding mostly through dialogue, with the occasional important flashback. Just as 'Witness for the Prosecution' feels like the work of the Master of Suspense, it noticeably lacks the classy style of the actual director, with the confines of the courtroom drama perhaps unsuited to Wilder's trademark sparkling repartee {though Charles Laughton certainly gets in a few masterful wise-cracks}.

Laughton is wonderful as the aging & ailing defense attorney(barrister in England) with a typical mysterious performance by Marlene Dietrich and a sometimes hammy performance by Tyrone Powers.  A lot of talented people were a part of this production of a Agatha Christie story & screenplay including Director Billy Wilder.  They all came through remarkedly and presented this story as it is(a well-written courtroom drama that was originally a play).  Wilder did a good job of letting the actor's play this story out and it shows in the final production.,

With no alibi, a choice motive, and Voles' own wife testifying against him, can Sir Wilfrid win the case before the strain kills him ?",
52,4 August 2013,misterjiggy,9, I want Charles Laughton as Council!,"Charles Laughton is absolutely hilarious and superbly witty as barrister/solicitor in this film, in fact- I cannot recall any courtroom lawyer who has a better grasp of language cadence and tone and pitch as the great Charles Laughton which makes his courtroom defence posturing unlike any! Further, outside of the court, Charles has such a finicky and droll humour that I was so tickled by his badgering of his nurse (who happens to be his wife in real life).",
53,27 October 2005,itamarscomix,9, A Whodunit Masterpiece,"I, myself, am not a fan of Agatha Christie's or of any of her followers; I rarely find the strength to keep up with all the clues and the various witnesses, lawyers, cross-examinations and objections which all lead up to the inevitable conclusion that, well, The Butler Did It. I can certainly understand the appeal in this kind of puzzle-movie; it just never appealed to me. To me the main problem with this kind of stories is that usually, more emphasis is put on the clues than on the characters Â– and so, when the real murderer is finally revealed, I say: ""well, how about that?"" Â– I simply don't care.",
54,16 October 2006,Galina_movie_fan,9," Guilty, Your Honor Â– I Love This Movie:","The film is based on Agatha Christie's story with the enormous twist not on the last page but on the last line. Billy Wilder's direction is perfect and all actors get it right. Charles Laughton is absolutely superb; he has the best lines and scenes and he brings the wit, intelligence, and the heart to the film. Marlene Dietrich is perfect playing not one but three roles, convincingly transforming from one character to another, from the present to the past. This is not just a good mystery but a classic of the courtroom genre and a very enjoyable film even after you know the ending. ""Witness for the Prosecutionis"" is one of my favorite Agatha Christie's screen adaptations.",
55,26 October 2004,jotix100,9, The burden of proof,"The superb adaptation of Agatha Christie's play is evident in this movie of 1957, which, by the way, it's still interesting to watch today, as it must was in the theater. The film was greatly helped by the direction of Billy Wilder who was able to achieve great performances all around from his cast.",
56,19 July 2008,sddavis63,9, The Best Courtroom Drama I've Ever Seen,"Charles Laughton (surely one of the finest actors who has ever lived) put on an absolutely superb performance in this movie as the aging and well known defense attorney Wilfrid Robarts, who is hired to defend a man accused of murdering an elderly widow he had befriended in order to gain her estate. Laughton manages to combine comedy (he's at times very funny, particularly in his exchanges with his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester) with great drama and he does it seamlessly; everything about this movie flows absolutely perfectly. His client is Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Powers.) Powers also seemed to me to capture the essence of his character - sleazy looking enough to make you wonder if he's guilty, but also angst ridden enough to make you doubt that he's guilty. Of the main actors, I wasn't especially taken by Marlene Dietrich as Vole's wife Christine. I haven't seen a lot of Dietrich's work, but from what I have seen I have to confess that she's never really turned my crank; she's no different here. Something about her performance (here and in other bits of her work that I've seen) just comes across as artificial. I can't explain it any better than that. Having said that, one performance that to me was sub-par (and her performance here probably suffers mostly in comparison with Laughton and Powers) can't detract from an excellent courtroom drama that keeps you guessing right up to the very end. The last twenty minutes or so especially are full of so many twists and turns that your head is spinning by the time it's over. I also appreciated the look at the inside of a British courtroom and its procedures, since most of the courtroom dramas I've seen are American. (As an aside, it was interesting to see Ian Wolfe as Robarts' valet Carter. Wolfe had a very long career in movies and television, never from what I can remember as a star, but as a supporting actor or guest star in everything from great movies such as this to TV shows like ""Star Trek"" or ""WKRP in Cincinnati."" What was most interesting about him was that from the time this movie was made in 1957 to his later work in TV he doesn't seem to change. He's immediately recognizable.) As for this movie, it's a truly excellent piece of work. 9/10",

68,11 June 2015,Quinoa1984,10, a very good movie with two towering performances,"Sir Wilfrid is such a bothersome, craggly old sod. He's just gotten back from having a heart attack, and is very big and very weak. But that doesn't mean he will give up his brandy or his cigars very easily, even if it means he has to stuff the later into his cane by secret compartment. He's a barrister, and a legendary one; he gets a case and it could very well be his last (probably before this became a clichÃ©, the ""final"" go-around for a character who's been around the block), involving a man seemingly wrongfully accused of killing an old lady who he became friendly with right before she was offed. Who did it? Was it him? Can it be proved that there's reasonable suspicion, at least in British court's eyes. He has to defend this man, Leonard Vole (Power), with his German wife (Dietrich) not really someone he wants to put on the stand to defend him. And while all this is going on, he has to watch his pill intake and swap his hot cocoa for brandy without his nurse watching.",
69,1 November 2003,zetes,6," Ridiculously overrated, but Laughton and Lanchester are excellent","Typical of Billy Wilder films, Witness for the Prosecution is mediocre and overrated. I don't know how his fans defend him so passionately. Sure, he made a few great films, but looking at this courtroom drama, one of his more popular films, how can anyone deny how hackneyed, predictable, and often just how plain stupid it is? I hate courtroom dramas, but this one is particularly laughable in its depiction of courtroom activities. Fortunately, it does contain two brilliant performances by Charles Laughton and his wife, Elsa Lanchester. Laughton plays the lawyer who defends alleged murderer Tyrone Powell (in his last performance, and what must be one of his worst). He has recently suffered a heart attack, and is advised to take it cool for a while. Elsa Lanchester is his pesky nurse. Their chemistry recalls their great performances in The Private Life of Henry VIII from a quarter of a century earlier. These two keep this sinking ship of a movie from becoming totally sunk. In fact, with the clever twist at the end, I was almost ready to say I liked it; the three good points, Laughton, Lanchester, and the twist made the film a somewhat pleasant waste of time. But then there is a second twist which is utterly forced and utterly idiotic, so my final verdict must be a slight disapproval. Still, if you haven't seen it, Laughton and Lanchester are worth the time. 6/10.",
70,24 April 2005,emdragon,7, silly ending spoils good movie,"I watched Witness For the Prosecution tonight, and was struck by it. It is an interesting courtroom drama with solid performances all round; compelling in it's style and makeup, and well directed. But the ending, after such a plausible and almost beautiful winding story of complete believability. . . left me shaking my head in disbelief. How the film makers could allow such a fine picture to collapse with such a concoction of trumped up melo-dramatic absurdity in the final scene goes beyond absurdity. It was as though someone in the production staff decided they had to save Charles Laughton's (who gave a grand performance as the lead defense English barrister, Sir Wilford Robarts) reputation, so that he did'nt come off looking as though he had been duped by the main characters involved in the murder he was defending. Afterall, Laughton had been the beloved protagonist featured as the barrister hero throughout the film. So at the end, when the wife (Marlene Dietrich) saves the murderer (Tyrone Power) from the gallows, they had to quickly concoct a scene to avenge the wicked and scandalous trick that had been played on the defense team, the law, and the true hand of justice. If they had allowed the husband and wife to walk off together hand in hand into the sunset at the end, I would have said this is one of the greatest courtroom pictures ever made. But Billy Wilder could have done much better with the ending IMO, which had nothing to do with plausibility, and for me almost ruined the picture. ",

74,21 March 2023,Uriah43,7, Another Excellent Performance by Charles Laughton,"This film essentially begins with a man by the name of ""Leonard Vole"" (Tyrone Power) walking into the office of a prominent London barrister named ""Sir Wilfred Robarts"" (Charles Laughton) along with his own lawyer ""Mr. Mayhew"" (Henry Daniell). Although Sir Robarts is recovering from a serious illness and told to take it easy, he agrees to listen to Mr. Vole and hear what he has to say. It's then disclosed that Mr. Vole is about to be charged with murder and both he and Mr. Mayhew want Sir Robarts to defend him in court. Sure enough, while their conversation is taking place, the police arrive and charge Mr. Vole with the murder of a wealthy widow named ""Emily French"" (Norma Varden). That being said, Sir Robarts agrees to defend him. This decision, on the other hand, displeases his private nurse ""Miss Plimsoll"" (Elsa Lanchester) who had previously done everything she could to prevent the meeting in the first place. Not only that, but further stress is added when Mr. Vole's wife ""Christine Vole"" (Marlene Dietrich) openly professes doubts that her husband is innocent of the charges against him. Needless to say, this creates some problems for Sir Robarts--which is only made worse when she is called up as a witness for the prosecution. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I found this movie to be quite entertaining due in large part to the performance of Charles Laughton who really rose to the occasion. Likewise, I also liked the performance of Elsa Lanchester as well. That being said, however, I thought that both Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich weren't nearly as convincing and overacted to a certain degree. But that's just my opinion. In any case, I enjoyed this film for the most and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

81,26 July 2013,MrSpark,9, The master of suspense,"One of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, many people confuse the director for Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense, in fact this brilliant marvel of a movie was directed by none other than Billy Wilder one of the most bewitching director and writer of early Hollywood. The movie is a beautifully scripted courtroom drama with comic, dramatic and suspenseful elements based on the play by Agatha Cristie. It brings you unprecedented acting by Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. The role of the accused was played by Tyrone Power who delivers a very inspiring performance that manages to capture the sympathy of the audience. The simple set of the movie (The courtroom, The judge's house etc) indulges the audience to focus more on the actors and their astounding performances. The sole reason this movie left me in complete and utter awe is of course the twist ending, classic with Agatha Cristie plays, that I will not reveal for obvious reasons. I usually figure out movies with twists but I must say this came to me as a surprise, as I thought the movie was over. Summarizing, this Agatha Cristie courtroom drama gives us profound acting performances and delivers us a story with tremendously suspenseful cinematography and one of the best twist endings I've seen. Thus I give this beautifully wonderful movie a 9/10.",
82,13 January 2015,Seraphion,6, All surprises are (or should really be) in the ending,"The story nicely bring on a classic base of mystery of whether or not the client is guilty, the most often used premise of court movies. The movie nicely reveals the details one by one in an ordered manner, all the while having refreshing inserts of laughable remarks and mannerisms by Sir Wilfrid. What's really nice is that the details are placed so very neatly, scattered across the movie's duration, all the way up to the ending. Yet it must feel so very surprising in the times this movie was released. But today audiences are highly anticipative thus the placement and insertion tricks done in this movie will never work. The ending will have been spoiled at the very first appearance of Christine, especially if the audience marked closely on Leonard's description about her. The acting overall is just standard in my view. Tyrone Power didn't even bother to conjure up a decent British accent. Marlene Dietrich's emotion play may look astonishing at those old times but it sure is not now. The fact that she didn't change her voice, only her accent, when her character was supposedly under cover may well make the ending very predictable even for beginners to spot.",

84,3 November 2022,CinemaSerf,9, Witnes for the Prosecution,"I might be asking for trouble here, but did Charles Laughton ever actually make a bad film? He leads this one as the brilliant but curmudgeonly barrister ""Sir Wildred Robarts"" with oodles of charisma and style. Marlene Dietrich portrays the evil, manipulative ""Christine Vole"" marvellously and even Tyrone Power, more the matinÃ©e idol than the serious actor, delivers as required in Billy Wilder's outstanding rendition of the Agatha Christie story about a man accused of murdering an elderly lady who has just happened to leave him a great deal of money in her will. Elsa Lanchester is suitably annoying/scary/lovable as the nurse trying to keep her ailing charge from keeling over mid-trial and a slew of other capable British actors - including a wonderfully charismatic turn from Una O'Connor in the witness box - fill in the supporting roles well. It is one of those very rare occasions where everything just gels perfectly and it really is fun to watch. Some of Laughton's wry asides and put-down lines are genuinely laugh out loud too.

90,5 January 2023,timothywalton-31924,10," Witty, funny, marvellously written","Witness for the prosecution is an unqualified masterpiece of wit, dark humour, and irony. The performances by Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton are outstanding. Laughton plays a grumpy barrister who is often very very funny- courtesy of the witty script- but beneath this exterior he hides an astute, penetrating legal mind. The film is also unusually funny for a serious drama about a capital murder case, and it balances this light entertainment and serious drama deftly. An analysis of the themes of the film would reveal the true genius and achievement of the screenplay. Throughout the film we see matters through the eyes of the defence barrister, Sir Wilfred, so our perceptions of the man he is defending, Leonard, are inevitably coloured in his favour. We are not presented with an omniscient narrators eye to judge the merits of the case impartially. Therefore the ending comes a a shock to us- not because of its impossibility and incongruity, but shocked because of our realisation that Leonard had been deceiving our powerless minds all along. It is almost most ironic that Christine, who has fabricated an affair with another man to save a husband, shall now lose her husband because he actually did have an affair. Witness to a prosecution is simply a joy to watch for its witty, entertaining script and clever twists, which on first glance might seem like poor writing, but on closer examination, probes deeper than one could have ever imagined.",

This film has everything you could possibly want in a courtroom drama: a feisty but lovable defense attorney, known as barristers in Britain; a defendant equally as likable; and a heinous crime at the center of the plot. The immortal Charles Laughton seems born to play Sir Wilfrid, a cantankerous but lovable barrister regarded as one of the best defense attorneys in London. His doctor and nurse try to dissuade him from taking anymore clients, but when he receives an intriguing case, he can't resist. He loves trials as much as cigars and brandy. Part of the fun concerns his nurse constantly trying to keep his cigars and him far apart.",

114,14 June 2017,thejcowboy22,8, The Standard!,"The perfect movie for insomniacs like myself who caught this epic courtroom drama on TCM commercial free with no interruptions.Our story begins with a renown British Barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts played by Charles Laughton. Sir Roberts, stout yet refined complete with monocle recovering from a recent heart ailment is cared for by his personal nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster) who was in reality Laughton's real Wife. The arguments and condescending quips being thrown by Sir Roberts at the overbearing nurse was probably as close to the real home life of the Laughton's as you can get. Enter the distressed, accused, and care-warned Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power). Miss Plimsoll strongly objects to her personal patient taking on any cases after Sir Robert's ailment. Sir Roberts hears out Voles statement as the accused claims his innocents to the murder of Mrs. Emily French a rich older woman who was fond with Vole, infatuated as to go so far as to make him the beneficiary to her will. I Personally enjoyed the credible performance here by Power as I the viewer, was convinced of his innocence done so naturally and humbly, Unparalleled acting. Sir Roberts takes the case under the consternation of his dictatorial nurse yet smooth as silk in his retorts to his nurse were just as caustic which gave the film comic relief throughout the entire film entwined in this unique murder trial. Vole claims to Sir Roberts that his Wife would testify on his behalf. Enter the cold, self assured Mrs. Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich) who tells Roberts and his colleagues a different story which quashes any alibi's for Vole. Vole is arrested swiftly and detained. The flashback scenes in Post-War Germany when Leonard talks about how a ceiling fell on him during his first meeting with Christine at a makeshift nightclub packed with eager G.I.'s who attacked her, ripped her pants. Dietrich showcases her talents with song and accordion. The trial begins with a cavalcade of familiar British heavy's known for television work in the 60's. Familiars like John Williams as Brogan Moore, (Robert's right hand in legal matters), who temporarily replaced Sebastian Cabot as the butler on the sit-com Family Affair. William exposure on American television was wide spread with a popular commercial for decades about classical masterpieces. Henry Daniell as Mayhew known to TV viewers as a frequent player in Boris Karloff's Thriller. Other familiars actors not born on the British Isles despite the queens tongue are Ian Wolfe as Carter known for his roles in Star Trek. The ever present Torin Thatcher as the Prosecutor Myers who was frequent guest on Science fiction related shows. Lost in Space,Time Tunnel, Voyage to the Bottom of The Sea and Star Trek. FYI last film for Tyrone Power who died a year later of a massive heart attack and last film for veteran actress Una O'Conner. Fabulous ending with tremendous shock value which felt like a Hitchcock film but Billy Wilder always gets lost in this masterpiece. His best directorial to date, but the book by Agatha Christy had more impact than the film but doesn't Hollywood always water-down screen plays to suit actors and budget.

He directed Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich to arguably the best performances of their careers, and handily led the great acting duo of Charles Laughton and Elsa Lancaster to equally remarkable performances, too. This movie is such an adept blend of mystery, wartime romance, courtroom drama and even some dark comedy that it's almost impossible to describe. You just have to see it!

Yes, it's a murder trial, and murder is dead serious, especially since the punishment in 1952 still was death by hanging, but there are too many flaws in this case to make it credible at all. For example, if Tyrone Power didn't kill her, who did? No other candidate is ever presented, except a fabricated hypothesis of a possible thief, who anyway didn't rob anything, while the broken window clearly wasn't smashed from the outside for a break-in.

127,15 April 2020,krational66,9, The process is more shocking than the result.,"The most important reason why a classic becomes a classic is its tenacious vitality. The 1957 legal drama, set against the backdrop of countless other films and TV shows with similar stories, never lost its luster, but became even more striking. As I watched the film, I thought, how could such a story, which has been repeated many times in the past, be presented so wonderfully? After watching this movie last night, I am still in a state of shock, and it is difficult to answer this question, so I can only slowly digest it when I review it in the future.
But in van gogh's high-quality films, the characterization of the characters is by no means inferior to the telling of the story. Sir The film from the beginning to the old man and the prestige by his side out of the people's behavior performance, and the old Sir's health also be buried under the early lead, it not only deepened the weight of the case, also affects the heart become a moment in the story behind the disturbing factors, at the same time had planted the interesting role, ""the nurse"" is in the court of the watch the intense debate at the same time, a relaxation opportunity to experience a little warmth.
Since the film is adapted from a stage play, the scene changes relatively little, especially when Leonard tells the lawyers the story, which is actually relatively dry. And storytellers very tactfully using the ""cigars"" and ""drawer"" and ""lens"" these three props, coupled with the actors wonderful performance, neither affect the viewer to understand the occurrence of the incident, and added a lot of interest for the paragraphs, and laid a good groundwork for the following story, let you believe the plot will be more wonderful.
Yes, even the three men's storytellers are rendered so amusing that the court statement that follows is simply too good to describe. As you can see, the old Sir's attitude toward different witness testimony has a considerable difference, he kept ""against"" and strong police testimony to the detriment of the defense is greatly reduced, and fundamentally shaken the trust of the jury testimony to the housekeeper, although there have been some mistake, but the power of those problems and persuasive, is forced to gasp in admiration of the senior barristers in experience and ability.
The ""prosecution witness"" that followed caught the old knight off guard, but went some way to explaining some of the questions that the show had previously left in the minds of the audience. Just when people thought the story would end there, something even better began to happen...
It is truly a stage play written by the queen of detective fiction. I have only seen Agatha Christie's ""detective polo"" films before, but I did not expect that such a court play can also be written as a detective novel. No wonder al pacino has expressed his interest in the remake more than once. The question is, would it be as good without Billy Wilder?
To all those involved in the creation of this film.",

Courtroom dramas aren't my thing. In fact, I hate legal and police procedurals with a passion! And yet, every minute of this wonderful movie is spellbinding and riveting. Without resorting to any lurid or gory scenes, the director Wilder, transports you right into the middle of the drama. Sans the gimmicks, he deftly lets your own brain create a wonderful and claustrophobic world that becomes harder and harder to get out of. This is one of those movies with so many ups & downs that you feel as disoriented as if you've just stepped out of a giant Ferris Wheel after taking many rounds. It wrings you out completely. And that's precisely what a good suspense movie does! A special shoutout for Dietrich whose role was amazing and so was her portrayal of it. Bravo!",

This job is not made easy for him when he meets the accused's cold wife, played with ice intensity Marlene Dietrich, who, for some reason, seems to be working against her husband. Who is really telling the truth? Anybody who knows Agatha Christie will know that nothing is ever how it seems. Just when you think you've found a red herring, you find out that you were right alongÂ… to then find out that everything was a bluff. Or something. So the plot twists, even for those who are familiar with Christie, will always surprise. And nobody is better chosen to adapt her play than Billy Wilder, one of Hollywood's best capable, adaptable directors. He classily uses the courtroom backdrop with deft ingÃ©nue, creating a film with courtroom drama elements, as well as petty comedy and sizzling suspense, all brought together by the excellent performances.",

As soon as the barrister smells something fishy, it is clear what game wife was playing, however, it still comes with an extra surprise about the murderer's girlfriend. But on closer inspection the movie is unrealistically manipulative, as even actors were manipulated and hence the murderer plays it in an unconvincing - or rather false - way given the twist ending. The barrister encourages murder, the murder is also not convincing, people do not just drop dead like that. But that can be forgiven, misleading acting - obtained by holding actor in the dark, falls however a bit short of masterpieces like Usual suspects and is more like the Sixth sense. But given the old age of the piece, it is still a compelling work, a few details short of perfection. Also, the whole young lover embrace ending is contrived and illogical if you think about it, given what had happened one might expect the murderer to be more cautious.",

Based on the Agatha Christie play, this sees unemployed egg-beater inventor Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) arrested for the suspected murder of rich widow Emily Jane French (Norma Varden). Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Charles Laughton), recently recovering from a near-fatal heart attack, agrees to defend Leonard, but the only alibi available seems to be from his wife, the calculating Christine (Golden Globe nominated Marlene Dietrich). As the witnesses answer the questions and give the evidence, including housemaid Miss Plimsoll (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's wife, and whose character was put in by Wilder and the co-writers), there is no clear verdict. That is until the prosecution calls Christine, and all the words that come out of her mouth spell disaster for Sir Wilfred and Leonard. But before the case is concluded, a mysterious woman gives Sir Wilfred some letters that prove Christine was seeing someone else and refusing an alibi. So in the end, you'd expect the end to be Leonard found innocent, but he wasn't, and Christine knew this, but Leonard admits wanting to leave her, and she kills him, and it ends with Sir Wilfred agreeing to defend her in trial. Also starring John Williams as Brogan-Moore, Henry Daniell as Mayhew, Ian Wolfe as Carter, Torin Thatcher as Mr. Myers, Una O'Connor as Janet McKenzie, Francis Compton as Judge, Philip Tonge as Inspector Hearne and Ruta Lee as Diana. Almost all courtroom films are going to engage you, with all the evidence and choice of witnesses popping up, your going to enjoy guessing the conclusion, and this certainly delivers with a great cast. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Co-stars Ty Power and Marlene Dietrich are their usual pro selves and the supporting cast which has the feel of being hand-picked - Ian Wolfe, Henry Daniell, John Williams plus Mrs Laughton, Elsa Lanchester are all right on the money. Though he barely 'opens up' the play on which it is based Wilder has no problem retaining interest even in black and white and with his usual no-nonsense camera angles - he clearly saw no point in tracking Tyrone Power down the street and back up again, content to leave no-brainers like that to the Godards of this world. I've never been much of a Dietrich fan, she's always seemed a tad mannered to me but if I have one cavil it is that Power would dump someone as substantial as Dietrich for the totally vapid 'other woman' with whom he went off at the end.

The first two are a problem for Mr. Laughton, who is recovering from a serious heart attack. Moreover, he has also been advised to stay away from his specialty â€“ stressful criminal cases. Trying to keep Laughton away from his vices is talkative live-in nurse Elsa Lanchester (as Miss Plimsoll). She is no match for Laughton as an intriguing case arrives. The client is all-American nice-guy Tyrone Power (as Leonard Vole), who was seen at the home of wealthy widow Norma Varden (as Emily French) on the day she was murdered. An aspiring inventor, Mr. Power looks even guiltier when he inherits a generous sum from the lonely older woman. Power's alibi is expected to be his wife, German actress Marlene Dietrich (as Christine Helm Vole). However, Laughton expects Ms. Dietrich's supportive testimony will be dismissed because she is the accused's wife...",

Not in the way that it's a completely surprising twist (which it was even though it was hidden in plain sight), but in the way that how politically progressive the twist was. By feeding the social stigma up till then, never losing focus on how exactly it is portrayed and suddenly exposing the truth of it and letting the viewers know why a lot of it is actually portrayed the way it is in the film.

With Agatha Christie as writer, Billy Wilder as director and Charles Laughton playing a lawyer, it seems that nothing can go wrong. Nevertheless as a court room drama the film doesn't live up to his stature. In my opinion the film falls considerably short of the great court room drama of 1957: ""12 angry men"" (Sidney Lumet).",

Although, the film's twist ending, which I won't spoil here, was really good. I certainly didn't expect it.

The film itself is very good but its not one of the greatest films of all time,"I watched this the day after seeing the show in London County Hall. I didn't know the story before seeing the play so I enjoyed it thoroughly, the twist and turns and the final reveal are brilliant. I'm not a huge Christie fan but my mom watches a lot so I know a fair bit and this was her most impressive and enjoyable work for me. I have to say though that while the film is very good and very enjoyable, I do think it is one of those films which is overrated, and I mean that literally. It is not an 8.4 on IMDB and 100% on rottentomatoes. Its probably a 7.9 and a 90%. Some older movies get crazy high rankings like this by critics especially purely because they are old. Its like how people become legends and more famous once they die because it is easier to rever someone who is no longer around to receive the reverence. There were many elements which I thought low-key professional actors did better on the stage than was done in this version. Particularly Tyrone Power as Leonnard I thought was particularly poor and you were suspicious of him from the start in this film version, he doesn't come across as anywhere near as innocent and likeable enough initially, whereas the guy who played him in the show did. The romance between Power and Dietrich was cliche and very Hollywoodified. They have a meet cute in a bar and then have a bent over kiss within 3 minutes. Charles Laughton is brilliant though and the film is very well made, but the play is definitely better. It is definitely the best film version out there, the other two (1982 and 2016) don't compare. But we could do with this being remade properly for a modern audience and without the dated bits. And the ratings being a more accurate reflection.",

Based upon an Agatha Christie short story and play, it was suggested to Wilder by Marlena Deitrich and he developed it with great skill, beefing up the role to be taken (over!) by Charles Laughton and introducing the notion of his recent heart attack and need for accompanying nurse, providing a fine role for Elsa Lanchester. Laughton is fantastic and clearly prevented from going over the top by the director, Tyrone Power is perfectly adequate in this his final film and Dietrich looks very good and tries very hard but is one of those actors who just does it and you either like it or don't. Didn't get the feeling Wilder has much say over her interpretation but it still works. it works because the director has such a grip on the whole and as he himself has said the Christie construction is so sound. Very entertaining with amusing asides and many a wondrous twist to a seemingly simple tale.",

Apart from the intriguing storyline, the highlight of the movie must be Charles Laughton and his wonderfully witty wife, Elsa Lancaster.  Their dialogue just bounces off one another so effortlessly.

Witness For the Prosecution is as complicated and multi-layered as mystery movies ever come: a man (Tyrone Powers) has been wrongly charged of murdering an old lady and is seeking legal advice from a famous attorney (Charles Laughton) who happens to recently come back home after having a heart attack. He's not supposed to take on any stress that may jeopardize his health but as stubborn as they come, this old man won't give up his cigars, take on this murder case while fighting with his nurse that insists he shouldn't be doing any of it.

Co-stars Ty Power and Marlene Dietrich are their usual pro selves and the supporting cast which has the feel of being hand-picked - Ian Wolfe, Henry Daniell, John Williams plus Mrs Laughton, Elsa Lanchester are all right on the money. Though he barely 'opens up' the play on which it is based Wilder has no problem retaining interest even in black and white and with his usual no-nonsense camera angles - he clearly saw no point in tracking Tyrone Power down the street and back up again, content to leave no-brainers like that to the Godards of this world. I've never been much of a Dietrich fan, she's always seemed a tad mannered to me but if I have one cavil it is that Power would dump someone as substantial as Dietrich for the totally vapid 'other woman' with whom he went off at the end.",

Unlike many films which maintain the mystery by deceptive filming or editing, in this one you know just what the central character (Laughton) knows at all times, and you unravel the facts along with him. You are never quite sure how much you don't know, right to the end. Laughton and Lanchester are delightfully amusing without detracting in the least from the main story line. Tyrone Power is convincing and Marlene Dietrich is at her peak - not only as a fascinating woman but a startlingly effective actress. It's hard to say any one role of Charles Laughton's is his best - he gave himself so much competition - but this is probably the one you will want to watch again and again.",

Marlene Dietrich probably gives the best performance of her career, other than Blue Angel, her major debut film that was a sensation at the time of its release.

I don't know if such a category exists or is recognized, however I would consider a court-hearing thriller a movie whose main scenes and events take place in hearings before a criminal court. In this meaning, I would not consider ""The verdict"" but probably would consider ""12 angry men"". But, as usual with Billy Wilder, this movie is a lot more. A monumental (in any sense of the word) Charles Laughton. A surprising Marlene Dietrich, who also plays a sort of ironic parody of her past in Germany and her past role as the Blue Angel. A convincing Tyrone Power, whose role will leave you with big surprises. Super-witty dialogs and tons of bitter irony over the rituals of justice, that cannot do much to help the truth come to surface. Another big hit to the bull's eye for one of the best directors of all times. 9/10 just because I never rate 10 a movie I have only seen once.

I was expecting a good old-fashioned serious court drama but instead I got all the information handed on a plate and the serious part was very unfortunately and unsuccessfully combined with unintelligent and highly annoying and unappropriate humor that made the movie feel less credible and almost cheap. For this I blame everything on Elsa Lanchester who perhaps played one of the least suitable and useless not to mention most blatant and annoying characters I ever saw in a movie of such caliber. Her stupid facial expressions and lines during the trial should have been completely edited out and burned but she got nominated for an Oscar instead. Charles Laughton was the only truly bright star of this movie as he was  the only one who wasn't all that transparent and provided the best moments and laughs throughout the movie. His performance was really good, but somewhat short of being David Niven good. As for our main femme fatale, mrs. Dietrich's performance was the key to figuring out the plot before the foundations were even laid.

192,28 July 2005,silverscreen888,8, Very Fine Pace; One of Wilder's Best Works; Intriguing and Different,"Aa a writer, I am neither a fan of Billy Wilder nor of Agatha Christie. But I must agree with the majority of viewers who in the case of ""Witness For the prosecution"" found the central character played by Charles Laughton to be a valuable and ethical hero for the proceedings, and I must further second their positive reactions to the logic, fun and intriguing twists introduced into the trial depicted and into Laughton's attempts to figure out who actually did the crime. On the surface, the film appears to have the advantage of an unusually skilled cast and a director who worked on the screenplay himself from Larry Marcus's adaptation of a Christie shorter work, with Harry Kurnitz. The cinematographer was the skilled Russell Harlan, art director Alexander Trauner and set decorator Howard Bristol. Costumes were provided by Edith Head with the music being composed by Matty Melneck. But the showpiece here is Wilder's fluid directing of a complex story-line. When Sir Wilfrid Robarts, cautioned by his doctors not to take on anything strenuous ignores those orders, obviously an interesting case, and one promising legal 'fireworks' may be in order. The barrister's client, Leonard Vole, is being accused of murder and swears he did not do the crime. Elsa Lanchester is Sir Wilfrid' nurse, cautioning him and insisting on medical regularities that interfere with his pursuit of the truth and of an acquittal for his client, played curiously flat and somewhat as an habitual repressing liar by Tyrone Power. Also in the cast are such fine performers as Henry Daniell, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, Norma Varden, Una O'Connor, Francis Compton, Philip Tonge, Ruta Lee, Franklyn Farnum. and J. Pat O'Malley, among others. The plot revolves about the testimony of Vole's German wife, played with bite and intelligence by Marlene Dietrich, then fifty, the eponymous witness. Fireworks in court are nothing when set beside the issue of Laughton's health and the plot-twists that come fast and furious near the ending. This is a superior film which makes a dramatic work out of a mystery short story adventure; this focus change turns the attention of the viewer from the solution of a baffling murder to the confrontations among those involved in the case--opposing barristers, witnesses, authorities, Laughton, Dietrich, Power and everyone concerned. This is not a great film,m but it always an intelligently written, swift-paced and entertaining piece of Hitchcock-style film-making. The B/W format is a distinct asset here, as is the very-fine acting in general. Certainly one of Wilder's best directorial achievements.",

Under the masterful direction of Wilder, the film does not feel the least bit stagy. In his final film before his untimely death, Power is OK if somewhat bland as the accused murderer. Dietrich has one of her best roles as his wife, a woman of mystery. However, the film belongs to Laughton. With his cynical delivery, wry smile, and sparkling eyes, the great actor has a field day as the cagey lawyer hired to defend Power.

Even if you already know how it all ends, there are still joys to be had from the star-studded cast and the master filmmaker's craftsmanship. Along with fellow screenwriters Larry Marcus and Harry Kurnitz, Wilder has imbued Christie's absorbing story with enough of his trademark humor to make the compelling film a genuine entertainment in the old Hollywood tradition. The plot centers on master barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who decides to take as a client Leonard Vole, an unemployed kitchen-gadget inventor who is charged with murder. Robarts is in ill health and must tolerate the constant pestering of Miss Plimsoll, a nurse assigned to make sure Robarts slows down and takes his medications. Through a trick he does with his monocle, Robarts believes Vole to be innocent of the charge of killing wealthy, lonely matron Mrs. French.

The need to produce drama is the worst spoiler of all, because the best writers can't seem to come up with believable incidents of the type that would happen in real life. Real life is full of coincidences and unbelievable situations, that seem perfectly acceptable when they happen, but these things cannot be put into a work of fiction without seeming forced. There, I got that off my chest.",

""Witness for the Prosecution"", however is another matter as it is an excellent film.  There isn't a dull moment in this story.  All of the actors and actresses are perfectly cast, especially Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton.  Even Tyrone Power is cast in a role unusual for him--instead of being just a pretty boy he is a distinguished defendant.  There is a lot of comedy within this film as well as suspense and a lot of plot twists to keep you guessing who killed Mrs. French.

Marlena Dietrich was so convincing as Christine. Even the other barristers and Sir Wilfred's manservant is perfectly suited to this film.

There are some amazing twists here which I won't give away. However, I will say that even though credit must be given to Cristie for her dynamic book, Wilder deserves just as much credit for being able to adapt this fluidly into a tense thriller that leaves you breathlessly wanting to know what will happen next.

229,22 September 2008,ctomvelu-1,8, A true classic,"Even with an ailing and miscast Tyrone Power as the defendant in a sensational murder case, WITNESS is a gem of a courtroom drama. Charles Laughton plays a famous defense attorney who takes on a case where it seems so obvious the defendant is the killer that one wonders why the barrister takes the case. The answer becomes obvious: it is a challenge for the aging and heart-damaged lawyer, who otherwise would be headed for Bermuda in the company of his perpetually nagging nurse (real-life wife Elsa Lanchester). Some of the best scenes in this classic Billy Wilder flick are of Laughton flailing about at home and in his office. The courtroom scenes seem a bit stilted by comparison, although things always brighten up whenever the camera switches to Laughton playing with his heart pills or reacting to some bit of testimony. Marlene Dietrich plays Power's two-timing wife. This was Power's last movie, by the way. He died a short time later while filming SOLOMON AND SHEBA. The ending is a shocker, although a bit contrived. It could stand a remake. Anthony Hopkins or Tom What's-his-name would be ideal in the Laughton role.",

The movie stars Tyrone Power in his last screen performance as Leonard Vole a man under suspicion for murdering an elderly woman and ends up employing an old British lawyer (played by Charles Laughton) as his attorney, the movie is kind of similar to The Fugitive but they both have the same plot but no courtroom scene in the fugitive. The reason why director Billy Wilder tries to keep us in suspense is because he tries to make us wonder if Tyrone Power murdered the elderly woman or not. But the other good performance is from Marlene Dietrich as Vole's ex-wife but (spoiler alert) kills him in the end.",

We also have two Americans abroad, Lenny and his travel store harlot and nobody bats an eye? Oh well. Worth the watch on a Saturday afternoon.

Murder on the Orient Express, a story of my favorite Christie detective, Hercule Poirot, had an unsatisfactory star performance (Albert Finney), and a great supporting cast (Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, John Gielgud, etc.) went to waste. But Witness for the Prosecution triumphantly carries Christie's wit and suspense to the screen. Billy Wilder directs with style and flair, showing once again that he can master both comedy and drama. The screenplay, by Wilder and Harry Kurnitz, contains expertly balanced suspense and dry humor. The performances are a joy, notably Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Elsa Lanchester.

Strong performances by Charles Laughton, the barrister staunchly defending the innocent and charming Tyrone Power, so frequently the hero in his films, contrast with Marlene Dietrich's despicable role as his cold-hearted and faithless spouse. Her disdain for love and fidelity, her absolute selfishness, reveal her as a liar and bigamist determined to undermine her helpless husband. Supporting cast members are all spot-on, especially Elsa Lanchester, the competent yet frequently subverted nurse, who actually knows the contents of her employer's thermos of cocoa and equally understands his resolve in defense of the innocent.

In the hands of the legendary director Billy Wilder, this is not only a sensational mystery tale, but it boasts great performances from a stellar cast and a brilliant screenplay by Wilder with Harry Kurnitz and Larry Marcus that opens up the play just enough to make it work as a brilliant film, and adds some touches of comedy that highlight the drama superbly.",

Even today, they are also highly praised works. The ending is reversed twice, which is hard to guess. The ""don't spoiler"" hint at the end of the film is really cute.",

276,6 October 2020,lukecon-63436,8," Not Wilder's best, but certainly a gripping courtroom drama","While my favorite Wilder film is Sunset Boulevard, Witness for the Prosecution is certainly another good entry of his. The story is gripping, mainly because it explains the conflict and situation effectively without doing so in a confusing way. Therefore, the film is very simple to understand, yet complex in its twists. However, Wilder still is able to explain the conflict, gripping the audience as a result.
The twist ending was certainly brilliantly done by Wilder, and is effective in completely changing the audience's perceptions of the situation and creating a completely different perspective for the audience. Wilder uses this concept effectively, and this adds to the brilliance of Witness for the Prosecution.
This is certainly one of the best courtroom dramas I have seen.",

Also, I never watched any movie with Dietrich. She really looked intriguing in her performance. And she really had beautiful legs!!!
Great performance for her, Tyrone Power and Charles Laughton.
Some may say that at some points there were some overacting from Dietrich and Power.
As usual on Agatha Christie's stories, surprises and tension at the end.
That's what make the difference between the current movies and the classics.",
279,16 February 2004,Cracklinrosie,9, TURNS & TWISTS!,This is a wonderful film with lots of plot twists and turns! The acting is superb and it keeps you watching throughout. It is always a favourite when shown on UK TV. I can recommend it.  Charles Laughton is perfect as the Barrister for the defence! His real wife Elsa Lanchaster played his nurse. Very good!,
280,12 February 2007,ctrout,10, Wow!,"I saw this movie a few years ago and it still resonates in my memory from time to time. That first viewing really affected me as a person because I realized what other people can do to me in the way of deceit and surprise. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that this ranks up there as one of the greatest endings of all time. It still packs a wallop fifty years later.",
281,23 August 2015,jacabiya,10, Some comments,"This is a delightful film with a wonderful performance from some say the best English actor in the 20th century, Charles Laughton, and an excellent supporting cast, mostly British. It is curious to me how Billy Wilder, one of my favorite directors, a German who developed his career in Hollywood, ended up with this project â€“ an Agatha Christie play - more suitable it seems to a British director. Some people even think Hitchcock directed this film. While I very much enjoyed this film, I have some reservations: the denouement is difficult to assimilate â€“ one initially believes Vole and his wife are simply playing another trick when he openly kisses his girlfriend in front of his wife and lawyer, and it is not until his wife reacts that we come to believe his actions, and her reaction thereafter, are real, moreover when we have been convinced that his wife does not love him, and her final act somehow fails to dispel this notion and move us to believe she was deeply in love with her husband. This is so because Tyrone Power fails to convey the type of man a woman would fall in love with, and Marlene fails to convey the type of devoted woman we finally find she is, and this because we are supposed to understand she is much older than him, when Dietrich actually looks much younger and beautiful (thanks to the use of her ""tape lifts"", and some pair of legs) even at 56, and Power looks much older. Another story it would have been if they had used William Holden in his role. I also had a problem with the notion that an overweight attorney with a 240/110 blood pressure and a weak heart, constantly fainting or wincing in pain, would be allowed to litigate in court,and to see him run to the train station in his condition was difficult to believe. Moreover when trial ends his nurse announces he would not go on vacation but continue with another criminal case, which is simply absurd. These I guess are things a less demanding audience in the 50s in that simpler Hollywood age would not have minded. Another grievance is that Dietrich's voice when playing the cockney girl is clearly dubbed, maybe by herself in the studio, but nevertheless it somehow feels like a cheat. Some people even believe some other actress played the part, but so much mystery surrounded this film due to its surprise ending and the need to keep everything secret that we will never know, and this some say cost Dietrich at least a nomination for the Oscar. Finally while I don't agree this film should be in position #76 based on only 50K plus votes (Throne of Blood is in the list with only 26K votes), I understand the problem of raising the 25K minimum votes to let's say 100K, which would drop many deserving classics like The General, City Lights and the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. I do not believe this film is in the same league as these other films, but that is only my opinion, and at the same time it is much better than many other films in the list.",
282,11 October 2014,k-thomas,10, Laughton's finest performance.,"Up until i saw this film for the first time yesterday evening on DVD, i always considered Charles Laughtons best performance was as Grachius in Spartacus, but this was overwhelming. As i have stated in my reviews of other old films, they do not make them like this any more. The humor coming out in Laughtons lines was hysterical, considering the serious storyline. There were fine performances from all the actors. Tyrone Power proved he was not just a swashbuckler, but a fine actor. Marlene Dietrich played the part of Powers wife brilliantly. You might notice a connection with Mutiny on the Bounty. Charles Laughton Played Captain Bligh in the original version and Torin Thatcher, the Prosecution Barrister, played the Captain of the HMS Brittainy in the Marlon Brando remake, but his scene was deleted. A must for anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas.",

285,1 September 2021,peter-beaves,6, Great plot but some odd acting,"A typical Agatha Christie twisty plot with much to enjoy. Some puzzles aside from the deliberate ones though. How did the character Leonard Vole, who met the Marlene Dietrich character in Germany while serving in the British army, acquire an American accent (he was played by Tyrone Power) for example? Marlene Dietrich at one point played a cockney woman so atrociously that she would have fooled no one, and appeared to be channelling a witch from Macbeth. No wonder she didn't get the Oscar nomination she expected! Also Tyrone Power's shocking overacting can only partially be excused as we find out his character is lying a lot of the time. That Charles Laughton's barrister was supposedly convinced of Vole's innocence by this overacting actually made me laugh.",

287,23 August 2005,dvanlienden,10, Witness for the Prosecution,"wow absolutely great, I have the billy wilder collection and this was the first movie I watched, because I'm a fan of Dietrich and I must say she'really steals the show, her performance as an criminal wives, who lies for him, especially when she's in disguise to tell a lie about her self, when I saw her I thought, that's Dietrich, but I thought no It couldn't be and yes she was it really a great performance, maybe her best, it was said that I already knew the end because it was in one of Dietrich's biographies but still you think what would happen, really a great performance, but not only Dietrich also Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchster are great and funny as well, this is one of the best movies in the Billy Wilder collection.",

289,8 September 2007,alicat821,10, Marlene Dietrich' vs Madeline Khan,"After watching this movie for the first time, the only thing that jumped out at me was that of Mel Brook's movie Blazing Saddles. The impersonation of Madeline's Kahns role of Lilly Von Schtoop had Miss D. down to perfection. She had everything down from the body language to the famous lisp. I am convinced that Miss Kahn studied her from this movie and Blue Angel-------just brilliant---I'm Tired-----Tired of being admired. The other comment was the double role done. I really was confused by the lady with the letters but had no idea it was Miss D. Mr. Laughton seems to enjoy working with his wife had it showed. I did recognize Ruta Lee and thought she would have a bigger part in this plot and I was right at the end. I thought Mr . Power had over-acted--- but fooled me in the end.------ Kudo's Billy Wilder",
290,26 November 2006,johnnykay07,10, An all time classic,"Although it has been a long time since I have seen this movie, it remains in my mind as one of the best I have ever seen. The interaction of the characters without the benefit, or should I say, distraction of special & sound effects, is remarkable. Charles Laughton & Marlene Dietrich do full justice to their characters and it is difficult to determine who is the star and who is providing support. The story line does what a truly great suspense mystery should do. It builds the story through a series of escalating points and keeps the viewers in absolute suspense until the climax which, when it comes, provides a complete and proper conclusion to the plot.",

Also a treat were Francis Compton as the judge and Una O'Connor as the elderly lady testifying against Power.",
295,4 August 2007,christian_gil88,10, A 'whodunnit?' par excellence - with lots of twists,"One of my all time favourite movies. A 'classic' in more ways than one. All the performances - especially Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich - are convincing and well shaped. Billy Wilder directs with his usual wit and acuity. Definitely the best of Agatha Christie's film adaptations. A man accused of murder is defended by a brilliant but ill barrister (played by Charles Laughton) - he's just recovered from a heart attack. His nurse (Elsa Lanchester - Laughton's real life wife) tries to prevent him from taking on the case, but to no avail. The accused (Tyrone Power, in his last film) seems friendly, sincere and caught in a web not of his doing. But all is not as it seems. The twists and turns in this film keep you guessing and the biggest twist is right at the end. I think this is one of Dietrich's best parts. Her role as the defendant's wife is central to the plot - just how, you will have to see for yourself, assuming you haven't already seen it. A 'must' for any filmlovers' library.",
296,25 June 2016,gudpaljoey-78582,8, Murder as Entertainment,"Wonderful performances all around. Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich at their best. Elsa Lancaster's comic brilliance. Tyrone Power showing his acting pedigree. The film is one of many examples of movies, novels, and plays where murder is presented not as it is, but as a mechanism for a narrative and plot. Be that as it may, I never read Ms. Christie's story or play, but I understand that the movie included her final ending. Therein, I think lies the fault. The final scene is there to establish justice, murderers must pay say the censorial public and codists. How much better would the film be if the killer walks, and his devoted wife loses him to the younger woman. End of story.",

But then somebody called up and asked have you watched this time. You have to. And I said, fine! Will look at it. and I am thankful to that person that he asked me to watch this one. There is no single performance which cannot be termed brilliant in this movie. The movie plot keeps u edgy, the simplicity with which the dialogue delivery is done is remarkable. And despite the brilliance of all the actors, Charles Laughton's performance stand apart. If he would have been a real life lawyer, he would not miss a single case. He is absolutely stunning in his performance. ",
300,29 March 2002,trueblueforyou1964,10, Masterpiece of suspense with Wilder's usual biting wit,"This review is being written the day after Mr. Wilder left this world to go direct at a higher level.  Of the few tributes of his life that I have heard so far, none have mentioned this masterpiece which ranks in my top 10 movies of all time.  Charles Laughton as the cantankerous yet crafty courtroom attorney.  Marlene Dietrich as the femme fatale.  At times you pity her and at others you hate her - I won't give away the sequence because that would ruin one of the MANY surprises to this twister.  Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's real-life wife, is uniquely qualified for her role as the only one who can stand up to him as his nurse and their reparte is a welcome whimsical distraction from the tension in this remarkable piece of work. Tyrone Power puts in one of his best performances.",
301,19 March 2020,Quannianjiexia,10," I guess right about the ending, but wrong about the humanity","The prosecution witness is indeed the most exciting part of the suspense inference movie. The storyline is different from the general suspense inference process using multiple reversals in the middle to achieve the effect. On the contrary, this film directly takes the audience from an interlocking plot development direction. After going all the way to earn enough interest from the audience, I finally overturned this line directly. The initial premise is really wonderful. Especially the middle and later paragraphs of the court trial are really textbook-like operations as a trial black and white film. Although it is not cool Advanced technology This kind of rigorous, humorous, humorous line script and the superb acting performance of the film emperors are simply the fierce confrontation between the prosecution and the witnesses of the art. The last thing mocked was English law",

I have seen some of the movies based on her books like Murder in the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, Ten little Indians and Evil Under the Sun. After watching these movies, as most of us feel that Original Books are better than adapted movies, I too felt the same. It will be unjust on my part to term these Adapted movies as Bad but they were no comparison to the High standards set by Agatha in her respective books. But this one is different. Each and every scene of this movie is so well scripted and directed that it was impossible for me to keep off my eyes from the screen even for a second.

315,9 September 2007,mystic9121,10," Response to ""flaw"" claimed in comment","One review above claims a flaw, in that Christine Helm (Dietrich) never actually committed perjury (true!!!! ) and therefore she should not have accepted her fate so readily, implying that her murder of Vole is manslaughter only and therefore defensible. Helm claims correctly that she had never testified that what she had written in the letters was the truth, merely that she had written them. Christie exploits this assumption by the jury brilliantly and credibly, and is a diabolically clever plot twist. But I don't see it as a flaw. I see it as a way for the audience to assume that Lanchester realizes this very wiggle room is her justification for suggesting Laughton defend Dietrich instead of going to Bermuda on vacation. I have seen this movie masterpiece many many times,and always forget exactly how the denouement is reached, and always enjoy analyzing how Christie brilliantly always remained one step ahead of the reader.",
