At the same time, 'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier.",/
1,7 December 2005,evanston_dad,7, Individual Parts Greater Than the Whole,"One of this movie's most famous images--Chaplin sliding around inside the gears and cogs of a monstrous machine--provides a handy visual to go along with my opinion of the film in general: there are individual cogs that I remember as being brilliant, but when put together they don't make a totally satisfying machine.",r

What would the little man make of the world today, as technology continues its drive to remove people from the workplace and replace them with more and more automation (who can blame them during pandemic times). A timeless classic that is perfectly geared, engaged and enmeshed for the unstoppable onslaught of technology and its perpetual modernisation - happiness beckons.",e

4,18 May 2016,Horror-yo,8, Excellent,"This very well written story never lets down from the very first image we see, flocking sheep compared with rushing urban human crowds, to the very ending. Excellent criticism of the Taylorism/capitalistic through humor relevant for any age, nationality or time; story-telling that would touch anyone alike in a universal fashion, every now and then sparkled with Chaplin's unique and deeply influential sense of humor and on-screen comedy. Hilarious in moments, and unique. A man of many talents clearly, and excellent at those. Overall this depicts quite a zany approach to life, one that is pure in essence and profoundly antagonistic with the current ways of the time, and ways of today still: a life dominated by one-track thinking, rigid and stubborn social etiquette, and the enslavement this new world has brought in so many aspects to the human species. Finally, it highlights the importance of never giving up; EVER; and the preciousness of love.",i

Indeed, the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable, but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong, time-transcending message about poverty stricken populations.",/

We like to think that with the advent of sound and the injection of modern technology in all aspects of film production has made just about everything better. Indeed, it's hard to argue that so much of today's fun and farce just can't exist without a sound mixer and a few boom mics laying around.

9,10 May 2004,razwee,10, The Farewell Performance of The Tramp,"Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film. Indeed, several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp (with his worn hat, distinctive mustache, dusty suit, cane, and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.",w
10,31 July 2015,lampic,10, A Classic,"This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous ""Modern times"" - we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much, much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga. Another example of things I just assumed I know. It charmed me instantly, of course, because Chaplin was a true genius and magician - his creation, ""Little Tramp"" is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly, for all his sweetness, clumsiness and old heart. This story apparently happens in Metropolis-like factory where work, machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we (audience) roar with laughter - I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny. Basically, everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed, until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again. What a genius!",4
11,10 September 2000,Chris-268,10, Hilarious comedy with a serious message,"""Modern Times"" is in my top 5 films, and #2 in my list of favorite comedies. Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being, nevermind film maker, that ever lived. I first saw this treasure about 8 years ago, and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny, and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film. ""Modern Times"" passed my test with flying colors. I laughed hysterically from start to finish. Each and every scene is innovative, well thought out, and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed. Among my favorite scenes are the ""automatic worker-feeding machine""; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food, thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store. No special effects or computer animation, just pure, simple, genius.",5
12,21 March 2009,ackstasis,9," ""Buck up - never say die. We'll get along""","By 1936, Charles Chaplin was already an anachronism  albeit, an anachronism who was also treasured as an artistic genius. The arrival of 'The Jazz Singer (1927)' did little to curb the director's enthusiasm for silent cinema, and, though he considered at length the commercial implications of converting to synchronised sound, his first film in the ""talkie"" age was almost completely silent (Chaplin compromised by composing a musical score). Nevertheless, the critical and commercial response to 'City Lights (1931)' was strong, reaffirming Chaplin's status as a cinematic master, and vindicating his decision to linger with an otherwise extinct medium. Thus, 'Modern Times (1936)' was to follow in the same mould, despite a synchronised soundtrack which includes a musical score, sound effects and several lines of spoken dialogue (always spoken through a mechanical ""barrier,"" such as a record-player, radio or loudspeaker). The film is historically significant in that it was Chaplin's first overtly political work, raising concerns inspired both by the economic hardship of the Great Depression, and Chaplin's growing interest in socialism.",5
13,7 October 2010,Steffi_P,9," ""Actions speak louder than words""","There is something fundamentally sad about Modern Times, by the very fact that it shows an unparalleled genius making his last move in the now-defunct art form with which he made his name. Charlie Chaplin, undisputed master of silent comedy, had managed to bluff his way through the awkward early days of sound, but by 1936 the talkie had got its act together, and screen comedy was dominated by the witty wordplay of the Marx brothers and the smart sass of screwball. Slapstick had all but lost its market, and the picture is saturated with a feel of ""One last time"" A",7

Genius is a much over-used word, but in Chaplin's case, it's use is apt.  This is one of the classics of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made!  The scenes in the factory are hilarious.

He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts. The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine. By late afternoon, he gets lost in the machinery. He can't stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital. He gets out but he doesn't have a job anymore. A red flag falls off the back of a truck. He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it. The police grabs him thinking that he's the leader. In prison, he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released. A Gamin (Paulette Goddard) is stealing food for the children. Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage.

16,5 February 2017,The-Sarkologist,9, A Masterpiece of Yesteryear,"I was actually about to completely write off this movie until I actually realised the genius that went into creating it. In a way Hollywood simply does not make movies like this any more, particularly where the creative genius of Charlie Chaplin is the writer, director, and star of the show. Sure, Chaplin is one of those actors that I have heard a lot about – he is one of the greats of the early years of Hollywood – but I never paid much attention to him believing that the only decent movies of the silent era came out of Germany (and to an extent Russia). However, a friend at work was talking about a film called The Dictator and a part of me decided that maybe it was time to actually sit down and see what Charlie Chaplin was all about. Well, I have to admit that I am glad that I did.",2
17,19 January 2000,Angeneer,9," A definition of ""classic""","Usually you watch old films trying to be generous with your criticism because of the huge difficulties the directors and actors faced those days. This one is a miracle. A comedy that stands tall even in today's cinema, starring perhaps the best comedian who lived on earth. At some parts it is hilarious, but the social message Chaplin wants to pass is always there, making Modern Times even more important. The love story is also very sweet and Paulette Goddard is a remarkably beautiful woman! So what to say about this man's genius? Charlie Chaplin acts, directs and even composes the music! And by all means he does a magnificent job. You can find great symbolism and a lot of political references, we all have to remember that Chaplin was accused of being a communist (which of course was a pride for intellectuals, given their accusers). I have unlimited respect for the Great Charlie Chaplin.",/

19,22 April 2016,quinimdb,8, Modern Times,"In the 1930s, technology was increasing faster than people could've imagined 30 years ago, and factories were simply becoming normal at this point. The world was moving faster than ever before, and I'm sure the workers at the factories couldn't help but feel like they were being used as just another cog in the machine. ""Productivity"" became more important than the workers well being and big company bosses - as well as the machines themselves - seemed to be controlling the workers. The machines seemed to be taking jobs from the actual human beings and this feeling is perfectly conveyed in Charlie Chaplin's great ""Modern Times"".",r

21,24 March 1999,SamLowry-2,10, The Inspiration of continuing greatness...,"Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" has influenced the 20th century as much as any other film could have. His portrayal of man vs. machine, individual vs. group, love vs. industry...is the framework of classic modern American ""anti-progressive"" thinking. Gilliam's ""Brazil"" is the late century equivalent. But Chaplin hit it right first, insuring generations would have the chance to relate to the challenges of their own modern times.",f
22,24 March 2006,planktonrules,9, amusing semi-socialist picture,"This is an interesting historical film. When it came out in 1936, the Depression was at its height and unemployment was rampant. Because of this, Socialism, Communism and unions were all on the rise. Considering how poor everyone was, these seemed like pretty attractive alternatives. This film was actually a radical political/social message wrapped up in comedy set in the very near future--if it had been presented as a drama, there's a good chance Hollywood would not have made the film. It's about the dehumanization of the worker and this movie as well as Chaplin's political leanings would later come back to haunt him during the Red Scare.",_
23,10 December 2006,Quinoa1984,10," maybe not as entirely, artistically fulfilling as City Lights, but it might just be funnier","Charlie Chaplin is a true master of at least a few things, and all within a specific world that he's created and fully culminates in City Lights and, even more notably in Modern Times: he has running gags all over the place (his 'Tramp' character getting involved in that is), including always being an unintentional klutz by way of too many people or too much to get acclimated to with the machines and other little things in the world, and somehow getting into trouble and being thrown into jail. But there's also a lyricism to it too, a sense of pure whimsy that while it has been aspired to by the likes of De Sica and even Benigni (the former has probably gotten the closest and topped Chaplin's style), has rarely been matched. Modern Times is a very fine example of Chaplin's world, and when I wasn't laughing myself silly, aside from a couple of notable moments with the Gamin, I had a big goofy smile on my face, which in the end is Chaplin's main message (his final words, unspoken of course, are 'come on, smile). No matter what happens, there's always a good heart somewhere in Chaplin's work, probably one of the purest too.",=
24,26 February 2018,digdigby,10, THE FEEDING MACHINE SCENE IS UNSURPASSED,"I saw this as a child and my laughter at the feeding machine scene was so WILD that I have never laughed so hard at anything again in my entire life. I literally slid out of my chair to the ground gasping for air. The whole film is absurd and brilliant, crisply realized by a comedy genius but for me that one moment transcends even greatness and touches the sublime where is poetry and God. Seeing the 'feeding machine' again as an adult there are tears mixed with laughter. To eat is to live, it is the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm is so arrogant and pompous that it frightens me a lot to see how far it has gone as 'they' regulate our speech, our food, our sex lives according to the latest PC doctrines of 'nice'. Chaplin would not have recognized this new world of ours where the working class he represents here is ruled by progressive billionaires spouting inanities.",t
25,27 January 2016,MrWalrus,10, Classic Chaplin,"Favorite Chaplin film. Packed with social commentary that is still relevant today. Chaplin does a superb job of representing the average worker of the time and the mental impact that the daily motions of what we consider normal in society. Such as the opening of the movie in which a scene of a morning rush of people going to work fades into a herd of sheep. Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present in this film while still keeping serious undertones. The best example of this is the eating machine. This particular scene was a perfect representation of the problems in our society (a machine meant to further regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process) while also causing a laugh out loud reaction. My favorite part of this film is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances. What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was the first time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stance against ""talkies"". Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are complete gibberish but the audience understands regardless. All in all I believe Modern Times is Chaplin's greatest film, this was the first Chaplin film I had ever seen and since then have watched all of them and found a great respect for Chaplin and silent movies overall.",t

30,9 February 2023,JamesHitchcock,9, Buck up - never say die. We'll get along,"Although ""Modern Times"" was made as late as 1936, nearly a decade after the coming of sound to the cinema, Charlie Chaplin decided to make it a ""silent"" as he had done with his previous film, ""City Lights"" from five years earlier. I place the word ""silent"" in inverted commas because both films make some use of sound; both, for example, have a recorded musical soundtrack. (Chaplin, a gifted musician as well as a comedian, composed this himself, as he did in a number of his films). ""Modern Times"" also has sound effects and a limited amount of spoken dialogue. Chaplin himself does not speak, but does sing a nonsense comic song.",
31,2 November 2018,gbill-74877,9, Brilliant end to an era,"The final scene in 'Modern Times' is stunning, and in many ways. There is a message of hope amidst the poverty of the Depression, with Chaplin's responding to Goddard feeling overwhelmed and defeated by saying ""Buck up - never say die. We'll get along!"" (and lip-reading after that, perhaps ""Smile, C'mon!""). We then see his signature move, walking off down the road, but this time he isn't alone, he has Goddard with him, which could be viewed as overcoming through love and togetherness, or perhaps Chaplin's real-life marriage to her. The most tingly interpretation for me, however, is as a symbol of end of the silent era. Chaplin retired his the character of the Tramp with this film, and while he uses sound in some very creative ways, it's mostly silent. Long after almost all other movies had become talkies, when I see this iconic character walking off down the road, I really feel like it's a final good-bye to an era, which gives me goosebumps.",

33,4 March 2004,1966nm,10, Always modern,"Somehow, this very old film is particularly modern today and the exaggerations are not really sooo extreme compared with the real world. The humans, enslaved by the machines and by those who control them, become more and more small and insignificant, like the hero of this very funny comedy (one of the best in the history) that speaks about very ugly things in a very amusing way. The Tramp, is not a tramp in the beginning. He has a real job in a modern factory, that almost kills him, as the factory becomes more and more modern. He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job. Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police, who are there to serve and protect the rich. An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this. Even a new job. But honesty is not really enough. Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesn't permit you to make a new start easily.",
34,6 April 2015,martino-sanzovo,9, Current times,"The mechanized and standardized world made of levers, bolts, department stores and lifts is too difficult, or probably too ordinary, for the ""honest and trustworthy"" Charlie Chaplin, who always ends up trapped in his times. But did this world really change a lot when nowadays we walk to the subway (or we drive in crowded streets) like cattle in order to reach our working place? In fact, what Charlie Chaplin and the beautiful Paulette Goddard (a close up of her face after The Little Tramp is arrested for the theft of a loaf of bread is magnificent) really wants from modern times is a small, decent house where to have dinner together, an apple to grab by stretching your arm outside the window and fresh milk from a cow. Charlie Chaplin doesn't need to speak on the screen (while talking pictures were already widely produced since late 20's) to deliver his brilliant view on 1936's world; and even when he does talk during the floor show towards the end of the movie, we don't need to understand what it is said to appreciate once more his talent and genius. There are two moments that stand out during the movie: the feeding machine that feeds The Little Tramp on the assembly line in the first part of Modern Times (note also some similarities later when the mechanic assistant feeds his boss). And the splendid final scene when before fading out, The Little Tramp invites The Gamin to smile while walking on an empty street at dawn; a scene that alone is worth a full movie, a smile that becomes the essence of the use of trying. This last moment is full of hope and full of humanity; things that we still struggle for in our modern times.",

Computers have become more popular than they were ten years ago. Gameboys and iPods are constantly used by young people the world over. Even ""mom and pop"" stores rely on machines. Who predicted that all this was going to happen? One person did in 1936 and his name was Charles Chaplin. The world's greatest director said all this in his best film Modern Times. Obviously predicting the future wasn't Chaplin's only intention. He also wanted to take his beloved Tramp character to bigger and more exciting settings. The gags are important for all of Chaplin's comedic pictures and Modern Times is no exception.

44,18 June 2007,SmileysWorld,8, Charlie Chaplin:A genius in modern times and all times.,"I must now shamefully admit that as a self proclaimed lover of movies,that this is in fact the first Charlie Chaplin film I have viewed from start to finish.I had always been aware of the genius of Chaplin,and had seen him in bits and pieces over the years,but had never viewed a piece of his work in it's entirety.Modern Times made a tremendous impression on me.Chaplin's knack for physical comedy was nothing short of impressive,and his talent did not stop there.In Modern Times,he not only displays that area of his genius,there is romance and a genuine tear jerking sweetness to his character,the Little Tramp that he no doubt displayed in the other films in which he portrayed the character,which I plan to view in the future.Another thing I admire about this film was that it was 1936.Sound had long been incorporated into films by then,yet Chaplin was still displaying his silent magic here,though it isn't completely silent.Chaplin placed sound where he felt it was needed,and even the way he did that was nothing short of genius.If there were a Mount Rushmore for comedians,Charlie Chaplin would indeed have a prominent place on it.",
45,4 July 2006,jem132,10, Charlie Vs The Industrial Revolution!,"'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last silent (not really a 'silent' as such-more on that later)containing the Little Tramp's last film outing.

46,8 December 2010,mjneu59,9, the end of an era,"Charlie Chaplin had resisted the influence of 'talkies' for over half a decade, but not even an artist of his enormous talents (and ego) could stall the march of progress indefinitely, and so the Little Tramp's swan song shows the strain of a compromise between the freedom of silence and the straitjacket of sound. The distinction may be subtle, but 'Modern Times' is not so much a silent film as it is a sound film without sound, and Chaplin's tramp is all too clearly an anachronism among the humming dynamos and labor unrest of the 1930s (he might have called the film 'Changing Times'). Enough echoes of the old days remain to qualify it as a classic (including the mad dance through the factory and another great roller skating routine), but after his earlier 'City Lights' his sense of humor would never again measure up to his social conscience, and the hope with which the Little Tramp faces the future at the end of the film is not nearly so clear as Chaplin's regret at leaving silent film behind.",

It also takes dead aim at the advance of a mechanized age, a modernizing society dependent on speed and efficiency at the expense of humanity. Fritz Lang's austere 1927 film ""Metropolis"" took a similar approach but with a much darker tone, daring to ask 'Who are the slaves of the machines""? For Chaplin, opposition to that slavery is on display in his comedic, almost manic depiction of factory life and the assembly line. One can't help but notice the influence Chaplin had on later film makers; I immediately drew a comparison to Lucille Ball's hilarious attempt to keep pace at the candy factory, blending elements of Chaplin's frantic pace on the assembly line with the dehumanizing aspect of the Bellows Feeding Machine.",

56,13 July 2020,dr_clarke_2,10, One of the finest film comedies ever made.,"If you only watch one Charlie Chaplin film, make sure it's Modern Times. Or The Gold Rush, or City Lights, or... Well, OK there are a few to choose from. But aside from a satirical subject matter that has retained its relevance over eighty years since the film was first made, Modern Times is a near perfect example of Chaplin's talents, not just as a performer but also as a director.
Modern Times opens with an intertitle that proclaims that the film is ""A story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness"", followed by a shot is of a herd of jostling sheep, which cuts to a shot of a herd of jostling workers emerging from the subway. What follows is a blistering satire of industrialised modern life that opens with Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"" character (credited as ""a factory worker"") working on an increasingly fast production line, which soon drives him to a nervous breakdown. Accidentally ending up in prison, he soon decides that he prefers it to working in a factory and spends much of his time attempting to get sent back there, as a result of which he meets a girl - the Gamin - with whom he becomes romantically involved. Once together, the Tramp and the Gamin conclude that they can only achieve their dream of domestic happiness by finding employment, but it never quite works out for them...
Chaplin was a something of a polymath: not only did he star in Modern Times, he also produced, directed, wrote it and composed the score. The film was made at a time when talkies had more or less consigned silent movies to history, but he made the movie mostly silent because he reportedly believed that the Little Tramp wouldn't work in a talkie (we actually hear his voice in this, his final film, but only when he memorable sings in a gibberish). It's a not a true silent film and Chaplin makes use of diagetic sound, often for comic effect. Whilst he's mostly remembered by the public at large as one of the great silent screen clowns, Chaplin's talents as a director were prodigious: Modern Times is a masterful demonstration of his mise-en-scéne, boasting some truly remarkable props and sets, many of them featuring moving parts which form a key part of the film's funniest moments. The feeding machine is a particularly good example, as are the conveyor belt and the huge assemblies of cogs and wheels in which he and others get ensnared; less immediately obvious but just as impressive is the shack that the Little Tramp and the Gamin move into, with parts rigged to break and collapse on cue.
Chaplin's almost peerless grasp of physical comedy is on display throughout and it remains a very funny masterpiece of perfectly choreographed slapstick. It's enhanced by the fact that Chaplin shot the film at 18 frames per second and then projected parts of it at 24 frames per second, making key scenes seem even more hectic and chaotic, and along with the film's sound (or lack of it) this demonstrates Chaplin bringing the techniques of silent movies into the talkie era for artistic effect. His musical score is the icing on the cake, perfectly suited as it is to each and every scene.
The rest of the cast, mostly regular Chaplin collaborators, contribute to the film's polish by playing their parts straight around his clowning and doing so impeccably, with Chaplin's then-wife Paulette Goddard giving an utterly charming performance as Ellen Peterson, a.k.a. the Gamin. The end result is a beautifully made and very funny film, but one that is also angry, showing people driven to crime and forced to live in hovels by low wages and unemployment, and often daring (the scene in which the Tramp accidentally takes cocaine - with hilarious results - was technically forbidden by the Hays Code at the time). It certainly isn't the only Chaplin film worth watching, but it is nonetheless one of his very best and one of the finest film comedies ever made.",

For that his character pays the price. And, yes, he pays the price for some of the usual perils of 1930s life -- its poverty and its desperation. He takes the blame for stealing a loaf of bread that a damsel in distress has stolen so that she could sate her hunger.

It stars the great Charlie Chaplin, who also (as usual) wrote, produced, and directed! His leading lady is Paulette Goddard, as the gamin. Henry Bergman is the cafe manager at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, and Chester Conklin is the mechanic caught in the machinery. Stanley Sandford is Chaplin's partner on the assembly line in the factory. Chaplin tells the story of a man who tries to succeed in these modern times. His opening title tells us ""Modern Times-a story of individual enterprise, of humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness."" This sets the stage for a realistic yet hilarious film about a homeless man who has lost his job at a factory. He meets up with a gamin of the streets. He is convinced to help them get a nice home in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Along the way on the streets, he is put in jail. Then he foils a jailbreak. Then he is set free. Then he is put back in jail. Then he escapes and meets the gamin. Then he gets a job as the night watchman in a department store and is sent back to jail for helping in a robbery during the night. He then meets up with the gamin, who has found a shack on the waterfront for them to live in. Next, the tramp gets a job in a local factory, but only succeeds in creating some havoc. Afterward, he gets into a fight with a policeman and is jailed. Upon release, he finds the gamin working at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, where he gets a job as a singing waiter. He proves a success at singing an impromtu song and dance number, but then the authorities arrive. They have come for the gamin. She has run away from juvenile officers after the death of her father! Together, Charlie and the gamin make an escape.  The next morning, they decide to take life as it comes, and they set out down the open road, hand-in-hand. This is a touching finale to this story of technology. It is a classic and should be seen by everyone; not just as entertainment but as an eye-opener about today's modern times.",

MODERN TIMES begins with a shot of a clock (a time clock?) before cutting to a shot of sheep being herded along (to their deaths?), followed immediately by a shot of a herd of workers pressed shoulder to shoulder in their haste to get to work. Not exactly subtle, but the point is made. When The Assembly Line Worker (Chaplin) is selected to test an automatic worker-feeding machine (which will allow the workers to continue working during lunch), the contraption proves impractical. Not long thereafter, The Worker has a nervous breakdown and ends up quite literally caught up in the gears of The Machine. He's extricated and hauled away to a hospital. (Which means that he has better health care coverage than I ever did...) No sooner has he been released from the hospital than he's mistaken for a labor leader (a ""communist"") and hauled off to jail. He does his time, then meets a homeless girl (""the gamin"") and they fall kinda sorta in love. He vows: ""We'll get a home! Even if I have to work for it.""

At almost 1.5 hours, this is among his longer movies and I am a bit surprised to read there is really just one version/runtime. Anyway, this is from 1936, so it will have its 85th anniversary next year. It is really not one of Chaplin's oldest works, that much is safe and the then new technology of sound in films also made it to his movies. I don't think this is really a problem. On the contrary, the used it wisely and for example when we hear these words about the feeding machine (or whatever it is called), it has something really sterile and monotonous to it, which clearly stayed in the mind. This machine is from the early parts of the film and these were the parts that I liked the most, namely when the action takes place inside that factory where Chaplin's character goes more and more crazy, which makes for some nice laughs, for example how he basically turns into a machine himself. And also all the action at the assembly line was quite hilarious too I'd say. Chaplin really worked his talent there and the big guy next to him, who constantly struggles with Chaplin being too late with his performance, made it even funnier.

Possibly a tone on his views of sound films. Heck this was made in 1936. Silent films were long gone, and talkies were the thing of the future. Being Chaplin's last silent film he decided it was right to say goodbye to the little tramp. Anyways let's look at the plot. The tramp (Chaplin) is a factory worker. Chaplin illustrates his views on industry here by showing us huge gears and his daunting assembly line job. Chaplin inadvertently scares people when having a mental breakdown so he is sent to a hospital. After release he is inadvertently held as a communist and arrested again. After that Chaplin meets an orphan (Paulette Goddard) the oldest of her siblings who tries to provide for them. Chaplin and Goddard decide to make a life together and find a home and a job. The trouble is Chaplin always seems to get himself arrested after every job. After the final job that he has fires him too, the tramp and the girl walk off assured that they will make it somehow.

Basically a factory worker, let's just call him the Tramp, is struggling to keep up with machinery of the modern society, specifically tightening bolts on plates. He is at one point selected to try out a new experimental employee feeding machine to speed up production and breaks, but of course the boss is unconvinced. It is when the Tramp gets stuck in the large cogs of the machine that he has a nervous breakdown, where he has a laugh mucking up, and this takes him to prison. Meanwhile an orphan girl known only as Gamine (Paulette Goddard) faces going into a home with her sisters, but she manages to escape and is scrounging to get by. When the Tramp has been released he is immediately put back in when he is mistaken for the leader for a communist parade waving the red flag. In prison he is out of place, but at the same time he prefers to modern society, and when he mistakes cocaine for salt and he unintentionally foils a breakout he is rewarded with release. This release leads the Tramp to meeting Gamine stealing a loaf bread and trying to take the blame to go back to prison, and again getting himself loads of food without paying. He does get arrested for this and sees Gamine in the paddy wagon, but it crashes and they tumble out to make something of themselves, specifically the Trap getting a job in a department store as night watchman. After initially starting out well, the Tramp is caught in a pile of womens' clothes and arrested again, and when he is released ten days later Gamine meets him to show him their new home. She has found a run down old shack house almost falling apart, and while hanging in it and breaking some planks, the Tramp reads a new factory is hiring, and he manages to get a job. Soon enough just after starting, and getting a co-worker caught in a mess, they finds out the workers are on strike, and he gets arrested again because of a brick. Two weeks later, the Tramp is released and finds Gamine working as a café dancer, and she tries to get him a job as a waiter/singer. He fails at the waiter job getting a duck all over the place, but he proves a worthy singer with his own improvised piece which proves a hit. In the end, Gamine is wanted for arrest, but she and the Tramp manage to get out of the café, and the films ends with them starting a life on the road. Also starring Henry Bergman as Cafe Proprietor, Stanley 'Tiny' Sandford as Big Bill, Chester Conklin as Mechanic, Hank Mann as Burglar and Stanley Blystone as Sheriff Couler. Chaplin is lovable, Goddard is lovely as the troubled love interest, the feeding machine scene is great fun, and the other slapstick moments are memorable viewing, so it is a must see silent (there are sound effects and some dialogue) comedy. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 81 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

It's fitting, then, that some use of sound seeps into the piece and usually signifies the modernisation of society, machines replacing man and bringing audio with them. It also gives us the first taste of The Tramp's voice, as he is forced into an uncomfortable situation simply to find work - though the song he sings is gibberish to keep the scene universally understandable. This picture is perhaps Chaplin's finest silent work because it not only has a message, taking a stance against the industrialisation of the workforce and its replacement by unthinking machines, but is also riotously entertaining throughout. It puts a smile on your face in the first scene and keeps it there until the last. Each slapstick set-piece comes incredibly close to brilliance, with a few easily crossing that threshold, and the feature is funny in the way only a film of this kind could be. It really is effortlessly entertaining and endlessly enjoyable, remaining a purely visual treat from beginning to end with some fantastic themes and inventive scenes. There isn't really a moment that doesn't work and the Tramp remains as endearing as ever. It's made even better because of its underlying point, one that is all the more relevant today and was actually somewhat clairvoyant, and is certainly one of the most purely cinematic pictures I've ever seen. It's a proper Chaplin classic. 8/10",

The film Modern Times ( Dir: Chalie Chaplin , one of the all time best directors in history of film ) starts the first scene with a good montage and this is what he continued through out the film by elaborating the meaning , the expression that he wanted to deliver to the audience. A group of sheep was walking in one shot and then in the next shot the workers going to the industry to work like everyday . A good use of montage to show the workers as brainless,robotic character who works as an industry tool only and never treated as human being.
2. Story depicted the life of the working class and in one scene Chaplin was arrested also for raising voice for workers , although he not have done it intentionally. The situation of the job crisis gives him the idea that Jail was much more peaceful and better for him, even when he was released. Even when in the Jail he fought against some troublemakers , he was not in proper state of mind , which is a good humorous way to depict that peoples actually are not with the police or the administration. But the depiction was so beautifully done that decoding is also easier for the audience
3. The main female character also here a part of the suffering society which sensitively affected by job crisis and overwork issue. And that pushed her to steal food for her motherless sisters. Depicting the poverty and this crisis situation is not regular or normal for western society film, most of the time they try to depict it with some larger than life characters, super heroes or war etc kind of subject with glamour , violence , colorful content in their films, with entertaining music etc. to focus mainly on business but Modern Times , in a humorous way brought the shortcomings, inequalities, discrepancies in the society , in a manner that it will keep on bouncing from laughter, enjoyment to sadness , melancholy mood. This film take audience to a proper emotional journey to make them understand their real situation around

I was not really impressed and didn't really care. However I was determined to see Modern Times because I wanted to see what the fuss was about. At first, I wasn't really impressed because I didn't understand what they were doing. I also found the first few minutes pretty boring. I was wondering, ""I thought he was supposed to be FUNNY."" I even thought of calling this review that. I was not laughing. I felt that way until he does his hilarious signature walk, twirling around the jail. I was feeling very tired and sick at the time and I burst out laughing. I rewound it and I laughed again. That was a turning point. I was beginning to love Charlie Chaplin. Not only was I amazed by his comic genius, but his physically daring (or what would seem so) stunts. My dad and I were amazed at it! We had to rewind several scenes to try and figure out how it worked. It just worked perfectly. Another person who I was impressed with was Paulette Goddard. Although I think she wouldn't have been a good Scarlett, I think she is stunningly gorgeous in this. She really has a screen presence and I loved her in this. Yet another thing that was so relevant was the political element. Charlie Chaplin hits the nail on the head about the industrial situation in those days. So here I am, reflecting on this wonderful movie. Although it took me a little while to get into it, I am now a very big Charlie Chaplin fan. His modern genius amazes me. Not only do I love Chaplin, but this wonderfully told story. ",

But this movie baffled me on both fronts dealing with everlasting topics like employee management, changing times, love and hope bundled in beautifully orchestrated scenes like the blindfolded skating, video teleconferencing and automation.

In ""Modern Times"", the silent era and The Little Tramp return phoenix-like in arguably their zenith. Long after most talkie films released during this time are considered outdated, this film will be looked upon as an entertaining commentary upon disturbing technological and social trends extending well into the future. Although basically silent, with occasional written inserts, sound is sparingly used, though not in dialogue. Among Chaplin's films, it shares with its talkie successor, ""The Great Dictator"", the distinction of being not just a comedy, but a clear satire on the underbelly of evolving western civilization. In this film, it is the question of whether machines were rapidly becoming the new slaves of men or whether men were becoming the slaves of machines. The inhumanity of working on an assembly line that ever increases in speed is the first target of satire. Lucille Ball would return to this subject in one of her most memorable comedy skits. Henry Ford found that the cure for the astronomical turnover rate of workers on his assembly lines was to pay unheard of wages to his largely immigrant work force. The next target of satire is the invention of mechanical aids that are more trouble and danger than they are worth, or which rob us of our remaining sense of humanity. This is his famous automatic feeding machine comedy scene, one of the most hilarious comedy scenes in the history of film making. Next, Chaplin satirizes the increasing overcomplexity and bodily danger of machines and of life in general. Throughout the film, he mixes routine physical and situational comedy with occasional specialized situations.",
128,10 January 2009,lugonian,9, The Lady and the Tramp,"MODERN TIMES (United Artists, 1936), was written, produced, scored, directed, and stars Charlie Chaplin in what was to become his final role as the Little Tramp. It also marked the close to the silent screen era. In fact, MODERN TIMES, though not essentially a silent film in a sense, but more like some made between 1927-29 equipped with underscoring, sound effects and talking sequences. While silent movies officially ended by 1929, Chaplin kept that genre going with CITY LIGHTS (1931) and MODERN TIMES, demonstrating that silents is still golden. Chaplin, having come a long way from London music halls to American silent comedies dating back to 1914, not only developed his character but established the greatness in his work. Reportedly in production for two years, possibly more, Chaplin's ability to perfect comedy routines into a simple story like MODERN TIMES is amazing. Supporting Chaplin is Paulette Goddard, an movie extra since 1929, now awarded the opportunity in a major role opposite the comedy legend. Unlike Chaplin's other leading ladies of the past, Goddard is reportedly the only one to become successful, especially during the 1940s following her second pairing in Chaplin's first talkie as THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940).",

It's also a not-so-subtle critique of the change in America's popular attitude during his professional heyday, decrying the abundance of automation in local factories while the great depression still raged on city streets. Despite the weighty deeper implications, it remains a genuinely charming set of skits and Chaplin is at his emotive, expressive best from curtain to curtain.

134,26 March 2021,MissSimonetta,9, It's scary how relevant this still is,"On a technical and storytelling level, Chaplin made better movies than MODERN TIMES. The film is quite episodic even by Chaplin's standards and loses a little steam in some parts. However, this one might be the most socially relevant of his work. In fact, it transcends its Depression-era context: we of the twenty-first century know even more keenly than audiences of the 1930s how far technology has come and how dehumanizing its effects can be. Things like the feeding machine are not just satirical gags-- they feel like something Amazon or any other huge corporation might use in favor of saving a buck. The Little Tramp, always the outsider, was never more alienated than here, where the other characters often move like automatons or, as in the first allegorical shot, herded sheep, all of them sleepwalking through life and forced into repetitive, grueling work with little hope of a better life. The Tramp's sole kindred spirit is the Gamine, played with such a youthful vivacity by Paulette Goddard that you completely forget she's too old for the role. The film's original ending called for the Tramp and the Gamine's ultimate separation. She becomes a nun (presumably to escape the life of a wanderer) and he takes to the road, walking into the sunset alone while the Gamine dreams of joining him once more. In my opinion, the more optimistic ending with the Tramp and the Gamine walking off into the future together is more fitting to Chaplin's humanist vision: life is hard but we still have one another and the ability to try to face it all with a smile.",

During his previous film ""City lights"" (1931) talkies were on the rise, but in 1936 talkies were very much the standard. Silent movies were dead. Chaplin however believed in the strength of pantomime and had the opinion that dialogue would weaken this strength. For ""Modern times"" he made the decision to incorporate sound effects but not dialogue (but intertitles!). This is most manifest in the end when the little tramp (in his last film) sings a song in a sort of esperanto language. For Chaplin the tramp was an international figure and he hated to destroy that image by making the tramp talking English. His next film (""The great dictator"", 1940) contained dialogue but did not cantain the little tramp anymore.",

As an accustomed cinema audience, who never expects a Hollywood film to tell about real life, I had prejudices about Modern Times before watching it. But all my prejudices have cleared out with an unexpected astonishment in the first scene of the film: a flock of sheep moving ahead with a strong and obvious oblivion compared to a huge group of labor at a rush hour peak. There could not be a more honest and brave way of explaining such a message: if the modernity, technology and the ambition for more money, that is 'Modern Times' turn the people into industrialized, standard and identical creatures, and make them forget their humanity; the society that they constitute will not be a society, but a herd.

145,18 September 2008,pyrocitor,10, A cinematic marvel too modern for its times,"There is a single scene in Modern Times which perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the production, one where a blindfolded Charlie Chaplin, essaying his timeless 'Little Tramp' figure for the last time, roller-skates around the top floor of a department store, continually skating perilously close to the edge of a steep drop but each time miraculously changing direction at the last moment, danger averted by a hair. As well as a perfect example of the absurdly meticulous care Chaplin invested in his film-making process and enormous risks he took for his art, the sequence proves allegorical for the film as a whole: breathtaking, dazzlingly beautiful, hilarious and yet always on the brink of a fatal crash, each time veering away at the last moment. Considering all the factors against, it remains astounding that Modern Times works as a film - an almost entirely silent film released several years after talking pictures had permeated the film industry which also proved a daring social critique masked as a silly slapstick comedy. Yet despite what a difficult sell such a film must have been, Chaplin's frantic energy, confidence and eternal courage instead elevate the film into a monumental accomplishment, simultaneously challenging and enormously entertaining, decades ahead of its time, as its ironic title would suggest.

In a brilliant stroke of ingenuity, Chaplin decides to scrap the idea of making this a ""talkie"" and allows only machines to have a voice. For instance, if the boss needs to bark orders, he does so through a TV screen and if Mr. Billows needs to explain how his feeding machine works, he plays a record containing his full speech. The sound effects are great and the visuals stunning, especially while at the factory. What its essentially a silent film at its core, Modern Times is so much more. A commentary on technology and the dream of making a home for the ones you love, it is also a very sharp comedy that will have you laughing throughout with its physical gags.",
147,9 November 2008,CitizenCaine,10, Modern Times Is The Last Great Silent Film,"Following the release of City Lights, Chaplin met with several world leaders as he toured the world for eighteen months. Chaplin formulated ideas for his next film during this tour while the United States was caught in the grip of The Great Depression. It was the wave of automation in the industrial economy which peaked Chaplin's interest. His visit to the auto and industrial factories in Detroit served as the basis for his opening scenes of Modern Times. Chaplin preventing his co-workers from chasing him by throwing the conveyor belt switch makes a huge visual statement which correlates with Chaplin's views of workers' lives being controlled by economic oppression. Chaplin, the artist unencumbered by daily life, views individuals in The Great Depression (literally) as cogs, in one late scene, in the industrial machine, left behind or replaced at will due to a changing economy.

148,6 June 2007,jluis1984,10, The Tramp goes out with a bang...,"The arrival of sound to films in 1927 (in the movie ""The Jazz Singer"") was definitely a major turning point in history of cinema, and one that would have enormous consequences in the motion picture industry of those years. Only 2 years after ""The Jazz Singer"" was released, sound films (""talkies"") became the dominant format in cinema, and slowly the silent era reached its end and with it the careers of those who couldn't make the transition. Of course, sound faced harsh opposition from many prominent artists of silent movies like directors Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin, who felt that sound diminished the art of cinema instead of elevating it. Soon, both directors would find themselves forced to get with the times and make the transition, but Chaplin wouldn't quit without a last laugh. 1936's silent movie ""Modern Times"" would be Chaplin's sweet farewell to his beloved silent era, and with it, to his most famous character: the Tramp.",

153,9 May 2022,garethcrook,8, Coming to grips with a changing world.,"This is now the fourth Chaplin film I've watched in succession. I'm aware that I'm going with the favourites in The Kid, The Gold Rush and City Lights, but still what a career. He's The Tramp again here, this time struggling to keep up with a modern world that's speeding up around him. It strikes me that although on the surface we think of The Tramp as the lovable fool. Where Chaplin excels is placing him in worlds that the audience recognise and can emphasise with. How would Chaplin back in 1936 imagine these films being enjoyed nearly a century later. Sure our connection to the changing world of the 30s isn't really there, but I think in 2022 we can all still empathise with things changing around us without our control. The Tramp is a factory worker, thrust into a world of machines, electricity, productivity. He seems ill suited. The Tramp appreciates life, his calm polite energy at odds with this steel and chrome environment. He's certainly at odds with his boss, the president of the factory (Al Ernest Garcia), who was also the millionaire's butler in City Lights. He wants everything yesterday. Why let workers stop for lunch, when you can get a machine to feed them faster while still on the job! The Tramp, always the genuine pig expertly shows why some things are best done old school. This feels like a much more physical performance, as The Tramp loses his marbles in the industrial frenzy, literally caught in the machine. The camera moves more too though, giving this a phrenetic pace. Until it all becomes too much and The Tramp looks for a life without excitement. Without any effort though, excitement always finds him. Mistaken as a communist leader, accidentally getting high on Coke whist banged up, thwarting prison breaks. It's not short on drama. As is often the case with Chaplin films though, the heart of it is people. Here his understanding that modernisation isn't working well for everyone. Machines are taking jobs and the mass unemployed are being left behind. The Tramp's affable nature puts him in situations that aren't just funny, but allow him the chance to help those around him. He can't help it. He's looking out for himself too, but is just inherently programmed to do the right thing, even when it's the wrong thing. The score, also by Chaplin as well as writing and directing is great. He understands the rhythm of the story, how each scene moves things along and how the music brings the emotion and voices to the silent characters on screen. The Tramp finds himself a partner in crime with a young homeless woman (Paulette Goddard), who's an interesting character in herself. She's not the stereotype of the usual female roles of the era. Shoeless and slightly bedraggled she has a wonderful unencumbered freedom to her performance and she compliments Chaplin perfectly as they dream of a different life in a department store after hours. They're a sweet pair, happy in their version of domesticity, but the call of work is never far away, as is The Tramp's ability to find the humour in every situation. Like helping a trapped coworker with his lunch by funnelling tea into his mouth through a chicken, brilliant! Will he find a steady job though and will The Tramp and his partner's checkered past catch up with them? It's certainly the busiest looking Chaplin film I've seen so far, but he never loses sight of the importance of character, of story arc, of keeping an audience on its toes and doing it with a delightful sense of purity.",

Equipped with the playfulness which turns him into a child-like creature in our eyes, he does at the same time possess an unquestioned humanity, and is clearly capable of showing affection towards others. True, Chaplin had demonstrated the multi-dimensionality of the Tramp many times prior to this film, but never, I believe, quite on this level; although never mean-spirited, the Tramp can still be quite outrageous to his surroundings, and sometimes prone to take advantage of others. Yet, he is also generally well-intentioned, and this soft spot is made all the more evident after acquainting ""the Gamine;"" the chemistry between Chaplin and Paulette Goddard may explain, in part, why the Tramp turns into such a full- fledged personality in this film.",

I just watched the film today, thinking I should see it at least once. But then I kept recognizing vignettes that I must have seen within the last six months. That's the impression it made on me. And frankly, I was appalled by the socialist themes that an uber rich capitalist embraced. The Tramp is supposedly jobless, except that he gets jobs easily. He loses them not to the Depression but to his own poor performance and incompetence. He celebrates theft of food but celebrates it through gluttony. In short he has very few redeeming features here.

178,7 April 2020,krational66,9," The best of times, the worst of times","Chaplin is undoubtedly one of the greatest film masters of the last century, and his works have deeply influenced generations of people.
""Modern times"" can be said to be a masterpiece of Chaplin, just as the film language said that ""the film tells the industrial age, the individual enterprise and the human pursuit of happiness conflict. Even now, more than 70 years later, when I watch the film, I still have a lot of resonance.
The hero charlot is a modern times a line of the large factory worker, day and night neurotic repeating the same work, even go to the toilet of a cigarette to enjoy all selfish capitalist deprived of ruthless, finally because of strain, charlot mental disorders, was taken to a psychiatric hospital, factory at the same time, he also lost survival job. Soon after, he left the hospital. On the street, however, he was mistaken by the police for a leader of the workers' revolt and put in prison. While in prison, he mistakenly eats heroin, which leads to excitement and guilt. A series of bizarre events take place on charlors. Finally, he is released early, and the warden says to him, ""you are free."" But charlough said, ""can you keep me here for a few more days? I'm fine here."" Perhaps it was only in that absurd age that charlough had such an absurd idea.
It was true that he might as well have been in prison as out. Although he had gained a semiotically free existence, he still lived in a larger prison, in which the rich did as they pleased and the proles had no home. After a series of adventures, the heroine falls in love with charlough, and they find their own paradise -- a small shack by the river. They had imagined the ideal paradise, such as the life in the villa of a rich family, such as the happy time in the big department store, but these were only fantasies, the paradise that really belonged to them, and it was only the small hut by the river. Here, I see the warmth and happiness they never had.
By the end of the film, charlough and the beautiful heroine are on the run again, but the chapter is titled ""dawn."" I think Chaplin wished they were walking on the road to the dawn. When charlough saw the heroine frowning, he told her to smile and smile at the dawn.
More than 70 years later, when I watched this film, I did not feel the passage of time at all. Today, it is true that the story in the film happens every day around me. Maybe there are a lot of charlors around me, maybe I'm charlors after all, who knows.
At this point, I think of a scene at the beginning of the film. The first scene is a flock of sheep scrambling to get out of the sheepfold. When I see this, I think of myself, as I walk in and out of the subway station with thousands of people during my daily commute. I think the two shots at the beginning of the modern era have every reason to be the greatest and most classic montage in movie history.

He fought back with heart and emotion and by 1936 ""Modern Times"" was a major box office and critical success. It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change.

He struggles to keep up with the ever quickening pace of the production line where he screws nuts onto bolts and suffers a mental breakdown. After being released from hospital, The Tramp finds himself as the accidental leader of a Communist rally and is thrown in jail. Once released he finds life in the Depression ruined 30s difficult but meets an orphan girl with whom he develops a friendship. The film then follows their ups and downs as they try to scrape by and stay out of jail.",
206,8 January 2021,nukisepp,9, That is still modern,"A TIMELESS story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness. Perhaps the most timeless theme in any Charles Chaplin movie - a man's struggle inside the insanity of the modern world. Technology is technology, no matter how advanced and small. And novel technology, no matter how good it might look on the paper, doesn't usually work as it's supposed to (the magnificent scene with the automatic feeder). Already in that era, Chaplin compared the people rushing to work with the herd of sheep, a metaphor that is widely overused nowadays.",

210,16 February 2021,judemcrobbie,8, Lives up to the hype,"There's 2 schools of thought when watching this movie. You can just watch it and enjoy it anyway or you can watch this and be in awe of how you basically are watching the inception of cinema unfolding before your eyes.
This movie is clearly one of the influential of all time, you don't need a critic or me to say that. The whole way through I was wanting The Factory Worker (Charlie Chaplin) to say ""Ciao, Bella!"" like from Life is Beautiful (1997).
The absurdity juxtaposed to the monotonous tasks performed throughout is where the insanely funny slapstick. It's quite remarkable how just body language can make you laugh so hard.
The movie is quite clearly a preach on capitalism and respecting and helping the poor, which even holds up to this day.
Chaplin, and the rest of the cast, have this uncanny ability to create story and narrative just through a few cards of text and their body language. The musical score also is amazing at creating the story, maybe even more so than the acting.
The silence is new to me, but I enjoyed it so much as i let me imagine what they wer saying. The ADR, which I am imagining wasn't in the original, is horrendous but what are you expecting?
Brilliant movie that anyone remotely interested in film should watch.",

It has got to be the only time I have seen something like this done. Normally there are just sound effects and not voices.,
213,27 April 2020,e-07232,9, NICE,"It should be said that in addition to trying to show more human nature, the film is more concerned with the survival and ideals of individuals in society. The unfortunate experience of an unemployed man is treated as a comedy, and the director makes his work and life constantly ups and downs, and constantly reverses, and constantly gets new opportunities, which shows that life is indeed difficult, but it is not completely without a way out. Who says that a diaosi at the bottom of the heap is impossible to reverse? Even if he does not succeed in the secular sense, he can at least get the care of the beloved, can harvest a more promising life. This hope will not fade away, either in the 1930s, when the gap between the rich and the poor was huge, or in today's more modern world nearly a century later.",

216,6 May 2020,hukaiqun,9, good,"This story of modern times, like all of Chaplin's films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end. Never is everything lost.
With obvious inspiration from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" and maybe René Clair's ""À nous la liberté"", it made the strongest point about THE where we 're going, in all the cinema of the 30's (I think) 8) and with only Marx bros' ""Duck soup"" being able to stand anywhere close to it.

Anyone will be entertained and touched by this timeless classical satire with a deep feel of humanity and warmness. Many people may understand incorrectly the idea of modernization as a nameless monster which obsesses peoples lives and souls through machinery, computers(which were still not present during the movie was shot - smile), etc. This is deeply wrong I think and this is for example the difference between this movie and for example The Matrix which is quite pointless obsession with the prehistoric, idolized fear for the unknown and of the brave new world. On the other hand Chaplin tells us a story about capitalism, bureaucracy, dehumanization, poverty, of the little man trapped in the big machine of the government and thrown out on the street as a piece of trash, after his employer have sucked his brains out of work. The metaphor es are so direct and colorful sometimes that you can only sit and watch speechless while the whole story is told. My favorite moments are so many but I cannot forget Charlie trapped in the big machine, Charlie going crazy on the production line, Charlie and his girl friend dreaming of a better life, etc.I repeat the story is so totally and overwhelmingly human that even the big factory and the machines cannot spoil but only stress the man, a man fighting for his normal life in a crazy and anti-human society.",
221,9 January 2005,ACitizenCalledKane,10," As long as there is unemployment, poverty, or unhappiness in the work force, Modern Times will stand as a truly timeless masterpiece!","Charles Chaplin's 1936 masterpiece, Modern Times, reinvents its own title. It transcends what were ""modern times"" in 1936, and it every bit as relevant and powerful in 2005, our ""modern times."" A story of man vs. machine, individual vs. ""the system,"" and hope in the face of a world that seems to have grown apart from humanity, Modern Times is an inspiration! It is not inspirational because of the laundry list of problems facing our heroes, but because of their unrelenting resilience, their ability to ""Smile"" at the end of it all. Chaplin social commentary is presented in a satirical, yet optimistic, way, so that we are free to recognize the size of the problems at hand, but never allowed to sink into the hopelessness that such troubles often bring. We are led by Chaplin through a tumultuous time in American history; one of labor disputes, high unemployment, poverty, and despair. Fortunately we are guided by The Tramp, in his final screen appearance, all the way to the light at the end of the long, dark tunnel, his humor and pathos as poignant as ever. Through his phenomenal brand of physical comedy and ingenious directing, we see that all we need to do is smile, and not give in to the world that surrounds us, and we will see a brighter day. An extraordinary film of great power, with a message that should be seen by anyone who has ever struggled through a hard time in their life! A masterpiece!",

The comedy is marked by an innocence, not often seen anymore, that just makes you smile. The physical comedy is to an incredibly high standard and there are some some genuinely dangerous stunts, too, seen during an exciting chase sequence. There are some heart-string tugging moments as well, because this picture as a real heart to it. It's probably the most emotionally resonant of Chaplin's silent films, with a real emotional payoff. Of course the feature is dated, it is nearly a hundred years old, and there's a bizarre fantasy sequence towards the end that stands out as an odd and unnecessary aside. The piece's silent styling and heightened reality setting allows it to more-or-less totally stand the test of time and provide some honest enjoyment, though.

The endless complexity and harsh unforgiveness of 'modern' cities and the simple grace and beauty of two individuals trying to survive day by day is a very endearing and hopeful look at our own lives in a way that we never lose the ability to laugh at ourselves and take light of our circumstances, live in the moment, enjoy companionship and love, even if everything else goes wrong.",

Modern Times had many exceptional scenes and my favorites include: The climax dance and the events prior to it where he plays rugby with that roast duck, relieving the ship from the dock, blindfolding himself and skating in a danger zone, The dream scene with Paulette in which he had grapes and apples grown inside his home and a cow that milks himself and, the test he undergoes with the food-machine.",

In Modern Times we see Chaplin's genius at work demonstrated via the character of the Tramp. Between the humorous and controversial scenes at the Steel Factory which seem as a direct jab to progress and the enslavement of men by machines, and the heartwarming scene at the restaurant where the Tramp tries out as singing waiter, Chaplin managed to mix all these elements together and with Paulette Goddard doing a wonderfully good job in the part of the Gamin, he conjures this immortal film which still captivates audiences almost eighty years after its' release.

300,27 May 2008,agargash,8," Modern Times, Mason Class 420","Modern Times (1936), filmed between 1932 and 1936, it was directed, written, and produced by Charlie Chaplin. This was Chaplin's first film after his successful City Lights (1931). This film is Charlie Chaplin's protest against what is lost from silent films through the sound industry revolutionizing the film industry. There is no traditional voice dialogue in the film - but voices and sounds do originate from machines (e.g., the feeding machine), television screens (i.e., the authoritarian on the screen in the lavatory), and Chaplin's actual voice is heard singing as well as special sound effects are used. Set during the Great Depression, the movie's main concern reflected the millions of Americans in the era - joblessness, destitution, and famine. It had a number of marvelous and memorable scenes that showed the frustrating relationship between man and machine in the Industrial Age and social institutions. The scenes of the Chaplin's character Tramp is alternated between scenes as a factory worker, a shipyard worker, a night watchman, a singing waiter, or a criminal put in jail. The Tramp also deals with various authority figures during his abuses: a 'Big Brother' factory boss, a minister, juvenile authorities, a sheriff, a shipyard foreman, a store manager, etc. Under the overlaid credits, a clock face approaches 6 o'clock. The preface explains the film's topic: ""'Modern Times.' A relationship between industry, and individual enterprise - humanity exploring a median between efficiency and happiness."" The film starts with an overhead shot of a flock of sheep crowding their enclosure, and rushed through a shaft. Instantly, sheep dissolve into a related overhead shot of industrial workers pushing out of a subway station on their way to work in a factory during their commute. Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin is a milestone film, showing numerous changes in Chaplin's film making. It is also one of Chaplin's most famous films. It contains quite a few first attempts by Charlie Chaplin. It is Chaplin's movie used to make a social remark. It introduced Paulette Goddard, his partner both on & off screen. It is his first true talking film; in keeping with the movie's topic of the dehumanization of society, all of the voices in the film came from non-living sources (radios, a phonograph record, etc.)",
301,29 May 2008,shossei2,8, Gov490,"Laughter was a scarce resource in America during the great depression, which lasted nearly ten years from 1929 to 1939. Unemployment was extremely high and many families struggled to get food on their dinner tables. The world's economy was in shambles and many countries were on the verge of war in 1936 when Charlie Chaplin released his silent comedic movie ""Modern Times"". Just as many of Chaplin's movies he directed, produced and starred in this comedic masterpiece. Similar to his past movies Chaplin uses his ""little tramp"" character to illustrate the different trials and tribulations many men and women where facing during that time. This is one of Chaplin's first political themed movies. ""Modern Times"" is a story in which still relates to our everyday lives. As technology improves there will always be people similar to the little tramp character of ""Modern Times"", just not as hilarious as Chaplin's antics. This hilarious movie follows the Little Tramp as he attempts to find means to survive. Once he is laid off from his factory he is mistakenly identified as a communist protest leader, and quickly incarcerated. The hijiinks continue for the Little Tramp within the prison walls, one such instance was when he mistakenly consumed cocaine during lunch. As soon as the cocaine hits his system lunch is over and the prisoners must return to their cells, while he is being transported from one room to another a prison break erupts and he is once again thrown into the middle of an intense situation and he has no idea. Unknowingly he breaks up the prison break and is award for his brave actions with a pardon, once again he is free man, and however he is still broke, hungry, and homeless. Determined to get imprisoned again where he will receive three meals and a place to stay becomes his number one priority. Instantly his dream to be imprisoned again comes true as a young orphan girl whom is also dearly struggling to survive is caught stealing and as she fled from the police she ran into The little Tramp. He quickly takes the blame for the theft and is arrested. Once released from jail he his re-introduced to the young girl whom had escaped the police. The two of them immediately create a bond between them and vow to do whatever they have to do to survive. Chaplin eventually returns to work at the factory, and even though he's really not good at anything he still makes a valiant effort. His factory career doesn't last long before the workers go back on strike; once again he's unemployed and hungry. He eventually gets a job as a server/ entertainer at a local café where his young friend is performing at. Similar to all his other professions, Chaplin is thrown into the hectic lifestyle that was prevailing at the time. The increased industrialization and modernization was a huge conflict for The Little Tramp, whom was incapable of adapting. Ultimately he finds his calling, without the intrusion of technology he perfects his natural calling of an entertainer.",
302,11 July 2009,bulgarianflower,9, Modern Times Movie Review,"Charlie Chaplin is one of the actors, who gives us his body and his soul playing for the audiences in series of pantomimed movies. It is easy for all of us to express what we think, feel, and are concerned of by simply opening our mouth and speaking out, but Chaplin shows us that the ability to communicate with the other actors and the audience can be accomplished not only by the verbal speech, but also by the body language and our inner intentions. In the movie ""Modern Times"", he gives us a show of his sarcasm towards the fast-paced technology and the inability to catch up with the modernization in the world he lives in. The technology he describes and is concerned of supposedly should help us in our daily tasks as well as improve our life for the better; miserably it not only creates difficulties for him, but also makes it emotionally unbearable for him to deal with. He tries to be as fast as he could be when screwing in the nuts of the machines; he tries to adjust his attitude and physical body to perform and give his one hundred percent, but unfortunately he is left with disappointment when catching up with the rapid environment he is surrounded by. His skills and mind become rusty as he works only on one part of the assembly line over and over again like a robot without a break. His body is beaten- up from work and there is either no excitement at the work place or no direct benefits from the technological advancement. He tries to work hard and by the acceptable norms of the society, but his happiness is diminished as his soul and his inner self suffocate by the cruel demands from the management of the factory he works at. His dedication to accomplish his work requirements creates not only a problem for his co-workers and his superiors when slowing down the factory production, but also creates a nervous break for himself that only makes him physically and mentally weak and vulnerable when he foolishly plays around and annoys others by spraying them with machine oil. Throughout the movie Chaplin shows to us the dysfunctions of the new technology and he sadly transforms the difficult moments in his work career into comic laughter for the audiences. The situations he develops in front of our eyes make us question the advantages much argued and discussed to us about the positive influence of the new machinery. Back then human persona suffer to adjust to the new world which created obstacles and frustrations with the technology. The humanity was challenged by the new and changing future of the technological expansion. The movie shows us different unexpected scenes and aspects that the working class was dealing with at the times of scientific adaptation. Was it worth it or not for the human race to pass through the discomfort and discontent that the future had in store? Deeper insights are needed when conducting a formal or informal research on the case. Chaplin acts astonishingly in order to maintain his view for the present and future evolution concerning the human attempts to improve and benefit the society; and the movie brings us to our senses in observing the reality of the advantages and disadvantages in the new worldly- and quickly- changing technology.",

305,1 May 2010,ohiotoby,9, Humorous tale of life during the great depression,"Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" was released on February 25, 1936. This film would be Chaplin's last silent film. Charlie Chaplin reprises his role as the Tramp in this film set during the Great Depression. Chaplin continues his mastery of silent theatric humor in this film, whose storyline many people would have a hard time finding humor in. This film is fittingly produced in black and white. Modern Times is based in the midst of the Great Depression. The main theme of the film is to make the viewer aware of the conditions of the Depression and how they affected most people. This film raises our awareness of issues such as poor work conditions, unemployment, poverty, hunger, and the harsh reality of broken families during this time in history. Charlie Chaplin plays the Tramp who recently becomes unemployed after having a nervous breakdown, as a result of being worked too hard. The Tramp struggles to find and keep a job in these tough times. Discouraged, he resorts to trying to get thrown in jail so he has a place to sleep and food to eat. During his attempts to go back to jail, the Tramp meets the Garmin, played by Paulette Goddard. The Garmin is a young runaway orphan who recently lost her family, as a result of her father being shot in the street. The Garmin and the Tramp are now homeless, hungry and poor. They come find hope in each other and find a new determination to survive together and beat the odds. This film follows their struggle to overcome the odds, earn an honest living, keep nourished and maintain hope throughout all of the obstacles they encounter. Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, composed and produced this film. Chaplin's masterful use of sound draws the viewer into the scene. In this film, sound is vital in establishing mood and atmosphere of scenes. One defining scene in the film that is a perfect example is a scene where the Garmin loses her father. The Garmin and her sisters are on the dock collecting wood (happy, joyous music is heard), next a gunshot is heard and the music becomes frantic. The Garmin sends her sisters off and she rushes to see what happened. She arrives at her father lying in the street and takes him in her hands as the music turns sad and she mourns her father's death while holding him in her hands. Chaplin also uses masterful body language to portray the emotion and tempo of the film. This is a vital component to this film, like so many other silent films. One good example of this is when the Garmin and Tramp are sitting on the side of the road. The Garmin suddenly comes to tears and dramatically places her head in her arm to cry on. The Tramp and the audience are fully aware of her mood at that moment. This films overall theme is similar to that of Cinderella Man. Even though these films were produced about 70 years apart, they share a theme. Regardless of the circumstances you are dealt, you should never give up. While Cinderella Man is based on a true story of the Great Depression period, Modern Times is based on Charlie Chaplin's unique portrayal of the period. I would strongly recommend viewing this movie to gain a better understanding of this period in American History.",
306,30 August 2010,kalyugkapaapi,9, A Satirical Masterpiece,"Modern Times is a satire on capitalism; it highlights the drawbacks of the Industrial Revolution and how machines have burgeoned into a menace, dominating all aspects of human life. It is the story of an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the various social and economic changes; generated with the advent of industrialization. It portrays how capitalism can push an individual to the periphery of the society. The first shot transforms from a flock of sheep to a crowd of people .Idea associative montage has been used to portray that human beings have lost their individuality and their lives are dictated by a social dogma. The movie was made when the world was going under an economic crisis and the political undertones employed, in this movie, are very conspicuous. Charlie Chaplin is shown as an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the industrial and social changes. The movie is about his constant conflict with capitalists, police and the society in general; the movie is definitely a landmark in comedy. The impeccable humor timing of Chaplin makes him one of the greatest entertainers in film history; but despite being a comedy one cannot help but wonder about the various political and connotations made in a satirical and humorous way. The movie, in a subtle way, highlights the plight of the working class who are often exploited by the capitalists. The movie was made after the great depression during which thousands of people were unemployed and many families starved to death. The movie was light years ahead of its time and delivered strong thoughts in the form of humor; the movie has a lot memorable scenes which make us laugh and think at the same time. This movie is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedies ever made; made by a genius who was not only a great film maker but also a greet visionary. This piece of art has stood the test of time and has been appreciated by people of all ages. This movie serves as a testimonial to the artistic and creative genius of one of the greatest entertainers to have graced the celluloid screen.",

All the sound effects and voices were done in post. Its about Chaplin making fun of the new talkie movies of that time. He has an evil boss who talks notice. A new machine is made to eliminate the lunch hour. People trying to make more money on people who don't have any. The two main characters that are struggling just to get by never make a sound. Also when Chaplin does finally speak he signs a song to Americans in another language and they love it. Actions speak louder than words and that's what this movie is about. Chaplin pokes fun at the new films and makes a silent movie when they were all but over. Probably one of the 50 best movies ever made for its history, hidden meanings, and subtext.",
