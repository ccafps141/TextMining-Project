0,12 July 2006,planktonrules,10, Probably the greatest WWII naval movie,"This is an amazing achievement, and it's obvious because it is one of the only German language films to receive widespread distribution in American theaters since the silent era. It was just that good! When it came to America, the movie was cut down a little from it's original HUGE length and it was released in both dubbed and subtitled versions.",/
1,25 November 2017,claudio_carvalho,10, German Masterpiece,"In October 1941, the German Capt.-Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jürgen Prochnow) of the U-96 U-Boat receives the war correspondent Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer) to cover the work in the submarine during their mission in the Atlantic Ocean. They sail out of the shipyard La Rochelle and along the next weeks, Werner learns the lives, loves, fear and behavior of the young crew, the veteran Captain and his officers. The skilled captain hunts British vessels to sink and dives to depths below the limit of the boat to escape from the destroyers. Near Christmas, they plan to return to La Rochelle; but out of the blue, Captain Henrich receives an order to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to go to Italy. But the captain knows how protected the area is and plans a means to lure the British Navy. Will the U-96 succeed in crossing the Strait of Gibraltar?",r
2,7 December 2020,Essex_Rider,10, Emotionally Draining,"My late father served in the Royal Navy in WWII and was torpedoed by a U Boat, so when I sat with him to watch this in 1986, I fully expected him to be filled with hatred for them. Nothing could have been further from the truth. He told me that seamen, even those on opposite sides, share something unique. He told me that his ship picked up some U Boat survivors from a ramming. They were just ordinary men doing the bidding of their masters, just like he was. They were put down at Scapa Flow as POW's after being at sea for 5 weeks. Many of them had formed friendships with the Royal Navy men, including my father. He formed a friendship with a submariner called Gotz Stiffel and they remained friends until Gotz passed away. My father attended his funeral in Duisburg and he was welcomed as an old friend by the survivors of that U Boat sinking. My father said that film bought tears to his eyes. They were just ordinary men caught up in extraordinary times and this film captured everything from fear to boredom and relief. He said, and I utterly agreed with him this was just about the finest anti-war film ever made.",e

With ""Das Boot"", I have no such reservations. Here's a film that takes all your preconceived notions about Nazi villains and stands them on their head, by portraying a World War II submarine crew as human beings, facing life and death daily in the cramped confines of an underwater prison. Not only does one come to understand their plight, but sympathize with them as well, to the point of hoping that they make it through their Atlantic ordeal. The only problem being that once they do, a cruel fate intervenes to usurp the lives of innocents in a way that their harrowing underwater ordeal could not.",i
5,18 August 2004,Theo Robertson,9, Review Of The Director's Cut,I've decided not to review the 1981 dubbed cinematic release of DAS BOOT . Instead I've decided to review Wolfgang Petersen's director's cut which is far closer to the miniseries version which most readers will be familiar with ,e
6,8 September 1999,susy-7,10, 15 years and I'm still thinking about it,"Das Boot is not just a great war film: it's a great film period.

8,25 March 2005,Mike_Wiggins,10, The best submarine film ever made.,"While it has been a very long time since I have seen this movie, it is one of the very few that I own.

9,7 July 2000,shmuey barak,10, Take it from a real submariner-,"on modern ""boats"" life isn't easy- but compared to the living hell that the German U-Boats were, modern submariners have nothing to complain about. People in certain professions don't like to watch movies about those professions (Doctors and Nurses shy away from hospital dramas, for example). Submarine sailors are different. We love to watch every submarine movie ever made, from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination: Tokyo"" to ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"". Why? Because we can always use a good laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. Except this one. After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously. And that is the highest praise a movie like this can possibly get.",w

11,13 May 1999,yenlo,9, Top of the line,When you go to a liquor store to buy Vodka you can purchase one of several brands or you can purchase Stoli. That's what Das Boot is when it comes to Submarine films. You can watch any one of several or you can watch Das Boot. Like Stoli Vodka it's in a class by itself. Superb film either way you see it i.e. subtitles or the dubbed version. See the directors cut if you can. The German crew could be any nationality the film is so well done it doesn't matter. Andy Rooney once said that when you're in a war you live life at 100%. The opening scene of this film demonstrates that. The men are living life at 100%. I never saw any other war movie that captured that like Das Boot.,3
12,31 October 2005,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: Das Boot: The Director's Cut (1981),"This is touted as one of the best WWII submarine films of all time, and it's not difficult to understand why. From the story to the cast, from the cinematography to the sound, everything's top notch on this German film directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who's now helming more Hollywood flicks). I'd rate it above U-571, K19: The Widowmaker, Crimson Tide, and The Hunt for Red October.",2
13,14 March 2006,lee_eisenberg,10, Hunters or hunted?,"Probably the main reason that ""Das Boot"" is so great is because it shows that the men in the submarine aren't really Nazis: they were just drafted. But once the submarine dives, then the suspense sets in. Capt. Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jurgen Prochnow) leads his men on a voyage of adventure and terror alike. As the viewer, you feel like you're in the submarine, getting attacked from all sides. Rarely do you see the kind of intensity that you see in this movie. Overall, it makes us question the idea of who's good and who's bad in wartime. It's widely agreed that the Axis Powers were the bad guys in WWII, but the men here don't hold Nazi ideology; we sympathize with them every step of the way. A great movie.",9

15,8 December 2020,Ruskington,10, Quite possibly the greatest war movie ever made,"Astounding piece of cinema, presenting the horrors of war in a particular powerful way.

18,24 March 2004,everyones-a-critic,10, Listen up Hollywood - this is how its done,"What can be said about this epic that has not already been said? Peterson has created the grittiest, most realistic war drama ever. It knocks hollywood epics like Saving Private Ryan on their sorry overproduced, oversentimental behinds, it torpedoes other submarine films before they have a chance to shout ""dive!, dive!, dive!"".",?

20,30 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9, Life in a Sardine Can,"In this superb drama, we get into the lives of the crew of a German submarine. It is a small submarine, and their individual lives are melded into the claustrophobic constricted world in which they live. Every action has a reaction. Everything is done with the knowledge that a single slip up will lead to their destruction. They face a series of death defying maneuvers and escapes, losing a little of themselves whenever they survive. The war is the enemy, and these men would have meant nothing to those in power. As with most wars, we redefine the value of human life and put others ahead of the common man. The terror of each moment, each challenge, is magnified. They probably don't know what it is for except someone has told them it is important.",e
21,24 May 2007,thinker1691,9, The Other side of War,"Wolfgang Peterson, wrote and directed this superb film of submarine life during World War II. When first seen by an American audience, reactions were mixed. Halfway into the film, the German crew begins to exhibit some universal traits which touch the heart of anyone fighting for a cause. Gone is the reason why the seamen are fighting often-times an unseen enemy. The reasons are replaced by a plethora of dangerous and certainly dramatic events which allow an audience to see the life and death struggle of all veterans. The visual heart of this unusual movie, is that of an experienced German Captain (Jürgen Prochnow) who sails the Atlantic, meeting both friend and foe alike. With him are his aids, Lt. Henrich (Lehmann-Willenbrock), Herbert Grönemeyer as Lt. Werner and Klaus Wennemann who is superior as Chief Engineer. When they realize the war is nearly over, they head for home. Unfortunately they are spotted, targeted and attacked by the English navy. Now comes some heart-pounding action as most of the crew expect to die before reaching home. Seen from the perspective of an American audience, one expects the inevitable. Yet, from the audience point of view, one can not help but sympathize for the Captain and his valiant crew. A Great film indeed. ****",f
22,16 September 2005,keithhallam,10, Reality,"I spent 17 years of my life in Royal Navy submarines. 'T' class, 'A' class and 'R' class. Das Boot is the only submarine movie that shows exactly how it was. It could be a documentary. Bouncing around in the Bay of Biscay with the sea too rough to be able to dive safely and get away from it. 'Goffers' pouring down the conning tower and the control room deck ankle deep in the green stuff. Going down backwards at 500ft and you know there is 10,000ft below you, with seawater pouring in through a burst cooling pipe and one main motor out of action. Existing for two weeks on kai or oxo because your stomach is rebelling against the elements. Laying in your bunk in ultra quiet routine with the sweat just dribbling down. When the sweat starts to dribble upwards you know it's a cockroach crawling up your body. And that Klaxon. 'Hunt for Red October', 'Crimson Tide'. They are just adventure films.",_
23,12 April 2006,bigkeeko,10, One of the BEST war movies ever,"If you've never seen this movie then beg, borrow or steal a copy. It'll actually make you admire/feel sympathy for the German Serviceman caught up, in what was the most horrific of wars. Tense, realistic and gripping this one off has yet to be bettered in my opinion. The start doesn't really remind you of a war movie but believe me thats armed forces behaviour all right. As WW2 progressed Hitler drew on ever younger recruits and the historical accuracies are in abundance for a change. This film makes modern junk like the new Pearl harbour look limp wristed.",=
24,29 July 2004,JonDavidCampbell,10," Gripping, Compelling, Intense, Suspenseful, Realistic","""Das Boot"" is a classic. This film couldn't be more intense and emotionally draining. It is a work of genius. Jurgen Prochnaw gives a spectacular performance as the German U-Boat Captain. The acting is first rate as the cast of characters is as realistic and believable as it gets. Don't watch this film unless you are absolutely prepared to immerse yourself into the drama of life as a crewman aboard a German submarine during war. This is a very rare portrayal of battle through the eyes of our enemy and will actually have you cheering for the ""bad guys"" at times. This is a one of a kind movie that must be seen to be believed. Words in a review cannot describe the experience of ""Das Boot."" A tremendous film! A 12 on a scale of 10!",t

The last was definitely the best.",t
26,28 May 2004,Jamesb_2,10, The best depiction of fighting men....ever!,"I first saw this film on the BBC when it was aired in it's mini series format. I was 13 at the time and was totally blown away by it. Up until then, the only war films i had seen were gung-ho movies, with GI's firing tommy guns from the hip at hoardes of evil Nazis. ",_
27,16 September 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Immersive and unforgettable masterpiece,"I haven't read the novel, so I base this upon the Director's Cut, which is the only release I have watched. Yes, it's three hours and fifteen minutes long. And let me tell you, it is completely worth it. The development of character and build-up of atmosphere and mood are among the best ever seen in this medium. You care about the entire crew, and they have varied personalities and every last one of them is credible. Including a reporter lets them occasionally explain something the audience needs to understand without it standing out, and apart from that, he is also someone you feel for. There are no good or bad guys in this, there are only *people*. Human beings. And you experience the terror that actual submarine crews did, as well as the filth and the claustrophobia. All without any of it getting excessive. This is intense and extremely well-paced. It manages to not overwhelm the audience to the point of over-stimulation. You don't merely witness how little room they have to move around, how two men cannot pass each other at certain parts lest they both squeeze up against the wall and move sideways, you *experience* it. If you are not OK with closed spaces, you may not want to take your chances with a viewing of this. It's exceptionally well-shot, from start to finish. The authenticity is astonishing. I understand that this really happened, and is a combination of two true stories. Exposition is delivered smoothly, and this is well-told all the way. There is occasional humor, to lighten the tension slightly. I don't want to risk giving too much plot away, so this is all I will reveal: This follows a group of young men, inexperienced rookies, on their first mission on a sub, under a veteran captain. This is well-made all the way, and it was the perfect decision to do it almost completely in sequence. The sound design is amazing, in a class of its own. Every acting performance is flawless, and it's no wonder that Prochnow got several American roles after this came out. The DVD offers a dub in English(by the same cast, I understand), though I chose to hear the original German. It also contains a trailer, a six minute featurette of sorts, about the DC edition, and a subtitled, highly informational and also fun commentary track with Wolfgang, Jürgen and Ortwin Freyermuth who produced this version of the film. This has relatively infrequent strong language and is disturbing, sometimes violent and bloody, and most definitely not for the faint of heart. I recommend this to anyone who likes anti-war movies. Unquestionably Petersen's greatest achievement. 10/10",u
28,24 May 2007,dr_foreman,9, Intense.,"""Das Boot"" is an excellent drama...and it's also more terrifying than virtually every horror film I've ever seen. The dark, dirty, claustrophobic environment of the submarine is something out of a nightmare. Even the sound effects are scary - the boom of the depth charges, the groaning of the hull under pressure, the ""ping!"" of bursting bolts, etc. etc. The images, the sounds, and the charged performances of the actors work together beautifully to create the illusion that fifty men are fighting for their lives in an amazing but fragile piece of machinery.",r

34,25 January 2000,tammolotz,10," Packing, genuinely, overwhelming!","Using the term 'authenticity' in connection with any kind of art is rather difficult and daring as well. Sometimes it looks posed or is by certain purposes manipulated. Referring to Petersen´s ""Das Boot"" however, I consider it justified to call it authentic and true. I think this statement can be strengthened mainly by the fact that Lothar Gunther Buchheim was consulted. He composed the novel this breathtaking movie bases on and he himself was employed as a war correspondent in the Second World War.",

42,16 October 2004,st_soulboy,10," Nearly four hours long, and never a dull moment!","The first time I saw this film I could not take my eyes from it. I was mesmerized with the transition of a hearty young crew leaving port evolving as the sheer moments of terror (deep under water battles and personal struggles as well as the final scene) lead them all to rethink their actual cause, and their very own mortality (as well as our own in the perils of war!). I can't imagine another film actually displaying what it must have been like to be on one of Nazi Germany's U-boats - young nationalist boys being plucked from their mother's bosom and cast into the claustrophobic iron wolfs in the heat and height of the second world war, who begin to doubt the cause and victory of the fuhrer they've been taught to love and trust. Very colorful, contrasting characters and a script and plot thick with surprises and emotional drama/trauma. Top-notch direction, action, acting and sets. This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. Sorry I couldn't be more specific with the review, there is just too much to cover without spoiling anything for those yet to enjoy it, and thus I just highly recommend it to anybody, not just war movie buffs. I have seen both the regular version and the director's cut (which I own on DVD now) and I must say that the DC is superior. A masterpiece!",

War is protrayed here to be very real, very gritty, with not much glory in the end.

It starts off with young (17 year old to 25 year old) who have been filled with propaganda about the war effort and glorious battle. After this young crew of immature sailors start to experience the true horrors of war, you can not only see, but experience with them the boredom, laughter, camaraderie, team work and death. In a world where you have no windows, where your ears have to be your eyes, where a cat and mouse game is played and the looser dies, these young men age 10 to 15 years It makes the viewer realize the horror of submarine warfare in WWII.

48,11 June 2019,byzantineiconoclast,10, A life changing masterpiece.,"Oh, boy, this review is overdue by 25 years or so...I remember watching ""Das Boot"" as a miniseries on TV, back in the beginning of the 80s. My father, a war movie buff, permitted me to watch it with him, even though I was about 8yrs old then- not exactly a suitable series for a young girl - or boy for that matter. Coming from a country which was on the Allied side in WWII, I believe this has to be the first and only film that made us not only cheer for the Germans (up to then our mortal enemies), but also portrayed the Germans as normal people and not as stupid, cardboard villains (a stupid cliche that continues to this day in most WWII films). It's true I didn't have the experience to understand or appreciate everything, but, two things stood out and I remembered them for many years to come. The intense, claustrophobic atmosphere was the first, and Jurgen Prochnow's magnetic blue eyes was the second. These blue eyes haunted me for many years, until finally in my teens, I rediscovered the film and watched it again and again, while at the same time I tried to learn as many things that I could about naval warfare in WWII, in order to have a context which would help me appreciate the story better. And what a story it is...Every soldier in every war goes through hell in various different ways, but I cannot think of a worse fate than slowly suffocating in the bottom of the ocean, inside an iron coffin, while being bombed from above. ""Das Boot"" manages to perfectly portray the terror, the angst, the despair, the triumph, the boredom- the incredible range of emotions which every submariner- most of them young boys in their teens - went through in the course of 1 mission. The foggy, smelly, cramped confines of the submarine become the canvas on which the increasingly pale, skeletal and exhausted sailors are being painted- and no matter how much we root for them (and we DO root for them), we can't help but feel the dread that is bound to follow. We cheer with the crew, we laugh and cry and despair with them, and finally for them. All the aspects of this movie are spectacular. The direction, acting, photography, sets etc. are all top notch. I would like to give special kudos to the soundtrack, which has been my second favorite OST of all times after the Blade Runner one. This movie doesn't glorify war- quite the opposite. I guarantee that after watching this movie, you will want to watch it again and again because it reaches in a deep place inside the human psyche and never lets go. For me, it is one of the very few life-changing movies I have had the privilege to watch. If I could give it more than 10/10, I would.",

50,4 November 2018,RatedVforVinny,10," Possibly, or probably the best movie of all time!","Whatever version you see, it's a strong candidate for the greatest fil of all time! There has always been a deep interest (even by British Historians) with the German Kreigsmarine and my own fascination stems directly from this incredible movie. For once it's not about the Americans, the British or even about the Germans, but possibly the only war film (ever) to deal with real people and their struggle (in a tense cat and mouse game) for survival. Although there has been highly brave sub-mariners from many nations, they have largely been forgotten: as the chief focus has always been on the most-feared 'Wolf Packs'. Us British were top masters in espionage, as well as inventions such as Radar and Sonar. Active sonar could detect a pen dropping on a desk (within a U-Boat) and once located with passive sonar, it was almost game over! 3 out of 4 Boats never came back home. Nominated for six academy awards, it shamefully won nothing; losing out to 'tootsie'. Go figure that stupidity. 'Das Boot' is quite simply a life changing, true masterpiece of a movie.",
51,24 February 2007,Sylviastel,10, Germany's Best Film to Date!,"Let's face Germany has a dangerous past. This story is about men aboard a submarine during World War II. I saw it dubbed in English. I would have preferred subtitles and listened to the original German language being spoken. This film is completely German made with German actors. Of course, the story is not lost in translation. These men have to fight for their country regardless of whether they support their government. It's really about young men who could be any one of us in their position. You have to ask yourself what are you to do if you have no choice. I was a little disturbed when one of them stated that he was molested by six of the other guys like a ritual hazing ceremony to another officer. It was as if an unofficial initiation ceremony and disturbing as well. In war, you could see young men killing and dying and you wonder what it was all for anyway.

Knowing the Oscar nominations it received, I was only disappointed that the whole cast didn't win one. One lone actor cannot take all of the credit for such an incredible force portrayed by all the men on the ship. Jurgen Prochnow played the part of the captain better than any other actor has ever played the role of a leader of men. He brought to life the drama of leading a group of young men into a possible suicide mission with utter realism and depth. I don't normally get emotional at movies anymore. I did watching this one! All the other actors deserve as much credit for the very different men they portrayed. Not one of them was bad. Wolfgang Petersen is an amazing storyteller, and this movie proved it. I would have to say that it might very well be the best war movie I have seen, heck, it may be the best movie I have seen period!!!",

This film will challenge how much tension you can take. You will endlessly think ""when will the depth charges stop"", ""when will they stop sinking"", ""when will the boat stop leaking"". I swear that the claustrophobic nature of the film will make you feel like you are actually in the submarine. You can smell the stink of unwashed men and rotting fruit. You will feel the sweat and the salt water all over. This film is so amazing that it is interactive. You don't just watch the film, you become part of it. All of the exciting parts seem endless and Wolfgang Petersen uses the slower parts so you can get to know the characters. You see their fear, their excitement, their pride and their insanity. He does this so you actually side with the enemy. You realize these boys have no ideologies driving them to war. They don't have any love for Adolf Hitler. They are just doing what they are told to do because they are good soldiers who love their homeland. The ending is unsatisfying no matter who you side with. The reason this is done is because Petersen wants to show us that in war there are no winners...only losers.",

Unlike so many war films it does not make heros of one side and villains of the other instead it focuses on the the emotions of the crew and how each one goes from being exhilarated in one moment to terrified in the next. The acting is absolutely first class the characters totally believable and although u do not get to completely identify each of them you really do start to imagine what life on board a WWII u-boat in the latter part of the war must have been like. The sense of fear and anxiety is their for u 2 see in the eyes of these sailors whose faces are covered with a mix of sweat and oil The absolute horror on their faces when they test the sub to depths beyond that of the original trials: just gripping!

Conversely I could mention the good things in this movie, but that would be a put-down. This flick was awesome in all respects. The filming was so remarkableI got so involved. I felt so claustrophobic even in my living room. I could almost sense the pressure closing in on me when the boat went below crush-depth - at one point I went out to my garage to make sure I had plenty of wood for shoring. And then when the boat started rocking and rolling in seas-state-oh-my-God, I broke out my puke-bag in order to join the crew in their vomit-orchestra. I sat glued to this movie for over 2 hours and ended up wanting two more hours – and then two more on top of them. The filming was excellent, or as they would say, 'amazing in Germany' – ahhhh - oh yeah - 'amazing in Germany'. I have been on US subs a number of times and these U-boats were tiny compared to the boats now-a-days. If you need an idea as to how small these guys are, check out the U-505 in Chicago. I don't like to do this too much because it does take away from another's work, but comparing the perceived size of the sub in U-571 and this u-boat – U-571 would be a tractor-trailer and this boat would be a 'Smart Car'. Anyways, the cast was superb. I do not speak German, but with this kind of acting – well I knew. I mean I really, really knew when it was time to dive, and I knew when we – oops – I mean they were in serious doo-doo (trouble), and mostly, I knew that the bread would really suck if someone didn't shave off the mold. You see - I knew. And that was due to the superb acting. OH, and I did get a little translation help form the English dubbed version I own. No-no-no I would have still known. I wish I had written this when I first saw this flick in a cinema – but I waited and forgot about it until I popper it in the DVD player last night. I do hope to see more like this.",

The typical war movie simplifies war to a struggle between good and evil, though real war is so much more complex. Das Boot is nothing like the typical war movie. It shows World War II for how it was: horrifying, ruthless, and ill-planned. The U-boat crew are ordinary guys, with lives back home in Germany which they long to return to. They are not heroes, they are men who are afraid and are in the line of duty out of self-preservation and patriotism, not because they are psychotic Nazis. (they're not.) It is a story far more complex that good and evil, it is about human decisions and mistakes, and the complex struggle between one's loyalties and one's nature. Watching Das Boot, you forget that the crew is German, which in Western society we are taught is the 'bad team' of WWII, and see them for what they really were: ordinary men. I loved this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a film that's really about something, without the warm-fuzzies and Hollywood conventions steeped into most movies.

Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (Jürgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea. Das Boot puts you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen.",

Other films like ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" barely hold a candle to the nail-biting, claustrophobic world of Petersen's ""Das Boot"". Where other submarine war movies try to excite you with action and excitement, this film tries to instill in you the fear of war that these men would've faced, tries to give you a glimpse of the boredom they would've felt before their missions, and it helps you to understand the way of life on a submarine during wartime. There are scenes that make the viewer feel like we're right there in the darkened passages of that German U-boat with the men, waiting on baited breath to see if the submarine will ever surface again. It's intense, invigorating, and exhausting, but it's also and unforgettable journey, one that I will be happy to revisit again and again.

I am not a veteran of any war, and not old enough for WW2, but my dad fought against the Axis and they were his mortal enemies, but this movie shows how young boys are just the cannon fodder of wars, while the men who started it were the real enemy, the real evil. These were kids that just wanted a lady at their side and a bottle of booze with them, as were all soldiers from any army. We, America, Great Britain, France etc., fought the Nazis, not Germany, not the people, certainly not the kids. I actually was saddened by the British raid at the end of the movie, even though Britain was an ally and to this day one of my country's closest friends. A great many of the soldiers and seamen, on both sides, weren't good guys or bad guys, just brave kids who did what they were told to do. One day maybe the men who start these things will end up in a cramped, stinking U-boat, and see first hand what their actions lead to. Anyway, I can't believe how much I pulled for ""the enemy"".",

No movie at all has been made in such an accurate and realistic way. Plus it talks about the German U Boats; that changes from the usual ""good"" Americans submarines. Directing, acting, technical skilles are obvious in this movie where the technical and actors crew worked so hard, gave so much of themselves to make the result an absolute and definite unforgettable piece of work. Scenes that will remain in your mind forever and which you will never get tired of. Watch out for those sequences when the U Boat is attacked in the bottom of the sea by the sub grenades. Even at home, in the deep of your sofa, you feel squeezed, crushed, litteraly smashed by the bombs, you feel promiscuity, claustrophobia, scare. I am also jaw dropped by the characters depiction. Though those men are German and fight for the Nazis, you are totally with them, you fight, breathe with them, fight with them to survive, you wish them to finally make it.

In Das Boot (or, you guessed it, 'The Boat'), Wolfgang Peterson adapts Bucheim's journalistic novel about a U-boat in late 1941 who are tasked to go into the North Atlantic and take on the enemy, primarily British convoys and other boats of the like.

The ending bothered me in that the boat he loved sank before his very eyes. But - in the German Navy - the submariners suffered the highest casualty rate. Of the 35,000 submarine sailors - barely 4,000 ever survived the war. But - this is a movie I could watch over & over again. Cannot say that about too many other movies.

The power of das boot wasn't equalled until Band of Brothers came along in my opinion. The no nonsense, warts and all picture of the hardships involved really spell out what people faced.

It is not an easy movie to watch because it needs your patience and attention throughout its long duration but if you are ready to endure, it is quite an engaging, emotionally moving, technically perfect and equipped with amazing performances. Half an hour into the movie and you will be right in the middle of the life of people of the boat and living every moment be it joy, sorrow, boredom or fear. Actually Das Boot is one of those movies where you feel that you are running short of right words to describe what did you feel while watching this epic battle of those soldiers. The climax scene might leave you empty, devastated but most of the running time it is the story of hope even when there is no hope.

I saw it a few years ago, and the whole thing completely blew me away. The film is about a German reporter who travels on board a Nazi U-Boat to live with the German crew for a few months. (Note: The Film was filmed in German; watch it in German with subtitles. Its so much better and more realistic.) The sub is cramped, and the crew endures multiple hardships and problems as they travel through the seas during WWII. You are brought in to see the war from their point of view, you're not seeing it from the English, not from the US, you see it as a Nazi, which is quite an accomplishment for a film because the Nazis are nowadays normally frowned upon and disliked. You become attached to the crew, and you can almost feel the poor conditions of the sub as you watch. And then there's the end, which you make you run out of your living room screaming. Yes, it's that good. And I'm surprised that this film isn't as talked about as much or receives as much attention as other big films do such as Titanic. And in my opinion, it's far better. Now go to your movie store, or your Blockbuster, and get it, and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",

Hands down. Carried by the performance of Jürgen Prochnow. This is perhaps the best war movie ever made.  I recommend the German version- even if you do not like subtitles it is worth it.  While the dubbed version is very well done, you still lose something when you take out the live German voices. A true masterpiece.  I showed this movie to an American WWII Navy Veteran, and he said that it was the most realistic portrayal of submarine warfare he had ever seen.  This from a man who was on a PT Boat in the same area part of the movie takes place.  This is a must see for anyone.

What solidified this position and what I have used as a comparison since seeing the film, was `Das Boot'.  In theory, I should have been bored.  Here we have a film about a German U-Boat that almost solely takes place on this boat (save book ending scenes ashore) and yet there was not one moment when I could conjure up any sort of criticism regarding the pacing.  There were multiple scenes where the camera pretty much panned the faces of the crewmembers, and still, it was compelling due to the masterful direction of Wolfgang Peterson, a director whose filmography (in my opinion) is spotty at best.",

My paltry words simply cannot do it justice. Claustrophobia, tension and terror pervade throughout (except in the IMO slightly unnecessary opening sequence which is mercifully brief.) For me it was a story about the captain, a stunning performance by Jurgen Prochnow who plays an experienced, U-boat captain who is not without flaws. His crew comprise a few old comrades plus a group of raw recruits and a journalist. These men are German but not Nazis (with one exception) and though they spoil for a fight with the British convoys one cannot help but be drawn to them. The captain is a complex character, he shows disdain for his own 'high command' and respect for his 'enemy' yet he does not shy away from sinking convoy ships. He makes mistakes and has victories but treats them all with a fatalistic dark humour. A very good film changes gear into an astonishing masterpiece when the crew of U-96 arrive in Vigo, Spain. The sickening opulence contrasts starkly to the conditions aboard U-96, then the orders to go on what could prove to be a suicide mission. The peril of the crew is intensified, their heroic work to survive and ""go home"" is followed by what is an excruciating final twist that will leave you reeling.",

The actors are brilliant and for a lot of them ""Das Boot"" was the start of a big career in the European or German cinema or TV. One of them - Herbert Gronemeyer - was already a pop star at the beginning of his career in Germany 25 years ago. Today he is one of the most successful stars in the German music scene... he makes good music but unfortunately only music. His character was, except of Prochnows role, my favorite one, but unfortunately we'll never see more of his acting talent.

The stoic captain maintains discipline below the waves despite everything. He is perfectly cast. It is one of those few movies that actually improves with each viewing. Apart from the above, the movie is also interesting in that it is from the German viewpoint (and made by Germans). The acting is superb and the scenes realistic.

But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them.

133,2 September 2002,kyle_c,10, **** out of ****,"Wolfgang Petersen's landmark submarine film is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The ability to to create tension and suspense equals or surpasses a great deal of Hitchock's work, and the drama at the level of the individual is handled as well as any war film has ever done so.  The story is simple - it follows the story of a German U-Boat on patrol for British convoys, focusing on the Captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and a war correspondent (Herbert Gronemeyer), who has come along to report on the war.  We view the film from a view that is as close to being on a real submarine as you can get, and we identify with these men.  Realizing that these individuals who we sympathize with are the enemy is what makes such a powerful anti-war message, much in the way that ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" did.

In a lucky chance it goes hand in hand with the story, the actors, technique and last not least the music that approximate this. As a child I watched Star Wars in cinema (though I wasn't allowed to, I went in there with my father) and in a blink of a second I was sure that it was the best film of the universe. I don't know if I kept my mouth shut even for a second. Today it relativized a little bit, but a film that touches me at best for most of the term is outstanding in my view. I think I can only say something to the atmosphere of this film when I made my military service. Now I got a slight idea of what those poor men went through. All they said and thought seems so realistic. Heroic behavior occurred maybe at the beginning but that was kept them out of mischief during the turn and as far the submarine sank we came to see the characters of humans in extreme situations. On the other hand there was an inhuman and megalomaniac system that was far away, though, but reached with it's cold fingers into the last corner of the boat and the soldiers had to face the music the Nazis engaged. The outer circumstances that describe the time remind me of the master work Tin Drum and I just believe that the description is well. The music is congenial. All in all it is an intense warning.

People would be wrecks mentally as well as physically after some time and having veterans like Clark Gable or Curd Jürgens on board was simply not possible. And the subs in other movies, like the 2 before mentioned were so relatively clean and nice as they never were.

The inexperienced crew will carry out their laborious and mundane duties in cramped quarters as they await to go into action for their Fuhrer. The sub becomes the prey as it dives to extreme depths to silently await their possible death via bombarding depth charges. The U-boat fleet has already begun to take heavy loses.

I cannot imagine it being cut, much less dubbed. I can only say that I found it compelling drama, though everyone I know who has seen it has been male, and it may be that this film has particular meaning to those who have at least to consider the possibility that they may one day be required to fight in a war. The British have always been able to distinguish between honourable and dishonourable German fighting units, but the acting in Petersen's film is of such a quality that you really care what happens to these people (and I speak as someone whose father fought against them). The feeling of being part of a U-boat crew that is one moment the hunter and the next moment the hunted, the elation and the fear of combat, the heightened sense of self-awareness, the questioning of one's role, and, above all, the ultimate futility of war are all powerfully brought home. The extraordinary German sense of discipline is evident throughout (helping to explain why it required the combined efforts of The British Empire, The Soviet Union and the United States to defeat Hitler's forces) but it is a discipline infused with respect and intelligence. This is a wonderful piece of filmmaking which I would recommend to anyone. Just make sure you see it in the original German.",

158,11 July 2011,spamobile,10, Just the best movie ever,"Just the best movie ever. Not because it is well made from start to finish but because of the characters in it. Even if you don't like war movies this is just in a league of it's own and a must see. As a youngster I read the book before it was a movie. It was something like 600+ pages of boredom, day to day life on board of a U-boot, and only like 50 pages of sh.... in your pants action. So why is so much boredom so good? Simple, I believe it reflects real life on board. It's not about Nazi saluting hero's chasing and torpedoing boats left right and center, no, it's about ordinary people trying to do a job, a nasty job, and being scared sh...less at times doing so. It's based on a true story, a story about life on the line. The movie is absolutely fabulous. The characters are very strong and extremely well played by the on international level relative unknown actors. The journalist, you see the fright on his face if it get's tough. The Captain, strong character, determined, calculated, trying to be strong in the face of danger, but ultimately if you read his face between the lines, he's just as scared as all of them. There is one character, one of the officers, that is the coolest of them all, but, also he come to near breaking point. They all show you life, real life, girlfriends at home, wives at home, loners, career man, victims who would like nothing else as tend to their garden at home, so, real people out there having to do an awful job. The movie is so well made that it's nearly ""smell TV""! You can ""smell"" the fear, the stench of lack of ventilation, the stores, the salty sea air. You should ideally see this in German. I am lucky to understand some German so can follow it mostly without the subtitles but even if you have to read the subtitles, the characters just need to be German, it's a part of the atmosphere. I've seen a dubbed version as well and characters get lost in translation (also the subtitles are not the best representation of what is actually said). Compare this movie with U-571, 5x as high budgets, don't get me wrong, a good movie, but they've stolen parts of Das Boot and is really fake as a movie with weak characters. Das Boot, when you see it in bad weather, OK, CGI is not the strongest point of the movie, Das Boot is actually pretty fake, but don't forget it's not the best funded movie, but it does not detract of what this movie is worth, a 10+++.",
159,21 June 2012,wm-girvan,10, Sub of the Day: Plenty of meat and no cheese,"A lot of war films are heavy on patriotism. This one isn't, and that's what makes it special. Set in 1941, the film follows a German U Boat Captain and his crew in their mission to seek and destroy Allied forces convoys in the Atlantic. The Captain we learn, despises his political masters but as a career sub-mariner he ruthlessly adheres to the chain of command. The captain may view the crew as cogs in his machine but we get to know them as they spend their time cooped up together. The film really focuses on how various crew members cope with the extreme pressure situations that arise out of the captains' decision making. It is this human element that gives the film a timeless quality, it never feels dated and it also enables the viewer to really connect with the emotions that the captain and his crew are experiencing. In fact, it feels so real that you can almost feel the salt spray on your face as the boat races through the waves at full speed. Watch this one, you won't forget it.",

Jürgen Prochnov is magnificent as the captain of the submarine.

Yes, the Nazis were a force that needed to be defeated in order for civilization to survive. That fact understood, this film reminds the audience of the ultimate inhumanity and immorality of war. The fact that I, as an American audience member, found myself sympathizing not with the crew's (they, the ""other"" side) cause, but with their humanity is a testament to the power of film.  I just saw the director's cut of this fine film today and it reinforced and enhanced what I already had experienced the first time I became immersed in this film's narrative.  Gritty, well acted and written, claustrophobic, agonizing, tragic and utterly believable, Das Boot is simply one of the finest war films ever made.

You'll find yourself so immersed in the story that you'll feel like you are in the U-boat with them. This is an incredible movie and deserves more praise; the action is so suspenseful and nothing can prepare you for the ending. It will leave you biting your nails as you hear the sonar get close and closer to the hopless Germans inside their submarine. This is a must watch and should't be unnoticed. Its not heroic like Saving Private Ryan it is almost a patient film and if you give it a chance you'll have a movie experience like no other. Absolute masterpiece.,
173,13 March 2004,angryman_45,10, Absolutely Fantastic,"This is, perhaps, the best war film ever made. This may seem to be a little over the top, considering its opposition, but I feel that what this film lacks in special effects is more than made up for by the depth of its characters and the sheer claustrophobic suspense of the final hour. Das Boot is a very faithful adaptation of the original book (which is fantastic as well), and is best viewed in its original German, but with English subtitles (assuming you are not German!). As a proud resident of Great Britain, you can understand how easy it is to hate the members of the U-boat fleet for what they did to so many crews in our Merchant Navy. Despite this, it is easy to contemplate how terrible an experience life in a U-boat was. After having watched this masterpiece, I felt (and still do feel) that the sheer boredom and terror of U-boat life was far worse than that experienced by allied surface crews.  This is not meant to disrespect anyone, but is meant to provide an accurate comparison.Other War films about the Battle of the Atlantic (e.g. ""The Cruel Sea"", ""In Which We Serve"" & ""Sink the Bismark') are based almost entirely from the Allied perspective, and almost all Germans are portrayed as cold-blooded murderers. Das Boot is unique among movies of its genre in that it is based entirely around the Germans, but also that it does not portray any side to be morally superior. Das Boot's main theme seems to be the futility of war itself. The acting throughout is superb, and the set is highly effective at communicating the claustrophobia, cold and stench of the inside of a submarine. The soundtrack is uniquely chilling and thrilling, and simply adds to the rich feeling and accuracy of the plot. There have been far too few films made about the U-boat crews during the Second World War, but since Das Boot, it seems as though no others are necessary. This film is absolutely fantastic, and richly deserves its rating of 10 out of 10!!!",
174,16 November 2012,the_Forcer,10, The movie is not about WW2,"It isn't. It simply isn't. And that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as ""Apocalypse Now"" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare.",

Wolfgang Peterson did a fantastic job directing this movie, and the cast was top notch to carry this out the way it needed to be. Do not expect a high action movie, it has its action, but that is not what this movie is. Be ready for a movie that is long, drawn out, and sometimes tedious to watch, it is well worth every minute of it.

Going down backwards at 500ft and you know there is 10,000ft below you, with seawater pouring in through a burst cooling pipe and one main motor out of action. Existing for two weeks on kai or oxo because your stomach is rebelling against the elements. Laying in your bunk in ultra quiet routine with the sweat just dribbling down.

Basically, the crew of a German submarine in WWII goes on the hunt for British warships, and tries to survive counterattacks. The best part of the movie is the cinematography. Both the scenes of crashing and the claustrophobic scenes in the submarine are shot so that you constantly go from this feeling of being in the wild open, and being closed in on all sides. All the sets are gorgeous. The music is okay; sometimes it feels a little over-the-top on the synths, but it isn't too bad. I think the acting is good, though it's hard to tell with the foreign language. The characters are hard to keep track of - there's a few too many of them, and their names aren't distinct enough for my American ears. The real downside I found with this movie was the length - a lot of scenes go on too long, and a lot of them are the same thing presented over and over (the crew stumbling while the submarine shakes happened like 8 times).

Get the directors cut.,"For those of us ( majority ) who have never set foot on a modern submarine let alone a World War 2  SUBMERSIBLE it is not possible to comprehend the living hell these U-Boat crews endured - ( U-Boats had to surface frequently to replenish air, and use diesel engines to surface patrol and recharge batteries, therefore were not true submarines such as a modern nuclear sub today ).  This film comes closest of all offerings lately to show what it was really like. Horrific depth charging, poor food and air, were a U-Boats mans lot during the closing stages of the war in the Atlantic. The ""Happy Time"" was definitely over for U-Boats as Allied warships employed ASDIC underwater sonar and new depth charge techniques to inflict terrible losses on the U-Boat forces. Director Wolfgang Peterson went to great lengths to ensure as accurate as possible portrayal of the lives these men lived and it was a demanding if ultimately rewarding shoot for the cast. All the cast members do a fine job. If you thought U-571 was good (and it's not too bad )stack it up next to Das Boot and see just how good Das Boot really is.

The screenplay, melded together with superb acting has created an exceptional film. The atmosphere is at times choking, in its close quarters perception. The action is immense and terrifying. We become drawn into the world of these men, due to the realism employed. We, as the audience, are allowed to draw our own conclusions, without being beaten over the head or emotionally manipulated.

There are at least two film versions and 2 TV series. I prefer the director's cut film, which lasts about 3.5 hours. The cast show us exactly what life on a submarine meant. The boredom at sea when they can't find enemy ships and the terrifying attacks when faced with depth charges. The film is based on true experiences on submarine U-96 and a book, written by Lothar-Günther Bluchheim. He later criticized the film for not being totally true to the book. Well, so be it. The film is what it's all about and if you're really interested in life on a sub, you will just have to see it. If you suffer from claustrophobia, this film will undoubtedly make it worse.

I watched the Director's Cut DVD which has the 3 1/2+ hour version of the movie and though it took more than one sitting, I was never bored...even when feeling the boredom of the men on the submarine. When the movie starts, it gives a little one page of history and then flashes to a second screen with a statistic that puts it all in perspective right from the start, ""40,000 German sailors served on U-Boats during World War II. 30,000 never returned"". I am guessing this movie is a very authentic portrayal of life on a U-Boat, both technically and emotionally. As I was watching it, I didn't really think of the fact that these were German's, our enemies during the war, but just as men who had to deal with their situation. I think that's a credit to the director, Wolfgang Peterson. This is definitely the movie the best movie I've seen that shows what life on the submarine back then was like. Even seeing all the movies made since this one, didn't detract from the feeling of this movie. I think the sound was really well done in this movie. From the simple tinging of the sonar of the destroyer getting further away, then closer...to the creaking of the metal as it's pushed to the limits as the sub goes deeper and deeper. The parts where all played well, by actors that I'd never seen before. There's a USA version, ""The Boat"", that runs over an hour shorter. I'd guess that would just leave too much out.

And that it's shot in an actually submarine and not on a set, gives it such much more realism, you almost feel like one in the crew. The acting is also absolutely outstanding. It is a bit long though and you are pretty much trapped with the crew inside the boat during the entire duration of the film, until the film almost gives you claustrophobia (that's not really a negative since it serves the entire purpose of the movie). This is with out a doubt one of the best and most realistic war movies ever made. It's also always refreshing in some way to see a ww2 movie from the greman side. (I hope this isn't interpreted the wrong way, my disdain and disgust for the nazi regim can't be described in words).",

Although it is quite long with over 3 hours, it is worth seeing it and by the way, one never gets bored. Instead, tension is built up throughout the entire film with outstanding acting of Jürgen Prochnow first of all and Herbert Grönemeyer and rest of the ""crew""!!! It is really a must see film. I am not only saying it because I am half German myself, but because it is a second world war movie that doesn't focus on who are the good and who the bad. Its all about the people in the submarine trying to survive, far away from political attitudes. The ending could not be better, its simply a film of my taste. Its just so disappointing that current German film industry can't manage to do such great work again, except of last year's ""Der Untergang""!!!!!",

It does not take one side or the other, but rather allows the audience to make up its own mind. This is especially true considering that Das Boot is a German film about a German U-Boat crew set in World War 2. The German sailors aren't portrayed as villains nor are their actions glorified. Rather they are hard- working men who fought out of love for their country. They were united by their loyalty to each other and to their country. Das Boot did a brilliant job at portraying the relationships that these men shared.",

It scored 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Writing for Petersen. But it did not get the foreign language film submission from Germany as they were going with German Film Award Best Picture winner: von Trotta's ""Die bleierne Zeit"". Petersen (who adapted a Buchheim novel for this one) made a very successful career out of this movie and worked with the likes of Clooney, Pitt, Wahlberg, Eastwood, Malkovich, Hoffman, Freeman, Ford, Oldman, Spacey and Close during his long career. Not many directors can say that about themselves. There are many known German actors in ""Das Boot"": Prochnow, Ochsenknecht, Grönemeyer (more known for his music actually), Wennemann (rip, looks a bit like De Niro), Hoenig, Semmelrogge and Otto Sander.

220,22 February 2015,JosephPezzuto,8, Reel Look: 'Das Boot',"""Hail and victory and sink 'em all!"" Director Wolfgang Petersen takes us on an epic, once-in-a-lifetime maritime adventure, set in the autumn some years before World War II came to a close and U-boats were still sailing(mostly below) the cold seas. An adaption of the eponymous 1973 novel by German author and painter Lothar-Günther Buchheim, the film was released in 1981, but is filmed in a time four decades its prior. 'Das Boot', or known in the U.S. as 'The Boat', which originally aired as a six-hour German mini-series and was shot in complete silence due to complications of getting sound equipment into the actual submarine, thus having the actors to lip-synch their dialogue in later, was the most expensive German film at the time. But does it's length outweigh it's story? Let's take a look. ",

I'm not sure it matters which one you watch but in the end, you will feel a little something for this German crew that has given their all...some so young,,,some not so young,,,all there to do their duty to their country (not necessarily their Fuhrer) and definitely to do their duty to their mates. Remarkable. A true testament to ALL submarine crews at any point in the history of their service, they share a remarkable code of honor and bravery that I personally know I could never hack.

227,8 July 2009,bluesman-20,10, The Cold Deep sea and fear.,Das Boot is one of those rare war movies that actually makes you feel like you are in that sub serving with the crew. The Story deals with a Veteran Captain with a mostly green crew in the last days of the Atlantic war. It is 1943 and the war has turned against Germany of all the U-Boats setting out they sail with a green crew and a experienced Captain who knows the Undersea battles are not as Glorious as the propaganda machine makes it out to be. it is one of fear and tight spaces and horrid sounds that the sub makes as it dives. It is of the uncertain that you may never see the light again or go home. He knows That Hitler and Goering and Gobbels are madmen but still this is his country and it has asked him to go to war and he does so but in time he loses the patriotic luster and he is actually angry that these young men are being sent to die. The film is full of cat and mouse scenes with destroyers going against the sub and almost destroying them. You feel the fear and terror as the sub creaks and the depth charges explode. The Film was adapted from the novel DAS BOOT written by a navel war reporter who served aboard a sub. The Script is a faithful adaption of that thrilling yet grim novel and the screenplay captures the mood perfectly it is relentless. The Directer's Execution of the screenplay is almost flawless. In The Genre of War movies there are only a few war movies that stand out just because they are so realistic Saving private Ryan and Band of Brothers come to mind and now Das Boot joins that rank of unforgettable war films.,

It showed what I would feel without actually being a submariner, a realistic portrayal of what it must have been like to be a U-Boat crewman during WWII. It is completely believable, draws you into its claustrophobic insides with a magentism that is rarely portrayed well in movies of this genre.  For anyone with an interest in WWII, submarines or marine combat in general, this movie is well worth owning.

Unlike Americans, Brits, or Russians any German celebration of their accomplishments during World War II would be deemed as glorifying villains. As a result other films about World War II come out on a yearly basis while German films on the subject could probably be counted on your hands. But some directors have managed to figure out ways to present the themes of the time or the subjects in a way that fails to offend. Lars Von Trier's The White Ribbon addressed the mindset that led to the Nazi state while Downfall showed Hitler as the insecure child he truly was (and gave us an internet meme for the ages).

Very harrowing, tough, uncompromising war film, not Hollywood-like at all.  It doesn't feel like there's any guarantee that anyone will survive.  I don't think the film would work at all remade as a slick CGI-fest, like Petersen makes these days.  Despite the near four hour length of the director's cut, the film never drags, and sets up a relentless pace and a very uncomfortable, queasy feeling right from the start.  I thought the camerawork by frequent Paul Verhoeven DP Jost Vacano was good, as were all of the performances, and the score by Klaus Doldinger.

244,21 December 2009,nodialogue,10, perfect illusion with some thrill of authenticity,"Back in the day I saw this movie on the big screen which pulls you into the story for the darkness in the cinema is real. Das Boot is one of the few movies going 3hours+ that is always entertaining. The perspective is very clean, you see the action unfold through the eyes of the war correspondent on the boat. This war correspondent is a person in the real world, the story is autobiographic. As a spectator your level of knowledge is the knowledge of the people on board, this is how the suspense lasts all those three hours. Adding to the suspense even more is the use of sounds which are naturally dominant in submarine without any windows, no visual connection to the outside world when under sea. What sets this film apart is also the variety and large number of characters portrayed as their thought and feelings show by their action and faces, Maybe comparable to ""12 angry men"" . Most of the time you do not know their names, maybe their job on the submarine. Nevertheless I predict that any viewer can identify any man on board. I recommend watching this film German with subtitles for non-speakers for the military way of speaking is accurate, I assume a foreigner would get this as well, it adds to the authenticity. Clearly the film centers around the submarine which by its technology determines all activities, the action and most important the roles the people find themselves in as soldiers. These roles are their lives as soon as they leave the port. Clearly the submarine comes first, the people second, the machine is their means survival and weapon to kill others as well. As for the Nazi ideology the submarine also serves as a refuge from the nazi-society on land. Another core conflict of the men on board is they need to kill fellow seamen. The film does a good job in making the viewer understand this drama without ever resorting to some style of argumentation, it is all in the pictures. As for the story there is no obvious red line. The submarine follows military orders and reacts to enemy attacks. No single crew-member could possibly interfere with this. It is finest cinema, you are pulled into the screen, you have the illusion of darkness, even smells. The film is a perfect illusion with some thrill of authenticity. This film never attempts to tell you anything, because you are in the submarine like everyone else.",

Having just seen the cheap imitation ""U-571"", I have to say that it does not at all compare to the original German subtitled version of ""Das Boot"".  I never found ""Das Boot"" at all tedious despite its considerable length; on the contrary, every moment seemed to submerge the viewer's mind deeper into the horrific reality of the film, and into the subconscious of the captain and his crew as they faced the grim reality of the odds against their survival.  (I agree with whoever it was that called it ""claustrophobic"", but that was also one of the horrors which afflicted the senses prevalent in this film.)  Kudos to Jurgen Prochnow, a remarkable actor in a difficult and emotionally demanding, psychologically draining role.  I enjoyed reading through the insightful user comments of this film; so rarely does one find so much elucidation on the crucial elements which make a film work or not work.  Those of us who have seen and appreciated ""Das Boot"" are pretty much unanimous in our praise!  But this is a film that the squeamish and faint-hearted should avoid.  My rating is 10/10.",

Set in 1942, the film sees a German submarine fleet engaged in the ""Battle of the Atlantic"" to destroy English shipping. German U-Boats have taken heavy losses, and the particular boat is seen trying to accomplish impossible and questionable missions. Towards the end, after being badly hit, there is desperation to reach the surface and get back home, which they do manage, but the film ends with our ""heroes"" being bombed at port.

The fact that you are almost rooting for Germans to survive is quite interesting, the claustrophobia is quite effective, and the moments with explosions, especially the ending, are good viewing. The West German language film is available in the original two and half hour version, the three and half hour director's cut, and there's even the four hours and fifty-three minute uncut version.

That is what makes this film as important as it is riveting. You will experience what life was like for those who served on submarines during the war, many of whom were just teenagers. It was a life lived in dim lighting for months at a time. A life lived in close, cramped quarters with no privacy whatsoever. A life where anxiety and fear were ever-present. A life spent wondering when, or if, you would see your loved ones again. Whether or not you are a World War II enthusiast, do yourself a favor and see this film at least once in your lifetime.",

I now feel that my simple posting was perhaps not clever or detailed enough.I now feel very silly so, to prove i can talk about das boot in a more intellectual way, please indulge my hurt pride and read on. I honestly don't enjoy das boot for the captain alone. I have loved this film for a number of years now, i have loved it for many different reasons. Give me a chance to explain them. Please keep reading even if i do not express myself very well. I mentioned how in charge the captain seems to be and how this gives him sex appeal. However it is far deeper than that. Das boot is almost unique in that it is a totally male dominated film. I love how the men talk freely to each other about anything and everything without a woman to interrupt them. I like the way they interact with each other, or not as the case may be. Outwardly das boot is cold and stark and cruel. All those people locked together, forever in each others way. Inwardly the film has a soft and gentle side. One of great emotions. Fear and loneliness. It even has a spiritual side, or at least i think so. The man who has command of a situation like this has a special appeal. I get so involved that i want to mother some of the crew, befriend some of them and be the lover of others. The whole thing would be ruined if a woman came on board. Iam a woman and its like listening and viewing out of bounds territory.

Das Boot's running time consists of drawn out suspense sequences interspersed with down-time, where the crew takes measures to deal with their boredom. Considering how entertaining these down-time sequences were I can certainly imagine Das Boot successfully running longer than it does. The suspense sequences are excellent as well. There are so many things that can go wrong on a submarine and Das Boot uses them all in fantastic intersecting patterns. The sub is trying to hide from a destroyer and drops down to the deep. So deep, it seems, that the pressure will crush the boat like a tin can. The crew strain themselves in their tortured anxiety. Boom! A depth charge rocks the sub. Das Boot is filled with moments like this. A real U-Boat interior was used in Das Boot. The camera work in this extremely limited space is profound. It dances around the men as they bustle and sweat, forming every shot perfectly. At first I was impressed with the interior motion of the set as the boat rocked back and forth. Later on the use of water gushing from every direction set a new standard for realism. Complementing the realistic set are the actors. Wonderful performances all around. The actors were able to convey an immense amount of strain in stressful situations where they were required to remain quiet. Man is a weak and fragile creature. However he is able to erect complex systems that allow him to manipulate his environment with extreme force. A submarine is one of those systems. However this is a double-edged sword because when that system fails and man is once again reduced to his weak and fragile state it can be impossible to rebuild it, especially when he's stuck on the bottom of the Strait of Gibraltar. The film's finale is the superlative representation of the stress that the U-Boat crew faces. They are running out of oxygen, there are injured men, enemies above them, their depth goes off the meter, water is flooding in, and the damn boat won't work like it's supposed to! Horrible death seems imminent. However through great resourcefulness and hours of hard work the crew are able to see the sun once more. What a glorious feeling that is, for the audience as well as the characters. Das Boot is not about a cast of characters. It is about a boat. Maybe that's why it doesn't matter so much that the men whose story we are watching fight for Hitler. Das Boot is a near masterpiece worthy of being rewatched many times despite its great length.",

He wasn't on a U-boat, mind you, but he shared a few stories with me about what being a sailor or soldier in the German Forces of the time was like, and I was struck by how ""normal"" he made it sound. They weren't fanatical Nazis, these men. Just those who were called upon to fight in a war that most of them didn't want to fight.

This film shows how tough, dangerous and claustrophobic life in submarine can be. Many scenes are so tight and claustrophobic that they make viewer feel uncomfortable. Also I quickly felt for the crew despite them fighting for the wrong side. Acting is overall great most notably J. Prochnow. Music is also very good. Only glitch in this over three hour long film (there is also TV series which is longer) is a little cliché the most outstanding heroes of the film are not Nazis, captain is anti Nazi. I understand that it was made to make them more sympathetic, because I would hardly root for Nazi. But if they made heroes more morally ambivalent it would be more interesting.

275,29 January 2003,mynameismud,9, one of the most important war films ever!,"For those who haven't had the privalege of viewing this movie,simply need to.Its a different and truly compelling look at World War II through the eyes (and ears) of crewmen aboard a German U-boat.Typically,big budget WWII epics in American cinema are almost always shown through the eyes of American soldiers,but this is a look at war from the German point of view (the film is also entirely in german and was made by a German Production team)and gives the viewer a new understanding of life in a submarine,and life in the midst of a great war.The film is not focused on Allies vs. Axis Powers or Americans vs. Nazis,its about all the basic conflicts in story-telling.Man vs. Man, Man vs. Nature, and Man vs. Himself.It's not just a bunch of Germans in a boat,its men fighting for survival and their country and trying to achieve personal glory and pride as war heroes.Their hopes are quickly shatterd as they suffer through extreme physical and psychological hardship in the claustrophobic containment of thier submarine.You begin to find yourself completely engulfed in the suspense as you view this film especially with the newly remixed soundtrack for the Director's cut which is also about a full hour longer.With A running time of about 3 hours and 48 min. i loved every second of it.Every performance is top notch especially that of the new Lt.Werner who I really enjoyed watching.He doesn't say a large amount,but his intense silences and facial features speak for him.The part of the hard,war worn Captain is masterfully portraid by Jurgen Prochnow and is also a true highlight of the film.This is also an extremely large achievement for director Wolfgang Peterson who's vision has created a true war classic and essential for any moviegoer.War movie fan or not,it is a must-see.Its look at people in a time of extreme pressure and fear puts you on the edge of your seat not wanting to turn away.I highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to read subtitles for almost four hours and experience the truly magnificent cinematic achievement that is ""Das Boot.""",

The film reflects the life in a German submarine in WWII without including any synthetic love stories and heroes capable of doing everything. The life in the film is as fast as it must be in a real submarine with some critical routines, lots of time to think and thrilling false alarms.

The film USES narrow scenes to achieve the atmosphere of a huge scene, known as the classic submarine film. With a group of ordinary soldiers in the war as the main character, it is a very realistic reproduction of a German submarine cruising in the Atlantic ocean during the second world war from the perspective of human nature: the narrow space allows the audience to fully enter the scene of the characters and feel their fear.

The tedium is part of the realistic portrayal of the U-Boat life but this was taken too far. To be sure, this stylistic choice was the right way to go, eschewing the overt excitement and action of other similar films. There are several things this film should be commended for: 1) the realistic submarine lifestyle portrayal, 2) the acting behind the distinct characters, 3) the claustrophobic tension and 4) the special effects. These all tie into each other to create a very immersive film that really shows what it was like to be in such an old submarine during World War II. All waiting, no glory.

With the vast majority of action confined to the submarine, 'Das Boot' has many intense moments with the claustrophobic nature of the surroundings heavily emphasised. There are several marvelous tracking shots that run up and down the submarine interiors and the constant sharp sounds of the watercraft provide an eerie reminder of just how far removed the crew are from land. Clocking in at over three hours long though, there are invariably lulls in the action and overall, the film feels like more of an episodic collection of melodramatic underwater events than an airtight narrative. Jürgen Prochnow's captain is also the only character we come to really know in any depth. What the film does very well though is paint its young Nazi characters as very human with all the love anxieties, fears and worries that young people have. Especially interesting is the way they are able to quickly switch from partying in their time off to being at attention during emergencies. The film is also topped off with a surefire memorable ending. 'Das Boot' might not offer the strongest narrative or characters out there, but it provides an experience like few other motion pictures with its graphic portrait of submarine life.",

I saw the english dubbed directors cut version with an extra hour of footage.  I normally prefer subtitles, but the dubbing on this movie did not distract me at all.  The movie centers around a Nazi submarine, its crew, and their attempt to survive in World War II.  This movie reaches out and pulls you in!  You can smell the foul odors of the submarine and feel the fear and excitement of the crew.  I highly recommend this movie!!!!",

327,8 May 2007,Roman-Nies,10, The human likeness,"I was reading the other comments and got confirmed that many movie fans still are astonished to find out that Hollywood movies are often too patriotic, that they lack realism and objectivity. In this case DAS BOOT impressed them in a way that meant the opposite of this all. Sometimes, it seems, one knows what is true, just take a look on it! What a discovery as well: Germans are humans as we are! A discovery for victims of propaganda? The result of the consumption of hundreds of simple knitted movies? One commentator wrote it is typical for the Germans to be critical and realistic in the approach of the own achievements. That could be one of the favourable results of history. But the danger is, that the wish to make it everybody right, serves to make it wrong or at least to exaggerate the facts. May be the Allies have a lot to work off too? One German WWII Submariner commented, that such a wild orgy/party as in the opening scene of the film, was not possible. He never experienced such an absence of discipline in his service time. But he doubted only this part of the film and he was not everywhere during wartime. Some compared the film with Private Ryan. That one has also realistic scenes, but also unrealistic and very patriotic ones. I always wonder why writers or producers do not understand that a tool to make war movies come over more realistic is to show that the greatness of the victory comes from the greatness of the threat. If there is a strong opponent whom you have to overwhelm your challenge can be respected much more than in a duel with a weak idiot. Or maybe this is understood, but the audience would not like to take it as that. In Hollywood movies the heroes usually fight against stupid fools who are without exception barbaric and evil to the bone. Such movies were produced in Germany during the Nazi-regime. Psychologists say that this serves to make a small one bigger if he superelevates his feat and himself. The Nazis knew that they needed propaganda to tarnish their lies and evil plans. And Hollywood? Is the answer money and entertainment more important than sympathy for more accuracy and depth? And if suddenly there is an exception to that movie-policy, all people are enthusiastic and they feel ""we want more like this!"" But the award goes to....",

The story builds really well showing the Captain as always being the wise man and the calm strategist. It sure also has all those risk takings any great military leaders have to endure. Watching the director's cut version, I see this movie completes itself by also depicting all the contrasting experiences such as the 'collision games' and the supply vessel. The acting feels just enough. Here I see how Juergen Prochnw establishes his acting prowess. One thing about the acting is that most of the actors have quite the same expressions in almost all kinds of situation.",

It strives to replicate the confined, gruelling monotony of being on one of these subs and it does so effectively but it also places the viewer in that unideal situation to share.

The performances from all cast members are believable and you can practically taste the air inside the damp and crowded sub. Men who would rather be elsewhere are sent out to sea again and again to face an enemy well able to defend himself. The tensions rise, nerves are shattered and all human life is here.

Bad grammar aside, the sets are incredible, the fact that the actors and scenes were filmed in the order that they occur (so the facial hair is real), the sickly pale looks of the actors, living in the sub for hours and days on end, and the gripping humanistic drama of sailors in Der Fuhrer's Navy, this rather long movie is definitely worth the time spent. Can't say enough about it.

The director strives to show the claustrophobic conditions that the crew had to endure -- crammed as they were, into what one feels is basically a floating coffin. There is no doubt that care went into to the making of this film. The weakest part, however, is the script. One never feels that the writing rises to much more than going through the motions.

Make it one of the first DVDs you rent or (better yet) buy.  It is the  total experience, complete with tremendous sound effects that create the tension and paranoia of being in a submarine that is viciously and randomly bombed from above.  Never have I heard scarier or more realistic use of sound.  And as for the acting, it's a surprise that Jurgen Prochnow hasn't become a bigger star in the U.S.  His presence as the revered Captain of this U-Boat is something to behold. Wolfgang Petersen went on to direct action films in America, such as ""In the Line of Fire"" and ""Air Force One"", but none were as intensely realistic as this one.  Both technically and historically, ""Das Boot"" is an experience you will not forget.  Luckily, most DVDs contain the restored, re-mastered 3-hour+ Director's Cut, and, as many previous reviews have mentioned, it is never boring.

To get to know how I felt about other ones...I did like ""K-19"", the ""Hunt for Red October"" was alright, and I thought ""U-571"" and ""Crimson Tide"" were almost garbage. In most of these movies it makes living on a submarine seem close to paradise except for the battles when ""Das Boot"" shows you that it's a lot like being in jail in one retrospect. The smells are horrible, the food is worse, and there's no privacy whatsoever let alone places to move around to and fro. It shows you how hardy some of these enlisted men are that get stuck into this needed duty and how they can be heroic for putting up with these untidy conditions. I also couldn't believe this movie was made in 1981, it didn't seem outdated at all like a lot of movies from that time period are and I surely would've said the early 90's if I had to guess without any prior knowledge. If you watch the director's cut it can be strenuous at times to sit through since it is well over 3 hours and some parts are rather slow...but by all means it is still worth it to stay through the end. The acting is sensational and the pure raw energy that is exerted through some of the actors' facial expressions is enough to leave anyone speechless.

359,15 July 2022,brianberta,7, A very good war film.,"This is a really good film which flies by surprisingly quickly, in spite of its nearly 3.5 hour runtime. I must confess though that it leaves me somewhat cold since it falls in the 'characters feel like props amidst the action/suspense set pieces' category. With the exception of the Captain and (to a smaller extent) Johann, most of the other characters (the Chief Engineer, the 2nd Watch Officer, and Ullmann) are given only one character trait to stand out, and the movie doesn't even do much with that character trait to begin with. Also, Werner, who I think is intended to be the main character, is easily the blandest of the bunch. In spite of this, I do enjoy the movie quite a bit as, judging the film through the lens of the suspense and claustrophobia it creates, it's pretty fantastic. The sounds and visuals (the radar showing the ship's depth, the ship creaking from water pressure, the darkness of the cabin) work in harmony to make the film technically outstanding. The highlight of the film is when their ship faces a British fleet and are forced to dive well below the sub's test depth. The various large and small scale set pieces within that sequence are highly memorable and the conclusion clinches it as one of the greatest stretches of cinema I've ever seen. I also like how you never get the sense that the U-boat is at an advantage against the enemy ships. After all, the opening text says all that's needed to be said about how the crew was basically sent on a suicide mission. From what we see, their boat seems rather flimsy given how often they have to take shelter and only by carefully sneaking up to an enemy ship will they have a chance of sinking it. Overall, I have a ton of respect for this film's technical craft. I just wish it would grab me more on an emotional level. I might watch the mini series someday though as it may do a better job with that.",

While they mostly all follow a formula (submarine is damaged in an attack or dives to avoid an attack and goes too deep below design limits, people on the submarine work to get it fixed before it's too late, etc), and this one does follow that formula, it does it well and with interesting twists and turns and humanity. Being a U-boat, the expected outcome is destruction of the submarine by sinking. The actual outcome is different and somewhat unexpected when it happens, or it was for me. That outcome may have something to do with the controversy of a submarine full of Germans being nominally ""the good guys."" (That is, you're in the submarine with the often young or likable Germans, except maybe the Nazi code officer was a jerk, so that's who you root for, even though you know the country they were fighting for was doing evil things then.)

The German film comes up short in comparison to some of these, none of which needed 150 minutes to tell their story. I'm particularly reminded of THE ENEMY BELOW (1957), a superb drama on some of the same subject matter.

373,23 July 2001,jajambojajambo,10, (spoiler?) Excellent movie any way you look at it...,"A good story which tells us that there are nothing to gain from a war. Everybody loses, especially the ones who actually fought and perished. Although the original 6-hr series would probably show better characters development, the 3.5-hr director's cut does a fine job.  We get to know many of the characters and feel for them. The Kapitän is a rock!  Talk about a tough dude!  Yet he is compassionate and he handles crisises very well.  He does not always agree with the propaganda spread by the Nazi, and he's not afraid to show contempt. However, he knows his role as a captain, and he must follow orders given from above -- even if it meant certain death. The best scene is when he felt sorry the drowning British sailors.  I guess the Germans in general are a bit apologetic about WWII, and it is shown through the captain's emotion. We can also notice the changes in the sailors throughout the journey.  From boys to men, and from solders blinded by excitement and propaganda to men realising what the war really meant. As many of us have thought that the German subs were invincible, we were shown how, in contrary, easy they were detected and attacked.  And remember this: 40.000 were to board the U-Boats, 30.000 never returned.  (pretty chilling). I give this movie a 10/10.",

375,10 September 2010,idontknowiknowthatidontknow,1, can this movie be any more boring?,"I had to watch this film along with U-571 for a world history class report back in 2001. I checked out this film at my local library. It was three VHS tapes. I don't remember much about the film. I do remember it was very boring and trite. I remember it went into detail about the submariners' lives during the war and many dark shots of the submarine during the night. Other than that, I don't remember anything else. I didn't just rate this film a low score because it was meticulous and long. Many films of the kind can be good if they provide an interesting plot, story or something that makes the picture stand out in one's mind other than tedious boredom. For example I thought the movie Heat was boring for the most part, but there was a major scene in the movie that saved it completely: the bank robbery scene. That scene was probably one of the most intense and expertly executed action sequences I have ever seen. Another example is The American. It was another pretty boring movie except for a scene in the middle and its devastating ending. Those two scenes, and especially the ending, not only salvaged the movie, but took it to a completely new height. However this movie in my memory had just a documentary type bore throughout. I have to say I'm not sure if I paid attention throughout the whole movie, and I probably have to watch it again just to make sure about my opinion. Anyways, I remember watching U-571, another submarine movie, and it was a lot better. Not just because of the action sequences but because it was actually a thrilling ride. I felt as if I was one of the crew members on board. I don't understand why so many people have such a high opinion of this movie, but I will be sure to review the movie again just to make sure.",

379,26 June 2011,rdukeesq,9, so good I rooted for the Nazis,"So I watched 1981's Oscar nominated ""Das boot"", directed by Wolfgang Peterson. This is Peterson's masterpiece and his most lauded film. So is it a classic, well let me just say Heil, Hitler. Wait what was that, yes this movie had me rooting for the Nazis, something I never thought I would do, and something that probably just killed my parents. This movie starts a little slow, but once the men are on the u-boat (submarine), it becomes one of the most fascinating and realistic films I have ever seen. This movie was filmed over the course of a year, and allowed the men to naturally grow thin, pale, grow beards, and even really get injured. Even the injuries which really occurred as the actors were thrown around the set, were included in this film. ""Das Boot"" is emotional, gripping, well written, and wonderfully directed, what else can I say. ""Das boot"" is considered to be one of the best films ever made and I would concur with that notion. This film should have broad appeal ranging from women to men, and every cross section within the primary sexes. It is German, with subtitles, but like many movies is dubbed, though I have never liked a dubbed version of anything I have ever seen outside of cartoons. To discuss the plot like many films I review, is to do this film an injustice, the audience is always better off when a good story isn't spelled out for them before they see it. So just watch it sometime you should dig it, and maybe you to will find yourself rooting for the bad guys. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",

My only regret here was that I was only able to see the dubbed version, and not the preferred subtitled one, and as such, my review of the acting will not be complete as I would have been unable to judge the voiced expressions of the actors. While the dubbed voices were not great, I admittedly have heard much worse. Nevertheless, DAS BOOT happens to be one of the best (naval) war movies of all time, and arguably the best submarine movie to this day. The story is an engrossing and compelling one, and viewers will find themselves totally immersed in it for most of the running time. Wolfgang Petersen does a fine job of telling this story, and deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Director (1981).",

It is an incredibly acted film, with a simple but empathetic and touching story. The ending is brutal and apotheosic. The effects are stylish and elegant, even to this day the film looks very well done: the submarine, the exteriors, the explosions, the floods, absolutely everything looks real. The only problem for me was that the version I watched is too long: more than three and a half hours. That's too much for a movie in which not much happens, not much dialogue revolves around a plot, and it happens in nearly one location. Maybe if I had watched the two and a half hour version it would have been easier to enjoy, but even though I'm used to movies that run longer than 160 minutes, this one didn't suit the length.

409,20 June 2002,bolson29,10, Quiet moments rival the hectic ones in this brilliant movie.,"As is often the case in good war movies, the quiet moments between skirmishes were among the best the movie had to offer, a big compliment for a movie with many great moments.  Among them: a) moments at the officers mess table, particularly the chief engineer and correspondent sharing a moment over photos from home;  b) the correspondent's scenes of with young Ullman who misses his new fiancee;  c) anytime the captain is at the periscope or above deck with binoculars searching for convoys, his eyes tireless and sunken in a weathered, weary face.  I watched the director's cut DVD, which runs 3-1/2 hours, but is worth every minute.  If you haven't seen it, don't read the chapter titles and spoil anything for yourself, just watch the whole movie first!  The last comment is on the realism of the set - the film was shot with closed walls of the replica U-Boat; this adds to the sense of claustrophobia and close quarters in tense moments.  Living in Chicago, I cannot wait to tour the U-Boat at the Science Museum for the first time since fourth grade.  I will have a whole next outlook next time through it.",

This movie is the closest that I have ever seen to actually conveying the spirit, the sense of hopelessness and helplessness, that is always present in the reluctant warrior's life. The presentation of ""Number 1,"" as the dogmatic idealist, is superb, a perfect counterpoint to the real life horrors this movie so accurately portrays. Its pacifist theme so closely mirrors my own thoughts - now - on war and its meaning, that I find myself watching it over and over again. I own the theatrical version, the director's cut in widescreen dubbed, and the director's cut in the original german. I watch one of these at least 4 times a year, and always get something new from it. It is a tremendously textured film, and the layers of meaning, even allegory, that can be laid on it are onionlike.

If you've seen U-571, then Das Boot blows it out of the water.  The director was trying to give you a sense of what it was like being under the ocean blue for several months at a time.  It shows that war is not glorious but just a fault in our human nature and that we were designed to destroy and kill each other.

I was so engrossed in the story and finally getting an honest look at the human beings that were reluctanly fighting as part Hitler's of war machie.

Wonderfully shot, eerie compelling drama, very real human emotions, (even given the nature of the whole Nazi/Master race subject matter here) and then...that ""Commando Comics"" ending. For any non-Brits reading this, ""Commando"" was a series of WWII comic books for young boys that always made sure the 'nasty baddies' got their comeuppance in the end, usually in some typically gung-ho moment of literary redemption. What a shame it had to end like that. All that effort, all that time (3.5 hours), spent empathising with the crew and especially with U-96, feeling their fear and their worries and then a random US fighter plane comes out of nowhere, kills them all and sinks the sub when it's home and dry.

421,26 December 2011,nunoaraujoduarte,8, movieinthepark.blogspot.com,"German for The Boat. From Wolfgang Petersen, the director of Troy and Poseidon, more than two months in a German submarine, describing the whole everyday inside the U-boat, seen from the eyes of a correspondent, Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer). It's astonishing. Believe me it's amazing how such a movie can turn out to be so breathtaking, consisting of 293 minutes, almost all of them inside the submarine. Of course, it's painful to watch it in a row, I won't incite you to do it, you always have the later release with less 2 hours but I don't know if the quality remains. Anyway, the movie contains all the incidents of a trip taken by the crew of a German U-boat during the WW2, firstly in the Atlantic Ocean, with very few incidents, filling the whole crew with boredom and disease, except for a couple of encounters, that eventually don't end up as wanted. Finally, when returning home, a message from Berlin orders them to go to Italy. Obviously, going to Italy forced them to attempt to pass the straight of Gibraltar, and that's when things get real. The end is brutal. I'm not giving any information to avoid spoilers but I guarantee you that the end alone makes this movie recomendable, despite it's runtime. The acting s actually good, unlike what I was expecting, as happened with the image, including very interesting shots of the submarine at the surface, underwater, and also in battle.

441,21 May 2017,bbird-29353,3, Inaccurate Realism,"Applauded by many for how realistic it is for submarine life. But I was surprised at how sloppy obvious details were overlooked. I lost track of how often the sub was in 10 - 15 foot seas and the next scene (elapsed time < 5 minutes), the water was totally flat. Or, vice-versa. In one scene the captain is tracking a destroyer in heavy seas. His periscope is constantly awash in waves, obscuring his view. Instead of ordering the sub to rise a meter or two, he maintains depth. Of course, the destroyer almost rams him. Would a real seasoned captain have made this mistake? Elsewhere in the movie, the sub receives several radiograms on the activity of other subs. Yet, he almost collides with another sub far out into the Atlantic. No radio communication between the two? In the final scene, two fighters attack the port with machine guns.

Great suspense sequences allows you to experience the fear and nervousness of these submariners as they are chased through the Atlantic by British destroyers.  The film gives you a whole new definition of claustraphobia with specially designed sets and hand-held cameras.

People think of war as a clean thing, a battle between good and evil, and good always triumphs. No. War is a dirty, brutal thing, that takes innocent men and women on both sides and turns them into killers. It puts images into their minds that will haunt them forever. Nowhere is this demonstrated better than Das Boot. For the new crew members, war is a glorious thing, and you will always triumph if the Führer leads you. The veterans, however, see Hitler and the war for what they really are. And the new crew members learn this too, by experiencing war first hand. And the audience also sees what war really is. ",
447,21 February 2015,chip_cristian,10, Fake but wonderful,"Small tip: visit the Bavaria Film Studios in Munich. You can see there the real U-boat used in the movie and walk inside. Now, about the film let me get something straight: the Germans during WW2 were cruel, savage, with an raw unforgivingness character, mean, heartless and vengeful. I just watched a 5 hour long movie about a bunch of spiritual, loving, crying and compassionate Germans who wanted to save burning Englishmen from drowning. Now, I know there are many movies out there about how mean the Germans were and they felt the need to equal the balance but there are some historical facts that will contradict the movie: during WW2, there was something called ""doctrine"" and ""brain washing"" - something that the Germans of the 40's were very familiar with. Many of them really believed Hitler was doing the right and moral things and that they were purebred. Secondly, Germans were never captivated or even recognized the intelligence of the adversary due to their huge pride and ego (remember in the movie when the captain was amazed by the intelligence of the British); and third - it's totally science fiction to put the issue of saving your enemy from death in a TOTAL WAR. Besides the above ""minor"" issues, I loved the movie, the acting, and even if it was the longest film I ever watched (director's cut lasted 5 hours) I never got bored by this wonderful movie made before I was even born. The end, on the other hand, suggested the faith of the German war.",

This movie shows the second war by a perspective of a group of marines that have a hard mission. Staying inside a submarine for long time, giving and taking bombs. Like all movies of war, and in my opinion not different of the reality, the missions are pathetic. The attacks don't make much sense and usually the heroes are teenagers that don't' have a clue of the propose of what they are fighting for. If you like war movies and have planty of time, certainly Worth seeing!",
450,17 September 2019,fareedwattoo,9, (Misery and sufferings of humans in War),"No external factor has caused more harm to humans than they themselves. Since the very beginning war has considered been the must existing and cardinal part of human lives. Humans never stopped spilling blood, sometime for religion, sometime for land, sometime for prestige and sometime for nationalism. All of us chose exchange of blood for petty issues, lovers of God in the form of Crusades, the kings for pieces of lands to rule, some to maintain colonies to engulf natural resources of other fellow-beings and some in the modern world for the sake of nationalism. In all the forms, each time under different banners humans subdued humans.
In this movie, Wolfgang Peterson (director) tried to depict the miseries, sorrows, sufferings and agonies of those who suffered perniciously in the World War. The sordid war affected all the people without any difference on the both sides.
This movie revolves around a group of navy soldiers who were to live in a sub-marine for a specific time to destroy the opposite's vessels. Sufferings and suffocations of the crew and the viewer begins as the sub-marine dive into the water for the very first time. The stingy metal walls of the sub-marine where one can hardly move, the bunker where they sleep, the dining table where one hardly fits and all other places cause irremovable imprint on one's.
Many people have to suffer for the monstrous dream of a few bigots and warmongers. They live their lives in opulent palaces, having fresh beers, soft fresh breads, sleep in nicely woven clothes and served by uncountable servants. While in the pursuit of their dreams common-people live in dungeons, eat stale rancid food, take bath in sweat and sleep in blood with dirt surrounded by the piles of half damaged stinking bodies of their mates.
Morality, customs and norms of civilized society vanish from the instinct of veteran's minds. In the whole movie, no polite word of thanks, welcome or greeting has used. The rule of kill or get killed prevails in the battleground. Humans turn into friend and foes recognised on the base of uniform and flags instead of their morality and goodwill. Fires of bullets may stop on winning or losing the war but its effects haunt both the victorious and the losers until their last breath.
Therefore, we can conclude that this movie has successfully portrayed the impeccable picture of doleful and destitute people who suffered through war. Unbiased picture of war in this movie depicts the grim situation of the war torn people. Narrow walls of sub-marine, sultry atmosphere, high waves of sea and unfavourable weather has helped to portray the exact tormented situation. Either party of the war can win or lose it but humanity always loses.

The original cut was too short, the six hours of the TV mini series to long to watch in one evening, but the DR is perfect. What makes it even more special is the superb new soundtrack which sucks you inside the hull of the submarine giving you a claustrophobic time. The actors weren't allowed to see daylight during the shooting and really lived for the film so what  you see isn't only close to reality. What I like about the plot is you don't see the common ""ugly Germans"" and ""good allies"", but all soldiers are forced into their fate and nothing can help it. There is no vicious submarine crew but a handful of men crammed together in a tiny steel tube fearing the enemy as it fears them. If you watch the DVD, listen to the original German soundtrack and switch on subtitles if you like.",

This movie shows the terror of being trapped under sea in a submarine that easily will drown them slowly, and that the Germans had feelings too. All very new warfilms about the WWII is very one-sided and only cares about ""the poor Americans"". Well the Germans had choosed Hitler, and Hitler choosed War. Of course, those bloody Nazis was misslead by one of the worst and greatest dictators (and tyrant) ever encountered in history, so an interesting subject is taken in this wonderful movie. Who is evil? Is it the countrymen (the real Patriots, not always the soldiers), the Country or the man leading it. Well, thank god communism was gone forever in Germany after this, but the question is what is worst. Hitler or Communism... But by playing with the feelings of the soldiers, this movie is in its rightful place. Belonging at the top 100!

The cast is fantastic and the lead role of Captain is superbly played by Pronchow as is the role of Chief by the underrated ochschenket (forgive the spelling!). I am one of the few people who think the mini-series on TV is better then the movie and it is best to watch it with the subtitles as some of the dubbing totally alters the meaning of what the character is saying. A perfect example would be the speech given by Gronemeyer when all hope of getting back to the surface is apparently lost. In the dubbed version is sounds more like an American TV speech (i.e. ""they send us out in these boats blah, de, blah, de, blah""). What he is actually saying is sooooo much different and poignant ending with the (roughly translated) ""This is reality, real and big"". The BBC did an excellent job of translating the TV movie and I urge you to watch it. Rating 10/10 for the GERMAN movie and 7/10 for the dubbed version.",

By watching the film, I saw a vivid life in a German military submarine in the second world war. I was impressed that at such old time Germans could produce such fine craft already. There were a series of dangers and soldiers suffered from the contradiction of private affection and patriotism. Certainly all young boys grew up after several battles and fatal accidents. This film was shot from German view, so when we watched movies, we would be at the side of the Third Empire. But when their leader Hilter commanded their boat pass Gibraltar to reach a base in Italy, we would feel how cruel and evil the Third Empire was. The end was a tragedy. It was rather ironic. By the way, I liked the music a lot. To sum up, it is a pretty good movie. I believe that no matter if you are man or woman, you will like this military film. Supposing I have opportunity, I will like to watch Das Boot again and maybe more. P.S.So the actor who played Correspondent Herbert Grönemeyer is a well-known rock musician!

The great cast gave everything to the picture (for example, they were not allowed out in the sun during the shooting) and their transformation as it progresses into haggard, bearded, weary ghosts is startling and unsettling. Prochnow is stunning as the unnamed Captain; a man who has the respect of his crew yet is essentially alone, but the entire ensemble are brilliant - I especially like Wennemann (the chief engineer), Tauber (the navigator) and Hoenig (the radio-operator) all of whom give quiet, thoughtful, understated performances, very atypical in an epic movie filled with action. The eerily effective use of sound adds to the movie's tension, and there is brilliant claustrophobic camera-work by Jost Vacano. The depiction of the crew's struggles - alternating intolerable boredom with sheer terror when the alarm is raised, evading depth charges and destroyers, running dangerously deep to avoid detection, repairing the ship (literally everything breaks at some point), following suicidal orders - is the heart of the film.",
