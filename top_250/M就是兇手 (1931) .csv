0,16 January 2010,AlsExGal,9, Ahead of its time,This is a very interesting film on so many levels. It's interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time. Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture - Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place - what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding. Compare it with any American film from 1931 and you can't help but see the difference.,/
1,29 July 2005,Quinoa1984,10," Fritz Lang's (sound) masterpiece- a taut and quintessentially suspenseful story, and Lorre","The first time I saw M, by Fritz Lang, I almost didn't know what to make of it. I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances, the staging of the scenes, the locations, and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances. Then I saw it again, and a third time, and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany- it's a powerful statement about protecting our children (if you're looking at it as a ""message"" movie), but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven. Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements, and have such unconventionality of the times. Boiling down to this, M is about a child Killer - the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role - who snatches children when their parents don't watch, and continues on until an investigation goes underway. But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld, they know something is up, that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be, so they join in the hunt. This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thriller.",r

4,31 March 2006,EThompsonUMD,10, Influential and unforgettable masterpiece.,"Fritz Lang's highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany, where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement, and ended in the United States in 1953 with the production of The Big Heat, a film noir classic. Perhaps his greatest film, M (Germany, 1931) forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. ",i
5,30 June 2009,alexkolokotronis,10, Far Ahead Of Its Time And May Always Will Be,"M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all. For a film like this to be made in 1931 is just shocking. Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before. In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers, their complexities and particularly about pathological ones. Yet, M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, Seven and not to mention countless more.",e
6,2 May 2003,FilmOtaku,8, German Expressionism at its cinematic best,"Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art, I'm naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang.  I recently was able to see the restored version of ""Metropolis"" on the big screen, and was delighted to see ""M"" on the Sundance channel - especially since it was the uncut version.  M follows the trail of a child killer (Peter Lorre), sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation. ",w
7,8 September 2020,Xstal,9, Mörder...,"Casting its shadow through motion picture history and continuing to do so to this day, suggesting that societies throughout the world have struggled to resolve the most despicable actions of their citizens (inc. those in the police and armed forces) and the penalties they should pay - as seen by the gamut of forfeits that can be incurred for the same crimes across the planet, as well as those that are crimes in some territories and not in others.",/
8,11 September 2018,jamesrupert2014,10, Excellent film from the early days of European cinema,"Outstanding German expressionist film from Fritz Lang that follows first the police, then the underworld, as they search for a child killer in Berlin. The cinematography is moody and dramatic as the story moves through the poorer sections of the great city and the acting, while of a more melodramatic style than is currently popular, is very good*. Peter Lorre is outstanding as the killer who taunts the police as the noose slowly tightens around him. To some extent the film is an early 'procedural drama' as the police use (then) modern forensic techniques such as finger printing and graphology to try and find the killer. Tired of the increased police surveillance, the city's criminal element begins their own search, mobilising the numerous beggars to be 'eyes on the street'. The film touches on a number of issues that are as relevant now as in the 1930s including mob mentality (men are accused of being the killer simply for talking to a child), rights of the accused, the 'end justifies the means' use of torture, and the ever thorny issue of mental health and culpability. One of the great pre-WWII German films. *I watched a subtitled version on TCM.",r
9,21 April 2008,WriterDave,10," ""L"" Before ""M""","In an eerie propagandist fashion, the phrase ""in the name of the Law"" is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Lang's ""M"" as a child killer is brought to justice. If ""L"" represents the State and the Law, then ""M"" is meant to represent the Individual (who in this case is a Murderer). Lang boldly asked us way back in 1931, whose rights come first: the State or the Individual? A master of his craft, Lang leaves the question open-ended and let's the audience decide.",w

11,12 December 2018,davidcarniglia,9," Thoroughly Creepy, Thoughtfully Done","Like many great movies, M has a simple plot. It's the cinematography, acting, and screenplay that make such an intense drama. There's multiple levels to explore as well. Clearly, a psychological theme is drawn. Then, there's a political aspect; the waning of the Weimar Republic must have been a palpable experience of doom for plenty of Germans. Also, there's the theme of alienation; and, relatedly, the role of criminal underworld.",3
12,6 August 2018,ElMaruecan82,9, M or the Mark of a Disillusioned Genius...,"M like Manichean? What can you say of a plot driven by criminals and where good people are rather inefficient for the most part and where the most despicable character earns our own sympathy. This is a movie using such stark black-and-white contrasts, noir in its soul and gray in its core.",2
13,27 April 2018,TheNabOwnzz,8, A masterful take on compulsive immorality,"M has to be one of the most influential movies ever made, both technically and psychologically.

14,27 May 2009,Steffi_P,9," ""This won't bring back our children""","While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin' in the Rain were more or less myths, the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere. Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology, films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release. Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywood's first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselves.",9
15,21 October 2007,charchuk,10, The first sound masterpiece,"Probably the first sound masterpiece. Though it's one of the first to use the new technology, it doesn't feel like it, as the camera is fluid and expressive and the sound effects are utilized perfectly and are even essential to the story. Lang's direction is superb, amping up the suspense and terror by using the cinematography, lighting, and sound together to create a very tense and distinctive atmosphere. Peter Lorre is fantastic in what is really the lead role of the film, making us feel sympathy and pity for a horrific child-murderer. The combination of German expressionism, film-noir tendencies, and social commentary that Lang injects into the film makes for a brilliant and gripping work. Simply a terrific film all-around.",5
16,25 March 2016,elvircorhodzic,9, The birth of a psychological thriller!,"M"" is primarily a bold and controversial piece of work. Lang's first sound film. Directed us to the beginning of the game offers shade and excellent cinematography. The atmosphere is gloomy and tense. The case of child killer is thematically processed. The focus of the story is not a serial killer but on how his murder affect people.",8
17,2 May 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Unforgettable masterpiece,"Fritz Lang was a fine director with an artistic vision that is just genius. This is seen perfectly in pretty much all of his resume, especially in Metropolis and this unforgettable masterpiece, M. The film has a great story that unfolds without feeling too fast or too slow in development with a theme that is still relevant today, and to this day I never thought I would see a film that would make me think that the music of Grieg(Peer Gynt being the murderer's motif in a form of a truly chilling whistle) was scary.",/
18,25 February 2010,Eumenides_0,10, A Lesson in Film History,"Watching Fritz Lang's M is watching the history of cinema unfold before one's eyes. Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film, this 1931 masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasons.",?
19,3 November 2001,Quicksand,10, Timeless.,"As riveting as it is intellectually demanding.  And that's just by 2001 standards-- Fritz Lang directed this film, his first with sound-- in 1931, when hardly anyone knew how to integrate dialogue into a previously silent art form, and in the midst of the Nazi uprising at the same time.",r

23,20 July 2017,christopher-underwood,10, This film is almost 90 years old,"There is really nothing that can be said about this groundbreaking film that has not already been said, so just a few impressions on watching this after a gap of several years. This film is almost 90 years old and as the Blu-ray release has reinstated, if that is the word, the silent sequences it is well worth a re-watch. Made at the beginning of sound, this was not made with sound throughout, mainly for financial reasons. These silent passages are difficult for present day audiences but strangely effecting too, especially with such startling images. Overhead shots of streets and people scurrying. Peter Lorre lurking, eyes almost bursting. It is an amazing creation that impresses now, goodness knows what affect it had upon audiences of the time. Even without the nazi connotations, this is scary and worrying stuff. Beggars as detectives, criminals as jurors, it is mind boggling. And for a finale as the 'proper' police bumble about we go underground in the most amazing cave like structure packed with those who will decide the child killers fate, looking far too much like the very people that would drag Germany into oblivion.",=
24,29 June 2014,utgard14,9," ""...they never leave me. They're always there...""","There's a serial killer in Berlin who targets children. The police have been unable to catch him but their increased presence has made life more difficult for the criminal underworld. So the criminals band together to try and find the child killer themselves and issue their own brand of justice. Exceptional German film from the great Fritz Lang. His best sound film and second best film overall, behind only the silent sci-fi masterpiece Metropolis. The cast is terrific. Peter Lorre is amazing in this, which put him on the map. The direction, the cinematography, the angles, the lighting, the dark atmosphere all help to create this visually arresting film. It's a classic in every sense. Don't let its age or the subtitles turn you off from trying it. You're missing out on a truly great film if you do.",t

26,1 December 2012,Kubris,9, Dark and suspenseful,"M is quite the film. It shocks you throughout its runtime: the subject matter is scary and mature, the acting isn't over-the-top like its counterparts from the era, and there's swearing. Extreme swearing for the time. To top this all off, it's suspenseful. The entire last half is edge of your seat.",_
27,9 April 2009,lastliberal,9," I can't help what I do! I can't help it, I can't...",We see the beginnings of film noir in Germany's first talking picture. It also has some remnants of German Expressionism. But what is most impressive is the story itself.,u
28,14 May 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, This film is a masterpiece... and I don't use that term lightly,"My father has often told me about this movie. It's been available for next to nothing at the local DVD/CD shop here for longer than I can remember, and not long ago, I finally pulled myself together and bought it. Today, we sat down to watch it. I must say, this movie astounded and impressed me. From the first frame, it had me. It gripped me and didn't let go until the ending... if even then. If I'm not still in its clutches. The plot is excellent, and the way it's told is very interesting. It develops constantly, though never too quickly; the film never stands still, yet never moves too fast, either. The pacing is among the best in any of the films I've watched... and that list count nears one thousand titles(as I'm writing this, I'm nearing my way to 700 written reviews... but I've got a good 17 years of watching movies prior to my starting to comment on them). The acting is incredible. I can't think of a single performance I found anything less than flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The cinematography is nothing short of amazing. The way they created all those great shots, be it stationary or those with movement, at that time, with that equipment... magnificent work. Fritz (either Lang or the cinematographer, they share a first name) knows his way around cameras, and knows when to use movement... and, perhaps more importantly, when not to. This film has its share of both kinds of shots, and both work perfectly. The film uses the art of hinting to the fullest; something Hitchcock, the very master of suspense, would later employ, in huge thrillers such as Psycho. Shadows, suggestive camera movements, a tiny movement in body or face... things that, in a film of today, would be simply not be found. The silent and unclear would replaced by loud and obvious. One of the most important things to note about this film is how little it says outright... and how much it merely... hints. A careful, subtle remark, presented casually... in place of an absolute. Having recently watched Scarface, a film from the same period(it was released about a year later) which leaves little to be pondered over by the viewer(and much to be desired in that very area), the contrast between an open movie and a closed one is blatantly obvious. There is much to debate over and consider in this film. It reminded me of Alejandro Amenábar - a man whom I very much admire - the Spanish director who also employs few definite truths in his films. It's not up to the director to decide what is right... but rather us, the viewers, the movie-going audience. Alejandro knows that. So did Fritz. I will have to watch more films of his. Another thing is the level of detail in this film... reminiscent of Kubrick, another master of the art of film-making, this film is packed with detail. So many seemingly meaningless, but endlessly insightful little things. A scene that shows shady types idle... a subtle touch that would be edited out as early as during the script-writing phase of most newer movies... characters that are seen once and then never again... the examples are endless. Fortunately, this review isn't that, and on that note, I'll refrain from further listing of them. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. If you can, get a original version of this film... not a dubbed one. No matter how awful you are at the language, it just fits better in German. Just make sure you've got good subtitles... I myself am rather hopelessly poor at the language, and I noticed that many times, the lazy Danish translator skipped entire sentences(though I noticed it to be prominently used words and sentences, that, when uttered and translated once, were from then on left to only be heard, and not seen, which I guess is at least more acceptable than the worse alternatives). This film is full of suspense, and some of the best I've ever seen. Again, I would guess that Mr. Hitchcock took a lesson or two from Lang and this film. I was on the edge of my seat for just about all of this, and I couldn't have taken my eyes off it had the house been on fire. Well, I might've gotten up, once my chair was caught in the flames. Last but not least... the film-noir qualities. The interplay of light and dark, the dreary atmosphere and the tone... all spot-on. The film deals with several very difficult subjects... not to be mentioned here. I suggest you watch it for yourself and make up your own mind about each of them. Lang won't force his opinion on you. For such an old film, this is really not terribly dated... apart from some things that have obviously changed over the 75 years, three generations, yes, three quarters of a century that has passed, but they're really not that obvious. Had this film been made today, little would have to be changed. Sadly, it would not get made today... for many reasons. Unless it was on the indie scene, this simply would not be made. I can't see any studio accepting it as profitable. By today's standards, it's event-less, tame and, well, black and white. Of course, that says quite a lot more about today's standards(which, in my humble opinion, are far, far lower, and, indeed, too low) than the quality of this film, which is impeccable. I recommend this to any fan of Lorre, Lang and noir. Heck, crime, thriller and suspense fans will enjoy it as well. As would most anyone, really, who aren't too used to the films of today to enjoy an old great work. 10/10",r
29,24 November 2014,Rickting,10, A bone chilling masterpiece,"Many love detective stories. We love trying to figure out who did it. I am a lover of detective stories and cannot wait to finally see Se7en. However, do I really need to see it? It is already clear that I will never see a murder mystery movie as chilling, menacing, borderline harrowing as Fritz Lang's masterpiece 'M'. The plot concerns a child murderer on the loose in Berlin. Both the police and the criminal underworld hunt for him. Trying to find a more haunting detective story than M is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Every single frame is meticulously composed and oozes with suspense, menace and terror. Reflections and symbols are used brilliantly. The lighting is hauntingly atmospheric. Visually, the film is a total masterclass. The film's decision not to have a clear protagonist and to observe the action from an objective viewpoint may seem detached to some, but ultimately it makes the film feel more real and if even possible even more disturbing than it already is.",v
30,5 January 1999,Oliver1984,10, Chilling movie,"This movie is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It's about this childlike, pity evoking man (brilliantly played by Peter Lorre), who also happens to be a psychotic child killer. The city in which he lives is, of course, panicked by the mysterious child-killings, and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down. I won't reveal more then this, but I will say this: Just because it's an old movie, don't let your guard down. This movie is one of those rare movies, which are so good that you'll never forget them.",
31,12 October 1998,SMK-4,9, Lang's Child Murderer Classic,"Fritz Lang's first sound film is undoubtedly a classic.  Peter Lorre is utterly convincing as the serial child murderer, but an even bigger asset of the film is its realism.  When we see the children playing we believe they are playing, it does not look staged.  When we see the mother calling for her daughter and she doesn't respond then we can relate to it.  It is much more chilling and effective than the special effects bonanza of a modern slasher film, simply because it is much closer to our (speaking as somebody who lived in similar housing estates) everyday experiences.  This must have been even more impressive in its own period when viewers were accustomed to villains in comic book style, like Henry Bergman in the early Chaplin films.",

There's usually a lot of hype, and the film is no doubt controversial. The best known example of a serial killer film is PSYCHO. More recent examples would be MANIAC and American PSYCHO. But the film that started them all off was this black-and-white thriller/chiller that came from Germany, a shocking and disturbing film which still holds up as being powerful and frightening this day.

42,24 February 2009,cinematic_aficionado,10, A timeless masterpiece,"A masterpiece in the truest, fullest sense of the word. M is not just a thriller, but a study of human behaviour and the diseased mind and how the eternal battle of mind and soul forever troubles us or as it happens in this case, destroys us, after the main character has destroyed the lives of others. It also very successfully shows how society, even its most unjust members, craves for justice and how unprepared, or unwilling it is to tolerate child murder. Furthermore, the tendency of human psyche to take law in its own hands above and beyond its appointed instruments, in the event of the most horrific crimes involving children, is also very clearly demonstrated in M. Though released in 1931 its story and underlying principles remain timeless. Perhaps a lesson for today's filmmakers: Fritz Lang undoubtedly did not have access to advanced computer technology nor a budget in the multi million range and yet he delivers a film that is much more successful in both thrilling, respecting and entertaining its audience than many of today's ultra-expensive productions that desperately try to hide their lack of substance by filling the screen with gory, blood-filled imagery.",

48,4 August 2009,film-critic,10, Lorre's Little Secret,"From the elongated opening scene of ""M"", you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine. The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return, as we, audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle. It is foreboding, it is depressing, it is mesmerizing. It has been a very long time since a film, especially one made 78 years ago, seemed so delicate, so thought provoking, so timeless as ""M"" does. From these opening shots, Lang let's us know that this isn't going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops, but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window. With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty, Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred, where good and evil are similar, and a man defines his actions as ""uncontrollable"". This merely scratches the surface of ""M"", a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offered.",
49,20 February 2011,Sylviastel,10, An Early Film Classic!,"M is about a child murderer played by Peter Lorre, the great character actor. While the other players aren't familiar to me, they all do an excellent job. This film was done in the early days of talking pictures or movies. So the audience has to be aware that the English subtitles may not be complete but it doesn't matter. The film classic depicts a dark side in this black and white film about human crimes. Peter Lorre plays the killer in his best role. I thought the film was chilling enough about every mother and father's worst crisis. It's interesting to note that the cast list refers to Lorre as the murderer. Anyway, the killer is hunted down not only by the authorities but other criminals who seek vigilante justice of their own which may be more frightening than the actual court case. The killer becomes the hunted prey by ruthless predators seeking justice for crimes against children.",

Fritz Lang, who was one of the most versatile directors adds his mark to this. Lorre is terrific in his role, whistling ""In the Hall of the Mountain King,"" slinking around. That voice. That persona. It is also about the people who pursue him. One thinks immediately of Hitchcock's ""The Lodger"" (the first one) where the blood lust takes the place of reason and vigilantism rears its ugly head. We are led on a chase here and the close ups and the editing are masterful. Some would put this in a top ten (if they had actually seen it). It says, ""Don't go out at night in the fog.""

He gives both a very simple yet gut-wrenching performance that made him an international star. He is possessed and evil one minute and childlike the next, changing from vicious to fragile. (His babyface smile is the most sinister, deceptive thing about him.) The film sets the tone with a group of girls chanting a very foreboding and disturbing song, which a mother tells them to stop and the shadow and sight of Peter really gets you stirred up. The tables are turned on him when he is trapped not by the law but by a combination of the town's crooked element (who want him out of their hair, due to the police's tighter rein on them) and the poor tramps who are enlisted in the quest to find him. The film's use of silence was so, so quiet that the viewer feels something's wrong with the audio of the TV, the DVD, or something - only to hear all of a sudden a mother's yell to her children! The silence heightens the viewer's tension and Peter's desperation. The ending may be the eeriest thing of all!

In ""M"", he appears almost like a man-child, a roly poly round faced character who doesn't fit the profile of a child molester or murderer. Perhaps that was the point, to make him appear harmless until that creepy window scene where he wipes his lips and swoons with his evil desires while contemplating his next victim.

The films are basically about the same subject, serial child molesters/murderers.  It's a gruesome subject, and an emotional rollercoaster, but in the hands of a talented filmmaker, powerful stuff.  Where Solendz gives us a little more initial sympathy toward his main character, Lang's suspense takes front stage, only later giving way to a small measure of relief, in the scenes of the criminal underworld mobilizing their mission to make the streets safe (for them) again.  Fritz Lang was an artist decades ahead of his craft, using dark, stark, or sharply contrasting images and other innovative angles and techniques not widely seen in other films until the '50s or later. His choice of script was often visionary as well, tackling subjects that no one else would dare try to turn into art.  All the drama, power and impact of ""M"" survives intact today.

The plot is about a disturbed man who kills little children. Now you can probably understand the meaning of the first sentence. The police look restlessly for the man but are unsuccessful. After no luck other criminals decide to hunt him down as well. It sounds very much like a precursor to Jean Pierre-Melville's Le Samourai(1967) which is another excellent classic foreign film. My favorite part of the film is at the end at a trial staged by the criminals in which everyone jeers at the killer who says he can't help what he does.

It is Lorre who indulges a bit in _picturesqueness and histrionics—though his performance constitutes of course a great show, the vividly Expressionistic element of this otherwise realist movie. A police procedural at the scale of a mega-city—this puts a conceptual problem, and Lang solved it by alternating his approaches—first, a city—scale survey—then, in the second half, a suspenseful, hugely thrilling urban thriller—and then a few treats in the form of several actors' recitals. Lang aims at scaring and terrifying, delighting, amusing, informing, thrilling his audiences with his procedural epic—a movie that investigates a whole city of Berlin's scale, a tight ordering of the essential elements of the story.",

Regardless, there's a ferocious urgency in Fritz Lang's M, and its operatic hunt for the unassuming killer with the human face (you can practically feel Alfred Hitchcock leaning in for a fist bump); perhaps, sniffing out a shifting sociopolitical climate, he could tell ""indolent"" adults needed a 'Captain Hook' of their own.To say he succeeds would be an understatement for the century. Visionary and devastating, Lang's M is nearly as chilling in its immaculate technical mastery and scathing social commentary as it is eerily proficient at plumbing the depths of its macabre material.

It wasn't just the fact that director Fritz Lang was able to communicate heinous crimes through simple images, or that he flawlessly mixed German Expressionism with film-noir, a genre that had yet to be completely understood. The real reason this film has stood the test of time is the fact that it features some of the finest examples of direction and storytelling ever used.

And it should be pointed out that this is where the realism lies - the criminals have ulterior motives because the police search means the gangs can't operate their wares due to the heavy police presence . Something similar happened during the troubles in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 80s when loyalist terror groups found they couldn't operate extortion rackets and robberies and drug dealing because their more extreme death squads carrying out secterian murders attracted too much attention from the RUC , so they eliminated them .

89,5 January 2022,nickenchuggets,10," ""The man in black will soon be here""","Even though I've seen this movie before, I had to watch it again in order to more easily remember important scenes that I may have forgotten about. This wasn't an inconvenience because M, as many people know, is one of the best movies of all time. Directed by Fritz Lang (who also brought us the legendary Metropolis), M follows the attempts of ordinary people and a police force as they try and track down a despicable, child killing psychopath named Hans Beckert. Hans (Peter Lorre) is pure scum, and everyone in the whole city wants him dead. What makes the movie creepy all these decades later is how you don't really see Hans that much until the film is almost done, but you can still feel his presence whenever the authorities report yet another child has gone missing. The movie starts by showing a group of children playing a game that resembles ring around the rosie, and they're singing about a man in black who takes children away and kills them. A nearby woman tells them to stop singing that horrible tune, because as it turns out, there is an actual child murderer on the loose in Berlin. A young girl named Elsie comes home from school one day, and Hans comes up to her, whistling In the Hall of the Mountain King. He buys a balloon for her from a blind person and they walk off together. She's never seen again. Meanwhile, Beckert, being the psycho that he is, sends an unsigned letter to the press about how he killed Elsie and boasts about it. The police search a large area around the outskirts of Berlin with attack dogs and try to enlist people to spy on Hans, but nothing seems to work. Even criminals agree that Beckert is so evil that he should be killed immediately, and so mobsters are trying to search for him as well. Meanwhile, Hans sees another young girl and buys a balloon for her from the same blind salesman he bought Elsie's balloon from. Even though he can't see, he recognizes the song he whistles. A guy who is certain that Hans is the killer decides to shadow him. After using chalk to write a big letter M on his hand, he slaps Beckert's shoulder and leaves an M (for murderer) on his coat. Beckert's cover has been blown. Beckert runs to an office building after everyone has gone home for the night and tries to hide, but the other criminals are closing in on him. He is eventually captured and dragged to a derelict brewery to face an unofficial court. With a large crowd of angry and unforgiving parents watching him, Hans monologues to everyone about how murdering is something he feels he has to do, and that he has no restraint over it. A person assigned to be his lawyer argues that Beckert is deranged, and ill men shouldn't be sent to an executioner, but to a doctor. The crowd laughs, and right as they prepare to kill Hans, the cops arrest him. Judges then get ready to hand out Beckert's real sentence, as a mother of one of his victims says how everyone needs to keep a watchful eye on their children. Even almost 100 years later, M remains Peter Lorre's best film, at least in my view. It is extremely visceral for a movie released in the 1930s, as the antagonist's goal is to simply kill innocent kids. I can see why Lang had people threatening him in 1930 when he said his next movie was going to be about this kind of thing. The movie doesn't actually show a child being physically killed or even harmed throughout the whole runtime, but that doesn't make it less disturbing to watch. Peter Lorre portrays a man who is relentless and savage in his cruelty, and sees nothing wrong with the way he acts. In fact, he brags about it. Even though his speech towards the end is one of the most iconic scenes ever put in a film, Lorre was not really a serious actor before M. He had been featured in things before this, but his role in this movie was probably the true beginning of his career. The only minor complaint I have about this movie is how some scenes are quite slow, and not much goes on in many of them. When the cops are busy discussing how to catch Hans, all that's happening is that they're sitting at a table, and they give so many subtitles to read it's more like reading an M novel than watching the movie. Despite this, these scenes only add to the movie's complexity and in the end, it's worth it just for that unforgettable and creepy ending. The film just ends on a black screen, with nothing else. No ""The End"", no screen that tells you who played which characters. Nothing. Because it remains as shocking today as it was then because of its subject matter, I have no choice but to say M is one of the best horror movies and probably the best movie Lang ever made (even more than Metropolis).",

Police pressure on the local underworld prompts the criminals to seek the killer among their own. They must use ""funds meant for our colleagues already being hosted by the authorities."" Lang's camera moves among the suspects like a voyeuristic visual vulture, ever searching, always watching. (Perhaps only contemporary filmmaker John Carpenter has ever done it better.) In a truly stunning scene, we see ""Beckert"" (Lorre) aroused by the sight of a potential victim; he is prompted to begin whistling his signature tune- but a blind vendor selling balloons recognizes the tune (whistled when Beckert bought Elsie a balloon the day she disappeared). Beckert is marked by one of the underworld hoods and the chase is on. If there's one thing you DON'T want, it's a bunch of angry Germans chasing you... They call these Classics for a reason.",
95,26 October 2001,Bucs1960,10, Classic Fritz Lang Film,"This film epitomizes the word ""classic"". Lang directs this with such intensity and wrings such a heart wrenching performance from Peter Lorre, that it is almost painful to watch. Lorre may give one of the greatest screen performances of all times The subject matter, child murder, is unpleasant but the murders are never shown. The rolling ball and the drifting balloon are the indicators that something terrible has happened. Yet, somehow, you begin to have pity on Lorre as the murderer simply based on his poignant performance. Many people are put off by sub-titled films but dubbing would ruin this movie and the performances really don't need dialogue. The ""trial"" scene is very disturbing and Lorre's cry of ""I can't help myself"" will move the most jaded movie lover. The American remake with David Wayne doesn't even come close although you might want to watch it just to compare a classic to a ill advised remake. This is Lang and Lorre at the top of the game.",

Police then go to a card file system, look up that number and straight away know which window in which building and the address within seconds of the window being forced.

The sound and dialogue was handled incredibly well. Sound is indeed, a very important aspect in the movie, but it is handled in ways important to the plot without being over the top.
Film techniques (angles, fade ins/outs, use of shadows) hold up. You can actually see thee influence it must have had on film noire.
Acting is great and I can see how Peter Lorre became a star.
However, my favorite aspect was the plot. It is many layered, dealing with the killer, law enforcement, criminal industry, and society in general. I was not expecting anything so complex.

The film works because it shows us the mind of a serial killer and the beauty within the killer as well. This haunting picture also shows us the similarities between police and criminal, showing how both have hearts in the same image. The film is a great moral statement, it's not excessive or exploitive, nor is it under-played and sentimentalized, but somewhere in-between.

At least I do not feel that M is a complete disaster. The final third is actually quite good, and there are occasional moments of artistic merit prior to that. Further, you should watch M at least once for the same reason that you should head out to see the Emperor parade by in his new clothes at least once--namely, because everyone is talking about it, a lot of people are being influenced by it, and so on. But M is far from a masterpiece. Comparing M to classic Hitchcock is almost criminal. The hot air that's regularly emitted about this film could fill a million balloons for street vendors. The first two thirds of M are pretty bad--I almost couldn't make it to the ending, which would have been a shame, and I'm someone who is almost _never_ tempted to bail out on a film.",

It's a movie about misery, and humans at their worst....and maybe a bit at their best. 'M' created a genre (film-noir) and, although being made in 1931, it's a guideline and a FAQ for making this kind of movies.

The setting is 1931 Berlin and the top priority of the local police is to find an elusive child murderer Hans Beckert(Peter Lorre). The pursuit of the pedophile uses early fingerprinting and handwriting techniques. The local underworld's ""business"" is cramped with the cops and their steadfast hunt for the serial killer. The criminals decide to hunt down Beckert themselves to take the heat off their activities. They enlist street beggars to keep a watch out for the killer.

The scenes between the parents and children leave one particularly emotional as anyone with children must have felt what those poor parents were going through.

Director Fritz Lang's provocative thesis is that all it takes is one evil man--say a failed painter or an Emmy-losing game show host--to corrupt and curse an entire nation. Lang's M presents Peter Lorre as a crazed child killer who elicits the intrusive Big Brother German Fascist Efficiency that would soon send Gestapo thugs fanning out across Europe for building-to-building Terroristic searches resulting in Anne Frank and millions of other moms, pops, and kiddies being tattooed, recorded in ledger books, stripped, gassed, and burned. All basic Human Rights are suspended in the face of M, as happened in Real Life within a few years of its premier. As Mark Twain's historical tome SAINT JOAN best illustrates, the ""Maid of Orlean's"" top general turned out to be a notorious child killer just like M, cursing France to be conquered at least a dozen times by England, Russia, Germany, Algeria, and Vietnam.

131,26 April 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Visual black and white lending expressivity to the dialog,"The first talky by Fritz Lang in 1930-31. This great master of silent movies tries his hand on this talking long feature and succeeds in many ways. First the pictures are so beautiful, so well framed and lighted that the visual fascination Fritz Lang was a master of in the past is till there full and powerful. Second the actors are still acting as if they were voiceless, their body language being essential for the understanding of the action and the feelings. What's more long silent sequences give some density to the sound when it comes back and this sound is used in full expressivity, even in its imperfection as if it were the real sound we could hear in the street, muffled, discordant and with interferences from all around. Fritz Lang even manages not to have the typical sound of a sound stage though the whole film was shot in a studio, that sound stage sound so typical of so many American films of the 1930s. Then Fritz Lang deals with a subject that was just plain out in his time and yet he manages to do the job with such delicateness and tactfulness that it looks deeply human though dealing with the worst possible crime and criminal, and the board of censors of his time let it go through. But Fritz Lang manages to demonstrate how even that criminal will have to get a real defense, a real trial, justice in other words. Two visions of justice are thus contrasted: the justice that looks for some kind of vengeance, or at least a full retaliation, and the justice that is considering the real state of mind of the criminal and hence his responsibility. This explains well why the Nazis will ban the film later: it entirely condemns the Nazi expedient form of what they would have called justice which was always designating some kind of cleaning up of society, expurgating of the anti-social characters, be they political, sexual, criminal, religious or racial. And that's where the film today takes a new value. It becomes an allegory of what was to come. Hitler and the Nazis will be those who will authorize the underworld to take over and we must admit that they are more effective than the police in such situations and they don't wait for the judicial process to go through. The SS were the police, the court, the jury, the judge and the executioner, all of them in one body. In five minutes the mystery was solved and the criminal was eliminated, even if it was not a criminal but a Jew or a Communist, these facts being the worst crimes the Nazis could identify, crimes deserving immediate death. That's this visionary aspect of the film that is disquieting. Did the Germans know what was coming? Probably. So why did they not stop it? That is THE question and a very difficult one at that. Historians will still be asking that question in a couple of centuries.",

Whether it's the distinct intimacy of certain scenes, which take place in enclosed spaces such as underground bars and locked storage rooms; the manipulation of light to create bizarre images and shapes as familiar and somewhat usually unspectacular places are rendered spaces of terror or, indeed, 'uncanny'; the idea that the most powerful 'groups' of characters are additionally the more unlikeable; or just the frank and sheer immediacy of the title, 'M', something in Lang's 1931 picture always seems to just toy with the audience.

Lohman and the storm trooper posted outside the bar window), Lorre being dragged back down the stairs, and so on.  When Lang isn't explicitly showing us views that look up or down, he's making a point of concentrating on the high and low aspects of German society.  The overclass (represented by the police, military, clergy, politicians and an academic who looks a wee bit like Freud) represent the rational aspect of the society.  The lower elements are generally portrayed in subterranean settings with pretty over-the-top imagery like standing pools of water and intestinal-looking piping overhead. When the overclass needs to deal with the underclass, they send the appropriately named `Lohman' to stir them up.  But they are the same being, as Lang shows us with the masterful blending of the two settings where the overclass and underclass set about solving the same problem thinking essentially along the same lines.

Fritz Lang, of course, was a director of many silent pictures in the 1920s in Germany, and was one of the first to really take advantage of the sound format.
Unlike most directors from the very early 30s, he seemed to have an inkling of just what an audio track could do for film, in fact. This picture isn't
as audially fascinating as The Testament of Dr. mabuse, but it's full of really great dialogues on the nature and psychology of aberrant behaviour, the
mentality of mobs, and so forth. You'll also find that it's just far different from most Hollywood pictures of even those pre-Code days.",

He's a 100%, hears-voices-in-his-head, ""I must kill to quiet the voices"", driven killer. One of the things I would like to point out in this movie is how ""German"" it is, if that makes any sense. The spoken German in this can be oft harsh as the volume and sound levels can sometimes spike and be a bit distorted but you kind of get to peek at the 1920s/30s German mindset and zeitgeist and see it projected onto the screen. Sometimes the gritty acting is pretty risqué even by 1930s standards and I don't think the US started seeing movies like this until MUCH later.

The basement trial scene illustrates just how unsentimental this film is:  rather than letting us (or the killer) off easy by telling us what to think, Lang keeps jerking us between pleas for mercy, requests for legality, and demands for vengeance, without making any of them obviously more ""right"" than the other. Lorre's performance is, moreover, not only brilliant, but believable--enough to draw our sympathy without letting us forget just what it is he has done.  An amazing accomplishment for 1931. And an amazing one for 1999 as well.  Compare M to Silence of the Lambs, which was, in the final analysis, a movie about a freak show monster and another killer, who was given characteristics, but no personality. Lambs looked on the FBI crime lab's investigative prowess with all the critical detachment of a groupie and set its story in a never-never land of politics that meant nothing to anyone in the real world.  M, on the other hand, set its story in something like real world Berlin, with a political commentary that, whatever Lang meant, was still subversive enough to raise the Nazis' suspicions.

This stylized german production by one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, works on the senses in the most methodical insinuating way.  A perfect model of subtlety, that provides a powerful counter-argument to the gory modern horror film.  M shows us just enough onscreen action to frighten us, and forces us to make up the rest in our mind.  By portraying the Peter Lorre child murderer as a sad little wretch of a man, the material becomes twice as disturbing as it would be, if Lang had chosen to exploit his subject.  And as a result, we are presented with a timeless film, that has much to say about society.  To add to its successes, M suggests its ideas through the images and using early sound techniques to truly chilling effect.  Some of the images are unforgettable, and Lorre gives the performance of his career.

But when Lorre finally expresses himself, we can't help but feel his horror at the idea of being included in the unsavory world of those ""other"" social outcasts.

In M he combined this visual brilliance with some of the most inventive use of sound in the early days of the technology. The former is typified by rightfully famous scenes such as the murder of the little girl which is alluded to with four simple shots of an empty chair, an empty stair-well, a little ball rolling out from the bushes and a balloon caught high up in the telephone wires - in this way Lang was able to depict the most heinous of crimes imaginable in the most restrained, but nevertheless disturbing, way; sound is added to the mix in a similar creepy manner with the killers whistling being used as a clear indicator of his ominous presence.",

He and his wife, Thea Von Harbou co-wrote by extracting materials from the acts of various assassins in a series that had for some years proliferated in Germany, especially the bloody case of Peter Kürten, whom public opinion baptized as ""the vampire of Düsseldorf"", a psycho-killer that caused serious damage to German society. Social alarm lasted for many months, and only accidentally the police could tackle with the monster. Lang promotes a zeitgeist, a kind of global radical mosaic based on the concrete criminal events.

Children mirror what they see and hear; but the only reason the children's song was so atrocious was because the Child Murderer was afoot. Then Lang uses that long take to show the woman readying her table for her childwho will never come home; it is a drastic and dramatic scene and I find the horror of it magnified because we do not see Peter Lorre choking the girl, or stabbing heror doing whatever. We figured what would happen and in implication the suspense and horror are far greater than any Freddy or Jason slasher flick.",

""M""  is not just a story about a maniac, it's great allegory on the German society in 1930's. Fritz Lang shot this film in outstanding way: the film is really dramatic and captivating. The first 10 minutes of film is really terrifying and then investigation begins. In 1931 Lang felt that the Germany is frightened and too aggressive. Maniac (Piter Lorre) is not really great murder like Lector or Spacey in ""Seven"". He is just a little man that is really, really ill. His decease destroys him. He is just a silly monster. But look at the honest citizens: they are so frightened and aggressive; they are ready to destroy all. At that moment the criminals decided to find and destroy ""monster"". That's funny but even real murderers, burglars that had become the criminals on their free will, were sure that Lorre is a monster that had to be killed. And then  the last and, maybe, one of the best scenes in history of the world cinema: criminals caught Lorre and were trying to judge him. But at that moment maniac talked  holy God, it is a great moment!!! And at that moment I understood the main idea of this film: Lorre is a monster, murderer, but his enemies is much worse.

When the film was released in Germany the posters were in German but when the film was released in France the posters were in French.

176,5 January 2005,ACitizenCalledKane,9," Fritz Lang's study of serial murder, justice, and the death penalty","Based on an article Fritz Lang read about serial killer Peter Kuerten, M is a fascinating study of the criminal mind. Peter Lorre is compelling as Hans Beckert, a murderer of little girls. His diminutive size and high pitched squeal are used to great effect to hide the enormity of the demons within him. Mr. Beckert preys on little girls, buying them balloons, candy, anything they might want, just as long as they agree to leave with him. The murders are never shown, though, because Lang knew that by leaving them to our imagination, we provide far worse depictions of what may have transpired than anything that could have been put to film. Besides, no censors would have allowed such things to be shot at that time anyway. Instead, we see a balloon with no owner, a ball with no one to bounce it, and a dinner plate awaiting the return of Beckert's latest victim. Of course, the entire town is panic-stricken, and the film shifts its magnifying lens to the effects that Beckert's killing spree has on the remaining populace. We see fear, anger, frustration. The police are at their wits' end, attempting to catch a criminal who strikes on impulse and leaves hardly any clues at the murder scenes. To make matters worse, the frenzied public cannot agree on any solid leads. Even the underworld is haunted by the murders. The police are everywhere, searching for any clue at all, and the criminals have no way of getting around to their ill-gotten gains. Finally, the criminals decide it is up to them to succeed where the police have failed, and so, they decide to catch the monster themselves. In the meantime, psychological evidence taken from Beckert's hand-writing leads the police to the conclusion that Hans is clinically insane, killing out of a pathological need. The man hunt continues until a mob of criminals finally track down the perpetrator. Hans is then taken to an abandoned ware-house where he is subjected to a kangaroo court. In a panic, Hans admits that he has no control over his murdering little children, he pleads insanity. He begs to be placed under police custody, which is a joke to the ""court,"" compromised of every criminal that had to put his work on hold because of Beckert's string of homicides. Peter Lorre is spectacular in conveying Hans' desperation and the agony with which he lives every day of his life. His words fall on deaf ears, except for the man who has been appointed to ""defend"" him. His defense argues that he cannot be held responsible his actions if he cannot control himself. A wonderful debate takes place here, arguing over the justice or injustice of the death penalty, and whether or not it fair to punish a man who is clinically insane. Just before his sentence is to be carried out, though, the police arrive, and Beckert is taken into custody. You never find out what happens to him, though, as the film ends with the mother of one of the victims telling us that the no court ruling can ever bring her child back. Some may find this film slow or disappointing because of a lack of ""action"" or a some-what anti-climactic ending, but I believe that this film does what it set out to do. It sheds some light on the criminal mind, shows the psychological effects that a serial killer has on us all, questions our sense of justice, and also questions the morality of the death penalty. This film is disturbing, and I will admit that I find it a little slow here and there, but there is so much here to think about, that I cannot help but give it 9 out of 10 stars.

The acting is solid throughout, if theatrical in a manner typical of this period of film making. Talking pictures were very much in their infancy here and so the style of acting is highly visual – this is no complaint: the extravagant gestures enhance the atmosphere much as they did in the early sound Universal pictures.

I thought the build-up was kind of slow but the final court room drama is so spectacular and awesome that is really unparralled in any movie since then. Lorre´s defense strikes at the heart of the human condition. He is innocent yet accused by people for something he could not possible have prevented. It is in his psychology to act like he does and he has no choiche. The criminals around him has a choice though. They accuse him when they should really accuse themselves. It all comes down to the question of ""free will"". Nietzsche said that ""free will"" is a phony conception. This movie seems to discuss this concept in depth though, and it is up to the viewer to make his own judgment. That Lorre is ""rescued"" by the police in the end suggests that he made a strong defense though. Then a voice puts blame off him by saying: ""We must all take better care of our children"".",

The movie plot is pretty absurd with the whole of the self-righteous ""underground"" world of criminals uniting to catch the kindermorder who threatens to blacken their reputation! The Nazi propaganda is typically moronic, but that can safely be ignored to get to the climax where Lorre is being ""tried"" by the gangsters and gangland killers who think they are so much superior to them and he launched into his tirade. The killer is not an evil man, but one driven by an insane urge to kill, regardless of the consequences. Unlike the rest of the criminals who prosecute him, he does not do what he does for gain, but because his very nature, a drive that is alien even to him, forces him to obey. The sheer power of Lorre's performance, especially in the prosecution scene, blasts most other movies out of the water. There are few scenes as intense and revealing as this one. As a member of the progeny of UFA's expressionist classics, the movie is visually quite stunning and of course, highly artificial in its plot and acting, but this in no way takes away from its dramatic power. I wonder how it would have turned out had Lang not been under the Nazi censors who forced him to fell for his life a few years later?",

The difference between M and one of his earlier silent films, such as Metropolis, is striking. While the latter compensated for technical limitations with heavy acting and visually appealing sets, the former was driven by comparatively rich dialogue and developed its plot in a way that might seem familiar and appealing even to modern audiences. Lang used the recent addition of a soundtrack to great effect leading up to the climax as the killer, played by Peter Lorre, came to be identified with a particular whistled tune. Lorre's desperate plea for clemency would have been difficult or impossible to capture using intertitles and hand gestures, but Lang made it one of the most powerful and memorable scenes in his first talkie.

As the film unfolds it feels less like a procedural and more like the psyche of the beast unmasking itself methodically, as if the chase after child murderer Becket (Peter Lorre) is nothing more than the humanity itself exposing its' own devil, the problem of evil it struggles with in eternity. The city is like an organic machine, and Becket merely filling in the ultimate quota. He is pure evil, and yet innocent in that purity. He commits the most appalling crime of all, the murder of innocents, and yet he is a symbol for society's own corruption, the way the machine systematically murders its' own innocence from within. Because Becket is absolutely responsible, he is also absolutely absolved, because his crime is beyond reason, it is insanity, good and evil wrestling but joined in symbiosis, the ultimate monster none of us can bear. Trapped by the criminals who want him perished so they can continue their vices without restriction by police and civilian paranoia, he finds himself charged guilty by the guilty, by those that greedily profit from the weak, those criminals of 10 000 reasons who cannot deal with the devil directly.

Based on the real crimes of the ""Monster of Dusseldorf"" Peter Kurten who was put the death the year this film was released. According to crime historians Kurten is one of the most evil, depraved and disgusting criminals of all time. The character played by Peter Lorre, Hans Beckert was portrayed as a more sympathetic person. One of the details about this film that makes it unique even among todays thrillers is that the movie is more about the actions and reactions made by society rather than delving into the lifestyle of the serial killer like ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"". In pure cinematic ingenuity Lang smoothly cuts back and forth between the police and the criminal underground as they both strive for the same ultimate goal, find the killer. One of the many thrilling things about this film is as an audience member you are on edge about Beckert killing another child as well as wanting to know if it will be the police who capture Beckert or the criminal underground, plus what will either side do once they capture him. Another part of Lang's brilliant film-making is that he does not make it mellow dramatic. This was still the beginning of the sound era and many film makers through out the world thought that there should never be silence on the screen. Showing how far ahead he was of his time he took the opportunity to go without music and simply let the streets and crowds play as the soundtrack.

His performance as the pervert/murderer is outstanding and allows one to forget the obviously dated contrivances that characterize this movie. The impressionistic character of this movie is unmistakable. Scene after the scene the director attempts to use all kind of wide angled and skewed camera shots to generate certain feelings. Other times he uses close ups. These are all transparent attempts at manipulating the audience through gimmickry instead of through the story itself. If the story is strong, the gimmickry is not necessary. Here, the story is good but alone is not enough to sustain a full-length motion picture. Further, the story is so contrived as to create a need to prop it up with camera work and sound. The idea of a gang of thieves solving a crime is ludicrous. But all this is rendered secondary by Peter Lorre's performance. His performance sets the standard for future depictions of the sociopathic personality. Although playing a most reprehensible character, Lorre succeeds in investing in his character a pathos that preserves his basic humanity. That alone makes this movie worth watching.

Everything seems normal and that's when the spine chilling felonious character surfaces. We immediately learn that, there is a child murderer in the town and has already slay ed 8 children and the girl whose mother is waiting for lunch is the ninth victim. The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody.

Basically in Berlin, Germany, a number of child abductions and murders have been taking place, wanted posters are all over the place to find the psychopathic killer, this man lures his child victims with candy, balloons and other child-friendly items. The most substantial evidence the police, led by Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke), have collected are hand written letters from the killer himself, to be published by the press in newspapers, and also a Blind Panhandler (Georg John) who sold a man a balloon to a child remembers hearing key information to identify the killer, the man whistles Edvard Grieg's ""In The Hall of the Mountain King"", from the 'Peer Gynt' Suite I Op. 46 while luring the children. The police are not getting anywhere fast, as members of the paranoid public are tipping them about any person seen and quickly accused of being suspicious, but also criminals are taking the case into their own hands, wanting to catch the killer themselves while the police are straining their ability of conducting criminal activities. The killer himself, Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) is a self-loathing man, on the occasion the blind beggar recognised his whistling, he passes a message and gets a man to mark on Beckert's back the letter ""M"" with chalk (this stands for Mörder, meaning ""murderer"" in German), he eventually realises he is being followed, but gets caught by the criminals hiding in a building. Beckert in a criminal ""court room"" scenario is put on ""trial"", in a passionate monologue he explains that his urges compelled him to commit murders, which he regrets, the other criminals break the law by choice, and he pleads to be handed over to the police. The enraged mob are about to kill Beckert, but the police arrive to arrest him and the other criminals, Beckert is taken to a real courtroom where five judges will pass judgement, but the sentence is not seen, instead it cuts to many crying parents to murdered children before fading to black. Also starring Gustaf Gründgens as Safecracker/Safebreaker, Theo Lingen as Con Man, Inge Landgut as child Elsie Beckmann, Ellen Widmann as mother Frau Beckmann, Fritz Odemar as The Cheater, Theodor Loos as Inspector Groeber, Paul Kemp as Pickpocket with Six Watches, Friedrich Gnass as burglar Franz, Franz Stein as Minister and Ernst Stahl-Nachbaur as Police Chief. Lorre was best known playing sinister snivelling characters like parody, here he is genuinely rather menacing who catches and kills children, following his captures with chilling whistling. I admit the film was a little all over the place at times, especially with the concept of both police and criminals searching for the guilty man, but this being Lang's first talking picture is clever in its use of sound, from the clicking of a knife to crowd scenes, and of course the whistling, it is definitely one to be seen as a masterpiece, a great classic crime drama. Very good!",

I like how the movie builds its story quite slowly up to one third of its duration and then quickly changes pace to medium speed long sequences starting from where the murder suspect is identified by the blind man. It then lets the viewers ride a roller coaster of a story, inciting more and more curiosity as the movie provide room for it by presenting the two sides of the story, the police side and the organized crime side. The cinematography tries very hard to looks sophisticated for its time. Using camera movements that may be complicated to execute at that time, the movie continues on despite all those major and frequent hiccups. The sound department also doesn't escape this, as all the entire voice-over acting are misplaced by a third to half a second. The twist with Franz is also quite funny for me.

M is a procedural, stripped of all melodramatic emotion or sense of adventure, and it ends up so committed to its vision of Berlin and crime that the ending develops into one of the most complex finales, especially emotionally, of any crime movie.

282,15 April 2003,estreet-eva,9, Schraenker is cool.,"One of the earliest talkies, 1931's ""M"" kicks off the film noir subgenre in pre-Hitler Germany with a stylistic tale of Peter Lorre's child-murdering psychopath. Fritz Lang's genius for building suspense and using uncomplicated visuals to leave the horror to the audience's imagination is in full effect here. Where a modern film would take us painstakingly through the capture, torture and dispatching of the eight or nine girls Lorre's character goes through before the villagers with pitchforks catch up with him, Lang uses the lingering shot of a balloon caught in electric wires or an empty place-setting to let us figure out that the deed is done. Lang instead focuses his attention on the reaction of society to the killings: people accuse one another wildly, politicians use the events to gain power and police try the nothing-to-see-here tact until Lorre sends a confession note to the local paper. Lorre is the standout performance here eschewing more modern minimalist acting style for one with broad facial expressions, wild gestures and scenery (to the extent the minimalist Lang uses it) chewing soliloquies. These lack of modern touches do make some scenes difficult to comprehend for the modern viewer unacquainted with things that probably made a lot of sense in 1930s Berlin. Also the films unsatisfying ending and noir-ish moral ambiguity (sorry but pointing out that Lorre's accusers also have committed crimes in no way puts them on the same moral depth as someone who has killed eight children) are also points against it. However, if you a fan of ""Basic Instinct"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""DOA"" or other noirs, this is required viewing.",

So when I noticed that the Blu-Ray included the English version I decided to watch it again. Big mistake! You'll notice right away that the film isn't as good. Most of the English version is just dubbed over but some scenes were actually shot in English. You'd think it would be the same basic film but it wasn't. They edited it differently.

This movie certainly quite some good stuff going for. It is unconventional in the sense that we do not really have a main character. Well you could call the murderer the main character but he doesn't have that awful much of screening time. OK the best about the movie is that we have the mob and the beggars who join forces to catch the murderer, hoping to succeed where the police have failed this far. The shock and hysteria it causes among the people is believable for the time. People suspect and accuse each other, are suspicious when an adult is friendly towards a child. However this also results in long dialogs and shouting at each other which did tedious at times. It's rather odd that no one ever remembered anything while the murderer operated in broad daylight on the streets and was not actually secretive whistling ""King of the Mountain Hall"" tune constantly. Good performance from peter Lorre. Yes the chasing scene at the bank was exciting even if a bit overdue. The court scene was interesting but I didn't like the way how the murderer tried to be empathic.

Fritz Lang even manages not to have the typical sound of a sound stage though the whole film was shot in a studio, that sound stage sound so typical of so many American films of the 1930s. Then Fritz Lang deals with a subject that was just plain out in his time and yet he manages to do the job with such delicateness and tactfulness that it looks deeply human though dealing with the worst possible crime and criminal, and the board of censors of his time let it go through. But Fritz Lang manages to demonstrate how even that criminal will have to get a real defense, a real trial, justice in other words. Two visions of justice are thus contrasted: the justice that looks for some kind of vengeance, or at least a full retaliation, and the justice that is considering the real state of mind of the criminal and hence his responsibility. This explains well why the Nazis will ban the film later: it entirely condemns the Nazi expedient form of what they would have called justice which was always designating some kind of cleaning up of society, expurgating of the anti-social characters, be they political, sexual, criminal, religious or racial.

If a person commits an act of crime it should be punished by the law of the state and the common law of people, and if for some reasons that's not happening the others can proclaim themselves judges and lead the trial of their own in order to bring the person on it to get what he deserves. One can argue of its fairness for hours and hours, if that's lawful enough to murder a murderer but there shouldn't be any doubt that every person, no matter how bad and despicable he is, must be thoroughly investigated, his motifs checked and his story heard in order to sentence him to anything.",

In this movie, Peter Lorre, kills children. The gendarmes can't catch him, so criminals take it upon themselves to try, convict and kill him! Okay...it has atmosphere, it's interesting. Parts of it are scary and I was all set to recommend it to friends as a movie to see during this Halloween season. But I won't! I care about my friends! One thing I do like about this film (and one reason it didn't get a ""1"" is because you don't see Peter Lorre actually kill the children, but you know he did it. I won't completely give away the ending, except to say the criminals don't get their way. He has his trial and sentence is not only pronounced, but about to be carried out when Peter's defense attorney speaks up and gives a speech that any person who doesn't believe in the death penalty would champion.

I have a few reasons for this. First of all, the storyline is not very good. A guy is killing kids. As a result, the police crack down leading to a loss in money for organized crime. Ok, I can accept that....but when bosses of organized crime turn to the beggars union? Beggar's what?! The plot line is barely developed. Little tension is built. The only disturbing aspect is the introduction, after that little is done to build the character of Peter Lorre as threatening character. He's is immediately discovered by a blind balloon salesmen. From then on its the underworld figuring out what to do with him. The trial scene is supposed to be big and emotional. Its completely laughable in every way. The mock trial? This makes no sense and is completely unbelievable.",

The bare, sheer beginnings of 'sound film'. That Fritz Lang managed to utilize cinema in a way so constructively to ask a philosophical/society-type question is certainly something to behold, how he carefully lays out the hints from the very first scene to the end certainly demonstrates great originality and good technical command, a film made by pioneers in good command of their craft.",
304,20 November 2017,somamoons,6," Due respect to this pioneer, but nothing exceptional in and of itself","Things I liked about this movie: 1) the lighting isn't high-contrast. A great example of how early black and white films could still have perfect lighting. 2) They relied on visuals *and* dialogue to tell the story. For example during the first predatory scene, instead of hearing the girl cry out or yell, we see her balloon float away, followed by a shot of her ball rolling down the hill and stopping at the bottom. This indicates that she's been killed. The effect is chilling - far more so than any dialogue would have been. I wish more modern movies would use this technique to tell crucial parts of a story. 3) The ending - without spoiling anything, it's interesting to note which side you agreed with and then to ask yourself if that's something you would normally do. Many people have brought up the Nazi paranoia in this film, but I think it goes beyond the film. If you place yourself within the ending scene (and how can you not?), you can get a feel for which side you might have been on in WWII...and it might not be what you want to think.",

Fritz Lang is a master filmmaker, so is the man for the job. He creates plenty of very intense cinematics - dialogue, cinematography, and sequences that impose the seriousness of the subject material on the audience, and this is where Fritz comes through as a filmmaker - using cinematic techniques, quality dialogue, well-rehearsed sequences and intense photography to represent the seriousness of the film's content. All with relativity calm shots, too, as most film sequences from that era are without much tracking, steadicams, crane-shots; all to the benefit of Fritz here to enhance the tension in the film's plot.

310,25 August 2021,roblesar99,9, Probably my favorite foreign film.,"Considering the fact that I regard director Fritz Lang's Metropolis as one of the crowning achievements in sci-fi cinema, I expected M to be an early hallmark of the thriller genre. However, while there's plenty to admire about Lang's first ""talkie,"" it doesn't live up to the high standard set by Metropolis. The film follows two distinct groups, one composed of criminals and the other composed of police investigators, as they search for a serial killer of children after he strikes for the ninth time. What's most interesting about the film from a storytelling standpoint is that Lang eschews having a principal protagonist. Instead, Lang presents a three-prong narrative that focuses on Otto Wernicke's Inspector Karl Lohmann, Gustaf Gründgens' The Safecracker, and Peter Lorre's child killer Hans Beckert. Lang's decision to weave three story lines into one coherent narrative is a bold move, especially for a film nearly ninety years old, but Lang struggles just a tad to harness them all, leading to some slack pacing. The structure of the film felt akin to that of L.A. Confidential, but whereas that film functioned as a fascinating three- pronged character study, the characters in M unfortunately aren't as complex.",

312,4 December 2019,CarterRoadfeldt,10, A relevant and groundbreaking film for its time and for today.,"""M"" by Fritz Lang is a suspenseful and tricky film that will make you question your own morals and create an internal dilemma with its ending and show the conflict of the working class german people with local authorities.
The movie features many dark elements and traditional german expressionism, which can be clearly seen in many parts of the movie such as the opening scene. That same scene and many more like when the detective repeats ""Ariston"" and the camera pans in with each phrase are the ones that build the suspense of the crazed child killer we are slowly introduced to.
The film's main plot is of course the child killer, but it also expresses the conflict of the working class with police. In a lot of ways it feels like that is what Fritz Lang is really trying to express over the main plot's moral dilemma, and for the time (1931) it makes a lot of sense. With the German people in an economic crises and wanting for a new leader.",

314,11 February 2023,zeekwunlau,10, M: A Timeless Classic of Crime Thriller Cinema,"One of the most memorable details of the film is the murderer 's habit of humming the fourth movement of Pilkin 's suite. It is the darkest symphony. At least I usually hear this melody when it comes to the appearance of the reverse character in a movie or video game. To put it plainly, this work is not as interesting and enjoyable as the director's other representative work ""Metros"", but the unique impact of the plane is presented (the destruction of the building and the static afterimages of the building are repeated Reappearance), evil vs evil endings, can be called the precursor to inspire countless waves.
Some movies will never be outdated not because of his shooting methods and how classic the movie concept is, but to discuss a topic that is not out of date. Before the last five minutes, you may find many tricks still familiar in this movie. But in the last five minutes, the subject was thrown out. What is a person? Is the person 's mind a person or that body is that person? This movie is 31 years old. At that time, it was not a very vague concept of mental illness. The definition of multiple personality schizophrenia, this fatal ID in the future movie was used to build the entire movie. Weakly thought, the reason why the director used the triad to throw out these opinions, and in the end did not give the court's judgment may be to say that this was also an unanswered debate, one side is poor parents, the other is a face Another ignorant personality. At that time it was really difficult to make a judgment.",

319,19 August 2020,VikingBurialService,9, M,"A little held back by its era. Basically, a child murderer is sought out by both police and criminals across town. This movie's influence on the noir genre is immediately apparent; the dark tone, the camera angles, the distrust of authority. From that standpoint, it certainly deserves the respect it has. The pacing is also pretty good; the first half is everyone trying to find the criminal, while the second is them trying to capture/punish him. One problem with this movie is the dialogue; every conversation is obvious exposition, and doesn't feel like the way people would actually speak. Another problem is in the editing. There are lots of obvious jump-cuts, speed-ups, and poor use of music (though the first major use of a leitmotif is interesting).

The black and white photography is astounding, the performance of Peter Lorre shows why he ended up in Hollywood. You are both repulsed and strangely sympathetic to his character. Possibly this is Fritz Lang's finest film and every time I watch it I see the culmination of that whole post WW1 expressionist style in Germany, even though it is not really an Expressionist film. The way you get the self interest of the people in power and their human frailties exposed-no one is a 'hero' in this film. I can see why Nazi Germany banned it-it is uncomfortably accurate in its portrayal of the weaknesses of the German people. Part murder mystery it is really an exploration of us all. Our need for revenge, our lack of empathy, our ability to not see our own weaknesses. Yet it is also a portrait of evil. Wonderful film-they don't make like this any more.",

But I would disagree for several reasons. First of all it is paramount to remember that this movie is from the early days of talking films and still works much like a silent movie. Lang seems to have been using the sound medium gingerly and relied much on his silent experience. Secondly, this movie was made for a generation of vastly different sensibilities than that of our own time. Take off you culturally shaped glasses and try to watch the film with an opened mind. You might well see a movie that is both rich is stunning visuals, frame composition, as well as its strikingly humanitarian spirit. For me most interesting aspect of ""M"" though, is the view it affords of 1931 Germany. Here is a ""cinematic"" slice of what Germany may have been like prior to the total domination by Hitler and his party. As I watched the characters passing through many of the frames I was surprised at the extremely diverse parade of humanity that made up the cast. There were so many men who's physical forms were in direct contrast to Hitler's Aryan Model that I could not help but wonder how many of them later became victims of the Nazi death machine only a few years after the film was made.

What I can say though is that Peter Lorre in the final scene is great, he seems so panicked and he seems genuinely sorry for what he's done. And that part where he days that he can't control himself just gives me the shivers. I would have to say that the best part of the film is just the concept in general. Some of the best scenes are where all the townsfolk are searching for Peter Lorre because the police won't do anything about him. My personal favorite part would have to be the scene near the end when all the people manage to trap him in a building and they search the entire thing looking for him.
