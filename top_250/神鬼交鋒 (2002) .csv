0,24 January 2003,jotix100,10, Witty con man.,From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.,/
1,8 June 2003,rbverhoef,9, A lot of fun,"While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.",r
2,18 March 2003,rosscinema,7, Very good film has those Spielberg edges!,"At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",e
3,17 January 2005,mjw2305,8, Hard to believe its true,"I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.",v
4,31 January 2017,TheLittleSongbird,9, A film well worth catching,"'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.",i
5,28 October 2020,Xstal,7, Genuinely Entertaining but Overly Embellished...,"Great performances from some truly great actors with an almost unbelievable story - and therein lies the one criticism if you wanted to raise one. Because, in order to catch you, which Steven Spielberg does, and finds doing it a good deal easier than the task ascribed before Carl Hanratty, he has to evolve and embellish this story with some not insignificant leaps of faith. Fine if its a conjured tale of fiction but ever so slightly, for me, detrimental to the experience as a whole, as its not.",e
6,22 May 2003,MovieAddict2016,8, Catch It If You Can!,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.",w

8,31 March 2005,camcmahon,8, I haven't read the book just yet - I definitely will now!,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.",r
9,16 April 2014,ironhorse_iv,8, Catch it if you can. I concur this movie is good.,"Catch Me If You Can is a pretty interesting movie that is supposedly based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars. He was allow to pull this off, by posing high income jobs, and forging payroll checks. The movie by Steven Spielberg is really trying hard, not to say based off true events, as the movie use 'inspired by a true story"" in order to avoid controversy similar to other past biographical films, which deviated from history. In my opinion, the movie doesn't deviated from the autobiography of Frank Abagnale too much. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenager Frank Abagnale who after witnessing his parents awful divorce, run away. When he runs out of money, he begins to rely on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons grow bolder and he even impersonates an airline pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. He drew attention by the FBI Bank fraud agency lead by Det. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Soon enough, it become a game of cat and mouse, with Frank trying everything to try to escape, and Carl trying everything to try to catch him. Set in the 1960s, the movie has this early James Bond type spy genre escapism theme going with it. Even the opening of the film by Olivier Kuntzel & Florence Deygas, looks something out of a 1960s spy film with its one of a kind title sequence. The slender Lowreyesque stamp style animation figures run through environments that symbolize key plot points from the film to the 1960s jazz-era score by John Williams is amazing and memorable. The movie was shot with bright vibrant colors, bringing out the world that no longer exist, built on trust and a firm handshake. There is a few historical anachronisms, but nothing really standing out for too long. The movie is pretty predictable as it gives you the whole story in the opening shot of the film. Approximately 80 percent of the movie is true based on Frank Abagnale Jr's account, but there were some stuff, they didn't mention on the film, the producers change or Frank just make it up. After all, Frank is indeed a consummate liar. Lots of plot holes or scenes never truly explain well. There is one outlandish scene with him looking for female airplane attendant recruits just in the space of one day and another one escaping a jet through the toilet. You have to hold, suspense of disbelief here. There was a stint, not added to the film, where Frank was professor of sociology at a college in Salt Lake City, Utah that was supposedly cut due to time constraints; but the truth is, the college, Brigham Young University, repudiates this claim that he never did teach there. The film, somewhat change it to him pretending to a French teacher in the beginning a local New York school. Another thing is his relationship with his father. In the film, Frank has a strong relationship with his dad. His father love that his son is stealing from the government and business, because they didn't support him when his business went under. Not in the case of real life, as his first victim was indeed his father stealing $3,400 from him in credit card fraud. Also, Abagnale never saw his father after he ran away from home, unlike the film. Other minor changes is that, the movie omitted his two jail attempts to get away from prison and his time in France. It would be nice to see that, both the movie would had been long. One more thing, FBI officer who was chasing Frank was really Joe Shea. Frank Abagnale Jr. used the pseudonym ""Sean O'Reilly"" in his book because Joe Shea was still in the F. B. I. He has since passed away, but the movie still used a new name, Carl Hanratty. I love the relationship between Frank and Carl in this movie. The chemistry in their respective roles is what breathes life into this film. There is a great scene at a motel between the two. The whole act was so risky. Leo play Frank with integrity and accuracy. He got the suave playboy down being bold and stylish. Tom Hanks was great as Carl. Season actor by this time, going toe to toe with a then, still-green, Leo. There is another great scene where both of their character call on Christmas. You can really tell the lack of family in Leo's character making him sympathy giving him a Freudian excuse. As less, he wasn't unlikeable. Catch me if You Can deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods so well. The female characters played by Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo and Elizabeth Banks were alright, but in my opinion, I have to say, Amy Adams as Brenda Strong was the best. Amy Adams as Brenda Strong gave one of the best performance in the film, as the emotional Brenda. I felt sad on what happen to her character. Also check out, the real Frank Abagnale as one of the French police officers toward the end. The music is great. I love the way, they use Frank Sinatra 'come fly with me'. Full of fantasy glam. The movie comes with a good moral message. Overall: Highly Informative and Incredibly Life Changing, Yet Subtly Descriptive and Wildly Entertaining. Worth the watch. So catch it!",w

11,16 February 2023,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Knock knock, it's a great movie.","Frank Abagnale Junior becomes an accomplished fraudster at a very young age, passing himself off as a pilot, and cashing banker's cheques galore. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty makes it his mission to track him down.",1
12,31 December 2020,deepfrieddodo,9, Ridiculous True Story,"Absurd that this is even remotely true, Catch Me If You Can is funny, engaging and exciting throughout. DiCaprio is perfect for the role, and even looks like a kid to fit in with the proposed age. He and Hanks have perfect chemistry, although it seems so strange for them to be so friendly with one another. Casting throughout was impressive, as were the settings and wardrobe. With such an impressive story though, the added Hollywood embellishments seem a little unnecessary, they add little and don't really seem worth swaying from the truth.",7
13,17 March 2006,slokes,8, Going Places,"Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of ""Catch Me If You Can"" convinced me I was wrong.

14,23 March 2010,Stampsfightclub,7, Worth catching,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Di Caprio) makes his way across America posing as a lawyer, a pilot, a doctor whilst all the while being chased by Carl Hanratty (Hanks) Based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale Jr. this ambitious crime caper is a turn for excitement harmless joy that encodes spurts of comedy in a dramatic construction of a man looking for a sense of mayhem and wealth, to live in his father's footsteps.",3
15,5 January 2020,cardsrock,9, Spielberg works his magic with fantastic results,"Catch Me If You Can is a breezy, energetic tale about a fascinating person in the the history of American criminals. DiCaprio and Hanks are perfectly cast and Walken nearly steals the movie from them. From the beginning credits, the vibe and tone Spielberg sets is instantly enjoyable and he manages to carry it all the way through the film. While this film is tons of fun, there is also a lot of depth and emotion, a Spielberg trademark. Spielberg adds yet another very well-crafted film to his impressive filmography.",6
16,19 February 2021,auuwws,7, Catch Me If You Can,"A very good movie. The acting in the film was average by most of the actors except for leonardo dicaprio, whose performance in the film was impressive and Tom Hanks was not a good character, the story of the film was good and interesting, I enjoyed watching it and I recommend watching it",1
17,8 January 2017,Hitchcoc,9," Like Father, Like son","This is a very good dramatic film. Frank W. Abignale is a successful con man. Sometimes he uses his skills by design; sometimes he uses it to get away from threats to his identity. This is a young man who is so traumatized by his parents' divorce, but because his father knew how to con people, he learned to do what his father did. He is not a mere con man, but a young guy with incredible skills. He passes himself off as a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, and on and on. Leonardo DeCaprio plays Abignale and Tom Hanks is the rather humorless FBI agent who makes Frank his number one project. The interaction is interesting because the two begin to like each other. Abignale actually starts to find a father figure in Hanks' character. This is based on a real character, the object of an autobiography.",/
18,1 July 2020,Ruskington,8, Brilliant source material expertly translated to the big screen,"A thoroughly enjoyable and often hilarious film that manages to avoid any level of pretentiousness or ostentation. DiCaprio is mesmerising in the lead role and there is a something of a breakthrough performance by a young Amy Adams. The film is maybe a touch too long and Christopher Walken is a little bit too Christopher Walken but this is generally what a Hollywood blockbuster should look, feel and sound like.",?

This was hyped up a little too much for me because I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.",r
20,6 June 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10, Only the best chase film EVER!,"More people need to talk about this film because it is worthy of its 8.1/10 stars on IMDB and with your help of watching this movie you can increase it. This is how movies are supposed to be made, one of Spielberg's best of the 2000's and it has great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Amy Adams, Jennifer Garner and many more brilliant actors. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as real life con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. feels like the real thing, it feels like they casted the real Abagnale at the correct age and this is your performance.",e

It is so funny how Frank passes himself off as a Pam Am pilot, a lawyer and a doctor all before he is 21. It is also a shame at the end where Carl tells Frank his father is dead and he doesn't believe it. It is funny at the beginning where Frank says he is dying and they take him to the hospital and he escapes and when he pretended to be a substitute teachers and calls himself Mr Abagnale and when he embarrasses the bully in front of the entire class!!!! He looks so cute as a boy!!",f
22,29 July 2021,kosmasp,9, Going Places,"When I first watched this, I was not too fond of it as I remember. I did not like it as much as I did now with the rewatch or second viewing one might say. I would not have said that I didn't like it from a technical point of view, but I think I was in a ""don't like Di Caprio"" phase. Which is something unfair - especially to the movies he has made. Don't know his personality, but that wasn't the reason I wasn't fond of him - it was just the usual reaction to someone being hailed as the end all and the best and so forth.",_
23,15 November 2020,filipemanuelneto,10, Entertains and amuses the audience.,"Directed by Steven Spielberg, who achieves with this film another success for his already long list of cinematic successes, this film is based very slightly on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a well-known American con man who, in his youth, stood out for the skill with which he forged checks, to the point of working today as a security consultant in this sector. The film follows the origins and life of the main character, as well as the original and daring way in which he escapes justice until he is invariably caught.",=
24,18 September 2021,briancham1994,9, Fast-paced con-man thriller,"This film is a classic Steven Spielberg film, with fast pacing that never lets down, exciting scenes that take the audience for a ride and family related drama where an estranged father and son try to make amends. Catch Me If You Can really hits the ground running with a dynamic faux-retro animated title sequence followed by an introduction to the father's con-man ways. Christopher Walken does well in his own awkward way, but it's Leonardo Dicaprio who really exudes the boyish charisma needed to bamboozle everyone. His improvised schemes combined with his immaturity lead to an endless series of ever-escalating moments where he twists his plans on the fly to escape the FBI, surprising the audience constantly. Lesson learned: It's amazing what he can get away with just by wearing the right kind of uniform and keeping his head high.",t

28,2 January 2004,mercuryadonis,5, In Speilberg's world...,"Welcome to Steven Speilberg's world, a parallel universe where nuance, subtlety and personal interpretation are non-existent.  In this world FBI agents are stumbling lead-footed stooges, wearing identical MIB suits and porkpie hats, who enter a suspected check-forger's apartment with handguns drawn, shouting ""CLEAR!"" as they stumble about from room to room.  In this world a love scene must be accompanied by items on a bedside room service cart being knocked off one-by-one.  A conversation between two secret agents must be shot in silhouette against an ominous blue background.  A police station should be as glossily lit as a top European fashion emporium.  The precocious hero must be able to escape an airplane lavatory in mere seconds, without tools, by removing 4 tiny screws.  The love interest must be blonde, the in-laws stern, the failed father edgy, brittle and possibly nuts (Christopher Walken will do).  And most of all the hero's dubious achievements must be shown to have benefited society in the long term and any of his character flaws attributed to youth, naivety and bad upbringing. After all, this is a movie and we can't have a fundamentally flawed hero or a morally ambiguous ending.  Even if the said ""hero"" bilked countless innocent people out 4 million dollars.",r

32,25 December 2002,Quinoa1984,9, it did make money over its time... entertaining,"...but did Steven Spielberg's latest Blockbuster-fodder, Catch Me If You Can, have to be released now? The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks have already turned in their best for the year (Gangs of New York and Road to Perdition, respectively), even if those performances weren't great, and Spielberg's other chase film released during the summer, Minority Report, was one of his best films. While the release date shouldn't directly effect the film itself, it might've given Scorsese's Gangs a little chance to breath without having this and that as two Leo films at once during the Christmas-break film rush.

35,27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8, Catch Me If You Can is a classic cat-and-mouse chase that feels refreshingly whimsical.,"Spielberg is damn versatile. He is able to craft some of cinema's hard hitting dramas (Schindler's List), biggest blockbusters (Jurassic Park) and child-friendly tales (E.T.). This film is rather overlooked in his filmography, which surprises me considering the talent on screen. Part biopic and dramatisation of Frank Abagnale Jr's youth where he was able to utilise the power of deception to successfully disguise himself as a pilot, doctor and prosecutor in order to check in cheques. The youngest counterfeiting fraudster in America at the time. The greatest compliment I can give the story, is that it doesn't take itself seriously. This could've been a melodramatic crime thriller, but instead Spielberg twists the style and turns it into an exciting watchable chase that consistently put a smile on my face. Would it have been more poignant and resonating if it was powerful? Perhaps, but the film successfully entertains and sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended). There was only one actor who could pull off the suave deceptive con artist, and that's Leonardo DiCaprio. An absorbing performance that gave him an opportunity to be slightly cheeky yet maintain a sense of class which I'm sure paved the way for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. I loved the use of psychology and how the human mind can be convinced through simple sleight of hand gestures. A story of how living in a lie can often feel better than residing in reality. Utilising false identities to reinvigorate one's self and change their way of living, albeit being extremely illegal. Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent tasked with hunting down Frank Jr with what is one of his lighter performances. A young Amy Adams was also likeable. Spielberg is a chameleon. He can take any genre and create an excellent film without the need of over-stylisation. His techniques just blend in. Also, the opening credits scene was hypnotising, adored the animation. An irresistible light hearted tale.",
36,10 April 2018,michaelRokeefe,9, Innovative false pretenses.,"Steven Spielberg directs this fun to watch cat and mouse race about a teenage runaway turned con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). The young man is quick witted and innovative enough to pull off a carefree spree of convincing people at various times that he was an airline pilot, a doctor, a college professor and a legal prosecutor without even a high school diploma. And to support this giant pretense is his ability to create and cash millions of dollars in fraudulent checks.

The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe.  An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru ""Gladiator"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Elizabeth"", and the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest].

46,1 May 2014,raulfaust,7, Getting Away With Murder,"Well, first I'd like to comment how easy it is to lure spectator into this movie, due to the great names involved in this project. Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken are what made me wanna see it. To be honest, the film as a whole is good. Frank Jr. is a guy who is willing to do anything in his power to make easy money, even if it means stealing and cheating all around. There are plenty of moments in which the spectator gets to think ""he won't get away with it"", but, surprisingly, the well written plot always allows him escaping from the FBI. However, sometimes the way DiCaprio's character gets away feels over-the-top, considering that people wouldn't be THAT dumb in real life. I mean, how would Frank Jr. work as a physician in a hospital without EVER being asked about diseases or something related to it? Wouldn't Brenda's family make questions involving medicine? So, in my opinion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a well directed movie that entertains the spectator for the whole time, but sometimes admits to be just a movie and not a real thing.",

Based on his autobiography (which he wrote with Stan Redding), it charts Abagnale's exploits as a teenager who made millions of dollars through cheque fraud, travelled extensively at no cost to himself and assumed a number of fake identities with such success that he quickly achieved a glamorous lifestyle, great personal wealth and the attentions of numerous young women. Inevitably, his activities also attracted the attention of the FBI and led to him getting involved in a protracted cat-and-mouse game with one of their agents.",
49,26 September 2019,matthewssilverhammer,9, Easily my favorite Spielberg / Hanks Collab,"This is easily my favorite Hanks / Spielberg collaboration, & maybe the funniest film in Spielberg's history. A wonderfully written Christmas movie that perfectly encapsulates the disillusionment of material wealth in lieu of loving, familial connection. It's a more empathetic version of Spielberg's usual father-issues motif, though the child still struggles with his father's selfishly poor decisions. DiCaprio & Hanks are super good, but my MVP is Walken, turning in a performance as sad as it is charismatic.",

That is just the case with Stephen Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the most successful and intelligent con men of all time. When Frank is sixteen his father runs into problems with the IRA and loses his entire fortune, which also prompts his wife to leave him. From then on Frank vows to earn back his father's savings. He does so through a slightly (i.e. extremely) illegal manner. Check fraud. Frank travels the world taking on different personas, faking work as a pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc. But once the money he is illegally earning starts to build up, red flags go up for the FBI and Agent Carl Hanratty, played so well by Tom Hanks, sets out on an obsessive quest to chase down and capture Frank.The film is clever, quick, and an absolute blast.",

55,29 August 2009,paul2001sw-1,6, No kind of everyman,"The story of Frank Abegnale Jr., teenage conman extraordinaire, should make for an entertaining movie; but in Stephen Spielberg's hands, the story falls a little flat. Partly this is due to the casting of the dull Leonardo di Caprio in the leading role; and partly because the careful reconstruction of the 1960s is too familiar from countless other movies to be interesting in itself. Mostly, however, the film loses impact because of Spielberg's apparent determination to weave boringly quintessential themes into his story; instead of an epic tale of derring-do, at times it unfolds like a dull tale of a kid who loves his family trying to live the American dream. This may or may not be how it happened; but personally, I think there would have been more interest in the movie without the attempt to depict its frankly remarkable anti-hero as some kind of everyman.",

Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks had very good chemistry together. I liked the way how DiCaprio was able to perform Abagnale. The whole concept of this film is highly interesting. it's nice to learn how con artists operated back in the 60's. The music by John Williams is another classic but it is different than his usual music. You can tell that it's by Williams, but the music has more of a jazz sound. Overall, this is a very good drama by Steven Spielberg. I rate this movie 10/10.",

It had some great comedic moments, and I felt that it was an entertaining flick all the way till the end. How much of it is true is beyond my knowledge, but for a man to get away with so much.. it's kinda crazy. I will say that other than the great characters and their development, this did not feel like a Spielberg film. It just didn't have that masterful touch that I usually get from his other films. Is that bad? Well, no. It just doesn't feel like his best movie. So in conclusion I gave Catch Me If You Can a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10. Although I wanted to give it an ""Alright"" this film's characters and actors were outstanding and really made this film a good movie. The small issues with how the story was told, and Jennifer Garner's character (kidding) really held this film down from being a truly memorable one. If this film showed each event in chronological order this movie would have had great suspense and would have be a great movie overall, yet all it really gives us was Jennifer Gardner, and no one really wants that.",

And a true story it may be, but all of Abegnale's daring deeds and frantic escapes are oversimplified in this telling - everything he does seems too easy and natural for him. Showing the difficulty the real Abegnale would have had to endure would add some realism and make the tale less of a fantasy escape, which is what it ultimately ends up as. ",

This fits with my impression of it the second time around (if, indeed, there was a first time around). It's no surprise that it's technically immaculate - the editing especially impressed me, and of course, the performances are superb throughout. Entertaining and even fun as it is, it all adds up to something insubstantial and lightweight - and that's probably down to the writing. We never really get to the root of why Abagnale does all that he's portrayed as doing, and the breezy tone risks making light of serious crimes - crimes, which as far as the film is concerned, seem to be victimless (which of course they aren't). To that end, it reminded me of a film with the same star - The Wolf Of Wall Street ... entertaining but as light as a feather. Bridge Of Spies I recall felt similar (though I do need to revisit that also ... and that would definitely be a revisit). Spielberg can produce better straight-out entertainment (that doesn't feel so thin), and he can also make 'serious films about weighty themes that keep the viewer gripped. This falls frustratingly between the two.",

One day, his father has a problem with IRS. The Abagnale family looses all their assets for the government, becoming very poor.  But his great deception happens when his parents decide to divorce. He leaves home with nothing but his checks and a few clothes, and moves to New York City. There, it is very difficult for a boy alone get a job, so he decides to use his checks without funds. Then he pretends to be a Pan An pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, being chased by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), but always escaping. He becomes one of the greatest con man of USA, being in the list of the most wanted. Carl only arrests him in France. A movie directed by Steven Spielberg and with Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken in the cast is the synonym of a good and high quality movie.

68,9 September 2013,cartman_1337,8, A welcome departure from Spielberg's usual style,"This is the story of perhaps the biggest American fraudster in history, and the cat-and-mouse chase to catch him. A hunt that in many ways brought Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) together, since in many ways they were each other's lives at the time, and culminated in a lifelong friendship. Frank Abagnale Jr.'s story is an incredible one. By the time he turned 18, he had successfully played the roles of an airline captain, a doctor and a lawyer, and cashed in false checks for over $2.5 million. This is the film of his story, based on Frank's own accounts of the events. And it is an exceptionally entertaining film. Cocky con artists succeeding pretty much always make for a fun film, and when it's based on the true events of a young and likable man, it gets even more fun. It's amazing what you can get away with a little ingenuity and enormous amounts of nerve. But there's of course a price to pay when your whole life revolves around living a lie.",

He leaves home when his parents' marriage fails then tries to cash cheques but nobody will except a cheque from an unknown teenager; then he hits upon an idea; he will become an airline pilot! Not a real pilot of course but with a uniform and a fake ID getting cheques cashed is easy; he also learns that it can get him free flights on other airlines. As he racks up the miles and cashes more and more cheques Agent Hanratty takes an interest in him and at one point almost catches him. It is time to hang up the uniform but Frank isn't going to stop his game; he spends time working as a doctor and then a lawyer before he is forced to run; eventually he is caught of course we'd seen that at the beginning.

The main character is a criminal...a very bad man who hurt a lot of people....though the film makes him look pretty cool and clever. I've dealt with a man just like Frank from the film....and they aren't cool but selfish and vicious. They are sociopaths who have no conscience and leave a LONG trail of injured people due to their behaviors.

It seemed to me to be a vehicle for a smug Leonardo DiCaprio outwitting the authorities at every turn. Now I've watched it, I admit that I was completely wrong. DiCaprio plays a thoroughly sympathetic character whose side you are on from the outset thanks to a clever set-up involving his relationship with his father, a decent Christopher Walken. The viewer can then sit back and simply enjoy watching him as he attempts to beat the system by becoming a master fraudster. The fact that this is a true story helps a lot too.

The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, giving the best performance of his career, as Frank Abagnale, Jr., who successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars, way before his 19th birthday. He was able to accomplish this crime by posing as a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, and a prosecutor. Since his primary crime was check fraud, Tom Hanks and the rest of the FBI are trying catch this maniac. This is truly one of Spielberg's best films, and I think I already knew that I would love it. Steven Spielberg delivers a fine directing job in this movie, and he truly knocked the ball out of the park once again. As for the acting, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the entire movie as Frank Abagnale, Jr., and he should have received a Best Actor nomination. Tom Hanks is just awesome in this movie, playing FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who tries to catch Abagnale and throw him into custody. Amy Adams is pleasant in this film as DiCaprio's nurse girlfriend, and Christopher Walken brings his classic ""nice guy"" attitude in an Oscar-nominated performance as Abagnale's father. Once again, this is another classic Spielberg collaboration, and it has never looked better. John Williams makes a classic original score, Janusz Kaminski creates fine cinematography, Michael Kahn delivers unique film editing, and Jeff Nathanson has created such a brilliant well-written script that really recreates the life of this regular criminal. This movie is filled with surprising drama, some funny laughs, and some brilliant touching moments that only the greatness of Spielberg can provide.

124,11 March 2005,jboothmillard,8, Catch Me If You Can,"Director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) had charmed and affected audiences all over, but there was no sign of a film based on a true story, that is until this one came along. Basically, FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is picking up his inmate from French prison, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio), and through a series of flashbacks we see how he became the youngest and one of the most ruthless con-men in America. Hse has his mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) and father Frank Sr. (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken) separate, and just before turning nineteen, he runs away from home. He is determined to regain every penny that his father lost, and he successfully takes on many false identities in order to con his way to millions of dollars. In the process he passes as a history professor, airline pilot, a doctor and an assistant attorney general (lawyer). He also manages to have a one night stand with hooker Cheryl Ann (Jennifer Garner), before finding true (if that word can be used) love with nurse Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). Eventually his movements are being clocked by the FBI, led by Hanratty, who at one point comes face to face with his culprit, but he does get to him eventually. In the end, after many escapes and more attempts, Frank finally decides to stop, and finds a very good way to compensate by helping his now friend Carl catch other cons for the FBI. Also starring Martin Sheen as Roger Strong, James Brolin as Jack Barnes and Slither's Elizabeth Banks as Lucy. DiCaprio is fantastic as the young con, Hanks of course pulls his role off with ease, and Walken is a very good choice as the con's father, it is funny, moving and most watchable, a good fun biographical comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for John Williams, and it nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Costume Design, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, Christopher Walken number 34, and Tom Hanks number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",
125,9 January 2009,smoky_circles,3," The most saccharine, sentimental depiction of sociopathy, ever","Frank is a con-(young)-man. He cashes fake checks totaling up to millions, cheats and lies his way into several professions, and charms several women onto his sheets...but that is just because he is a lonely, lost boy, because his father was always in money trouble, and he had a broken home. He writes sentimental letters to his father, offers him expensive gifts, and talks about his mother rejoining them. He is actually a genius, see, and, when given the chance, proves himself to be virtuous by helping the authorities. And he has good, honest, hardworking potential too!! -- he passed the bar exam all on his own after loads of studying. This movie struck me as so false throughout that I couldn't help but see through it and overcompensate for its dishonesty and false sentimentality by continuously re-imagining it: what might REALLY have happened? How sociopathic might Frank have been to lie, cheat and steal so easily and continuously? How many women might he have slept, really? And how many times did people catch on to him? A brief look at a wiki article proved my suspicions. Frank's first victim was his own father. He ran away from home and never looked back. He failed the bar exam several times and his passing may have involved bribery and other methods of cheating. After being placed in prison he tried to escape to Brazil but was caught repeatedly. His cons sometimes failed as people suspected his lies. If this story was even mildly hollywoodized, I would have been fine with it (and if the writing, acting and visuals weren't as bland). But it takes sentiment and dishonesty to the oomphth degree. Take for example the window scene near the end. It again reinforced the theme that Frank was just a lost and lonely boy who committed all these crimes because he missed his mother. And the cheesy label-removing motif. That was just a waste. Tom Hank's character was worst at the beginning when he was going room to room shouting comically and trembling like an old lady. He got slightly better at the end. Leonardo's character was as I mentioned unnatural and flat, so I guess he made the best of it. The female characters were very fake and comic-booky and annoying, yelling ""yes, yes"" during the sex scenes or crying after being yelled at by their boss and falling bashfully head over heels for the guy who comforts them. The worst offenders might have been the FBI and law enforcement folk who were a bunch of bumbling cartoonish idiots, too shy to reach their arms over for a fork. There were also a whole bunch of random scenes that didn't give anything to the movie. Some, like the prostitute scene seemed to be out of nowhere and would have fit in more if the whole movie wanted to show Frank as mildly sociopathic (which would have been more realistic). The one scene that I did like was when the agent came to France to see Frank's setup. Money flying everywhere and tilted camera angles gave it a cool look. But even then you are given the dishonest condition of Frank in stress and somewhat unraveling, a condition which screams at you, 'hey! look! look how worn out and rambling he looks! This criminal spree is taking a toll on him too, you know. He does have a heart!'",

With 'Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the youngest person to appear on the F.B.I. most wanted list. His father was arrested for tax fraud, which led to the loss of their home and a divorce soon afterwards. Frank splits and learns the art of impersonation and becomes an airline pilot, a professor, and a medical physician all while dodging the law. Great work by Steven Spielberg who also scored with Minority Report the same year. DiCaprio is superb with the impersonations and lifestyles as he attempts to elope as well as stay ahead of authority. Tom Hanks is funny as an F.B.I. agent propelled by his unwillingness to be outsmarted. This leads to a lot of humour and an unlikely respect. Christopher Walken is terrific as Frank's father whom himself was a fraud but not as successful as his son. His wife is having an affair, which trails to his unfortunate fate. Martin Sheen appears as a potential in-law who sees through DiCaprio. More of Sheen would have been great. Amy Adams plays a nurse whose abortion caused a division between herself and her parents until DiCaprio enters their lives. It seems to reference old spy films, and is styled similar to The Pink Panther and equally curious. Score: 9 / 10",

Also, Christopher Walken is excellent and Tom Hanks does that thing that he does which is to pull off an extremely good performance without actually trying.

Even though the story is based on a true story/autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr., it all seems like some crazy Hollywood plot that's just too irresistible not to love. As for the rest of the cast, Tom Hanks is (as always) thoroughly reliable as the G-man set on catching Abagnale. Christopher Walken steals every scene he exists in as dad Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank Jr.'s impetus and inspiration for his outlandish check fraud spree. Like father, like son indeed. Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner make delightful appearances in key scenes and John Williams' score is top notch, perfectly catching the snappy-cool kitsch of the 60's in every note.

Same goes for Tom Hank's catcher, who incidentally, finds it difficult to do the catching.

For most of the 90's, especially post Titanic there wasn't a single girl over the age of 8 who wasnt in love with him. He was the epitome of a teenage heartthrob. While his acting in such films as This Boys Life, Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, The Baskeball Diaries, and the aforementioned Titanic was to me superb, I hadnt seen a perofrmance that made me set him above his contemporaries. This was the one. He became a Man in this movie to me, shedding the stigma of a pretty boy to a truely acclaimed thespian.
Tom Hanks was a good as he always is, though i felt at times left wondering what James Gandolfini would have done differently with the role. Hanks just does what we always expect, turns in a great performance with what seems like no effort.
The Best performance to me in the Film( apart from Leo's) is Christopher Walkens. Every scene he is in, you really feel the pain that he is going through as he loses everything. I cant really express in words the emotion he evokes, but watch the scene where he is pleading in the bank for some assistance.
Look for other great small performances from Martin Sheen, and a really young Amy Adams.",

153,4 November 2020,yusufpiskin,10," ""I'm your deadhead. - The James Bond of the sky.""","Steven Spielberg didn't need to make this movie. Come 2002, he had nothing else to prove. By then he had made Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report. And yet, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN surpasses all of those in my opinion. And I'd argue that it's the last truly great film he's made. This is first class Spielberg, showing him having a blast just making a film about normal individuals. He turns the fascinating but also inconsequential true story of Frank Abagnale Jr and makes it as enthralling, cinematic and deeply sad as his high concept or important historical pictures. The pacing feels reminiscent of Hitchcock's North by Northwest, with opening credits that'd make Saul Bass proud. Every technical decision, performance and piece of writing here is on point. It's just the most fun you can have with his filmography, reminding you that real life can be as memorable, if not more so, than the Cinema.",

156,6 February 2013,ashi-lance,9, Catch Me...,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic movies like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List and E.T., yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end. Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film, perhaps more as we see him in 2nd lead Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly. When his parents file for divorce and he has to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each step he takes. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. He is able to do all these sort of crimes inspired by comic books and experiences he got from things around him. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse. Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is more enjoyable for being a true story. If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the entire film length!! To be fair – the film didn't sets out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.",

I can't not mention the really sexy erotic score by John Williams which is a beautifully stunningly sexy showcase for the saxophone just beautifully erotic and sexy which is really interesting for John Williams because it is rare for Him and Steven Spielberg to direct and compose a score for a film like this they have not made a film like this recently a sexy erotic score with almost no other musical accompaniment the stunningly sexy saxophone solos are beautifully composed and painstakingly planned and timed to perfection just classy and sexy Thanks John Williams yet again it is an beautifully gorgeous sexy sophisticated score and your outstandingly beautifully sexy musical contribution to the film is undeniably perfection sheer perfection!

I think the best part about it was that you care. You care about Frank even though you really shouldn't because he's a criminal.

The cast is first rate which includes French actress, Nathalie Baye, as his French mother, Ellen Pompeo before Grey's Anatomy, Kitty Carlisle as herself, and the Oscar winner Tom Hanks. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg. The film is quite detailed about Frank's life conning everybody from his parents to everybody else. The film earned several Academy Award nominations. It's a smart film but it's too long. It does bring back the Pan Am airline legacy even for a little while. Before 1991, Pan Am Airlines was the king of the airlines before it closed down due to poor mishandled financial matters and weak security which helped cause the 1988 disaster.

Based on a true story!? This happened in real life! I just had to find out what in the world was he doing being able to do all that!? Quite an interesting story.
It's about Frank Abagnale Jr.(Leonardo Dicaprio) a young man who was able to con people being a doctor, a legal prosecutor and a pilot. And now the FBI , specifically Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is trying to catch him.
This was just incredible and shocking. Purely intelligent to be able to pull off something like this. What he did with those toy airplanes from Pan AM, that was genius, I was really impressed. How can someone have the guts to do all this and not be afraid of being caught just blows my mind.
Even though Frank was busy making money and impersonating different professions , he was lonely, missing his mom and dad very much wishing he had the old life he had with them. He was hoping all the money he was making can take him back to the way they were but it didn't. And he very much looked up to his father (Christopher Walken) they insinuated he had a part in making him the way he was. I wasn't very happy with his mom and her actions. A woman who looks for opportunities only.

The movie starts off with a game show talking about why he did all of this. Then it goes to Frank in French prison in 1969, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He tries to escape but the flashes back to 1963 with his father, played by Christopher Walken, winning some kind of award. Later his father is investigated for tax fraud. As his father slowly loses his fortune and gets divorced Frank runs away. He learns coning from some tips his father did earlier in the movie. After coning as an airline pilot he starts to get the attention of an FBI agent Carl, played by Tom Hanks. Carl almost gets Frank but he gets away the first time they meet. Then he cons as a doctor to throw the FBI off and then a lawyer. You probably know from the opening Frank will get caught eventually. Thought after he gets back to America the ending is actually pretty good and satisfying. I think this movie also started to create the 60's craze until Mad Men perfected it a bit later.

Bouncing checks and impersonating a teacher, pilot, doctor and lawyer. This movie is one I come back to again and again and I'm annoyed that it's no longer on Netflix. Going through this film everything that happens you can't even believe that it's the story of a true person. Tom Hanks is cast amazingly as an FBI agent who has been through a rough life and has thrown his life into his work and catching Frank. Dicaprio is also cast pretty well as a suave but unexperienced kid run-away turned into a criminal con-man. My one problem with the casting is that Frank is supposed to be 15-21. Granted the fact that Dicaprio looks older helps with the believability of the movie, but it's still something you notice from time to time.

After getting caught by ruthless F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty, Abignale wrote an outstanding memoir, which has been quite faithfully brought to the screen. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite great here as Abignale and Hanks is good as Hanratty. After watching it, reading the book and then watching it again, I feel the book is slightly better, as the movie leaves holes in subplots the movie alludes to, but doesn't explore further (like his time in jail, and his relations with the Pan-Am recruits, which, bizarrely in the movie, is just dropped, making me wonder what on earth it was there for).

Con artists have to be likable, and they have to be so convincing that ""being taken"" never enters your mind. The perfect con is one where the mark never realizes he or she has been had. Frank Abagnale Jr. was one smart and likable kid who realized early on that a lot of decisions are often based on artificial perceptions which may have nothing to do with reality. If you lay in front of people certain visual clues which play into people's preconceived notions, including their prejudices (which can be sometimes positive), you can steer people into a particular understanding which may have nothing to do with reality. Abagnale decided to test this idea by dressing as an airline pilot. And it worked; he found that simply wearing the uniform convinced people he was an airline pilot, and therefore trustworthy.",

So many things just didn't add up, particularly in some of the characterisations - the young girl's parents, for instance, just weren't the type to have thrown her out of the house when they found she was pregnant. No, reality really is better than fiction and all those things that Spielberg added in a naive attempt to interest the audience were just the things which turned them off.

233,29 December 2002,mrow,8, An entertaining film,"Just a short piece about ""Catch Me..""  (no spoilers here).  I think Leonardo C  was correctly cast. They needed someone who could pass for age 18 but also who was pretending to be  8 or 10 years older, as the featured main-character/con artist. He does look awfully young, but I think it came off ok.   The understated score was by Williams (no surprise) but was very different from other works he has done, and generally works well for the film. It is as unlike the score for Harry Potter as night and day, and does demonstrate Williams' versatility (although Schindler's List has long since put any concerns in that area to rest). I was not able to identify the composer prior to seeing his name, momentarily wondering if it might possibly be Dave Grusin or perhaps J. N. Howard or even Howard Shore.  The director is an excellent storyteller, but I am left wondering how others might have handled certain treatments.  There was good audience reaction and I would imagine it will continue to do well at the box office.  I would like to find out what the budget was, but for dart-throwing fun I would guess it at $75mil.  Tom Hanks as the hapless FBI agent-in-charge is entertaining as well, and Christopher Walken also has a good part in this. I would imagine that I will see this film again, sometime.",

The movie by itself is simple without complex storylines or profound meanings, but it's fine this way because the movie does its job: entertain.

For starters, the financial strain on his parents is beginning to show and to make matters worse is the fact that his mother ""Paula Abagnale"" (Nathalie Baye) has begun to have an affair with an old friend of the family. So when they announce their divorce he decides to run away with the hope of somehow making enough money to bring them back together. To do that he resorts to forging checks and impersonating people in various professions which include pretending to be an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. Eventually, however, the FBI gets involved with one specific agent by the name of ""Carl Hanratty"" (Tom Hanks) being particularly tenacious in his efforts to arrest him and have him imprisoned. Yet as hard as Carl works, Frank Jr. Seems to always be one step ahead. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that even though this film was based on a true story there were several embellishments to make it more entertaining to the viewers. A typical Hollywood practice.

246,2 March 2015,bbewnylorac,7, An enjoyable film,"I loved Frank Abagnale's autobiography so I was worried what Steven Spielberg would do with the film, given he's known for giving his subjects the big Hollywood treatment. I was pleasantly surprised - I guess Abagnale's incredible true story suited the big treatment. Leonardo Di Caprio accurately captures Abagnale's immaturity and impulsiveness, disastrously combined with his fierce intelligence. He becomes a master con man living out every fantasy, as a pilot, a lawyer, a teacher, and even a doctor, and manages to swiftly dodge the consequences for years. It's comical, in a way, seeing the sheer audacity and inventiveness of the man. I love the scene where he strides across the airport with the air hostesses in their chic suits. It's funny to see how trusting and gullible companies such as banks and airlines and hotels were in the 1960s, and Frank just exploits it to the hilt. But also, as in the book, we see how terribly sad Abagnale is. In the end he has only his wits to live on, and it can't last if he's going to live a normal life. Things I don't like include how overblown the music score is. I hate it when the music tells you how you're supposed to feel in a scene. I don't like Tom Hanks as the detective -- he's too much of a clown. I love Christopher Walken as Frank's dad, also a bit of a sad character. Also the film does go on a bit long, but then there is a lot of Abagnale's life to squeeze on to the screen.",

I have not read the book yet, so am a little unsure what is fact and what is Hollywood, but it did seem strange that he was captured 3 times.  Interesting performance by a New England accented Tom Hanks, who seems to be giving us his best Jack Webb impersonation.  Leo is solid as the con on the run and was a nice selection with his natural charm.  However, nowhere near as dynamic a performance as he gives in ""Gangs of New York"".  Stealing every scene was Christopher Walken.  Known mostly over the last 20 years for his goofing as frequent host of Saturday Night Live, Walken reminds of why he was thought to be a real up and comer in ""The Deer Hunter"".  I got chills as Walken swells with pride in his son as he realizes Frank has the establishment on the run. Really thought many of the scenes with his fiance and her family were idealized and were there to show how Frank missed being part of a family unit.  Again, I don't know the facts of the case, this is just a perception. Spielberg gets some nice supporting performances out of Mr. Barbra Streisand (James Brolin), Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner.

Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio are charismatic enough to keep things lively and entertaining, but their roles feel so stiff and rails-bound that there isn't room for them to add much in the way of extra spice. For the most part, the film's happy to ease back into simple escapism, embracing DiCaprio's shameless con-man tendencies as heroic and admirable, even when the repercussions couldn't have been pretty. Particularly uncomfortable is his stretch in residency as an MD, largely played for laughs, where he toys with more than just bankers' checkbooks. Christopher Walken appears in a throwaway role as the escapee's hard-luck father, but fails to pluck any of the intended heart strings and thus barely registers as more than an extended cameo. Satisfying at times, especially when it's inspecting the hard work and tireless attention to detail that's essential to such dirty work (not to mention the rewards), it whiffs on any aspirations to challenge grander themes.",

299,16 September 2008,kyle-cruse,8," Fun, fascinating film","Based on true story of con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. (played here by Leonardo DiCaprio) and the detective (Tom Hanks) in pursuit of him, ""Catch Me If You Can"" proved to be a fun-filled, fascinating movie. Rather than telling this story as accurately as possible, Spielberg manages to spice it up with tons of little bits of humor and fascinating facts rather than just tell it as a straight story. There is enough humor here for this to be a comedy, from Abagnale pretending to be a substitute teacher to get back at some students who made fun of him to him pretending to be a former graduate from Harvard to impress his girlfriend (Amy Adams) and her father (Martin Sheen). On the other hand, there is a moving story here, dealing with the struggles in this man's life and his family. It is truly a fascinating story on its own, especially the areas regarding Abadnale's high level of intelligence, and it is a story told very well here. The film could afford to be shortened a bit, as it tends to be a little long overall, particularly with the long scenes with Abagnale and his father (Christopher Walken) and other scenes having to do with his family. The recurring Christmas theme is also somewhat unnecessary and not necessarily beneficial. Nevertheless, this is an impressive movie, one of Spielberg's best, in my opinion. Not entirely perfect, but not too far off. Worthwhile for just about anyone, especially if you like excitement as well as great character studies.",

One example: setting up his print shop in the French town his mother was from. He had five million dollars. He could have gone anywhere.

I also wonder why watch a movie about a faker? This movie glorifies the cheat at the expense of the honest people of that era, which I find rather sad. Who wouldn't want to go back to that time compared to now, at least for a visit? The action was also rather tepid. I'm not sure the casting was right either. The movie could have been a lot better maybe if the actors were in to it a little more. A decade earlier, this would have been a perfect movie for Val Kilmer and Tommy Lee Jones with stepped up action sequences and pace. Leo's pleading personality also seemed a little too much for me compared to the smoother style of the real life version, who whose common working class looks allowed him to slip through the cracks of the system easier. Also, Tom Hanks as the Fed was all covered up with hat and coat most of the time, making it hard to develop his character. The musical score was also boring. That said, Steven Spielberg doesn't make bad movies, this one sort of labored on in an autobiographical way and was not as engaging as others he's done and lacked something I can't put my finger on. At the end of the day, the movie failed to plie the viewer and for that reason in my opinion is over-rated on this site. Also recommend watching original first for comparison.",

Not that it isn't entertaining, it is quite entertaining, but once the effects of this sugarcoated, high-gloss 'true story' wear off, it makes you wonder why we should really care about some kid who ran around the globe forging checks and seducing girls with low self-esteem to get ahead in his extortion scams.

The kid is not a bad guy after all and has a lot of chances to show his good sentiments. He almost always behaves nicely. The affection developed between chaser and chased (maybe the most important feature of the movie) is not deeply explored. Well the story is a bit lukewarm and makes you sometimes think how is it possible that the kid has not been caught on several occasions. We only believe it due to to the great individual freedom and personal mobility that exist (and existed already in the sixties when the story takes place) in USA with the possibility of people changing their names all the time if they want to, etc.. I think in most European countries that kid would be caught very soon with our much more tight personal controls, mandatory identity cards, etc.. Concerning the acting, Di Caprio is equal to himself as we know him and in my opinion Tom Hanks' real talent is waisted in this movie. By the way a curious note: FBI agents are not shown here as the usual supermen and heroes but many of them as somewhat poor guys and not very bright. Well just a tolerable movie no more than that.",

You have everything around you that can make you happy related to material. But the thing inside of you makes you condemn. Because you can not say it out loud to others to accept. It is very hard to tolerate to bear. You know a simple incident could happen to many of you but you can't confess or sometime hide. When you find the similar thing also happen to someone else then you will find that it's not only you there are someone else who are like you. It seems like someone share your burden and feel much better. The story of the movie tell you that you are not alone and of-course teaches you not to take a role of the same mistake.

If I had the chance to make multi-millions and be an international sex star I probably would sell out too. His performance in this along with the rest of his films is superb. Unfortanetly Tom Hanks does exactly what he always does, act poorly. He always plays tom hanks playing someone else, he's not playing the FBI agent, he's playing tom hanks as the FBI agent. Tom Hanks AS Tom Hanks AS some character. Once again, Spielberg also is merely mediocre. He has no edge nor directorial creativity and hardly does anything but tell an interesting story in a very bland way. The best part of the movie was the opening credits which was a throwback to the classic graphics of the opening credits of the 1950 (eg. anatomy of a murder) Walken plays his role quite well though.

The real Frank Abagnale, Jr. must have been 10 times slicker than Leonardo because the character as he portrays him wouldn't have been able to con me out of so much as a dollar bill and the FBI agent that Tom Hanks plays isn't too bright. How he ever let Abagnale get away from him as many times as he did is beyond me, but then again, based on recent news the FBI appears to be about as bright as Barney Fife so I guess they really did let this kid slip through their fingers on more than one occasion and make fools out of them all.",

337,4 December 2013,reissd2,9, A Great Film,"Catch Me if You Can is a fast-past adventure, but a major departure from Spielberg's usual films involving dinosaurs and aliens. Spielberg shows in this film that he is more than capable of creating an entertaining film without the use of expensive special effects. The film is a biographical true crime film depicting the life of conman and counterfeiter, Frank Abagnale. As a teenager, Abagnale began a crime spree that would result in him cashing over $2.5 million in fraudulent checks and take on the false identities of a pilot, pediatrician, lawyer and college professor. In the film, Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins his crime spree after his parent's divorce. When he is faced with deciding which parent will retain custody he decides to run away. Throughout the film, Abagnale uses various identities including that of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer to facilitate his check cashing schemes. It's clear that Abagnale hopes that with enough money he can somehow reunite his separated parents. Throughout the narrative, Abagnale is hounded by FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows a begrudging respect for the young con artist. The development of their relationship is very believable and adds a lot of depth to the overall narrative of the story. Leonardo DiCaprio masterfully takes on the challenging role of Abagnale simultaneously illustrating to the audience Abagnale's genius (albeit misguided) and his naivety regarding his family. Christopher Walken provides great acting as Abagnale's father while Tom Hanks provides his usual great acting acumen portraying an FBI agent who becomes a father figure to the troubled Frank Abagnale. If there is one aspect of where the film fails is its failure to truly analyze the real Frank Abagnale's motives. The motivations of Abagnale are romanticized throughout the film as a young boy who naively believe he can bring his parents back together. The real Abagnale wasn't so innocent and was far more motivated by women and using his ill-gotten wealth to meet beautiful young women all over the world. This weakness is rather small and takes away none of the entertainment value that the film has to offer. This film is incredibly well acted and is a rare true crime film that deviates from the expected blood and gore of the drama usual of the genre.",

We dont want to know what happens at the start we want to find out at the end!Only films like Momento can pull this off and this is no Momento.

Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding an honest, bittersweet quality to the movie, and his relationship with his son made for the most moving scenes of the film. Tom Hanks has the perfect dry wit in his role of Carl Hanratty, and his portrayal of the somewhat nerdy, striving foil to Leonardo DiCaprio's smooth character created a lot of comedic moments. ",

Carl resists to believe anything he says and still doubts while handcuffed, but French cops arrive soon later. This scene is especially interesting to me because I bet on Carl telling the truth because Frankie's counterpart has to be opposite of consistent lying, fake, and counterfeit, and the movie needs at least one morally good thing. Bringing Carl to Frank's level would have been too devastating. This kind of personal call of anticipation in addition to wonderful score brings in more suspense.",

The film also stars Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the FBI special agent assigned to track down Frank Jr. By telling this cat-and-mouse story from both the perspective of the cat and the mouse, director Steven Spielberg shows that hard work and honesty are more rewarding in the long run than any get rich quick scheme.",

350,5 June 2003,FilmOtaku,8, Entertaining and fast paced,"Catch Me If You Can, the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. is compelling from the stylish opening credits to the very satisfying ending.  I'll be honest, I have a love/hate relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio  I want to hate the guy, but once in awhile he comes out with a performance like the one in this film and I have to admit that he really is a good actor.  He convincingly portrays Abagnale, a teen who managed to outrun the FBI for years - all the while writing over 4 million dollars in bad checks, posing as an airline co-pilot, a physician and an attorney.  Throughout the film, he is pursued by Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks with whom he develops an interesting relationship. 	 While I admit to enjoying Spielberg's action and effects-driven films, I also enjoy the smaller pictures he produces as well.  This film is a prime example.  I completely forgot this was a Spielberg picture, something I consider to be a great compliment.  When a director doesn't have a defining style, it shows an immense amount of talent, and more importantly, lacks the predictability that we see all too often in Hollywood today, especially in the case of someone with such a storied and lengthy repertoire as Spielberg. Granted, Spielberg had the good fortune to have an excellent script and three fantastic actors (DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken) to work with, but the direction is practically flawless in that there are no slow moments; everything happens for a reason and is integral to the progression of the plot.  It goes without saying that a film that is close to two and a half hours in length can have lulls, or seem to be too long, but I found that I did not consider the length once while viewing it.  ",
351,21 May 2017,tupungato,10, Excellent,"This movie certainly entertains, but a viewer can find it as suspenseful as he does informative, touching, and powerful, given that such a con- artist, who deceived hospital administrators, airline pilots, and lawyers, and made the FBI look unprofessional and foolish, really did exist. Christopher Walken does a commendable job as Frank Abagnale Senior, the failed father who exudes irresponsibility and has a victim's ready excuse for his mistakes. Interesting to see how Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio), though he grows to see his father more clearly, deals with his hurt by acting out some of his father's antisocial behavior, becoming that of which he most disapproves in a parent. Frank Abagnale Jr. seems to have found the mentor he would have preferred in Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the determined and ethical FBI agent who finally catches up to the fast-talking fraud.",

Nevertheless, it is an amusing film with Leonard DiCaprio as the teen-age youth who successfully passes himself off as a co-pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc., while passing phony checks that lead the FBI on a global chase.

362,2 January 2003,artzau,7, A very good picture,"Spielberg is a very eclectic director and film-maker.  I get the impression, he loves to dabble, as it were.  In any case, he is definitely a risk-taker. This film is a jewel in several ways.  Strong performances by DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken.  I'm glad to little Lennie getting out of his cutsy-tootsy, post-Titanic over-self-adorational stage.  He might eventually become an actor.  There are several moments in this film when he gives an excellent performance without resorting to his whinny, spoiled teenager persona he's shown us in previous films.  Hanks and Walken, as usual, are top pros and right on line. Walken's role is a poignant one as the unconscious enabling father, Frank Sr. and old Chris comes through in fine style.  Hanks (and, no, you reviewers willing to slam him for his ""accent;"" he's right on with the New England dialect)is superb as the low-keyed, workaholic, driven FBI agent, Hanratty.  The circumstances of Abagnale's life and adventures are incredible and I remember reading about him back in the late 60s when he was apprehended.  This story-- his story-- is more of a statement on our American culture and how our commitment to excessive materialism can make fools of us all.  All in all, this film, while like most of Steve's brain children, is a bit too long but very engaging.  It is a delightful biopic with both hilarious and sad moments.  I recommend it highly.",

It is very easy to draw comparisons to Wolf of Wall Street, and for much of the movie I was feeling very similarly about them, but the lighter turn at the end significantly changes the overall tone. Leo is fantastic as always here, and Hanks is also very good. Seeing how Leo hoodwinks people over and over is fun, and the Barry Allen scene was especially pleasant. The high point of the movie for me was Frank's coffee with his dad where he gets so excited telling him how he got all this money and the family will get back together, only to hear that his mother has moved on. That scene really drives home the fact that Frank's entire motivation was to get his family back together and get his father everything he lost, and when he sees that's impossible he is inconsolable. Unfortunately, we don't see this level of psychological insight in the rest of the movie. In opening by showing Frank in captivity, Spielberg focuses the audience on the unsustainability of Frank's cons, how it's all going to catch up to him. After the scene with his father, we have less insight into why Frank keeps going, so when he eventually turns we have even less understanding of why he does that. His relationship with Brenda was an interesting note, but why he took such an interest in her after seeing hundreds of attractive women in his Georgia mansion and nothing really standing out about Brenda was a bit puzzling. The tension that had been built up earlier in the film from seeing Frank succeed but knowing it can't last forever dissipates anticlimactically as we see him turn and help the FBI for no clear reason. Sure, he wants to get out of jail, but at that point what does he really care about? He could've escaped to Europe, but chose to come back for reasons we don't know. It's an interesting movie and a consideration of what the truth means and what the societal penalty for being different than expected, but it was more of a lighthearted movie than a deeper introspection that I was hoping for. The friendship between Frank and Carl was cute, to be sure, but also a bit forced. I really enjoyed Williams' score for the film as well. It's a good movie and a fun one throughout, but had it explained the psychology behind Frank's actions in the third act it could've been a great one.",
382,12 September 2022,makolina,1, Pretty good movie,"If it was only portrayed as fiction. The guy hoodwinked everyone into thinking he was someone and most of his claims had been disproven even before Spielberg made this movie. The fact that they still try to pass this off as as ""autobiographical"" in the credits should be edited to actually tell the truth that Abagnale was just a really bad liar with a petty criminal record who actually didn't do any of those things portrayed in the movie. Everything portrayed was a gross exaggeration of the truth with the the pilot claims to be the most true even though those were an extreme exaggeration and the lawyer claims to just be an outright lie that investigative journalists proved to be a lie. What makes this more sad is this guy was named an AARP champion against fraud when even his fraud is fraudulent. Good lord what a sorry excuse for a human being.",

384,1 January 2003,Spanner-2,7," Good film, but not as good as it could be","This period film has Leonardo DiCaprio as a real life con man who pretends to be a airpline pilot, lawyer and doctor by watching tv shows and impersonating the characters. DiCaprio was born to play this part and pulls it off quite well, with the right mix of charm and youthful exuberance. Tom Hanks as the FBI Agent on his trail is somewhat less effective but aquits himself ok. This Steven Spielberg film works fairly well, but doesnt quite connect as it should as we never really get inside the head of the protagonist to know what makes him tick, sure his adventures are fun to watch but we dont care about him as much as we should.

It explores every facet of Abagnale's life while remaining wickedly entertaining and perfectly stylish (the costume design and set decoration are incredible). DiCaprio gives another knockout performance Hanks delivers what might be my favorite performance of his. Walken and Amy Adams are also quite excellent (as is Jennifer Garner in her cameo). A really fun, enjoyable ride with a lot more under the surface than it seems to have. It's easily my favorite Spielberg and definitely one of the best of 2002. I should also mention that the score is incredible.",
400,16 April 2006,forrest44,10, Fun in sadness,"Aside from Schindler's List, Catch Me If You Can is my favourite Steven Spielberg film, in which I believe something common between us teenagers is reflected home-- fear to see our parents' divorce. Frank's life as an economic criminal began right after his parents' announcing divorce. He first did this just for living, and then the thought of reunion his family took over. Like many teenagers, Frank loves his parents so much, as can be told through the minutia that Frank wants his mother to quit smoking, but they, just like many parents, just seem to ignore this, as an only child, I can't help but feeling extremely sad about it. Each pair of parents should pay attention to this brilliant piece of work, 'cause sometimes you just have no idea about how your children love you! Frank made every effort trying to reunion his parents, but each time his father turned him down. Every crazy step Frank took was related to this purest wish, nothing seems matters when compared with it, even going to jail. His father's death made up his mind to visit his beloved mother, who was happy with her new family, Frank alone outside in Christmas, urging Carl to put him in the car not to be seen by mom, not to worry her. I just can't help laughing and crying each time I saw this movie. Steven Spielberg is amazing! He handle the delicate feeling of the many Franks and the carelessness of parents so very well and accurately. A tragic rather than a comedy. A triumph deserves recommended.",

I felt that there were too many time switches back and forth and that maybe Spielberg had ruined a perfectly good movie trying to make it a Spielberg movie. However, fifteen minutes into the movie I became totally amazed. Great acting by DiCaprio, this part is an actors dream, however he plays it very childlike, and very believably(Amazing considering Leonardo is 28 and his character at one point is 17). Tom Hanks is very good. I was thinking on the way home that maybe a ""cooler"" actor could have played Carl (Hanks character) such as George Clooney. However I realized that Carl makes too many mistakes to be ""cool"" so Hanks fits the part. Christopher Walken does a great job. My vote 9/10. A great movie to spend an afternoon at the theater. If you don't agree with me, ""Knock Knock"" (You will get that after you see the flick, and hopefully you will laugh)",

412,25 December 2002,bix171,7, Interesting But Not Fascinating,"Steven Spielberg's entertaining chase comedy/drama features a couple of very fine performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as a forger who travels the world and the FBI agent determined to haul him in. Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., it fits nicely into the Spielberg canon of films about splintered families; Abagnale's underlying motivations concern his determination to recover what the I.R.S. has taken from his tax-evading father and, in the process, repair his broken home. Though it's an interesting story, it's not an extremely fascinating one: once Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson have set up the basic scams Abagnale operates, there's a lot of repetition over the first three-quarters of the film's 140 minutes (the action could have been pared a bit in the editing room) and it refreshes only in the final section, where Hanks overtly assumes the role of surrogate father to DiCaprio's needy child. After a couple of moody, personal science fiction films in ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and ""Minority Report"", Spielberg seems intent on losing himself in a wistfully retro action story--the film takes place in the Sixties but a Kennedy-era-innocent Sixties that seems cloistered from the events we've chosen to make iconic--but he's unable to let go of his dark side (he's probably incapable of ever making an `E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' again) and the film wallows in its unhappiness. But he's energized by the engrossing lead performances that dominate everything around them: as people consumed by the actions of escaping and capturing, DiCaprio and Hanks lock into each other and the relationship they form subtlety invites the viewer into their game; Spielberg wisely allows the actors to interpret the material directly and keeps the pressure off the audience by making everything clear and digestible. With Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken, amusing and intelligent as Abagnale's father. The harsh sunlit cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the cleverly mod production design is by Jeannine Claudia Oppewall. John Williams' unassuming, jazzy score is surprisingly good, considering the source.",

Tommy Hanks is good as you'd expect and Leonardo Dicaprio puts out his first good performance, (Liked Titanic, dislike him in it). This is a slick movie about a real life conman, who pretends to be many things and endangers peoples lives doing it! Tom Hanks is the cop hunting him down. It's funny how their relationship is portrayed as well. It's quirky and i think Steven used it well. Chris Walken is Leon's dad and as usual puts out a good supporting role. Overall, another good way to spend your time and a must for a Stevie Spielberg fan 8/10",

Spielberg did an excellent job of developing the characters and the casting of DiCaprio, Walken and Hanks in their respective roles brings this true story to life. You are tempted to feel pity for the father played by Walken but you realize that he is a malcontent who finds it difficult to take responsibility for his own actions. DiCaprio is perfect as the charming young con artist and complements Hanks character as the FBI agent as the plot moves from one twist to another. The plot provides a great mix of drama, tragedy, suspense, humor and fantasy. The soundtrack provides many well-placed tunes of that era including the sexy voice of Dusty Springfield singing ""The Look of Love"" which in my opinion should have won Oscar for best song in Casino Royale but lost to ""Talk to the Animals"" in Dr. Doolittle - go figure.",

This has got to be one of Speliberg's best movies but what also makes this film special is that it has his style but all in all without any big CGI or SFX , its just pure magical entertainment which strings you along. The story follows the life of a young man known as Frank Abignal Jr who would go into history as the most audios and yet daring and youngest con men in history conning banks out millions as well posing as several other professionals. Leo DiCaprio shows once again that he is not just a pretty face and he can square of with the likes of Johnny Depp. One thing that is great about his performance is the level of innocence portrayed by him and it is very hard if not impossible to be mad at him . The film moves at a slow pace which I really didn't mind because it introduced you into his world which also mad one build bonds with the other characters which made the movie an emotional one to watch and sometimes painful for me personally through watching my parents having to struggle with their finical situation and how teen against can some times go right out of control. Tom Hanks was good as the federal agent , not his best performances but still very good but Christopher Walken was nothing short of brilliant which begs the question why has not been given an Oscar yet ? My only complaints were that it was a little too long but I was willing to let that go because DiCaprio kept my hooked and a few Hollywood moments added in which I guess kind of distract a slight bit from its inspired by true events angel. To conclude Catch me If You Can is one of Speilbergs best works as well as proving that DiCaprio is not just a pretty face but one of the talent and very respectable actors coming up , highly recommended there is something for everyone in here.",

Leonardo, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner were more concerned about what they are wearing and how they look rather than getting into depths of these wonderful characters.

440,26 November 2016,cdjh-81125,9, A Different Kind of Spielberg Film,"If I had no idea who directed this movie and I was told to guess Steven Spielberg would not been my first guess, but believe it or not that's a great thing, it shows that Spielberg is willing to change things up and try new things and this is definitely one of his better movies. This is a film that is extreme well written, entertaining and funny all in one I loved this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio was so good in this film he really sunk himself into this con man but through his performance you can tell that he isn't a bad person just a lost kid refusing to face reality which makes him a much more interesting character. Tom Hanks was also fantastic in this film not only is he really funny but he had great scenes with DiCaprio, you really got the impression that these two were each others equals and it was riveting to watch. Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances ever in this film I thought he had some really touching scenes with DiCaprio and he was a really tragic character. John Williams gives one of his best scores ever to this film, the theme is jazzy and alive and matches perfectly with the tone of the film. A lot of the entertainment value for this movie comes from seeing Abagnale change in and out of his different personas, not only does it create for a lot of laughs but it was really interesting to see how he was able to accomplish all his misdeeds. I do have a couple of flaws with this movies for one a lot of character arcs such as Amy Adams arc just do not get a real conclusion and are left dangling in the air. My other flaw may seem like a minor one or a nitpick but there were a lot of unbelievable aspects in this film namely scenes where DiCaprio makes clear and obvious mistakes and are just written of as funny scenes, which they are but I just think it took me out of the movie a bit.

He make 4 millions dollar by fake check. He is very talented. When Tom Hanks who is after him find him for the first time in a motel, he capable to fool Hanks. He is so calm in that situation.

452,19 January 2003,darrell-garrison,8, What a team!,"Steven Spielberg has brought Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio together in what could have been a small film, but becomes great entertainment in the hands of these masters!  One of my favorite things about this movie is something I didn't even notice until towards the end-- Spielberg adds his unique touches ('Spielbergian') without overwhelming the film.  His restraint and professionalism truly shine here.  Hanks is excellent as always, and DiCaprio continues to show his growth as a fine actor.  It's only a matter of time before he wins his Oscar in the right vehicle (this isn't it).  I saw 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me If You Can' within a week of each other.  I would easily pay to see this film again, but not the other (even though 'Gangs' is quite good.  And by the way, this film is much more re-watchable than Spielberg's other film this year, 'Minority Report'). This movie has a great 60's sheen to it.  I hope it gets an Oscar nomination for Best Costume!  The audience I was with enjoyed this bad-boy-on-the-run caper, rooting for him vociferously.  And what makes it so special is that it's based on a true story.  This film makes me want to read more about Abagnale.  I recently saw an interview with him, and he stated that the movie correctly captured the essence of what his life was like then; that's as high a compliment as is needed.  I had a feeling that the real Abagnale had a cameo somewhere, and I was right.  In reading the credits he shows up as a French police officer!  For the films that were released in 2002, there are only two that I can universally recommend to ANYONE.  'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', and this movie.  'Greek Wedding' would get a slightly more vigorous nod because of a bad swear word said by Hanks in this that might offend some; but it was the FUNNIEST line of the movie! This may win no Oscars, but it's GREAT entertainment! ***1/2",

The characters were all likable. The period details really great  (check out DiCaprio's Bachelor pad when he's pretending to be a doctor).  Even the John William's score works nicely for a change.

Early in the film, Frank Abagnale sees a pilot and notices that everyone around him adores and admires him, and most importantly, does not question him when he cashes a cheque. Solution: Become a pilot. All you need is lingo (which he gets by fawning over an airport official) and a uniform (which he cons his way into). ",

460,5 May 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,7, Excessive,"There appear to be two Steven Speilbergs in Cinema: Speilberg the filmaker, responsible for such films as Schindler's list and Speilberg the entertainer, responsible for films such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Sometimes, he manages to balance out both with films such as Jaws as the result. I usually enjoy his more balanced out films, they really entertain while catching your deep thoughts. However, sometimes there's a sign of a clash between the two. In 2001's A.I. Speilberg seemed to want to have a Kubrick film yet at the same time dazzle the audience with vibrant chase sequences and harrowing visual effects. The clash usually ends up in somewhat of a mess, not neccessarly bad but not really that good either. That being said, I'll move onto the review. Catch Me if You Can is definitely a clash of Speilberg. He wants to provide the viewer with a quick and stlyish movie about one of the moust astounding criminals in the world yet also provide them with a deep, rich character study. Unfortunately, the script seems to go more with the quick aspect, providing flashy dialouge such as in Frank's Father, Christopher Walk's character. What ends up happening is a rather solid film, but it could have been a bit more. Leornado Dicaprio shines as the intelligent yet somewhat misguided Frank. He conveys his emotional moments and his excited moments effortlessly, really making the viewer think he's 17. Tom Hanks provides solid work here, but he seems to be a bit over- the- top with his character. Christopher Walken offers valuable support here, perhaps showing the route of the motivations for Frank's crime spree. With a good enough cast, this movie clicks instantly and follows through... almost till the end. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line the movie trips on it's own legs and becomes quite repeating. It ends up just being one con job aftr another, trying to inspire excitment in the viewer then get emotions out of them by showing Frank's internal dilemna. The script is solid enough and Speilberg's directing a bit unfocused but still all right. That being said, it's not that Catch Me If You Can is neccessarily a bad movie, quite the contrary really. It's an interesting $9 spent, a sort of ride yet an emotional experience. Speilberg clashes indeed, but the rest of the movie sticks together well enough. 7.5/10",

Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and his character really made the movie great. He is just such a great actor, and he can add this to his list of terrific performances. I also liked Christopher Walken as the Mr. Abignale Sr. I really think he is a great guy and a really funny performer and he gave this movie a lot of side character. I know this movie will be a big hit as it should be, and I am just amazed that this movie is based on true events. To think that a teenage boy could do so much harm in such a short time.

I can report that Dicaprio did a great job and that all the reviews criticizing Tom Hanks' Boston accent were wrong. I'm not saying his accent was perfect, far from it, but Hanks needed that little something to keep the viewer from thinking ""Hey, that's Tom Hanks!"" Hanks gives an understated performance that made me think that he is a better actor than I gave him credit for. (I know, I know he has two Best Actor Oscars) His mannerisms and the accent were different enough to allow me to accept his character and suspend my disbelief. Even if the acting had been horrible, the direction, the credit sequence, the music, the cinematography and the art direction would have me recommending this film.

This is personally one of my favorite Leo performances, an opportunity not wasted to showcase his incredible range. As for Spielberg, most critics will label this film as not one of his best, but I ostensibly disagree. Can you imagine if Verbinski or Fincher directed this? The central motif would have been drowned by overzealous desires to focus on audiences' base attraction to rebellion. Spielberg's finesse and directorial impulse control were perfect for this film. He was uniquely qualified to tackle the melancholy themes in Catch Me If You Can and have them wrapped up and presented in a beautiful, lighthearted package that was just right for the Christmas season.

In Catch me if you Can he gets a brilliant ensemble cast to for fill this movie eg: TOM HANKS (AGAIN), LEONARDO DICAPRIO and many more...

That is why every film he does is 100% perfect.. As you will notice he uses Tom Hanks in most of his movies, and that my friends is a very good move, because Tom is one of the best actors around and brings passion to all of his films.

Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg attempts to breathe new box office life into the career of Leonardo DiCaprio by adding the mix of Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks.

Tom Hanks provide hilarity and a sternness to the plot as he and Leonardo provide perfect chemistry on the screen. Everything is perfectly set in it's time of the 1960s. From the airports to the clothes, the 60s are brought to life again. Steven Speilburg did a wonderful job, as well as the people who did props, clothes, and other items, bringing this picture to life. Comedy, romance, suspense, family, and the true art of bank fraud are brought forward in this remarkable film. With a shocking ending and sweet story line, this film definitely deserved more credit than it got. Watch it. You won't regret it.",

I liked it but one thing that did bother me was that they never did go back to To Tell the Truth at the end. It seemed like they sort of forgot about that. It also wasnt the best DiCaprio movie this year. Gangs of New York was by far better than it but this movie was not bad.",

501,15 June 2007,raymond-massart,7, Easily Digestible,"Entertaining indeed. Easily digestible: a feel good movie seasoned with a dash of suspense, small-scale drama and the obligatory happy ending. Nothing wrong with the previous assessment apart from the fact that ""Catch me..."" did not entirely succeed in keeping my undivided attention and that I was not really impressed due to an absence of tangible substance in the portrayal of the various characters.All the protagonists seemed to lack a form of real content and appeared to me as being very shallow human beings. Even the chemistry between Di Caprio and his father which was obviously intended by the director, was hardly convincing. In the first half of the movie Tom Hanks was portrayed too often as a bungling FBI agent which bordered on ludicrousness but luckily he was more convincing in the second half. Some scenes, such as the references to James Bond and Di Caprio's amorous encounter in a hotel room, were really superfluous not to mention the viewer's disbelief at the ingenious escapology of the Houdini-like forgerer. As stated in another review: a popcorn movie more or less, with regrettably, in my view, slightly less than more.",

A hack script, Halmark-inspired score and sloppy editing render this potentially gripping movie slightly below average even as brainless entertainment. After a promising turn towards artistry and adrenaline in Minority Report, Spielberg seems to have slid back to his comfort zone of shlocky emotionally manipulative made-for-tv crapolla. While the moral ambiguity and basic plot are nonetheless interesting, seeing the stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio (--who, despite a slight air of inappropriate cynicism seems to have finally recovered from his Titanic fame and returned to his roots as an emotionally gripping actor--) and the absolutely fascinating true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. rendered into 24 carat shlock is a truly unforgivable con-job. With a trendy wave to non-linear narrative Spielberg also guts the movie of any adrenaline value by revealing the outcome of the story in the first three minutes of film. In perhaps the greatest travesty of all, the natural humor of the story is exploited to the extent that it is about as subtle as a fart in an elevator.",

And even though it has an original plot and it's inspired by real events, the movie is still somehow not the best. It's okay, it has very good things in it but it was too long (and that's why boring at times) and even though DiCaprio is a great actor he looked too young for this specific role. I mean, it sounds pretty odd that Frank got away with all of his felonies for such a long time but it's even more unbelievable when we see Leo on the screen.

The most amazing thing about the film is that it is based on a true story. Thankfully, Christopher Walken supplies Leo with some interesting motivation for becoming ""The Great Pretender"". Earlier in his career, the knock on Spielberg was he was a director of spectacle; not an actor's director like Sydney Pollock. That just isn't the case. His abilities have matured, as has the man.

Maybe not for best picture, but maybe and acting award. Oh well I'm not in charge of the Academy Awards (and I don't think many people would want me to be). I thought that the movie was very well done. The story line was great and the acting surpurp. Tom Hanks being my favorite of all time is a huge reason (if not the only reason) I went to see the movie. But after seeing it I fell in love with the whole thing. I will say though after re-watching it the other day, that most flight attendants are that excited about going to work or their jobs (trust me, I am a flight attendant, though I like my job, you would never see me that happy about going to work). Other than that, which I have to say makes me laugh, so I guess I should even with that I thought it was a well done and great movie to see.

532,27 September 2004,Stu-42,6, Don't read if the truth offends you,"This movie was OK. It wasn't spectacular and was on the overlong side. That's really not what you would expect from a big name film with big name stars. I guess I got about what I wanted from it, but to say that it's as wonderful as what I'm reading here is just not accurate. First off, you know you're in trouble when Leonardo Di Caprio is the best actor in the movie. I'm not a fan, but he did do the best job. I like Tom Hanks, how could you not? However, his acting talents are incredibly overestimated. For the first 20 minutes I was having a hard time trying to figure out what his accent was- southern, East Coast or perhaps Australian? Weak. Next, there's the infamous Christopher Walken. Amazing how no one mentioned him in the 20 or so comments I read. Maybe they didn't want to say anything bad about someone so well liked. OK, leave it to me to do the dirty work. Once again I'll bash another extremely popular actor: Walken is a terrible actor and in this movie he actually was a little better than I've seen him- slightly less terrible. I also read that this was totally original and that the ""cat and mouse"" idea was just great. This film didn't have an original feel to me and just off the top of my head I'm coming up with 2 other chase movies that blow this one away: Heat (De Niro) and The French Connection. Sorry to have to burst everyone's ideas, but I can't lie to you. I must also do the unthinkable again; yes, I'm going to say a few words about Spielberg. He has some talent, but his movies are filled with a certain sappy quality that just doesn't ring true or have any relevance. Perfect example- that thing with the floating $ bill that someone said was a nod to Forrest Gump (a forgettable movie to be sure). I guess people like that sort of stuff, but it's just silly and overdone. Well, I think I've ranted enough. I just feel there are many other better movies to get excited about out there. For Tom Hanks fans I still say ""Big"" (1987) is his best. For Spielberg I strongly recommend his first and best effort ""Duel"" (1971). For Walken and Di Caprio fans- you don't want to hear what I recommend.",

Truth seems to sort of stifle the creative juices. Having read the actual story, I'm afraid I had trouble following the movie, at times. It starts out in a French prison, but I don't recall anyone saying why he was actually in prison in France. I thought the movie version of his becoming a doctor was a bit raw and quite abrupt. The true story involved a much more natural flow of events and would have made a neat segment. I guess they needed a certain treatment in order to make transitions from one part of the story to the next. And they did a pretty good job of stitching the whole thing together, even providing (creating?) a background of family issues to explain, in a way, how he happened to get into his chosen lifestyle.

Frank's story is very intriguing and exotic.  It is about a man that in the late 1960's that makes a living through fraud.  He writes bad checks, imitates professionals such as doctor, lawyer, and airline captain. He made millions of dollars living this way.  At this rate it will take me two or three lifetimes to make the money he made.  He lived like a god for about 4 years.  It makes me want to just try to make one big score.  This movie is an inspiration to me to do `wrong' for profit.  If only I could have one chance to make big money.  I would go for it.  Yeah right, I don't have the courage to do it.

A tight plot, socially responsible handling of an otherwise psyche-corruptible story, beautiful performances by abganale Sr. and Jr. and a tight direction by Spielberg. The movie doesn't go off track not even for a single second and ends at an appropriate point. The jock, which frustrated Tom Hanks narrates to his peers is just too much. Movie has Spielberg humor, Spielberg pace and Spielberg commitment. The scene in which Dicaprio takes off on an air plane and hanks watches the aero plane is a very difficult scene to direct but is shot so smoothly that it doesn't even attract the attention.

He warned his money from cashing fabricated cheques, posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor. As the numbers went up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty started tracking him in a cat and mouse game. Based on a true story, I think this is a good film. The plot starts from the end and jumps back to see why and how Frank Abagnale Jr. was captured by Carl Hanratty. It is the reason why the two hours goes by very quickly. The presentation is good. The opening credits impressed me and attracted me to continue watching this film. I also enjoyed watching the exciting game of cat and mouse. The cast is good as all of them acted very well. I think DiCaprio is good, he acted well and he made a lot of expressions. Hanks has also done a good work. His character is quite dull but I really thought that he did better than DiCaprio. Both of them gave a fine performance. On the whole this film is an interesting chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.

Although this story lacks violence, blood, murder, and other stereotypical understandings of this genre, this film reinforces its true crime integrity through the criteria use of narrative style, the text at the finale, the explanation for the evil, and the psychological understanding of this true, blue collar crime. All in all, this 2002 film, Catch Me If You Can, directed by Steven Spielberg cleverly captures the loopholes found in the criminal justice system, not only in the police force but the Federal Bureau of Investigation, making this film a true crime reflection as well as an explanation as to why the accessibility of actual criminal minds is necessary in these judicial forces to ensure safety and justice.

544,21 August 2014,ankitapasricha2209,8, A complete laughter and entertainment dose !!,"This movie is a remarkable work by Spielberg. It is based on the true life story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. who himself plays a minor role in the movie as a French policeman. This only adds to the fascination and awe while watching the movie. The movie depicts how Frank disguises first as an Airline Pilot, then a doctor and later as a lawyer without any professional training in any of these fields. He was able to con a huge sum of money from various government authorities all around the world through his fake degrees, qualifications, payroll cheques etc. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Frank in the film was terrific and Tom Hanks' role as an FBI agent only adds to it. Frank's character in the film makes it seem absolutely believable that a man like him can lie, deceive and con almost everyone he meets. The most interesting part is to watch Frank disguise as a school teacher in high school so effortlessly . It is also amusing to watch him get away from the Airport so easily with eight of his selected stewardesses despite the presence of over a hundred officers at the Airport.",

That why the movie-going world loves a con artist, especially if he's a young Adonis with a soft heart and a winning smile who exudes charm and cool sophistication. This sympathetically told true story shows how one teenager, skillfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio, did it with daring bravado.",
546,24 August 2014,mn310-89-267537,10, I love it,"One of the great movies. Great actors. The best thing about this movie is that it is based on a true story. It is about a kid who is good at making fake checks and earning millions of dollars by pretending to work in different jobs. The first job was that he pretended to be a sub teacher at age 17. Then his father lost his business and the family had lost their house and became broke. When that happened the parents got divorced and the kid wasn't happy about it. So he ran away and depend on himself. He became so professional at making fake checks. He once pretended to be a co-pilot at Pan American World Airways. Then he pretended to be a doctor and a lawyer. While making fake checks the FBI started to notice that the kid had stolen millions of dollars and FBI started looking for the kid. That is why the name of the movie is Catch Me If You Can. Because all this time the FBI had been trying to catch him and they funny thing is that he got caught not in the United States, he got caught in France. I recommend this movie to everyone who are a fan of Tom Hanks.",
547,7 September 2003,phylly3,9, Best movie in ages,"I give this movie top rating! It's a MUST SEE. If you didn't know that it was a true story you might think it was too far-fetched. That's what makes it so intriguing. Very good acting from Leonardo and Tom Hanks. My only complaint would be that the mother's character was a bit difficult for me to figure out. The look of the film is also just right. It stayed in my mind for days after and led me to do a bit of research on the real-life character. Apparently the movie stayed very close to the autobiography except for the father's character. His role was enlarged for the movie, perhaps to help explain Leonardo's character's motivations. Don't miss this one!",
548,14 July 2021,dinhbeo,9," Funny, thrilling and emotional","I really love the plot of this movie; and I was more surprised when I found out in the credit that it was based on a true story. Maybe this movie is not a kind of long-lasting feeling, but it's really meaningful and fascinating. I also love the acting of Tom Hanks in this movie, really impressive!",
549,18 June 2003,berkerj,10, It caught me!,"Believe it or not, Leonardo DiCaprio has acted well in the past. ""This Boy's Life"" and ""Basketball Diaries"" come to mind. He couldn't miss with this kind of material. It's one of those ""how could you not like this?"" kind of movies. Such a unique story is perfect fodder for a movie. People are gullible. How many firms really pore over college transcripts and check out all those references in depth? Charm gets you quite far in this life because as much as ability counts, an employer also wants to know, ""Am I going to be able to stand this guy for eight hours a day?""",
