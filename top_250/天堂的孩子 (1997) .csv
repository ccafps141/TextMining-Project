2,1 March 2011,Peter_Young,9, Oh those golden childhood days...,"Majid Majidi's Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a fascinating and deeply moving piece. It is a children movie which will be equally enjoyed by adults, and that's simply because it will take any adult back to their childhood days, back to the days when they did something wrong and were afraid to confess to their parents. The film was made with great simplicity and soul, and its impact is perfectly made through the characters of Ali and Zahra, two amazing kids who can set an example to anyone. Majidi brilliantly captures the world of these young golden-hearted creatures. They are smart, intelligent, innocent, respectful and caring. It's quite impressive to see how little kids pay respect to their seniors, what moral values they have, and their tender care for their parents' economic status and daily struggle is particularly moving. More than anything, it is their own sibling relationship which tugs at the heartstrings. Majidi's portrayal of the neighbourhood, the school where the kids study, and their own home, is most lifelike and authentic. Without a doubt, the script is the film's main winner, but the casting is one of the film's biggest strengths. Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi are astonishing in their roles - charming, convincing, heartbreaking and totally relatable. You really feel for these kids and really want to settle their problems so that they can move on. This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists, and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood. Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a wonderful cinematic experience, which must not be missed by anyone. Just go and grab your seat, I assure it will keep you on the edge of it for one hour and a half and will be engraved in your heart long afterwards.",e

4,26 July 2004,blue-7,10, ENCHANTING & UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE,"What a marvelous thing film can be. It can touch us and open our hearts to a culture that is both different and familiar to ours. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, a film by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a little boy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have in each other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister's newly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes their secret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them in the morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent faces of the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty, provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcome a crisis. The direction, cinematography, music are all outstanding -- but it is the children that you will fall in love with. Well worth picking up on DVD (though there are no ""Extras"" to speak of).",i
5,2 August 2014,g-bodyl,8, Very Talented Filmmaking!,"Children of Heaven, which is Iran's selection for best foreign film at the Academy Awards, is a very good movie mainly because anyone in this world can relate to the topic of family and showing love to each other no matter the living circumstances. As an Iranian film, it is definitely played safe but a film with such an universal theme and elegantly told as here should really not be missed, especially by movie-lovers.",e
6,26 April 2003,Drewboy-2,10, Beautiful!,"I just saw this film in South Korea at a church.  The film is spoken in Farsi, the subtitles were in Korean.  It didn't matter that I couldn't understand a single word, because the cinematography and the faces of the children, their parents and the other cast members did all the talking. A wonderful film that dispelled my notions of Tehran as a dark and forbidding place - actually it's quite beautiful!  We Americans have not seen Iran since 1979 and it is my hope that soon we can restore relations again.  I wouldn't mind visiting.",w
7,5 August 2007,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: Children of Heaven,"Finally I've gotten my hands on a copy of Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven (not illegally of course, but from the library's collection), and have set aside some time to viewing this much talked about masterpiece. And I couldn't agree more that the film is of great quality. I've often selected titles for my pop to view since he's retired, and have gotten a call from him during a working day that I MUST watch this film. Of course I had to clarify that Jack Neo's Homerun is an adaptation of it, given that he found some similarities in plot, but I must say, any movie is worth its salt if it can move my pops.",/
8,10 April 2000,piapia,9, A piece of neo-realism as moving as The Bicycle Thief,"Neo-realism was the school of cinema developed by the Italians just after World War II. From 1945 to approximately 1954, directors like De Sica, Rossellini and Zampa delivered  masterpieces like Open City, Paisan, To Live in Peace, Shoe Shine, The Bicycle Thief, Umberto D and Miracle in Milan. But the Italian (not the World) audiences got tired of seeing poverty and everyday problems and demanded something more sophisticated. Federico Fellini added imagination to the down-to-earth themes of Neo-realism and gave the world a new concept of cinema. Neo-realism, it was said, was proper to poor, not to wealthy cinematic industries. It this was son, Iranian Director Majid Majidi accepted the challenge, and has made Children of Heaven, the most moving and perfect piece of neo-realism that has been filmed outside of Italy.  The story is much like that of The Bicycle Thieves: it's a pair of shoes that are stolen. But Majidi has provided us with the most wonderful performances from children that the screen has ever seen. A great story, magnificent color and camera work,perfect actors both children and adult, and a firm direction that never misses an opportunity to engage and captivate the audience.  I have never seen a better motion picture from that part of the world.",r
9,9 December 2009,Tweekums,9, Made me smile from start to finish,"Until a fortnight ago I'd never seen an Iranian film and assumed any film from their would just be religious or political propaganda... perhaps there are films like that but having just watched this film and ""Offside"" it is clear that they also make fantastic character based films that are a delight to watch.",w

11,28 August 2005,planktonrules,9, seemingly dull plot but marvelous!,"When I repeatedly passed this film at the local library, I completely ignored it because it looked rather dull and I must admit I had a prejudice against Iranian films.

12,28 July 2004,MollieEternity,10, Majid Majidi is a genius,"Majid Majidi is a genius. He is a director and actor of great talent. This film presents a sweet story of a brother and sister, their bond and their unique solution to solving the problem of a pair of lost shoes. The child actors are adorable and utterly convincing and the production of the film is of such quality that you get lost in watching it. The story itself is humorous, at times, and inspiring. Though the premise may be simple, each scene is infused with such passion, beauty and emotion that the experience of viewing this film is anything but simple. To all who have yet to view the film, take note of the very last scene.",9

15,18 April 2009,Sambd1,9, Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films,"Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films. Foreign films are usually thought to appeal to only a sophisticated and cultured audience, but Children of Heaven is best suited for all audiences. Forget that this film is set in a foreign land with an unfamiliar culture. Forget that the script is written in a language that you can't understand. These elements are only a small part of the story that will whisk you away and get you lost in the simplicity of the plot. Children of Heaven follows the story of Ali and Zahra and their conquest to find a lost pair of shoes. In an attempt to hide the lost shoes from their parents, the brother and sister duo decide to share one beat up pair of sneakers. This films gives an inside view of the life of a poor Iranian family and the innocence of young children. Children of Heaven opens your eyes to culture different from your own. A culture very much stereotyped because of its common appearance in American newsstands. Children of Heaven tells a story never broadcasted in the media. It can help to show the similarities and differences between American and Iranian culture. Our similarities are more than your local news lets on. We both share a class system which separates the rich from the poor. We both share the importance of family relationships and religion. We often forget that people all over the world endure our same trials and triumphs. Children of Heaven forces its audience to examine their own lives. As Americans we wonder how children with so little can be content? We wonder what it means to live simply. This film reminds us to be thankful and not value our material possessions. It also reminds us the importance of strong family relationships. Next time you contemplate viewing a foreign film think of all the benefits. Viewing foreign films exposes you to new and different cultures, languages, music and landscapes. It can contradict stereotypes and biases conjured up by news reports. You will become more respectful to those with values and morals that differ from your own. Foreign films encourage you to explore new places and create appreciations for the benefits that your own culture has to offer you. WARNING: Children of Heaven may cause a new outlook on life. You will leave this film a little happier and more appreciative. Now don't say I didn't warn you.",6

This movie will take you to Ali & Zahra's lives, and leave you there for a while. Their dreams & fears, their very few smiles, and their recurring disappointments will flood you and sweep you off your feet.But most definitely will make you wish for their sincerity, forgiveness, and contentment. Ali & Zahra will remind you of the most important things in life; the things that are really worth racing your heart out for, and will remind you that being a winner might mean nothing at all. Brilliant piece of art!",4

The story revolves around a pair of shoes, or rather its absence; never did I imagine that a pair of shoes can sustain my interest for 90 minutes. Writer/Director Majidi tackles issues like poverty, necessity, selflessness, purity of childhood, sibling-love, perseverance and determination with such aesthetic and charm, without being melodramatic.",/

20,23 June 2001,valky,10, Every scene is breath-taking; a masterpiece in cinema,"This movie is amazing.  Every character is fully dimensional, which is a rarity and it's a smart trick to keep the audience fully involved throughout.  Majidi does this with our young protagonist and his sister, and he does this, amazingly, with those with smaller roles. His technique for making the kids speak volumes (tho they are obviously not ""trained & accomplished"" actors) is the use of their facial expressions, Parviz Malekzaade's attractive cinematography, and the musical score. What captivated me most about the film was that the story was told so well.  It's hard to find a good story teller, and it seems that we can trust Majidi with this.  The story is of a boy and his sister struggling with diffrent problems, but they become each others saviors. I can't think of ONE person who would dislike this wonderful gem.",e
21,30 January 2000,Dime,10, Beautiful movie,"Children of Heaven with a simple humor and simple actors, show us the hard life of two siblings and their family, the importance of a single pair of shoes, the concern for the economic situation of the family and the affection between the two children that it's shown when the boy removes sky and earth, so his sister can have a pair of shoes. Really beautiful and well done movie.",f
22,13 November 2018,faterson,7," A Nice (Partly Frightening) Movie, But I Don't Get All the Rave Reviews","_Children of Heaven_ is pretty shocking in its depiction of poverty in modern-day Tehran. Well, ""modern-day"": for the first few dozens of minutes in the movie, you might as well be watching a story from centuries ago. The only aspect of contemporary life visible in the frame is a small, old-fashioned TV set; and a radio transistor, like those commonly used 50 years ago, perhaps. Only later in the movie, when the father and son, riding a bicycle, visit ""downtown, modern"" Tehran, does one clearly realize that the movie is, in fact, fully taking place in the present day, although it certainly doesn't look like it to a Western viewer.",_

24,10 May 2009,atulg_nitw,10, Such movie comes once in a lifetime,"Already 91 reviews for this movie, so why am I writing one. You'll know the answer if you have watched it. Children of haven is the pinnacle of story telling. When we are bombarded with star-studded high budget sagas, there are very few movies which leave an impact like this one. And Hollywood, beware, because Asians can tell stories like no one else in the world. The movie is gripping throughout, especially the last 15 minutes. When Ali tells Zahra that he'll come third in the race to get her those sneakers, I literally had tears in my eyes. And there was no stopping them once the race began. No background music, no special effects, but you could still feel the excitement and anxiety of Ali running for the cause. At that moment I realized, they truly are the Children of Haven. Its amazing how two of the most beautiful foreign films of all times got nominated for Academy in the same year (and eventually Life is Beautiful got the reward). But I can say Children of Haven must have given it a close fight. In all, it was a complete pleasure to watch Children of Haven. Don't miss it for anything.",t

36,12 February 2007,joshuamolson-1,10, Not so common social criticism,"Before I ever set eyes on Children of Heaven I was told that it was an Iranian film that contained a clandestine layer of social criticism. While I watched I searched all over for signs that could help reveal this to me. Hidden symbolism of a corrupt and immoral power, purposeful ignorance, even Michael Moore. I could find none of these things. Now I knew it would be difficult considering that the movie was made to pass the conservative censoring that was in place to prevent such criticism from being displayed. I was beginning to think that all the talk of criticism was fabricated by imaginative literature teachers and film critics to make the movie more interesting. After reading others reviews of the movie on the Internet I found that I was not the only one who had difficulty in finding any hidden agenda in the movie. While this made me feel slightly better I knew I had to keep trying to find this movie beneath the movie. ",

Only because of the very sweet and innocent relationship between the characters. Many times they are gruff, and difficult with each other, but you can't mistake the love. Your heart just completely opens and cheers on the two main characters, and I was really crying at the end. Only because it really touched my heart. I would have liked to have seen the ending a bit different. We are given a hint as to what was to come, but I would have preferred to see it, rather than just imagine what was going to happen.",

43,16 July 2012,manendra-lodhi,10, An emotional display of humanity and optimism.,"This is one of those rare films which teach people as how to live their lives with optimism. I was amazed at the innocence of the children. The film portrays the poor life of people which definitely is not a new subject but the way it has been shown is definitely superb. Once after 20 minutes when I understood what the film would be about, I was astounded at the marvelous script. What makes this film superb is the fact that it is explores the nature of humans. All other things related to the film are simple but the characters are the fuel for the film which makes it the favorite for many. Human emotions are portrayed at their best. The acting by the cast has to be applauded. But the backbone of the film is two cute and innocent kids and a beautiful script. In my opinion the film teaches a lot of things with love as a sweetener. It conveys a lot of important messages. One important message imbibed in it is to never lose faith even when there are a lot of problems. I have always liked films which are on the path of changing the attitude of the people in the world. Because every character in the film is shown kind hearted and that is a positive wave missing these days in people. One such film was Kiki's Delivery Service, which also portrayed human struggle but also has shown that people in the world are not bad. To me, films like these are revolutionary and help in generating faith in people when everything is lost. The film is one of my favorite now.",

Language was no barrier for my students to enjoy and appreciate this movie. My students speak Spanish and the movie was in Farsi with subtitles in English. At the end they concluded that children from different cultures are all alike. Majid Majidi is an artist. With out the $$$ of Hollywood he makes movies that are far superior to all the silliness we have to see. I wish there were more movies like this one.

58,11 February 2007,bigmoecrusader,10, Ali's struggle,"The movie, Children of Heaven, in many ways could be described as a struggle from within. During the entire movie, moral dilemmas were presented and these two children had to make a choice. The author seems to represent in the two children the openness to change. This could be seen in many cases during the movie. The author portrays the two children changing and adjusting to all the different situations. This shows that the children of Iran are more open to change and more able to change then the later generations. This could also represent Modernity vs. tradition.",
59,12 February 2007,goldsbs,8, Children of Heaven,"When my college professor chose this film to show, I was a bit skeptical as to whether I would enjoy this movie. This was my first time watching an Iranian film. I was surprised to find myself feeling so many different emotions for Ali and his sister Zahra. This is the type of movie that brings happy tears in the end. This film provides you with a story of compassion and love for one another. In the Children of Heaven, a brother shows concern and guardianship for his little sister. This type of behavior towards siblings in the United States is less likely to happen. Therefore, I was surprised at how thoughtful people of Iran treat others they care for. After learning about the Middle East and their relationship with God, I was able to see the symbolisms that the director was portraying. The actors based outcomes in the movie as their belief that the will of God is more powerful than any other belief. Ali coming in first place in the race was a will of God. This might be why Zahra was not upset with him when he returned home empty handed. The director chose to capture the sense of being a child. His film angles were set low at a child's level so the audience could follow along with the kids and relate to them. In addition, the movie shows that the younger generation of Iran seems to be more in control with changes and are willing to change. The older generation of Iran seems to be set in their ways and change is not comfortable with them. This might be why you get the sense that the children are more knowledgeable and clever than their parents and elders. This film is a must see for anyone who is a sucker for tearful happy endings. If you appreciate different cultural beliefs and ideas, chances are Children of Heaven will make you smile.",
60,12 February 2007,williamtinch,10, Zahra's Shoes,"Children of Heaven is a movie that strays away from the fast paced, action packed thriller that most Americans, like me, are familiar with. The editing and framing are done in compliance with Iranian rules about propriety. Men are never shot in the same scene with women that they are not married to or have a family orientation with, but children, as it is allowed by Iranian standards, are shown in any context with each other and any other adult. The pace of the movie is significantly slowed down from the Western motion picture custom and the scenes, as well as the people, are all real. This is to say, that there are no professional actors in the majority of the movie and the scenes are that of real Iranian cities, schools, and homes; there are no sets. The literary elements of the film are dealt with at a unique angle as well. The plot is based on the folly of Ali as it relates to his sister's cherished shoes, a ratty pair of children's shoes, and the pursuit, after they have been lost, of returning those shoes to Zahra: Ali's sister. The development of the story is slow but charming, in my opinion, as the journey to the regain the shoes is drawn out over the entirety of the film but treated with specificity while using allegory to point out struggles between traditional and modern day Iran in relation to the government of Iran and its impinges on the citizens therein. The characters and conflict are uncomplicated and delightful, seeing that they are simply about common people dealing with common problems. ",
61,16 June 2007,Andy-296,8, Very good (if a bit sentimental) Iranian film,"One of the new Iranian cinema's most accessible films, this is actually a very worthy movie, if a bit on the sentimental side (while Iranian movies have a strongly humanistic bent, they usually reject maudlin sentimentalism). Directed by Kiarostami's disciple Majidi, this story tells the tale of a brother and a sister from a poor neighborhood in Tehran. Problem comes when the boy, through no fault of his own, loses her sister's shoes. Since their family is too poor to buy a new pair of shoes, they have to share their shoes in secret, trading them off in a rush every day. The boy eventually comes up with a plan to solve this problem: entering into a race that gives a pair of shoes as a prize to the third-placed runner. The climactic race is a bit on the sentimental side, but the movie is very much worthwhile watching. And it has some nice side plots, as when the brother goes with his father to a rich Tehran neighborhood to find work as gardeners.",

Western societies who take so much for granted will receive a real eye opener when they view this movie. The storyline is so straightforward and simple yet at the same time, puts you so close to the characters and makes it all so realistic that you will be completely drawn in. The performances of the two children, the brother and sister, are absolutely incredible, yet so disciplined.

The idea that a pair of shoes, simple shoes, can change a families life on levels of loss and aspiration are indelibly portrayed in this film. The children take it upon themselves to carry the burden to the extent of hiding their shared secret from parents. How this evolves through the story is nothing short of minimalist exposition with superb attention to detail. Acting is beyond anything Hollywood could imagine, story beyond what many can relate to. At the same time, the story sucks you in and takes you to a place you forgot. Memorable, heartfelt and involving ideas lost in western materialism. Watch it and feel your childhood. Certainly not a gender study, this film is about the personal perception of characters and their goals. Truly film-making at it's finer moments. Almost perfect.

When Ali takes his sister's shoes to be mended, they are mistaken for trash (which tells you as much about their condition of living) and taken away. This would be a hard sell in a western setting; it seems inconceivable that such a mundane loss could propel a family into such desperation.

This film is so simple, the conflict is so childish, the approaching is so innocent that you find yourself sharing the anguish the little characters have to deal with, even when the problem is not such a big one. If you side this with a superb photography work and with the great work of all the actors involved (How he managed to reveal such natural emotions on those kids???) what you get is a genuine piece of charming cinema, with images and emotions that will follow you long after the film has concluded.

It is a Middle Eastern film from Iran and therefore is subtitled and very different from American movies. It does move rather slow and has many scenes with little or no talking. I believe this is good because it gives you time to think about and recognize what is going on in the movie without relying on the characters to tell you. Many things in the movie are implied rather than stated outright. Very few, if any, of the actors were professionals, however the cast is brilliant. The main character, the young boy Ali, is especially convincing. The movie has heavy Islamic themes which you should be able to easily pick out if you have knowledge of the religion.

There are always arguments about showing 'what people are' and 'what people could be' in movies.  For this story there is no need to show people as they are. That would shadow the main point of the story-Love inspite of one's struggles. So far I have seen only this Iranian movie. But its wonderful. The director's view is exactly coinciding with a child's view. 'Bubbles', 'sneakers in the rain','girl looking at all shoes in the prayer', 'class room dialogue for football match between students' and 'giving the new pen gift to the sister' are typical of children. The film has much more. The 'poverty' is not stressed much. But that is also the reason for viewers enjoying the movie instead of feeling the social contrastness. As I see from a country like India I felt very closer to the Iranian people because their life style portrayed in this movie looks familiar and gave me the feeling that people are same everywhere.

Well, I guess my feelings about children being beaten, and about film-makers who present that atrocity without even a shred of condemnation, very much colored my response to this movie. I notice that IMDb has this listed as ""Comedy/Drama,"" but frankly I didn't find anything funny about it . The protagonists' family is poor in an affluent city, the father works constantly in a futile effort to make ends meet, and the mother shows no discontent at her utter subservience. These lovely bright children attend schools where conformity and obedience are the only traits rewarded, and have only each other to turn to for support and comfort. During the course of the film, every time an opportunity for progress arises, it is soon dashed, and even the State religion is not shown as offering any consolation.

I have to say that the barrage of the barrage is really heavy now. But I think this is a good father, knowing to love his wife and children. He has always used what he has done to do his fatherhood and set an example for his children. I suddenly remembered my dad. He was the most taboo in his life to owe something to others, so if I borrow someone else 's money or things at school, he always quarrels with me: ""I do n't have enough money at home? As much as you want, we are not without it, we have to borrow it. "" I also have an older brother. Because of my marriage and buying a house, my parents' savings have been taken in. In the end, my mother borrowed tens of thousands. My mother knew that my dad would not want to go, so he went with his dad on his back. After all, the paper couldn't cover the fire. My dad knew that. I quarreled my mother first. After the quarrel, I went to work. I worked overtime every day and paid off the arrears in the coming year. In fact, when borrowing money, people who borrow money know that my parents are honest people, so they are happy to help us. Family education is really important.

Majid Majidi
 Iranian film marked with lot of classics from undisputable craft and theme which organized and conducted by some power packed legends including Abbas Kirostami, Majid Majidi, Asghar Farhadi, Jafer Panahi etc. These legends just show off something simple atmosphere and outlook that engaged with commons. There themes were so close with the ongoing simple aspects of human beings. Basically they are the subjects of things and beings. Their movies will also often open us to the marvelous world of unknown (but common) that we can read in daily press and in the streets. (So far from Bunuel's view about films).
 As far as, for me Majid Majidi looks astonishing about the depiction of downtrodden concepts and ideas. He just portrayed the basic plot of low class people around the Iranian outskirts. Children of Heaven mesmerized me because of the subtle representation of low class people. It is not about anything which marks calamities and atrocities mainly associate with common people, it's just a simple opening to the world of kids or children. This movie opens up to us two siblings of age around 11 or 12, a brother and a sister. We could understand their family appearance from the initial sequence of the movie when the title cards going on. A person repairs a shoe of a small girl. When we look close and analyze we can find out the shoe gets more damaged and there is no worth to repair it. Going back to home after it gets repaired Ali (the brother) lost the shoe and their turns up the beginning of the movie.
 Majidi's class can be seen at every course of the movie. He just put the camera to a brother and sister and captured their interactions in a candid way. In the initial part, because of the afraid of his father they both convey the absence of shoe and the consequences associate with them when they do not have a shoe and everything, they just scribbled through the notebook. They can't talk anything about the topic because their father will hear this. So while they are studying they just share their dialogues through writing which is so vast in its context. The audience gets to know more about their complex stage and the problem relate with them and everything through those writings.",

The film takes place in an urban suburb of the city in Iran and is surrounded around the school and where they reside. Other scenes include a trip to the lavish and beautiful city to the rich neighborhoods. The pace of the movie is relatively slow, especially in the opening scene, but progresses at a decent and almost unnoticeable pace.

137,1 March 2022,EddyTheMartian007,4," Quickie: Below average children's movie, why is this so praised?","Extremely basic, cliched, contrived, and shallow. Message is simple and over done, the filmmaking is nothing special, the characters, plot, story, etc. Are underdeveloped. There are certainly some good moments and elements, like the race was genuinely intense, the child actors worked well, but apart from this movie being endearing, I have no idea how it could be so praised. The entire story has so many dumb and convenient moments. The family dynamic is underdeveloped, and so are all the characters. These kids seem like they're not able to communicate well, like why doesn't Ali explain the reason he's late? Im pretty sure the teachers would understand. I mean it may not work, but it could, which is the point, show it, otherwise Ali who gets good grades just seems dumb. When he cries to be in the race it definitely sends the wrong message for this kids movie. Simple words could solve so many of their issues, but they just sit there and make up extremely basic lies that nobody will believe or cry. Wow great characters! What about Ali's sister explaining the the girl that those might be her shoes? Then she might've gotten them back. I thought perhaps this was going to reflect on how the parents raised them, like the father wasn't able to communicate well either when he's to garden for the wealthy people, but nope, suddenly Ali comes to the rescue and does all the talking for him. I'm being a bit lenient considering they're children, but this just seemed like sloppy writing to me, especially considering how the storyline is haphazardly set up, going from inconvenience, to convenience, inconvenience, convenience, and so on. It's the simplest way to manipulate- I mean garner sympathy from the audience. It's also doesn't help that like the story being so choppy, it's not very well paced or edited either. Scenes just jump around, and it has one of the most sudden endings. I mean I guess it concluded, but there could've been a bit more of an aftermath. What happened to Ali playing football in the final game with his friend? This is just not a very good movie in any way, and I can't understand how anyone is praising this unless you're swept by the movie's emotions. If so then I guess it'll work for you, and it did have some pretty good emotional moments for me too but it's pretty easy to sympathize with children. When the main driving force of your movie's supposed greatness is the audience being able to sympathize with children, then I think you need make the rest of the movie stronger for those who might need more than that.",

139,16 March 2006,Shadow10262000,8, Children of Heaven Themes and Thoughts,"""There is beauty all around when there's love at home. There is joy in every sound when there's love at homeIn the cottage there is joy, hate and envy ne'er annoy Oh there's One who smiles on high, when there's love at home"" (LDS Hymn #294). When a brother and sister do not fight it brings joy to the parents. There is a sweet spirit that can be found with in the walls of that home when there is love. It does not matter if people are rich or poor, black or white, American or Iranian, what matters is the way people treat one another. Among children there is a certain loyalty to one another, especially when these children are siblings. There is nothing a brother wouldn't do to help his sister, keep her happy, and keep her safe. The portrayal of love, loyalty, and caring is wonderfully depicted in Children of Heaven. In a typical family you might expect to observe bickering, back biting, and children acting out against one another. At other times we see the total opposite of this example, a home filled with family members expressing compassion and sympathy in how they feel and act towards one another. In this fairly simple story Ali loses his sister's shoes, tries to find them and fails. He must then go home and tell his sister what has happened, and as children often do they try and hide from their parents the truth that they will be reprimanded for. After Ali tells his sister, Zahra, that he lost her shoes he pleads with her not to tell their father. There are two reasons I see for this fear, it could be because Ali fears he will be in trouble and will be punished for his carelessness, or it could be that he knows that the burden his parents have is already too great and that his family does not have the means to buy new shoes for Zahra. It is out of love rather than fear he does not tell his parents. The relationship that Ali has with his sister is more valuable than all the material things of this world. In effort to console or keep his sister quiet Ali gives her a new pencil and later a golden pen that he is awarded for doing well on a test. Ali shares his shoes with his sister until he can figure out how he will get her shoes back. This makes for some interesting action where they must quickly meet up to exchange shoes so Ali can try to make it to school on time, which he seems unable to do. He is caught a few times by a school administrator, yet even when Ali is in trouble, we see something that seems to be not so common in America anymore. A young child who is courteous and respectful to the elders he comes in contact with, always raising his hand to speak. In doing a little research on this foreign film the use of children actors in Iran is more than just showing innocence and child like love. In Iran there are rules in the film making about using adults. They cannot use a beautiful woman if she is over the age of nine she must cover her hair and womanly curves at all time and if there is a love scene with in the film they cannot touch or even kiss, unless in real life they are husband and wife. When using children they are able to still show these same ideas and are able to use the children in adult situations and give them the characteristics of adults. At the age of nine the father feels his son should be able to help support the family, and that he should be working as well, just like the father had done at his age. There is a tremendous pressure and responsibility put upon a young child, but it is only because of the love of the parents wanting to help prepare them for the rest of their life.",

The story evolves around the brother and sister Ali and Zara.A bolt of bad luck causes Ali to loose Zaara's shoes, therefore the kids come up with a plan to share the only pair of sneakers that they have. What follows is then a heart warming tale of brother and sister trying there best to cope up with the situations that crop up and in the mean time keeping there secret. The plot of the movie is quite simple but is full of beautiful moments. These moments become more beautiful because of the great acting by the lead pair of brother and sister. Both the children have done extremely good acting and this itself is a tribute to the director of this movie. This movie is like a new born child, as you go along the movie you start sharing there emotions, feeling bad for there misfortune and hoping internally that everything turns out fine with them. The movie is full of positive energy and watching this movie leaves u with a hopeful and enthusiastic state of mind and heart. One other good aspect of this movie is the way in which it showcases Iran's culture. It shows quite boldly that Iran and other Arab countries are not just about Mullahs and hardliners and the people there are no different from the rest of the world.

It pretty much hits all the stereotypes that one can imagine and it elicits prejudices against stupidity that exists in the world today. Here is a family - so poor and destitute, they need to have 3 children to share their misery with. PEOPLE! OVERPOPULATION IS RUINING THIS PLANET! The boy is irresponsible and loses the girls only pair of shoes so they switch shoes for school so they don't have to tell the father who will beat them. The girl never gets home on time, so the boy is always late for school. He finally gets kicked out for tardiness but, lo and behold, one teacher stands up for him. Hurrah for teach!!! They owe the grocer but he still gives them food. They're 5 months behind on the rent, but they still keep on living there (how does that happen in the US? I'd love to know) The mother is ill and can't go to work, but the daughter takes care of the baby. The boy wants to race and get his sister the sneakers so they will get back to normal (how long is this? And dad hasn't noticed???) The boy goes to register 5 days after the entry deadline but again, lo and behold, they let him register. He wants to come in 3rd to win the shoes, but golly darn - after tripping and falling - he comes in first! Don't worry about the fact that he has a 2 foot stride while all his competitors that lose to him have a 3 foot or great stride. BUT THE BEST PART!!!!! Dad decides to become a gardener with no skills and he takes the boy on his first day on a bicycle 10 miles away from home where to ""good"" houses are. He's too stupid to articulate himself, so the boy has to explain what they do. Then after a full day, on the way home, they have an accident because the bike they are riding has no breaks?????

Children of Heaven is a very simple story about an -insignificant- event in the -not so important- life of two Iranian children, it is literally a story conceived with a pair of shoes in the center of it! and yet it succerds in what so many Hollywood blockbusters fail, that is speaking to its audience sincerely and creating characters that we really care for.
You don't need a tragic backstory about a psychologically traumatized childhood for your character or a first class celebrity to take the role in order to make the audience feel the character, it is much more subtle than that.. And Majidi shows us how it's done! (by the way I have to give a shout out to the little children that took the leading roles in the film for their outstanding and touching performances).
Like Grave of The Fireflies, Children of Heaven is about a brother-sister relationship in an environment that is not adequate for their innocence and yet they find meaning in the most insignificant of things, and like Bicycle Thieves, the father-son relationship faces difficulties but is never broken. It is the interpersonal relationships that give these characters a reason to fight the cruel lives they face and find meaning in it.
Children of Heaven, like its two coumterparts, are examples of storytelling at its best.. They don't force anything on you, they don't rely on schmaltzy music or melodramatic special effects, they respect the viewer as not to tell them how to feel at a particular moment, and they all depict ""real"" life no make-up or sugar on the top, just the plain life we all live and see.
I should also point out for the subtle social and economical criticism that Majidi displays in his film, showing us the big differences between the classes and yet not depicting the rich as evil and selfish or the poor as the persecuted heros.
In the end we're left with an ending that's the perfect metaphor for life itself, not a happy ending nor a sad one nor anything actually, it's just there.. This type of ending might as well be of impact on the Iranian cinema as another outstanding Iranian film, A Separation, had a similar type of ending.
In conclusion, Children of Heaven is the type of films that we should all watch from time to time to remind ourselves of life as it is not as it's presented through most of the media. simple but profound are the best words to describe it.
Stay well..",
166,30 August 2019,mustafazerin,10, .,"One of the best movie for ever. Wow, what can I say? Every bit of this film is so warm! It really looked at the world from a child's perspective. Every single scene is inundated with sweetness and the innocence of children. How they share one pair of shoes was amazing...and heartbreaking. How the little sister had no confidence in her brothers shoes was shown in such a warm and effective way. The ultimate despair Ali felt when he won was also so heartbreaking. Ali and his sister are both so cute and they can really act. This film can easily move one to tears. Do watch it!",

169,7 July 2016,ananthujohnson,10, Really sad that they have not shown the happiness of children while getting the new pair of shoes.,"I was really expecting the happy faces of the children by receiving new pair of shoes at the end. But, considering the brilliance of film making by not showing the scene in the movie, I have no voice. The characters played by the children were outstanding. This is my first review on IMDb. I even thought of writing a review after seeing this movie. Don't miss this beautiful movie! I realized that happiness is what we always try to pursue but being kind and loving each other will bring happiness and it'll remain forever. Maybe in order to realize this, they have not shown the happiness of the children. The use of music was effective by using it in only some places.",

173,12 February 2007,grkracer35,6, A Perfect Relationship,Children of Heaven with director Majid Majidi is a movie with an excellent portrayal of a relationship between a brother and sister. It is easy to see the compassion and love they have for one another. The movie immediately begins with the loss of Zahra's shoes with Ali at the blame. The rest of film follows Ali and Zahra on their adventures to find the shoes and living with only one pair shoes.,
174,9 February 2007,strong_h,7, Ali and Zahra over coming obstacles and what the director did well and what didn't work,"""Children of Heaven"" is a movie that communicates many different ideas. It shows that even though you are small and don't think you have much you can make a difference. Because Ali's sister had no shoes, Ali and Zahra had to come up with a plan so that they both could go to school with one pair of shoes between them. The whole movie is built around the struggle of these children and the need for Zahra to have shoes but they make it work without the help of an adult. It's also a movie of hope, no matter what your situation looks like there will still come a light at the end of the tunnel. Ali and his family are very poor and Ali's father cannot catch a break. Ali and father go to the city and are able to make a significant amount of money. If it were not for Ali, Ali's father would have turned away and given up. This goes back to the idea of young Ali making a difference when an adult could not. Because Ali and his father made that money His father was able to but food, pay the rent and buy both Ali and Zahra shoes. Ali didn't expect to get shoes he was more concerned with his sister getting shoes but he was also rewarded. I believe there were many messages in the movie and symbolism with Muslim undertones that would not be clear if you are not familiar with that religion. Think the idea of faith in Allah to help you when you need it is one of the main ideas. Also, he may not help you when you would like him to but he will not leave you hung out to dry. I think it was good that the director used a Middle Eastern setting and cast. The movie was in the native Middle-eastern language and I think the culture was portrayed accurately. This movie was not an American film in the Middle East. This movie is an authentic Middle-Eastern movie that we Americans have the privilege off viewing. I think the director's decision to use a natural setting and culture for this movie mad it more real to the viewer.",
